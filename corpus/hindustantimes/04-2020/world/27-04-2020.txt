The pandemic could cost the global economy “tens of trillions of dollars,” he said in the interview.The foundation has contributed $250 million to help counter the coronavirus and is re-purposing units dedicated to fighting other diseases to join in the battle against the pandemic.“We’ve taken an organization that was focused on HIV and malaria and polio eradication, and almost entirely shifted it to work on this,” he told the FT.Gates also defended the World Health Organization against accusations from U.S. President Donald Trump that the body had mishandled the virus response.“WHO is clearly very, very important and should actually get extra support to perform their role during this epidemic,” Gates said. He said he doesn’t believe Trump will follow through on his threat to withdraw funding for the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-s-coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-12-months/story-nfp8plhHNyNfjBMELKsomM.html

27-04-2020||World||New York state set to start reopening from May 15 in phases||New York state, the American epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic, will begin reopening around mid-May, starting with low-risk businesses in regions with low incidence of the disease. New York city and its suburbs, which have borne the brunt of the epidemic, will remain under lockdown.“The numbers are on the decline: everything we have done is working,” New York governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters at his daily briefing Sunday. “There’s no doubt that we’ve gone at this point through the worst. And as long as we act prudently going forward, the worst should be over.”Phase One of the reopening could start on May 15, when the stay-at-home orders in the state are set to end.Cuomo told reporters Monday that he will be extending these restrictions — called the “New York on Pause” order — for parts of the state and will “unpause” them for some but urged local officials, who are raring to reopen, to be “smart” about it, and weigh their options carefully.Several US states have reopened or decided to over past few days as the spread has slowed down with a continuing drop in new cases and hospitalization — Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee. In addition to South Carolina, Georgia, Alaska and Oklahoma.But the cumulative number for all of the United States still look daunting: total infections went up by 27, 631 to 965,951 over the last 24 hours and fatalities by 1,126 to 54,877.New York state has been the worst hit with 288,045 infections thus far and 22,269 death with 17,280 in New York city alone.Officials have expressed optimism that the state may have come around and has passed the worst, even as they stress caution, urging people continuously to exercise all the necessary social-distancing guidelines, which, as the governor told reporters, has worked, slowing down the epidemic.Low-incidence area of upstate New York could begin reopening after May 15 when New “York State On Pause” are set to end. The reopening of an area or region will depend on a steady decline in new cases for 14 days there, and will apply to construction and manufacturing sectors., These areas will be closely monitored and the state could move to the next phase only if there was no resurgence in cases because of the reopening. In phase two, the resumption would be “business-by-business”.As a sign of continued improvement in the situation in the state, USNS Comfort, the naval hospital ship, that had been docked off New York city since March 30 to help it deal with a surge in cases, is returning to its bases in Norfolk, Virginia. It discharged its remaining patients Sunday, will be sailing for home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-state-set-to-start-reopening-from-may-15-in-phases/story-BCYUIZchNcJIUxJM9ZNs4L.html
27-04-2020||World||Nancy Pelosi, top House progressive give Joe Biden twin endorsements||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden renewed his party unification efforts Monday with bookend endorsements from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the leader of the House progressive caucus that sometimes battles the speaker from the left.The twin announcements from Pelosi and Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal highlight Biden’s effort to avoid a repeat of the 2016 presidential election, when tensions between establishment Democrats and the party’s progressive flank hobbled Hillary Clinton in her loss to President Donald Trump.Pelosi, a longtime friend of Biden’s, is a face of the Democratic establishment and boasts perhaps the widest network across the party’s wealthiest donors. Jayapal, who had previously backed Bernie Sanders for president, is co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose members want sweeping expansion of the federal government’s role in the economy, notably through a single-payer “Medicare for All” insurance plan that Biden and Pelosi do not favor.The two women reflected those varied approaches Monday as they explained their common conclusion that a Biden administration is the best chance for Democrats to advance a liberal agenda, even if in degrees.Pelosi, speaking in a video, said Biden offers “hope and courage, values, authenticity and integrity.” She said he’d be a “voice of reason and resilience” amid the coronavirus pandemic.The 80-year-old speaker also cited Biden’s work as President Barack Obama’s vice president during the 2010 health care overhaul and the economic recovery acts after the 2008 financial collapse.Jayapal, in her own statement, noted she has “not always agreed with Vice President Biden on matters of policy.” Yet she struck a pragmatic bottom line about the prospects of a second Trump term.“Any progress toward a better future requires defeating him this November,” Jayapal, 54, said.Further, the congresswoman echoed a claim Biden has repeated often amid his recent outreach to progressives. She framed his agenda as “the most progressive” for any Democratic nominee “in history.”In particular, the 77-year-old Biden touts his preferred health care path, a “public option” government plan to compete with private insurers but not outlaw them, as a major leap forward. He’s also moved toward the progressive flank, though not all the way to Sanders and Jayapal, with proposals to ease student loan debt and waive public college tuition for poor, working-class and many middle-class households. Sanders proposed forgiving all student loan debt and making all public college tuition-free.Pelosi’s support wasn’t unexpected now that Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee. Her backing nonetheless reinforces Biden’s contention that he is the party’s best chance to keep the House majority and regain Senate control from Republicans.As House minority leader in 2018, Pelosi spearheaded Democrats’ midterm House victories. The party won more than 40 Republican-held seats to take the majority and hand Pelosi a second turn as the first female speaker in U.S. history.Most of the party’s gains came in battleground districts anchored by suburbs and exurbs, places where the Biden campaign believes he can outpace Trump in November.Biden campaigned for many of the current House freshmen, and he often cited their victories during his primary campaign against progressive presidential rivals. He argued that Democrats succeeded in the 2018 midterms because they did not move too far to the left in historically Republican-leaning districts. Pelosi has said repeatedly that Democrats win when they recruit candidates who “fit their district.”Biden’s alliance with Pelosi, paired with his ongoing outreach to progressives, is not without political irony and risk.The former vice president has worked for decades to cultivate his image as a working-class ally born in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Pelosi, though mistrusted by the left as an establishment figure, has been a favorite target of Republicans who caricature the wealthy San Francisco Democrat as out of touch with most Americans.Republicans have doubled down with a similar strategy on Biden as he’s picked up more endorsements from progressives, including Sanders. Ultimately, those dynamics will test what is more persuasive to voters: the Republican contention that Biden’s proposals are a government expansion that threatens taxpayers or Biden’s contention that a liberal agenda is what would boost the middle class and overall economy.___Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-top-house-progressive-give-joe-biden-twin-endorsements/story-98KqwahXpRI3CuDdJBzO1H.html
27-04-2020||World||India, Kuwait resort to damage control after leak of Kuwaiti Cabinet note||Indian and Kuwaiti authorities resorted to damage control on Monday after a Cabinet note of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member state that expressed concern about the “targeting of Indian Muslims” was leaked on social media over the weekend.Kuwaiti ambassador Jasem Ibrahem al-Najam and external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava issued separate statements that highlighted strong bilateral ties and cooperation between the two countries in the fight against Covid-19.Srivastava also noted the Kuwaiti government had assured India that it doesn’t “support any interference in the internal affairs” of the country.The note in Arabic from Kuwait’s council of ministers, which was dated March 2 but was leaked on Twitter on Sunday by a well-known Kuwaiti scholar, expressed concern “about the targeting of Indian Muslims” and called on the world community and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to take steps to stop such attacks and end the bloodshed.At least two people familiar with developments confirmed the authenticity of the Kuwaiti Cabinet note.External affairs ministry spokesperson Srivastava noted the references to India by non-official social media handles in Kuwait and said: “The government of Kuwait has assured us that they are deeply committed to friendly relations with India. They also do not support any interference in the internal affairs of India.”Srivastava said India recently deployed a rapid response team at the request of Kuwait to assist that country in its fight against the Coronavirus. “During its two-week stay in Kuwait, the team rendered valuable medical assistance in testing and treatment of afflicted persons and training their personnel,” he said.He added, “It is therefore important that friendly and cooperative nature of our relations is accurately recognised and misuse of social media is not given credence.”Ambassador al-Najam said in a statement issued to Kuwait’s state-run Kuna news agency that the two countries “share many principles in their foreign policies, like respecting the UN Charter, non-interference in other countries’ affairs and respecting sovereignty of nations”.He further said Kuwait and India have a historic relationship and “always seek to develop them in [the] political and economic domains”. The two sides are cooperating and coordinating to step up the fight against Covid-19 and had been looking forward to a meeting of the bilateral joint committee in the first quarter of 2020 but this was postponed due to the pandemic, he said.India has been concerned by criticism on social media of the treatment of Indian Muslims by prominent commentators and members of royal families in some West Asian states. Over the past few days, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has reached out to his counterparts in GCC states and other Arab nations to discuss this issue and the welfare of Indian expatriates.On Monday, secretary (overseas Indian affairs) Sanjay Bhattacharyya of the external affairs ministry held a teleconference with envoys of the GCC states as a follow-up to Jaishankar’s conversations, people familiar with the development said.The GCC envoys thanked the Indian government for keeping open supply chains for food and medicines and for assisting in the evacuation of their citizens, one the people cited above said. The envoys also requested the deployment of Indian healthcare personnel in their countries to deal with the pandemic and discussed the issue of Indian nationals who want to return home, the person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-kuwait-resort-to-damage-control-after-leak-of-kuwaiti-cabinet-note/story-fJEQuzVXBWCVJ8X1Er06zH.html
27-04-2020||World||Violence increased in Afghanistan after US-Taliban deal: UN||Violence surged in Afghanistan in the weeks after the United States and the Taliban signed a deal supposed to pave the way for a peace process, a UN agency said Monday.Afghans had enjoyed a period of relative calm ahead of the February 29 accord, but the conflict resumed almost as soon as the deal was signed, and the militant group has since rejected multiple calls for a ceasefire during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.“The report tracks a disturbing increase in violence during March at a time when it was hoped that the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban would commence peace negotiations,” the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a statement accompanying the release of its quarterly report.More than 500 civilians were killed and over 700 injured during the first three months of the year, UNAMA said.While casualty numbers rose in March, UNAMA noted that the overall toll for the first quarter of 2020 was down 29 percent from a year earlier, thanks to a lull in fighting in January and February -- including a week-long partial truce -- as US and Taliban negotiators ironed out a withdrawal agreement.Under the accord, American and other foreign forces have pledged to quit Afghanistan by July 2021 provided the Taliban stick to several security guarantees and hold talks with the government. However, fighting spiked in March as the Afghan government and Taliban bickered over a number of issues, preventing negotiations between the two from opening.“To safeguard the lives of countless civilians in Afghanistan and to give the nation hope of a better future, it is imperative that violence is stopped with the establishment of a ceasefire and for peace negotiations to commence,” UNAMA chief Deborah Lyons said.The Taliban rejected the figures, claiming the report “conceals the daily crimes” committed by the government and US forces.UNAMA did, however, note that pro-government forces were responsible for more than twice as many child deaths than the insurgents were during the first quarter, mainly due to air strikes and shelling.Recent attacks have mostly been limited to rural areas and small towns. Under the framework of US-Taliban deal, the insurgents have agreed not to attack cities.The release of the UN report comes hours after the US special envoy who brokered a deal with the Taliban called for the militants to implement a humanitarian ceasefire while Afghanistan tries to tackle its worsening coronavirus crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-increased-in-afghanistan-after-us-taliban-deal-un/story-bFxfou5YB8WSqrjYJxMlHO.html
27-04-2020||World||UN report notes drop in number of Afghan civilians killed||A report by the U.N. mission in Afghanistan on Monday noted a drop in the number of civilians killed in violence in the first three months of this year, compared to the same time last year, but underscored the still heavy toll the conflict continues to inflict on the civilian population.The report said 533 people, including 152 children, died due to the fighting in the war-torn country in the first quarter of 2020, and hundreds more were wounded. That represented a 29% decrease, compared to the same period in 2019, and the lowest death toll figure for a first quarter of a year since 2012.The report came as the Kabul police said a sticky bomb attached to a vehicle detonated in the capital on Monday but caused no casualties.According to the report, the Taliban and other anti-government militant groups, such as the Islamic State group’s affiliate in Afghanistan, were responsible for the majority of the civilian casualties during the first three months – or 55%. The Taliban were responsible for as many as 39% of civilian casualties, the report said, an increase by 22% compared to the same period last year.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected the U.N. report as an attempt “to cover up daily crimes against civilians committed by U.S. and Afghan forces.”“Afghans are witnessing that most of the civilian casualties are due to indiscriminate bombings, rocket attacks on villages and towns as well as raids on civilian homes,” Mujahid said.The U.N. report said Afghan forces and their allies were responsible for 32% of all civilian casualties during the first quarter of 2020. The report also said that pro-government forces were responsible for more child casualties than the Taliban and other militants and over twice as many child deaths — mainly due to fatalities inflicted during airstrikes and indirect fire during ground operations against militants.Children and women continue to be disproportionately impacted by the violence, it said, adding that the U.N. mission documented that 152 children and 60 women died in violence from Jan. 1- March 31.The report also highlighted a disturbing increase in violence in March, when it was hoped that the Afghan government and the Taliban would start negotiations after a peace deal that was signed by the Taliban and the U.S. at the end of February.The U.N. mission in Afghanistan is especially concerned about the escalation in violence in March and increasing civilian casualties, the report said, an in particular, about the uptick in civilian casualties last month as a result of operations by Afghan forces, mainly ground engagements, indirect fire and airstrikes.The U.N. report came a day after Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan, called on the country’s feuding leaders to set their differences aside to combat the coronavirus pandemic and COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, and advance the stalled U.S. deal with the Taliban.Deborah Lyons, the U.N. chief’s special representative for Afghanistan, echoed that appeal, saying she called “on all parties to seize the opportunity” and “to focus collective efforts on fighting a common enemy, the COVID-19 pandemic.”“To safeguard the lives of countless civilians in Afghanistan and to give the nation hope of a better future, it is imperative that violence is stopped with the establishment of a cease-fire and for peace negotiations to commence,” she said.Afghanistan has reported 1,703 cases and 57 deaths from the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-report-notes-drop-in-number-of-afghan-civilians-killed/story-fj3f6mVXWiViQAvFVjaHVM.html
27-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Boris Johnson ‘refuses to risk second major outbreak’, urges patience over UK lockdown||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged his lockdown-weary nation to be patient Monday, arguing that easing social and economic restrictions too soon would create a second deadly spike of coronavirus infections.On his first day back at work in three weeks after a bout of COVID-19 that left him dangerously ill, Johnson said Britain had reached the moment of “maximum risk” in its outbreak.Speaking outside his 10 Downing St. office, Johnson said the country was reaching “the end of the first phase of this conflict” but warned that a quick end to a lockdown due to last at least until May 7 was not in sight.“I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the (health system),” said Johnson.The 55-year-old leader appeared thinner but better-rested than when he was last seen in public early this month.As of Sunday, Britain had recorded 20,732 deaths among people hospitalized with COVID-19, the fifth country in the world to surpass 20,000 deaths. Thousands more are thought to have died in nursing homes during the pandemic.Despite the death toll, Johnson’s government is under mounting pressure to set out a blueprint for easing the lockdown that has sharply curtailed business and daily life since March 23.More than 1.5 million Britons have applied for welfare benefits in the past month, and the government’s economic watchdog says the economy could shrink by 35% by June 1.In signs of lockdown fatigue, the volume of road traffic has begun to creep up, and businesses including construction sites and home-supply stores have begun to reopen after introducing social distancing measures.As other European countries begin to reopen businesses and schools, Johnson said he shared Britons’ impatience to get back to normality. But he said “we simply cannot spell out now how fast or slow or even when those changes will be made.”Johnson indicated that any loosening of the lockdown would happen in stages, as authorities “begin gradually to refine the economic and social restrictions and one by one to fire up the engines of this vast U.K. economy.”Johnson spent a week in St. Thomas’ Hospital in London earlier this month, including three nights in intensive care. When he was discharged on April 13, he thanked medical workers at the hospital for saving his life, saying his condition “could have gone either way.”During his absence, Johnson’s Conservative government has struggled to counter criticism over shortages of protective equipment for medical workers and a lack of testing for the virus. The government has promised to conduct 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April, but has yet to reach even 30,000 a day.Countering claims that the government has been secretive, Johnson promised decisions about ending the lockdown would be made “with the maximum possible transparency” and in consultation with businesses, regional authorities and opposition parties.___Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-boris-johnson-refuses-to-risk-second-major-outbreak-urges-patience-over-uk-lockdown/story-VgugbF4bAXz4ij7nd5euFM.html
27-04-2020||World||‘Kim Jong Un could very well be OK and reappear’: Experts debate on rumours||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s prolonged public absence has led to rumors of ill health and worries about how it could influence the future of what one analyst calls Northeast Asia’s “Achilles’ heel,” a reference to the North’s belligerence and unpredictable nature.But there’s a basic, unanswered question, debated by the media and government intelligence services alike: Are the rumors even true?The exact state of Kim’s health matters because it could determine the stability of the dynastic government in Pyongyang and the security of nuclear weapons that the nation has repeatedly threatened to use on its neighbors and the United States.It’s a problem that outside nations have faced for decades. Gathering intelligence on perhaps the world’s most secretive, suspicious and difficult-to-read country is incredibly difficult. And there’s probably nothing North Korea guards more closely than information on Kim’s health, which is only likely shared among a small portion of the elite, including his powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong.At the heart of the intelligence shortcomings about North Korea is its extremely closed nature. But there is also plenty of blame leveled in South Korea at efforts there.Supporters of South Korea’s current liberal government, which remains eager for inter-Korean engagement, lament the previous decade of conservative rule there, when exchanges between diplomats, government and business leaders, aid groups and others stopped under hard-line polices toward North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. This, they say, deprived spies of high-quality information sources.Conservatives, on the other hand, blame liberals for supposedly downsizing espionage operations while pursuing inter-Korean rapprochement. They say such networks have been difficult to rebuild.South Korea’s government has repeatedly played down unconfirmed media reports that Kim is in fragile health following heart surgery, saying it has detected no unusual activity in North Korea or any emergency preparation by its ruling Workers’ Party, military and Cabinet. Without specifying its information sources, South Korea’s presidential office said it believes Kim is handling state affairs normally at an unspecified site outside the capital, Pyongyang.However unfounded the fears may be, some experts say South Korea, as well as its regional neighbors and ally Washington, must begin preparing for high-level instability that could come if Kim is sidelined by health problems or even dies. That could include North Korean refugees flooding South Korea or China, or military hard-liners letting loose nuclear weapons.While those are worst-case scenarios, planning for them is crucial because nobody knows for sure what’s happening inside North Korea, said Nam Sung-wook, a North Korea expert at Seoul’s Korea University who termed the situation the “Achilles’ heel of international politics in Northeast Asia.”“Instead of just saying he’s fine ... our government should prepare for various chaotic scenarios,” said Nam, a former director of a think tank affiliated with South Korea’s main spy agency. “He could very well be OK and reappear in North Korean state media again, but considering his weight and worsening shape, the risks linked to his health will sharply increase as he gets older.” Kim is overweight, reportedly smokes heavily and has other health problems.Questions about Kim’s health have been raised since he missed the birthday celebration of his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, the country’s most important holiday.Kim, who is in his mid-30s, was last seen in public on April 11, when he presided over a meeting discussing coronavirus prevention and electing his sister as an alternate member of the political bureau of the ruling Workers’ Party. State media have since reported that he sent greetings to Syrian President Bashar Assad, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa..On Monday, the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said Kim sent a message of gratitude to workers building tourist facilities in the coastal town of Wonsan, which is where some speculate he is staying. No photos of him were published.South Korean intelligence combined with North Korean state media reports suggest that Kim could have suffered some sort of medical setback but likely not a life-threatening one, said Du Hyeogn Cha, a senior researcher at Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.But the root problem may be the shaky nature of South Korean intelligence.“Even after decades of work, South Korea has yet to build a reliable intelligence network to gather information on the North,” said Cha, an ex-intelligence secretary to former South Korean President Lee Myung-bak. “It’s clear our government has some level of information on the North, but not enough to make a confident statement about where he is and whether he’s fully healthy.”Finding out what’s happening with Kim is important because incapacity at the top could lead to a bogged-down decision-making process that could boost the hard-liners who emerged following the collapse of Kim’s second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in February last year. The Americans at that summit rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North’s nuclear capabilities.The National Intelligence Service, Seoul’s spy agency, has said it can’t confirm whether Kim had surgery. If Kim emerges alive and well in state media, supervising a weapons test or celebrating the construction of one of his many resort projects, he would join past North Korean officials who were incorrectly reported incapacitated by outside media.“Kim Il Sung shot dead” remains perhaps the most famous newspaper headline in South Korean history three decades after it caused both public panic and euphoria.The 1986 Chosun Ilbo story was initially backed by a South Korean military statement that North Korea had announced the demise of its founder over loudspeakers at the mine-strewn land border between the rival nations. But just hours after the newspaper was released, Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, appeared at Pyongyang’s airport to greet a visiting Mongolian delegation.Another big problem is that for decades South Korea never really had a strong grip on the location and health of North Korea’s top leadership, which continues to be kept tightly under wrap, according to Cheon Seong Whun, a presidential secretary during the South’s previous conservative government.“Anybody who says they know something for certain is just writing a novel,” Cheon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-could-very-well-be-ok-and-reappear-experts-debate-on-rumours/story-bX0qhrxukKivhfDu4H1x1L.html

Recent victims of the virus included doctors Jitendra Kumar Rathod, Manjeet Singh Riyat and Krishan Arora.The Boris Johnson government has set up an inquiry to probe initial data that Indian and other non-white people are disproportionately falling victim to the virus. So far, 492 people categorised as British Indian have died in England.Kallil, chair of National Health Service in Thurrock said: “We were very sad to hear of the passing of Dr Masson, he was a well respected and liked GP in Thurrock, with a significant contribution over the last 30 years in the borough caring for patients and providing support”.“Later he provided GP services in both Thurrock and Basildon. We extend our heartfelt thanks to Dr Masson for his commitment and passion and our condolences to his family for their loss.”Masson’s family said he came to the UK in 1973 after completing his medical training in India and working as a doctor in East Africa. He was recognised by patients, colleagues and peers as a dedicated, determined, positive individual who would always do his utmost to help in all endeavours.“Dr Masson was an honest, kind and generous man who was deeply respected by anyone who was privileged to cross paths with him. He was jovial, funny and kind, always wanting to make the best of any situation”, his family said in a statement.“Dr Masson was taken from us too soon and still had so much to give. He had practised medicine for over five decades and was a dedicated servant to the NHS for 47 years. He would have wanted to practice medicine for many more years to come”, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-deeply-respected-indian-origin-doctor-dies-due-to-coronavirus-in-uk/story-TV2cOg68FGhUdAo4cX9JbN.html
27-04-2020||World||China, Australia in diplomatic spat over call for international Covid probe||Chinese citizens could avoid Australian products and universities if Prime Minister Scott Morrison doesn’t stop calling for an international enquiry into the coronavirus origins, a top Chinese official has said in what is fast developing into a testy diplomatic exchange between the two countries.Australia has shot back against the threat, cautioning China against any threat of “economic coercion”.In the past week, Morrison had spoken to the leaders of the US, France and Germany to gather support for an international investigation into the Wuhan origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.Beijing didn’t take lightly to the move.Chinese ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye said in an interview to The Australian Financial Review on Sunday that the call for the probe was “dangerous”.“If the mood is going from bad to worse, people would think ‘why should we go to such a country that is not so friendly to China?’ The tourists may have second thoughts,” Cheng said, adding: “It is up to the people to decide. Maybe the ordinary people will say ‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?’”“The parents of the students would also think... whether this is the best place to send their kids,” he added. China is not only Australia’s largest export market for wine and beef, it is also the largest markets for energy exports, education and tourism – Bloomberg reports that Australia’s is the most China-reliant economy in the developed world.On Monday, Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne cautioned China against attempts at “economic coercion”.Payne said in a statement on Monday that Australia had made a “principled call” for an independent review of the Covid-19 outbreak which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late last year.“We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation,” Payne said in the statement.China had earlier called the move to ask for an independent inquest politically motivated.“Currently, with the pandemic still spreading across the world, the most pressing task is to put people’s life and health first and work together to defeat the virus,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang had said.“At such a critical juncture, it is highly irresponsible to resort to politically motivated suspicion and accusation. We advise the Australian side to put aside ideological bias and political games, focus on the welfare of the Australian people and global public health security, follow the international community’s collective will for cooperation, and contribute to the global cooperation in fighting the virus, instead of doing things to the contrary,” Geng had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-australia-in-diplomatic-spat-over-call-for-international-covid-probe/story-bf0CCxNJARMq2ruY2K5VdL.html
27-04-2020||World||Italy’s daily Covid-19 death toll lowest since mid-March||After being battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Italy on Monday recorded its lowest number of deaths in 24 hours since mid-March. The number of people who died due to the disease between Sunday and Monday is 260, the country’s health department said. Italy had the bad luck of being the first Western nation to be slammed by the outbreak, and its official total of 26,600 fatalities lags behind only the US in the global death toll. Its first homegrown case was recorded on February 21, at a time when the World Health Organisation (WHO) was still insisting the virus was “containable” and not nearly as infectious as the flu.The hardest-hit region in Europe’s hardest-hit country is Lombardy. Virologists and epidemiologists say what went wrong there will be studied for years, given how the outbreak overwhelmed a medical system considered one of Europe’s best. In neighbouring Veneto, the impact was significantly more controlled.Even after Italy registered its first homegrown case, doctors didn’t understand the unusual way Covid-19 could present itself, with some patients experiencing a rapid decline in their ability to breathe.Italy was forced to rely on home care in part because of its low ICU capacity: After years of budget cuts, Italy went into the emergency with 8.6 ICU beds per 1,00,000 people, below the average of 15.9 within the developed countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).Some 20,000 Italian medical personnel have been infected and 150 doctors have died.Two days after Italy registered its first case in the Lombardy province of Lodi, sparking a quarantine in 10 towns, another positive case was registered more than an hour’s drive away in Alzano in the province of Bergamo.By March 2, the Superior Institute of Health recommended Alzano and nearby Nembro be sealed off like the Lodi towns. But political authorities never implemented that recommendation, allowing the infection to spread for a second week until all of Lombardy was locked down March 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-s-daily-covid-19-death-toll-lowest-since-mid-march/story-LWIjKmrNvUOy4MEGDRlsBI.html
27-04-2020||World||Canada looking to gradually ease Covid-19 restrictions||Even as Canada recorded its 2,500th fatality due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the country could witness gradual easing of restrictions as some of its largest provinces now want more business to become operational as early as possible.While the number of confirmed cases in Canada has crossed 45,000 and was at 46,848 on Sunday evening, the tally for the number of deaths have climbed to 2,560.But those figures may be gradually peaking and two of the worst hit provinces, Ontario and Quebec, are now planning on releasing their plans for opening up more businesses. Other provinces like Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are also considering similar return-to -near-normalcy in some sectors. In Ontario, the country’s most populous province, the rate of growth of cases has slowed over the last fortnight. As it reported 437 new cases and 24 deaths, those figures represented the lowest numbers since April 13. Nearly 60 per cent of these cases are in the Greater Toronto Area or GTA.But any such measure will be taken in a graduated manner. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed the matter with premiers of provinces this weekend and they “acknowledged the importance of restarting the economy through a gradual and phased approach, based on the advice of public health experts,” according to a statement from the PMO. It also said that they “agreed that protecting the health and safety of all Canadians should remain the top priority while restarting the Canadian economy.”While talk has increased of resuming some economic activity which have been restricted during the crisis, the country is still grappling with measures required to make that effort viable without endangering the population. Among the measures announced is the setting up of a Covid-19 Immunity Task Force which will try and estimate “how widely the virus has spread in Canada and provide reliable estimates of potential immunity and vulnerabilities in Canadian populations.”Part of the process could be influenced by the experience of states south of the border, in the United States. As Trudeau said recently during a media briefing, “”As provinces look at their own situation and how we can move forward on beginning to reopen our economy, I know their decisions and our decisions will be informed by what is working, and what is perhaps not working as well, elsewhere the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-looking-to-gradually-easing-of-covid-19-restrictions/story-lGwZPc0xxVyPyo77c9VF4H.html

It was a first step as the government plans a gradual process of easing restrictions.“I never thought I would miss school but I really miss it,” Lucia Ibanez, 9, out for a walk with her mother told news agency Reuters. Ibanez said she had missed the streets and the park and “feeling the air on your face” during lockdown.Children have been allowed one hour of supervised outdoor activity per day between 9 am and 9 pm, staying within one kilometre of their home. Many children wearing protective masks were seen strolling the streets in Madrid.As per the relaxation allowed by the government, adults can accompany up to three children who will not be allowed to use playparks or share toys, and must adhere to social distancing guidelines, remaining at least two metres from other people.“It was totally necessary after 42 days,” said Carla Marquez, out with her daughter near Las Canteras beach in Gran Canaria. “It has been super emotional... We have to value the small things in life which apparently we didn’t before”.Spain’s health ministry, meanwhile, said that 288 more people had died after being diagnosed with Covid-19, the lowest daily rise in the death toll in the past month.That brought the total number of deaths to 23,190, while the overall number of cases rose to 2,07,634. Spain has registered the third highest number of Covid-19 deaths, after the United States and Italy.The government had declared a state of emergency on March 14 and shut down most public life and economic activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/feeling-air-on-my-face-children-in-covid-19-battered-spain-come-outside-after-6-weeks/story-VdJTA1EtSMv3my42Fva9LK.html
27-04-2020||World||Oklahoma guv asks Trump to declare Covid-19 ‘act of God’ to help oil producers||Oklahoma’s governor has called on U.S. President Donald Trump to declare the coronavirus pandemic an “act of God,” a step to help oil-producing states contend with a crude glut that caused futures prices to close below $0 last week for the first time. “Over-production of oil continues to threaten the economy,” Governor J. Kevin Stitt said in a letter to Trump that Stitt posted on Twitter late on Saturday. Declaring a “force majeure” or “act of God” would allow oil companies to halt operations without risking that land leases will be canceled for stopping production, Stitt said.Oklahoma’s energy regulator said on Wednesday that producers could close money-losing wells without losing their leases, the first victory for struggling U.S. oil companies seeking relief from states after the market crash. U.S. production reached a record-high of near 13 million barrels per day late last year, but the pandemic has cut global consumption by 20% to 30%, or up to 30 million bpd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oklahoma-guv-asks-trump-to-declare-covid-19-act-of-god-to-help-oil-producers/story-9KOmNoyFsrVghidtJPXcfJ.html
27-04-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson makes first public appearance after coronavirus absence||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday made his first public appearance since being hospitalised with coronavirus three weeks ago, saying Britain was beginning to “turn the tide” on the outbreak but rejecting growing calls to ease a nationwide lockdown.In a statement in Downing Street marking his return to work, looking thinner and with his trademark blond hair a little longer, Johnson apologised for being away “for much longer than I would have liked”.He thanked the British people for heeding a month of stay-at-home orders, which have helped stem the spread of COVID-19, although more than 20,000 people have already died from the virus.Their efforts had ensured the state-run National Health Service was not overwhelmed, “and that is how and why we are now beginning to turn the tide”, the 55-year-old said.Johnson pledged on March 19 that Britain could “turn the tide on coronavirus within 12 weeks” but only if people heeded advice to avoid social contact.But while acknowledging the concerns of many businesses and increasing numbers of MPs in his own Conservative party about the economic toll, Johnson warned that now was not the time to ease the lockdown.“I know it is tough and I want to get this economy moving as fast as I can,” the prime minister said.“But I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak, a huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS.”New normalJohnson became the most high-profile world leader to contract COVID-19 one month ago.He spent a week in hospital, including three nights in intensive care, later admitting in a video message after he was discharged that things “could have gone either way”.He returned to his Downing Street residence on Sunday night, after two weeks spent recovering at his countryside retreat of Chequers, and was due to chair the daily government coronavirus meeting on Monday.In his absence, the government has faced increasing criticism over its response to the pandemic, as the death toll in Britain climbed to among the highest in the world.Healthcare professionals still complain about a lack of protective masks and gowns, while a target to test 100,000 people a day by the end of April looks like a tough ask.Debate is also still raging about whether Britain introduced the lockdown too late, as a decision looms on whether and how the measures could be eased.People have been asked to stay at home where possible and non-essential businesses have been shut for more than a month. The rules are up for review on May 7.Some hardware stores are already beginning to reopen and several construction firms have announced a phased return to work.A senior Conservative MP, Graham Brady, on Sunday said the government must get the economy moving again, after dire predictions from the Bank of England last week of the worst recession in centuries.“If there is a question over whether something is necessary or not, I think we should err on the side of openness and trying to make sure that more people can get on with their lives and more people can get on with getting back to their jobs,” he told BBC radio.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been standing in for Johnson, said on Sunday however that social distancing measures would remain in place for some time.People would have to get used to the “new normal”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-makes-first-public-appearance-after-coronavirus-absence/story-9MXUEnF4NCccitiuLM4x2L.html
27-04-2020||World||Donald Trump’s disinfectant remark remaining in the news is bothering: White House doctor||US President Donald Trump’s remarks that disinfectants could potentially treat coronavirus patients remaining in the news after four days of them being made was “bothering”, a key member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus has said. “I think it bothers me that this is still in the news cycle, because I think we’re missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing, as American people, to continue to protect one another,” Dr Deborah Brix, member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, told CNN in an interview. Trump on Wednesday had suggested the possibility of studying injecting disinfectants into COVID-19 patients or bringing UV light “inside” their bodies to kill the deadly virus, drawing immediate flak from health experts while a leading disinfectant producer urged people not to listen to such dangerous speculation. Brix, a leading doctor specialising in HIV/AIDS immunology, said the dialogue should focus on asymptomatic cases and not on the president’s remarks. “We should be having that dialogue about this unique clotting that we’re seeing. We are the first country that really had young people to this degree. Italy and Europe is about eight years older than us, as a median age. “So, this is the first experience of this virus in an open society, where we really can understand what’s happening to every different age group. These are the things that we should be talking about and focusing on,” Brix said. “As a scientist and a public health official and a researcher, sometimes, I worry that we don’t get the information to the American people that they need, when we continue to bring up something that was from Thursday night,” she said. Responding to a question, Brix said Trump made it clear that physicians must study his idea. “I think I have made it clear that this was a musing. But I want us to move on to be able to get information to the American people that can help them protect each other and also help them understand how devastating this virus is to different age groups and different symptoms and different comorbidities,” she said. Dr Brix said that she is “always concerned” when asked about a potential surge in new cases and deaths after many states have started taking actions to open up their economy. “I’m always concerned. And that’s why we put out key, key gating criteria. And that gating criteria was not only looking at the epidemic. It was looking at the health care workers and making sure that the health care workers were protected. And it was also looking at capacity within the hospitals,” she said. Noting that over the last few weeks there is a better understand how much asymptomatic cases and asymptomatic spread may be out there, Dr Brix underscored the need for sentinel surveillance, monitoring proactively in long-term care facilities, in inner-city clinics that have multi-generational households, in prisons, among Native Americans, to really ensure to find the virus before people even get symptoms. “And that’s a key part of this also that, sometimes, I think is missing when we’re talking about diagnosis and contact tracing. We also have to diagnose the virus before it is evident in communities,” she said. The coronavirus, which originated in China’s Wuhan city, has claimed over 2,00,000 lives and infected nearly 3 million people in the world so far. There are nearly a million confirmed coronavirus cases with over 54,000 deaths in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-disinfectant-remark-remaining-in-the-news-is-bothering-white-house-doctor/story-DLxywru7XijgazX4NzAwLM.html
27-04-2020||World||Funding and access can avert starvation due to Covid-19 crisis, says UN food programme head||The head of the World Food Program says he has been on the phone with leaders of some of the world’s richest nations with a critical message: the coronavirus pandemic is not only affecting your economy but is impacting the economies of vulnerable and conflict-torn countries where millions of people will face starvation if you cut the U.N. agency’s funding for food.David Beasley said in an interview with The Associated Press he has also been telling leaders that maintaining supply chains is critical and there are many potential obstacles — export restrictions, closed borders and ports, farms not producing and roads closed.“If we have money and access we can avert famine and we can truly avert catastrophic humanitarian death from starvation,” Beasley said. “But if we lose our funding, or we lose supply chain, there’s going to be disaster.”Beasley warned the U.N. Security Council last week that as the world deals with the COVID-19 pandemic it is “on the brink of a hunger pandemic” that could lead to “multiple famines of biblical proportions” within a few months if immediate action isn’t taken.He said 821 million people go to bed hungry every night all over the world now, a further 135 million people are facing “crisis levels of hunger or worse,” and a new World Food Program analysis shows that as a result of COVID-19 an additional 130 million people “could be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020.”WFP is providing food to nearly 100 million people on any given day, including “about 30 million people who literally depend on us to stay alive,” Beasley said. And if those 30 million people can’t be reached, “our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three-month period” — and that doesn’t include increased starvation due to the new coronavirus.“In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries,” and in 10 of them there are already more than 1 million people per country on the verge of starvation. According to WFP, the 10 countries with the worst food crises in 2019 were Yemen, Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Syria, Sudan, Nigeria and Haiti.In the interview following up on the Security Council briefing, Beasley said support for WFP comes from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the European Union, Japan and other prosperous nations.“If their economies deteriorate substantially, that impacts our money, it impacts the local economies in the developing nations in a variety of different ways,” he said.He cited the examples of South Sudan, which has faced years of conflict and is 98 percent dependent on revenue from oil whose price has plummeted as a result of COVID-19 and where WFP feeds about 6 million people, Nigeria where 90 percent of the economy is oil, and Ethiopia which has been struggling to feed its poor and where 50 percent of the economy is from tourism that has vanished since the pandemic.Beasley stressed that “We can’t say it’s hunger vs. COVID.”“We’ve got to work this together and look at the whole picture, keep the supply chain going, and minimize the economic impact so that we can make certain that people don’t starve to death,” he said. “So it’s going to be a very delicate balancing act for leaders, and I think they’re learning.”The WFP executive director said he is asking donor nations to accelerate the $1.9 billion in funding they’ve already pledged in order to preposition food to protect against the effects of supply chain disruptions, commodity shortages, economic damage and lockdowns.WFP is also seeking a further $350 million to set up a network of bigger logistics hubs, distribution points and transport systems to minimize the risk of supply chain breakdowns, he said.“And if we can do that it will save us money, and it will save us time, and it truly will end up saving lives,” he said.But Beasley said he’s very concerned some of that money will disappear.“That’s why I’ve been on the phone Skyping, Zooming, literally hours and hours and hours per day, and I have gotten nothing but extremely positive response from the leaders of major donor countries,” he said.He said, however, that if leaders are told, for example, that their country will see a 25 percent reduction in revenue for the rest of the year, “you know that all bets are off at that point in time.”Beasley, a former governor of South Carolina who has recovered from COVID-19, has spent the past week in Washington speaking to senior figures in the Trump administration, WFP’s largest donor.Beasley said he has also been warning leaders that economic deterioration, lack of money and a breakdown in the supply chains will lead to “destabilization and chaos in many countries around the world, which will result in significant financial implications for all regions of the world.”Beasley said he’s also been stressing to leaders that they can’t take a short-term perspective.He said “it’s going to be worse” in Africa because in very fragile areas people’s immune systems “are already troubled,” and children have poor nutrition and aren’t getting lunches with schools closed.“What you see in Africa right now is nothing, nothing, compared to what you’re going to see, just like what you were looking at in the United States or the UK just six weeks ago,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/funding-and-access-can-avert-starvation-due-to-covid-19-crisis-says-un-food-programme-head/story-dCUXn9OOpGR3rPZmsMDkIK.html
27-04-2020||World||Avocados are in, pork bellies out in the era of Covid-19 pandemic eating||There is no trend, exactly, other than this: People want comfort. They also want to eat their way to stronger immune systems. They’re stress baking, but they’re also eating healthier than they would have at restaurants. Avocados are in. Pork belly out. Frozen pizzas and instant noodles are selling out.And these seemingly conflicting and converging buying patterns are upending agricultural markets, sending prices for avocados surging 60% from early March, while butter is tumbling because of the loss of restaurant demand.Any way you cut it, the coronavirus has “completely changed everything,” said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor and senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.“People are more concerned about putting food on the table than anything else,” he said. “That really changes the mindset of a consumer.”Some of these trends could be here to stay, experts say. Now that some people have gone back to packaged foods, they may be surprised to see the quality improvements for these products and keep buying them even in the post-quarantine world. Cooking more at home might also continue well after the lockdowns end.‘Health Halo’Avocados are one of the foods that have seen a surprising price surge in the last few weeks. When lockdown measures first went into effect, farmers in Mexico, the world’s top producer, started slowing harvest activities, anticipating a demand drop-off.But it turns out avocado toast and guacamole are proving to be stay-at-home favorites. Demand has been much higher than the growers were expecting, and that’s sent prices surging. A box of Hass avocados from the state of Michoacan, Mexico’s biggest producer, cost about 480 pesos ($19) on April 24, according to the government. That’s up about 60% from 300 in early March.Other produce items have been flying off grocery shelves. U.S. retail sales of citrus were a standout, gaining about 50% from year-earlier levels in March, according to data from researcher IRI.“There is a general health-halo over all fresh produce items,” said Roland Fumasi, analyst for RaboResearch, in Fresno California.It might be the vitamin C content in citrus that prompted the buying as consumers look to boost their immune systems. Orange juice, once a breakfast staple that had fallen out of favor because of its high sugar content, also got a boost. Futures traded in New York are up about 13% since the end of February.In Asia, consumers are turning to traditional remedies to safeguard themselves from the virus, according to Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. In Vietnam, people are eating more black garlic and Indonesians are stocking up on jamu, a traditional medicine made from natural ingredients.Comfort FoodsFor a lot of people, eating has become an escape from boredom and stress these days. Consumers are picking up items at the grocery store they had been shunning just a few months ago -- packaged foods in particular have been given new life.“Traditionally, food has a comforting role,” Tan of Mintel said.Nestle SA, the world’s largest food and beverage company, is seeing very strong demand for essential food and drink items, Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said earlier this month. The company makes DiGiorno frozen pizzas and Maggi instant noodles.Conagra Brands Inc., which includes Duncan Hines, Chef Boyardee and Birds Eye in its portfolio, is seeing a lift across all the categories, Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said late last month.“It moved in waves, but everything is moving,” he said.Snack consumption is also going up. That’s partly because people are stuck at home, but also because they’re spending more time doing activities that lend to munching, like binge-watching “Tiger King” on Netflix.The case of South Korea is instructive for other markets, according to researcher Euromonitor International Ltd. Snack sales at a popular convenience store in the country were up 9% from a year earlier in the first part of March.Restaurant LossesEven with the huge spike for grocery store buying, the blow from the closure of restaurants is just too big to overcome in some markets. That’s why there’s been things like milk dumping. Farmers are being forced to dispose of excess supplies because demand from cheese and butter makers has dried up.Price moves illuminate that pain. Butter futures in Chicago have tumbled to the lowest in a decade, and cheese has also crashed.Belgium’s storied pomme frite purveyors are another victim. The country is the world’s top shipper of frozen potato products, hawking fries, crisps and mash to more than 160 countries, said Romain Cools, secretary general of industry group Belgapom. The vast majority is exported and demand dried up as the food-service industry grinds to a halt. European processing-potato futures are down almost 90% this year, trading at an all-time low.Even if restaurants are still doing take-away orders, many have reduced their menu offerings while home cooks in general are not using as many ingredients as they might eat at a sit-down meal.But consumers will also be pleased to see that $20 goes a lot more at the grocery store than it does at a fine-dining or quick-serve restaurant, said Nicholas Fereday, a consumer goods senior analyst at RaboResearch in New York. And the revival of packaged foods might have some longer-term impacts on buying habits.“There’s a simplification going on,” Fereday said. Packaged foods are “certainly more available because there’s more output, and people will remember that. When there was nothing left to eat, these companies delivered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avocados-are-in-pork-bellies-out-in-the-era-of-covid-19-pandemic-eating/story-jLBATOzvhxQF7WwnSlyZHI.html
27-04-2020||World||Over 54,000 Covid-19 deaths in hardest-hit US, number of cases near a million||The United States recorded 1,330 more Covid-19 related deaths in the past 24 hours, according to figures reported late on Sunday by the Johns Hopkins University.The country now has an overall death toll of 54,841, with 9,64,937 confirmed infections, according to a tally by the Baltimore-based institution at 8:30 pm on Sunday.The United States is by far the hardest-hit country in the global pandemic, in terms of both confirmed infections and deaths.The 24-hour US death toll was 2,494 late on Saturday, and 1,258 on Friday evening - the lowest in nearly three weeks - as the government struggles to quell the virus.The US government notified lenders on Sunday that it will cap how much each bank can lend under the emergency loan programme designed to keep workers on payrolls amid the coronavirus pandemic, hours ahead of the reopening of the lending programme.US banks were girding over the weekend for another frantic race to grab $310 billion in fresh small-business aid due to be released by the government.Despite technical and paperwork challenges, the programme’s first round of funds was exhausted in less than two weeks and lenders expect the second tranche of cash to be snapped up even faster by tens of thousands of applications queued up.That has left thousands of small businesses that have been forced to shut down in order to stem the disease outbreak, without badly needed funds to keep them afloat.The shuttering of the US economy due to the coronavirus pandemic is a shock of historic proportions that will likely push the national unemployment rate to 16 per cent or higher this month and require more stimulus to ensure a strong rebound, a White House economic adviser said on Sunday.“This is the biggest negative shock that our economy, I think, has ever seen. We’re going to be looking at an unemployment rate that approaches rates that we saw during the ‘Great Depression’ of the 1930s,” President Donald Trump’s adviser, Kevin Hassett, said at an ABC programme.A record 26.5 million Americans have filed for jobless benefits since mid-March, and retail sales, homebuilding and consumer confidence have all cratered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-54-000-covid-19-deaths-in-hardest-hit-us-number-of-cases-near-a-million/story-7yyz2FRmu0VfN6SMCVwE1L.html
27-04-2020||World||All because of them: Pakistani cleric blames lies, deceit for Covid-19||A well-known cleric in Pakistan has said the coronavirus pandemic has been unleashed on humanity because of lies, deceit and dishonesty of people among other things during a telethon to raise funds for for victims of the respiratory disease.According to news agency ANI, Maulana Tariq Jameel made the comments during the Ehsaas Telethon fundraising event on Thursday, during which Prime Minister Imran Khan was also present.The religious leader spoke for nearly an hour and said the goal was not to fight against the coronavirus pandemic but to be humble in front of God. He went on to blame the pandemic on the prevalence of lying, dishonesty and betrayals in society, lack of honour and people accumulating wealth through fraudulent means. Also Watch | ‘Pakistan planning to export COVID-19 patients to J&K’: DGP Dilbag SinghJameel had also condemned the media for what he said was disseminating lies. “The prime minister is here, anchors are sitting here... Do we consider how we are going to face the day of judgement due to our deceitfulness?” he asked.“The owner of a very big channel asked me for some advise; I told him to abolish all lies from his channel. The owner replied that the channel would be close but lies would not end... This is not just here, but media the world over is the same,” he said.He later apologised for that remarks, saying it was a slip of tongue.“Who has torn honour to pieces in my country? Who makes my country’s daughters dance? Who is asking them to wear skimpier clothes? Whom should I hold accountable for this sin?” he said.“I seek forgiveness from Allah that I could not make my community understand. When a Muslim’s daughter choose the path of indecency and the youth choose vulgarity… The biggest curse of God was on the people of Lut as they crossed all boundaries of indecency and were cursed five times,” he said. The Human Right Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has pulled up the cleric for his statement against women. “HRCP is appalled at Maulana Tariq Jamil’s recent statement inexplicably correlating women’s ‘modesty’ to the Covid19 pandemic. Such blatant objectification is unacceptable and, when aired on public television, only compounds the misogyny entrenched in society,” the commission tweeted.The country widely-read newspaper Dawn wrote in an editorial that statements like this are troubling, adding they are also aired, unchallenged, from a very high-profile platform.  Dawn said that it is a “shame” that the cleric was not corrected when he made these offensive comments. Cases of domestic abuse cases have soared during the coronavirus pandemic as women are forced to stay home for extended periods with their tormentors.Pakistan has reported 11,940 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), including 253 deaths across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-because-of-them-pakistani-cleric-blames-women-for-covid-19/story-pAGSvpSTNg9rZTc6JKSqHK.html
27-04-2020||World||Saudi Arabia ends death penalty for minors and floggings||Saudi Arabia’s King Salman has ordered an end to the death penalty for crimes committed by minors, according to a statement Sunday by a top official.The decision comes on the heels of another ordering judges to end the practice of flogging, replacing it with jail time, fines or community service and bringing one of the kingdom’s most controversial forms of public punishment to a close.King Salman’s son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is seen as the force behind the kingdom’s loosening of restrictions and its pivot away from ultraconservative interpretations of Islamic law known as Wahhabism, which many in the country still closely adhere to.The crown prince has sought to modernize the country, attract foreign investment and revamp Saudi Arabia’s reputation globally. He’s also overseen a parallel crackdown on liberals, women’s rights activists, writers, moderate clerics and reformers. The 2018 killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey by agents who worked for the crown prince drew sharp criticism internationally.The latest royal decree by King Salman could spare the death penalty for at least six men from the country’s minority Shiite community who allegedly committed crimes while under the age of 18, including Ali al-Nimr, who had participated in anti-government protests. Such activity carries terrorism-related charges in the kingdom for disturbing order and disobeying the ruler.In a document seen by The Associated Press, the royal decree orders prosecutors to review cases and drop punishments for those who’ve already served the maximum 10 years.However, the decree states that terrorism-related cases of minors will be tried differently. It was not immediately clear whether these cases would be bound by the 10-year prison limit.Last year, Saudi Arabia executed a young man convicted of crimes that took place when he was 16 years old. Amnesty International said Abdulkareem al-Hawaj was found guilty of offences related to his participation in protests in Shiite-populated areas of Saudi Arabia.Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have long called on the kingdom to abolish the use of the death penalty, particularly for crimes committed by minors.The president of the Saudi government’s Human Rights Commission, Awwad Alawwad, confirmed the latest decision in a statement Sunday, saying it helps the kingdom establish “a more modern penal code and demonstrates the kingdom’s commitment to following through on key reforms.”He said “more reforms will be coming,” and that the two decisions “reflect how Saudi Arabia is forging ahead in its realization of critical human rights reforms even amid the hardship imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.”The decree expands on a previous order by King Salman issued in late 2018, which set a maximum 10-year prison term for minors in certain cases, except for crimes punishable by death. Now the 10-year maximum applies to all crimes by minors, with the possible exception of terrorism-related crimes.“This step, if true, needs to nullify current death sentences of all children,” Ali al-Ahmed, a Saudi rights activist in Washington, said.Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court recently issued a directive to end flogging as a form of punishment sometime in April, according to another document seen by The Associated Press.The public spectacle of whipping a handcuffed prisoner for often non-violent crimes had drawn some comparisons to the types of punishment carried out by extremist groups like the Islamic State. Saudi authorities had argued it was a form of deterrence against potential criminals. Rights groups criticized the practice as inhumane.The Supreme Court document said the decision was in line with the kingdom’s reforms and developments in the realm of human rights as directed by King Salman and overseen by the crown prince.Five years ago, prominent Saudi blogger Raif Badawi was given 50 lashes before hundreds of spectators in the metropolitan city of Jiddah. It drew outrage and condemnation from around the world, including from many of Saudi Arabia’s Western allies. Badawi’s feet and hands were shackled during the flogging but his face was visible.Badawi is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence and was ordered to pay more than $266,000 in fines on charges related to his criticism of Saudi Arabia’s powerful clerics on the liberal blog he founded.While some crimes, such as murder, may carry fixed punishments under Saudi Arabia’s interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, many other offenses are considered “tazir,” meaning neither the crime nor the punishment is defined in Islam.Discretionary judgments for “tazir” crimes, such as flogging, have led to arbitrary rulings with contentious outcomes. Muslim countries generally do not practice public flogging.“This is a good step but we are still waiting to see if existing lashing sentences will be reversed and expunged,” al-Ahmed said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-ends-death-penalty-for-minors-and-floggings/story-pAjBbWIxUQ6CE13iL0qTjN.html
27-04-2020||World||US records 1,330 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours: Report||The United States recorded 1,330 more novel coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, according to figures reported late Sunday by the Johns Hopkins University.The country now has an overall death toll of 54,841, with 964,937 confirmed infections, according to a tally by the Baltimore-based institution at 8:30 pm (0030 GMT Monday).The United States is by far the hardest-hit country in the global pandemic, in terms of both confirmed infections and deaths.The 24-hour US death toll was 2,494 late Saturday, and 1,258 on Friday evening -- the lowest in nearly three weeks -- as the government struggles to quell the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-1-330-coronavirus-deaths-in-24-hours-report/story-bL2CBYe8DQWrkHOOAI5x5M.html
27-04-2020||World||Italy PM announces plan to ease coronavirus lockdown||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Sunday (local time) that the manufacturing, construction and wholesale sectors will be able to go back to work beginning on May 4.They will be followed by retailers, museums, galleries and libraries on May 18 and bars, restaurants, hairdressers and beauty salons on June 1.Also starting from May 4, people will be allowed to visit their relatives as long as they wear masks, while parks and public gardens will reopen and people will be able to go jogging or bike riding further than 200 metres from their homes, Conte said in a nationally televised speech.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Prime Minister made the remarks ahead of the end of the national lockdown on May 3, which is to be followed by what he called Phase Two.Funerals will be allowed but with a maximum of 15 participants as long as social distancing requirements are fulfilled. All businesses will have to follow rigorous workplace safety protocols.Conte said that the government has fixed the price of surgical masks at 50 euro cents each to prevent speculation and promised “massive support” measures for businesses and the tourism sector in order to reopen the economy during Phase Two.“If you love Italy, maintain your inter-personal safety distance to keep the new coronavirus pandemic at bay. We are about to embark on the phase of living with the virus. We must be aware that the curve of the contagion could go back up in some parts of the country,” he added.“The risk is there and we must take it on, methodically and rigorously. This is why during Phase Two, it will be even more important to maintain the inter-personal safety distance of at least one metre,” the Prime Minister further said.“If we do not respect the distance, the curve will go back up and it could go out of control. Our deaths will increase and at that point, the damage to our economy could become irreversible. Our objective is not to have more people on welfare but more people with jobs,” Conte said.According to Sputnik, Italy has recorded 260 coronavirus-related deaths over the past 24 hours, which is the lowest number of daily deaths registered since March 14, the country’s civil protection department said in a statement on Sunday. The death toll stood at 26,644.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-pm-announces-plan-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdown/story-L9qDctWxCe3UMez0asI8oL.html
27-04-2020||World||Amid coronavirus crisis, world’s biggest wheat supply from Russia dries up||For the first time in a decade, the world risks being cut off from Russian wheat at a time when some key buyers are rushing to import it.The top shipper last month limited sales through June to protect its own supply as the coronavirus crisis sparks food-security concerns around the world. Although the curbs were seen loose enough to ensure normal trade flows for this time of year, Russia has already burned through the entire quota. It will halt grain shipments to all but four former Soviet neighbors once the last cargo booked under the limits leaves the country.While the ban will only last until farmers start harvesting in July, some other nearby nations have also restricted grain exports, threatening to reroute global trade and fueling worries about food shortages and higher prices. Countries from Egypt to Turkey are trying to load up on imports while they still can, and Russian shippers have been feeding that demand.There has been “a flurry of activity” recently, said Andrey Sizov Jr., managing director at consultant SovEcon in Moscow. “Buyers want to stock up because they realize they may not have the chance to do it later.”The window has closed fast. In just a few weeks, shippers booked out all of the 7 million-ton quota set through June. As well as strong demand from importers, a weak ruble is keeping Russian grain attractive. Also, sales from government stockpiles -- another measure intended to safeguard domestic supplies -- have helped contain local prices and keep exports competitive.The Agriculture Ministry on Sunday didn’t specify when the last cargo booked under the quota could leave.One reason the limit was reached so quickly was because shippers rushed to get customs paperwork for future cargoes, according to Dmitry Rylko, director general at the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies. That means about 3 million tons could still be exported in the next two months, Reuters reported him as saying.Russia has a history of disrupting the wheat market through restrictions or taxes, but last imposed an outright ban in 2010 after drought destroyed crops. The move caused wheat futures to rally and some researchers saw it as as an indirect contributor to the Arab Spring uprisings.While there’s still ample global supplies, the memories of past food shortages have restarted the debate about food nationalism. Organizations such as the United Nations and European Union said the risk of social and political unrest is rising again as the pandemic spurs discontent, and urged against unjustified measures that could hurt food security and raise prices.Trade ShiftBanning Russian exports could benefit rival suppliers such as the EU and the U.S., said Amy Reynolds, a senior economist at the International Grains Council in London. Crops office FranceAgriMer this month raised its outlook for French wheat exports outside the bloc to a record for the season that ends in June.Egypt is one country that may purchase more from the EU. The top wheat buyer is taking an unusual step of importing a large amount of wheat during its own harvest to ensure it has enough to feed its population, many of whom live in poverty. The North African nation is heavily reliant on Black Sea grain, but has already boosted French purchases this season due to more competitive prices.The increased demand is drawing down European inventories at a time when dryness is threatening crops across the region. If conditions in the Black Sea deteriorate further, that could prompt buyers around the world to stock up on supplies even more in the coming weeks, SovEcon said.“The probability of that scenario is growing, given the current weather,” SovEcon’s Sizov said. “Among the major exporters, the U.S. has some of the biggest inventories, and that may help their sales.”Still, forecasting trade flows remains difficult due to the uncertainty over how the health crisis will play out. Plus, the collapse in the energy market will likely take its toll on the economies of wheat importers like Algeria and Nigeria, which derive large amounts of income from oil.“The demand profile is uncertain and clouded further by events in the crude oil sector, with some of the key buyers potentially affected by falling oil revenues,” the IGC’s Reynolds said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-coronavirus-crisis-world-s-biggest-wheat-supply-from-russia-dries-up/story-7DT8yYgkhdelSRVVosSZ3M.html
27-04-2020||World||Covid-19 Update: Spain lets children play, US states move at various speeds||Spain let children go outside and play Sunday for the first time in six weeks as European countries methodically worked to ease their lockdowns and reopen their economies, while governors in the United States moved at differing speeds, some more aggressive, others more cautious.Elsewhere around the world, China’s state-run media said that hospitals in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the disaster, no longer have any COVID-19 patients, after a crisis in which the city recorded nearly 3,900 deaths. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson planned to be back at his desk Monday at 10 Downing St. after a bout with the coronavirus that put him in intensive care.While governors in states like hard-hit New York and Michigan are keeping stay-at-home restrictions in place until at least mid-May, their counterparts in places such as Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska are allowing certain businesses to reopen. And churches in Montana began holding in-person services again Sunday.Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, said each state is different. Still, she told NBC, social-distancing recommendations would “be with us through the summer to really ensure that we protect one another as we move through these phases.”The official death toll from the virus topped 205,000 worldwide, with over 2.9 million reported infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, though the real figures are believed to be much higher, in part because of inadequate testing and differences in counting the dead.Italy, Britain, Spain and France accounted for more than 20,000 deaths each, the U.S. for about 55,000.Some encouraging signs were seen, as Italy recorded its lowest 24-hour number of deaths since mid-March, with 260, and New York state registered its fewest since late last month, with 367.Seven weeks into Italy’s strict lockdown, Premier Giuseppe Conte laid out a long-awaited timetable for getting back to normal, announcing that factories, construction sites and wholesale supply businesses can resume activity as soon as they put safety measures in place against the virus.Conte also said that starting May 4, parks and gardens will reopen, funerals will be allowed, athletes can resume training, and people will be able to visit relatives living in the same region. If all goes well, stores and museums will open May 18, and restaurants, cafes and salons on June 1, he said.But he warned that if people don’t wear masks and obey other social-distancing rules, “the curve of contagion can rise again, it will go out of control, deaths will climb and we’ll have irreparable damage” to the economy. After Italian bishops complained that these latest rules didn’t allow for public Masses, Conte’s office said a plan for such worship would be released.In Spain, where the crisis is also easing, the streets echoed again with children’s shrieks of joy and the clatter of bicycles after youngsters under 14 were allowed out of their homes with one parent for up to an hour of play.“This is wonderful! I can’t believe it has been six weeks,” Susana Sabaté, a mother of 3-year-old twin boys, said in Barcelona. “Today when they saw the front door and we gave them their scooters, they were thrilled.”Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will present a detailed plan Tuesday for the “de-escalation” of Spain’s lockdown but said it would be cautious. His French counterpart will as well on the same day.In the U.S., where President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed to reopen the country for business and a split has opened among the states along often partisan lines. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, told “Fox News Sunday” that with hospitalizations dropping in his state, he will reopen churches and restaurant dining on Friday, with social-distancing guidelines in place.“We believe it’s the time to have a measured reopening,” he said.But Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, told ABC that her state is not ready and needs more robust testing, community tracing and a plan for isolating people who get sick.“We’ve got to be nimble and we have to follow the science and be really smart about how we reengage,” she said, “because no one — no one, even if you’re a protester or you’re the sitting governor or you’re on another side of the issue — we know that no one wants a second wave.”In Montana, some churchgoers returned to Sunday services as a general stay-at-home order expired. At Christ the King Lutheran Church in Billings, every other pew was kept empty. Roughly 100 people streamed into St. Anthony Catholic Church in Laurel, where ushers tried to keep families separate from one another and hand sanitizer was available.“It’s like being given life again,” said church member Jack Auzqui. He said being unable to attend had been spiritually difficult for him and his wife.Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, in announcing the opening of several businesses last week, reiterated religious services were allowed as long as strict social-distancing protocols were followed. But leaders of various denominations said they would keep their buildings shuttered for now.In a sign that it could get harder to enforce restrictions as the weather improves, a lingering heat wave in California lured people to beaches, rivers and trails Sunday, prompting warnings that defiance of stay-at-home orders could reverse progress. Most recreation areas are shuttered, but officials worried that those still open could draw people who will ignore the rules.On the other side of the Atlantic, as Britain’s prime minister returns to work, he faces calls for more clarity on when his government will ease the lockdown, now set to run until at least May 7.Other European nations are further along in relaxing their restrictions. Germany allowed nonessential shops and other facilities to open last week, and Denmark has reopened schools for children up to fifth grade.In China, Wuhan said all major construction projects have resumed as authorities push to restart factory production and other economic activity after a 2 1/2-month lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-spain-lets-children-play-us-states-move-at-various-speeds/story-7THq2GNMTid1lNWxKKYXtK.html
27-04-2020||World||Kim Jong Un mystery grows on reports of train, medical team||Speculation about Kim Jong Un’s health intensified over the weekend after tantalizing -- yet unverified -- reports about a visit by a Chinese medical team and movements of the North Korean leader’s armored train.China sent a team including doctors and senior diplomats to advise its neighbor and longtime ally, Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, a train resembling one long used by North Korean rulers was parked last week near a coastal leadership compound in Wonsan, according to an analysis of satellite imagery released Sunday by the website 38 North. A prominent South Korea adviser also rejected the notion that Kim was ailing or dead.“Our government position is firm,” Moon Chung-in, a foreign policy adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told CNN. “He has been staying in the Wonsan area since April 13” with “no suspicious movements” detected.The latest developments shed little immediate light about the 36-year-old ruler, who U.S. officials said they were told had been in critical condition after cardiovascular surgery. Kim -- a heavy smoker who has gained considerable weight since taking power in 2011 -- hasn’t appeared in state media for two weeks, and missed April 15 birthday celebrations for his late grandfather, state founder Kim Il Sung, for the first time.The episode renews longstanding questions about the stability of a regime built on iron-fisted authority and a cult of personality for Kim, who has no known successor. Health scares have been a common occurrence over the years, and the leader’s medical condition is a closely-guarded subject in one of the world’s most secretive states.Any leadership change in North Korea could increase the threat of instability on China’s border and raise questions about control of the country’s expanding nuclear arsenal. Kim has also been central to U.S. President Donald Trump’s so far unsuccessful efforts to get him to reduce his weapons stockpile.The mystery sent journalists, diplomats and non-proliferation experts scouring satellite images, state news outlets and unverified social media feeds for clues about Kim. The hashtag #kimjongundead was the among the top subjects trending globally Saturday on Twitter. The name of his younger sister Kim Yo Jong -- a potential successor -- was also trending in the U.S.“Information about the serious state of health of our Marshal Kim Jong Un is false and malicious,” Korean Friendship Association head Alejandro Cao de ­Benos said in a tweet Saturday. Cao, who was featured in the 2015 documentary “The Propaganda Game,” didn’t say where he got the information and declined further comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.Kim similarly disappeared from state media for six weeks in 2014, prompting speculation that he had been sidelined by gout, an ankle injury or was even overthrown in a coup. He subsequently showed up walking with a cane during a visit to a new residential block.A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party’s International Liaison Department -- which manages relations with North Korea -- departed Beijing on Thursday, Reuters said, adding it wasn’t able to immediately determine what the trip signaled about Kim’s health. Officials with the U.S. National Security Council declined to comment on Saturday.Speculation about Kim’s condition accelerated after Seoul-based news site Daily NK, reported April 20 that the North Korean leader was recovering from surgery, citing one unidentified person inside the country. CNN reported a short time later that Kim was in “grave danger.”Trump has since said he believed the CNN report was “incorrect,” saying he heard “they used old documents.” South Korean officials said repeatedly last week that they believed Kim was conducting “normal activities” in a rural part of the country assisted by close aides, and that they detected no unusual movements by the regime.The presence of Kim’s train in Wonsan, about 230 kilometers (143 miles) east of Pyongyang, potentially fits with the South Korean account. The area has received intense interest from Kim in recent years, hosting an expanding leadership compound, a large tourism development project and numerous weapons tests.The train, which Kim took to his failed summit with Trump in Hanoi, arrived at a nearby railway station on or before April 21, 38 North wrote, citing satellite imagery. The train was spotted again at the station on April 23, and appeared to be repositioned for departure.North Korea’s eastern coast saw a burst of military activity on April 14, including cruise missile tests and fighter jet maneuvers, that at the time appeared to be timed to coincide with South Korean parliamentary elections. The next day, Kim was absent from events marking his grandfather’s birthday, known as the Day of the Sun and North Korea’s most politically significant holiday.Although state media has continued to publish messages exchanged between Kim and dignitaries, such as a letter sent to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday, reports included no fresh images and made no mention of new events attended by the leader. Kim was similarly missing from events Saturday marking the anniversary of the Korean People’s Revolutionary Army, although he also didn’t attend the events last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-mystery-grows-on-reports-of-train-medical-team/story-xb5P2KNSzDulho5FkarhTO.html
27-04-2020||World||Covid-19: UK PM Boris Johnson returns to work as business demands lockdown clarity||Boris Johnson returns to work for the first time in a fortnight with one key item at the top of his in-tray: when will he let Britain do so?The prime minister will chair the government’s Monday morning meeting to coordinate efforts to tackle the virus. He spent the last two weeks recuperating at Chequers, his grace-and-favor countryside house, after contracting Covid-19 himself and spending three nights in intensive care.With the nation recording its lowest daily death toll since March and lockdowns being partially lifted on the European continent, Johnson is facing increasing pressure to explain how his administration will move Britain onto the next phase.Businesses are “clamoring” for information, the Institute of Directors said. A survey of more than 1,000 business leaders showed fewer than one in four were optimistic for their prospects over the next 12 months.How and WhenSix business leaders, including Conservative Party billionaire donors Michael Spencer and Peter Hargreaves, have written to the government asking them to ease restrictions, according to the Sunday Times. Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer wrote to Johnson calling for an “exit strategy,” while his party’s senior spokeswoman Rachel Reeves told the BBC the public should be treated as adults.“We should really begin to offer a narrative of how and when it’s going to stop,” Spencer told the newspaper. Three unidentified Cabinet ministers told the paper they questioned how much more voters would stand.The Daily Telegraph reported Monday the premier could ease the lockdown as early as this week. Citing unidentified allies of the prime minister, the paper pointed to May 7 as a possible date. Johnson’s office rejected the report.On Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who’s been deputizing for Johnson while the premier was out of action, rejected the calls for an early easing of the lockdown, telling Sky News the outbreak was still at a “delicate and dangerous” stage. On Sunday, the U.K. reported 413 hospital deaths from the previous day, taking the tally to almost 21,000, the fifth highest in the world. More than 150,000 people have tested positive for the virus.In a series of television interviews on Sunday, Raab wouldn’t be drawn on how and when the U.K. would scale back restrictions. “Until we can be confident -- based on the scientific advice -- that we are making sure-footed steps going forward that protect life, but also preserve our way of life, frankly it is not responsible to start speculating,” he told Sky.Domestic ViolenceIt’s not just the economic impact that Johnson needs to weigh. The cross-party Home Affairs committee called for action against rising cases of domestic abuse, citing “higher levels of violence and coercive control.” Pressure group Counting Dead Women calculated that between March 23, when the lockdown began, and April 12, there were at least 16 domestic abuse killings of women and children, according to the report.In the daily televised news briefing on Sunday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said workers are taking advantage of the government’s furlough program -- where up to 80% of their salary is paid by the taxpayer -- will be asked to take second jobs in the agricultural sector to help farmers bring in the harvest, as migrant numbers are down.Meanwhile, second home owners in Wales could be ordered to leave their properties under measures being considered by the Welsh Government, the nation’s First Minister Mark Drakeford said. Doctors in rural areas, where there are fewer health resources, appealed for second home owners to stay in their primary residence.“If we are going to get to that position, we have got to do it and be confident that the law is secure under our feet,” Drakeford told BBC Wales on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-pm-boris-johnson-returns-to-work-as-business-demands-lockdown-clarity/story-fZrl7bSeQPasG1G0STzHXO.html
27-04-2020||World||As mystery over his health deepens, 5 things to know about Kim Jong Un||The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea since it was founded in 1948. Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who assumed power after his father Kim Jong Il passed away from a heart attack in 2011. It is said that Kim and his ancestors have Paektu bloodline, which is named after the highest peak on the Korean Peninsula-- Mount Paekdu--where Kim’s late father and former leader Kim Jong-il was born. It is also said that those with the Paektu bloodline and its direct descendents have the right to rule the country. Kim Jong Il was groomed for close to 20 years as North Korea’s prospective ruler, while Kim Jong Un had to suddenly take over the reins due to his father’s sudden death.Likely SuccessorKim’s sister Kim Yo-jong is widely seen as a likely successor if Kim dies before his eldest child is ready to take over. Some commentators familiar with the pecking order inside the Kim dynasty say that Kim Yo-jong, the youngest daughter of Kim Jong-il, has the strongest claim to the leadership position by virtue of her bloodline and also because of her experience in politics. She is an alternate member of the Politburo and vice director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK). ALSO WATCH | North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in critical condition? Watch China’s reaction She’s believed to be in her 30s and a few years younger than her 36-year-old brother. She has maintained a relatively low profile and was noticed last month when she hit out at South Korea, comparing the rival nation with a “frightened dog barking” after it lodged a protest against a military exercise conducted by the north. She is said to well-versed in the art of running the North Korean propaganda machinery. She was blacklisted by the US Treasury Department in 2017. HealthKim Jong Un has not been seen publicly in the last 15 days since he attended a major party meeting on April 11. Some reports suggest he underwent a cardiovascular surgery due to health issues triggered by heavy smoking and weight gain. There’s also a family history of cardiovascular problems which has made matters worse. This would not be Kim’s first ‘health-related’ disappearance. In 2014, he was unseen for over a month- 40 days to be exact-- before he re-emerged, walking with a limp and using a cane. It was said that he was tending to an ankle problem.Given the nature of their dynastic rule great secrecy is maintained around health issues of the first family. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, had also vanished for months in the year 2008 due to a heart stroke which was confirmed only later by a French doctor. The supreme leader died three years later. Early LifeHe is widely believed to have studied in the West during his school days. By most accounts he was a shy boy who loved basketball and spent several hours sketching Michael Jordan, who used to play for Chicago Bulls, said The Washington Post. He was also fond of computer games and liked to watch Jackie Chan action movies. There is also a wide agreement that Kim went to Kim Il-sung University as youth between 2002 and 2007. The university is a leading officer-training school in Pyongyang. Kim is said to have obtained two degrees, one in physics and another as an Army officer from the Kim Il-sung Military University. Political KillingsReports allege Kim’s role in purging several political leaders including his own uncle after he assumed power in 2011 for the purpose of consolidating it by eliminating all threats. Jang Song-thaek, Kim’s uncle was executed for alleged treachery. Kim was also widely blamed for the murder of his half-brother Kim Jong-nam in Malaysia in February 2017. However, it couldn’t be proved conclusively. Kim Jong Un’s uncle Jang Song-thaek was arrested in December 2013 and executed soon after by a firing squad. Kim is believed to have put to death all members of his uncle’s family, including the children and grandchildren of all close relatives. Jang’s sister Jang Kye-sun, her husband and ambassador to Cuba, Jon Yong-jin, and Jang’s nephew and ambassador to Malaysia, Jang Yong-chol, are all believed to have been executed on Kim’s orders. In another incident of political purge to safeguard power, deputy security minister O Sang-hon was allegedly eliminated using a flamethrower in 2014 for his role in supporting Kim Jong Un’s uncle Jang Song-taek Assasination Attempt2014 was a difficult year for Kim as news of an assassination attempt surfaced while he was busy consolidating power by purging his uncle’s loyalists. It was revealed that year that an assassination attempt had been made on the young leader in 2012, when a machine gun was discovered under a juniper tree in Ryugyeongwon, near a route that Kim was taking. Three years ago, in May 2017, Kim’s government accused the American spy agency, the CIA and the South Korean intelligence service, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to have hired a North Korean lumberjack to assassinate Kim. It was alleged that this was to be achieved using a “biochemical weapon” that was not only radioactive in nature but also was nano-poisonous. The effect of the poison would have only appeared a few months later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-mystery-over-his-health-deepens-5-things-to-know-about-kim-jong-un/story-rsI4wOeY6v7SdhBDsRXWoL.html
27-04-2020||World||With Kim Jong Un’s health uncertain, spotlight shifts to his sister Kim Yo Jong||Of all the family members who could eventually take the reins from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, his sister seems like the obvious choice.Kim Yo Jong, in her early 30s, has been by her brother’s side at summits with U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, sat behind Vice President Mike Pence while representing North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics and became the first immediate member of the ruling family to visit Seoul, where she delivered a personal message from her brother inviting South Korean President Moon Jae-in to a summit.The biggest potential hang-up: She’s a woman in a society rigidly controlled by men. While many North Korea watchers say bloodline is more important than gender, others are skeptical.ALSO WATCH | North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in critical condition? Watch China’s reaction “Yo Jong’s role will likely be limited to a regent at most” due to North Korea’s feudal patriarchy, said Yoo Ho-yeol, who teaches North Korean studies at Korea University and formerly advised South Korea’s unification ministry and defense ministry. “Not only the male-dominant leadership, but also ordinary people there would resist a female leader.”The question of whether Kim Yo Jong will become North Korea’s first woman leader has suddenly become front and center as questions about her brother’s health intensify. Kim Jong Un hasn’t appeared in state media in two weeks, prompting a flurry of reports suggesting he could be incapacitated.The Kim family dynasty has ruled North Korea for three generations since its founding after World War II, when the Soviet Union and the U.S. divided up control of the Korean Peninsula. Over that time, it has built up one of the world’s most vigorous personality cults -- making the preeminent claim to legitimacy in the dictatorship a bloodline said to stem from the sacred Mount Paektu near the Chinese border.When Kim Jong Un took power after his father’s death in 2011, the big question was whether a leader in his 20s could rule a country that revered seniority. He soon exerted authority over geriatric generals and eliminated potential rivals: He executed his uncle and one-time deputy, Jang Song Thaek, and was suspected to have ordered the assassination of his exiled older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, in Malaysia.In many ways, Kim Yo Jong -- who has spent nearly a decade enmeshed in the state apparatus -- has been better groomed to take over the top leadership role. She could also similarly surprise anyone who doubts her ability to run the country, according to Soo Kim, a Rand Corp. policy analyst who specializes in Korean Peninsula issues.‘Begins and Ends’“I don’t think she needs to worry about gaining acceptance as a leader by the North Korean people by virtue of her Kim family bloodline,” Soo Kim said. “North Korea’s fate begins and ends with the Kim family.”The other potential male Kim heirs are younger or less experienced in the halls of power in Pyongyang. His brother Kim Jong Chol has no official title and seems to be more interested in playing guitar than politics, while his nephew, Kim Han Sol, has denounced the regime and is believed to be living abroad.South Korean media reported that Kim Jong Un has a 10-year-old son, but none of his children have been officially mentioned in state media. Thae Yong Ho, the former No. 2 at North Korea’s embassy in London who defected to South Korea, said in a radio interview that one potential successor is Kim Pyong Il, the only surviving son of North Korea’s founder Kim Il Sung who returned to the country last year following four decades overseas serving as a diplomat.“Those who’re serving Kim Jong Un are the first generation in their 60s through 80s, so there’s at least a 30-year age gap with Yo Jong. In their eyes, Yo Jong is just a novice,” Thae said. The same argument was made when Kim Jong Un took power, though his youth didn’t block his ascent or his control over the old guard.Either way, Kim Yo Jong remains the most prominent heir. Born in either 1988 or 1989, she was once a chubby-cheeked girl who loved dancing and was nicknamed “Princess Yo Jong” by her father, the late dictator Kim Jong Il, according to a biography of Kim Jong Un titled “The Great Successor” by Anna Fifield. She joined her brother at a school in Bern, Switzerland until about 2000 and later came back to study in North Korea.Rising ProfileHer appearance by her brother’s side at the time of their father’s death let the North Korean public know she was a part of the Paektu bloodline. She soon had a position in the Workers’ Party Propaganda and Agitation Department, according to South Korea, where she was responsible for managing the image of the leader in state media -- a post similar to one held by her father when he was being groomed for succession.She steadily rose through the ranks and became a closer confidante to her brother, accompanying him on inspection tours of factories, farms and military units. Then her high-profile appearances on the international stage, which included mundane tasks like helping the leader extinguish a cigarette during a train stop in China, helped cement her status.Kim Raises Sister’s Profile With North Korean Politburo Post“When Kim Yo Jong has risen as high as she already has, she is no longer considered a woman but a leader who inherited greater legitimacy to rule than others,” said Chun Yungwoo, South Korea’s former envoy to international nuclear talks with North Korea. “North Korea certainly is one of the most male chauvinistic societies in the world, but bloodline supplemented by status in the Korea Workers’ Party supercedes gender.”Kim Yo Jong’s clout was on display last month when she personally responded to a letter from Trump offering assistance to fight Covid-19. In a statement carried by state-run Korean Central News Agency, she said Trump’s “close relations” with her brother weren’t enough to settle differences between the longstanding enemies -- providing a glimpse into how she would handle U.S.-North Korea ties if she does take power.‘More Powerful’“We try to hope for the day when the relations between the two countries would be as good as the ones between the two top leaders, but it has to be left to time and be watched whether it can actually happen,” she said. “However, we will never lose or waste time for nothing, but will keep changing ourselves to be more powerful for that time just as how we made ourselves for the past two years.”Kim Hong-gul, the youngest son of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and a lawmaker-elect, said Kim Yo Jong looked firmly in control when a delegation from Seoul visited Pyongyang as part of a summit between the leaders of the countries in 2018.“I saw from a distance, at the airport upon our arrival and the banquet in Pyongyang, Yo Jong meticulously taking care of everything near her brother,” Kim Hong-gul said. “It looked like she was the top supervisor on the site.”On paper, there’s nothing stopping a woman from taking power in North Korea, even though its rubber-stamp parliament shows the vast majority of its members are older men -- one of the least gender diverse in the world. The constitution says “women are accorded an equal social status and rights with men.”Still, some analysts don’t think Kim Yo Jong could hold sway over the country’s generals who command the nuclear weapons program, which for many in Pyongyang represents the main guarantor of protection against a U.S. war for regime change. Ra Jong-yil, former deputy director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, said it was more likely the country is run by a military junta than Kim Yo Jong.Playing the Game“It is almost unthinkable to have a female leader in North Korea” in part due to its “unique patriarchy based on the Confucianism,” said Lee Byong-chul, a former South Korea presidential adviser on national security issues who is now a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. He questioned whether she could control the “old male generals” without her brother’s influence, and saw it more likely that either her uncle Kim Pyong Il or nominal head of state Choe Ryong Hae takes over.Still, North Korea’s “cult-driven system” makes it essential to have a family member in charge, and Kim Jo Yong “has shown that she knows how to exercise authority,” according to Sung-Yoon Lee​, who teaches Korean Studies at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts.“The generals with the big guns have every interest in protecting their own power and they understand that power runs through the Kim family,” he said. “She will be able to wield power through a mix of terror and promotions. She knows how to play the game.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-a-woman-run-north-korea-kim-jong-un-s-sister-outshines-male-rivals/story-wBRP1dQpI1MvO8f8CAipvI.html
