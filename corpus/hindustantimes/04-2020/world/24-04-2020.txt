He said injecting disinfectants would likely kill anyone who tried it.“It is hugely irresponsible because, sadly, there are people around the world who might believe this sort of nonsense and try it out for themselves,” he told Reuters.Trump said at his daily media briefing on Thursday that scientists should explore whether inserting light or disinfectant into the bodies of people infected with the new coronavirus might help them clear the disease. “Is there a way we can do something like that by injection, inside, or almost a cleaning?” he said. “It would be interesting to check that.” The White House said on Friday that Trump had been taken out of context and had urged people to seek coronavirus treatment only after conferring with their doctors.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement: “President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing.”The emailed statement did not directly mention cleaners or ultraviolet (UV) light as coronavirus treatments, but its subject was “White House on disinfectant.” While UV light is known to kill viruses contained in droplets in the air, doctors say there is no way it could be introduced into the human body to target cells infected with Covid-19.“Neither sitting in the sun, nor heating will kill a virus replicating in an individual patient’s internal organs,” said Penny Ward, a professor in pharmaceutical medicine at Kings College London and chair of the Education and Standards Committee of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine.“Drinking bleach kills. Injecting bleach kills faster. Don’t do either!” she added.Reckitt Benckiser, which manufactures household disinfectants Dettol and Lysol, issued a statement also warning people not to ingest or inject its products. Parastou Donyai, director of pharmacy practice and a professor of social and cognitive pharmacy at the University of Reading, said Trump’s comments were shocking and unscientific. Donyai said people worried about the new coronavirus and the Covid-19 disease it causes should seek help from a qualified doctor or pharmacist, and “not take unfounded and off-the-cuff comments as actual advice”.Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former US labour secretary, added on Twitter: “Trump’s briefings are actively endangering the public’s health. Please don’t drink disinfectant”.Reading’s Donyai said previous comments by Trump had already been linked to people self-administering medicines or other products in ways that make them poisonous.“We have already seen people mistakenly poisoning themselves by taking chloroquine when their hopes were raised by unscientific comments,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-disinfectant-idea-shocking-and-dangerous-doctors-say/story-Nzlvzchd3XWOU5IBOhdJaJ.html
24-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: Don’t inject disinfectants, Lysol warns as Donald Trump raises idea||The parent company of Lysol disinfectant warned Friday that its products should not be used internally to treat COVID-19 after President Donald Trump wondered about the prospect during a White House briefing.Trump noted Thursday that researchers were looking at the effects of disinfectants on the virus and wondered aloud if they could be injected into people, saying the virus “does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.”That prompted a strong warning from the maker of disinfectants Lysol and Dettol, which said it was issuing a statement to combat “recent speculation.”“As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),” said the statement from Reckitt Benckiser.The White House accused the media of misrepresenting Trump’s comment.“President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement Friday. “Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines.”Researchers are testing the effect of disinfectants on virus-laden saliva and respiratory fluids in the laboratory, said William Bryan, who leads the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security. They kill the virus very quickly, he said.“And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning,” Trump said. “Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you’re going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds -- it sounds interesting to me.”Bryan said injections weren’t part of that disinfectant research.The president has often talked up prospects for new therapies and offered rosy timelines for the development of a vaccine as he encourages states to move to reopen their economies.On Thursday, the White House also pitched “emerging” research on the benefits of sunlight and humidity in diminishing the threat of the coronavirus.Past studies have not found good evidence that the warmer temperatures and higher humidity of spring and summer will help tamp down the spread of the virus.But Bryan said at a White House briefing Thursday that there are “emerging results” from new research that suggest solar light has a powerful effect in killing the virus on surfaces and in the air. He said scientists have seen a similar effect from higher temperatures and humidity. A biocontainment lab in Maryland has been conducting testing on the virus since February, Bryan said.“The virus is dying at a much more rapid pace just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity,” Bryan said.Trump was asked if it was dangerous to make people think they would be safe by going outside in the heat, considering that so many people have died in Florida.“I hope people enjoy the sun. And if it has an impact, that’s great,” Trump replied, adding, “It’s just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very, very smart, perhaps brilliant man.”“I’m here to present ideas, because we want ideas to get rid of this thing. And if heat is good, and if sunlight is good, that’s a great thing as far as I’m concerned,” the president said.Bryan stressed that the emerging results of the light and heat studies do not replace social distancing recommendations.Earlier in the month, scientific advisers told the White House there’s no good evidence yet that the heat and humidity of summer will rein in the virus without continued public health measures.Researchers convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine analyzed studies done so far to test virus survival under different laboratory conditions as well as tracking where and how COVID-19 has spread so far.“Given that countries currently in ‘summer’ climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,” the researchers wrote earlier in April in response to questions from the White House Office of Science and Technology.In addition, the report cited the global lack of immunity to the new virus and concluded, “if there is an effect of temperature and humidity on transmission, it may not be as apparent as with other respiratory viruses for which there is at least some preexisting partial immunity.”They noted that during 10 previous flu pandemics, regardless of what season they started, all had a peak second wave about six months after the virus first emerged.In March, Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief. said, “We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it’s a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-don-t-inject-disinfectants-lysol-warns-as-donald-trump-raises-idea/story-nKUsHOpZitqv671vcc7FEI.html
24-04-2020||World||Canada shooter’s rampage began with assault on girlfriend: Police||The worst mass shooting in Canada’s history started with the suspect assaulting his girlfriend, and this may have been the “catalyst” for the 22 grisly slayings that followed, police said Friday.Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Superintendant Darren Campbell, at a news conference describing the 13-hour manhunt for the shooter, said his motives are still under investigation.But the suspect’s beating of his girlfriend, who managed to escape and hide in nearby woods and later informed police that her attacker wore a patrolman’s uniform and drove a mock squad car, “could very well have been the catalyst to start the chain of events.”“It was a significant assault,” Campbell noted, suggesting also that her escape may have enraged the shooter, identified as 51-year-old denturist Gabriel Wortman.Police previously described the girlfriend simply as “a key witness” who helped them identify the armed suspect after she emerged from hiding Sunday morning, about nine hours into the shooting and arson spree.Thirteen victims had been identified by then in the quiet and sparsely populated Nova Scotia seaside community of Portapique where police set up a four-square kilometre (1.5 square mile) perimeter to try to contain the suspect.Overnight, the shooter may have fled the area by driving through a field or, disguised as an RCMP officer, slipped past barricades, Campbell said.“I can’t imagine any more horrific set of circumstances when you’re trying to search for someone that looks like you,” Campbell said.This “obviously complicated things” and gave the suspect an “advantage” over police, the public and “every person that he encountered through the course of his rampage.”Authorities noted also that they learned of three “plated” Ford Taurus cars owned by the suspect -- the same make and model as RCMP squad cars -- but were not initially aware of a fourth made to look like a squad car and driven in the attacks.Their investigation has so far uncovered where Wortman purchased the lightbar for the vehicle and may have sourced decals. His guns, police said, were purchased in Canada and the United States.He also took the sidearm and magazines off a veteran policewoman after killing her in a confrontation shortly before he was gunned down by a tactical officer who caught up with him at a gas station near Halifax.“While he was at the gas pumps, one of our tactical resources came to the gas station to refuel their vehicle,” he said.“When the officer exited the vehicle, there was an encounter and the gunman was shot and killed by police at 11:26 in the morning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-shooter-s-rampage-began-with-assault-on-girlfriend-police/story-zMwVabExtSu6unqufUj3sK.html
24-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: Donald Trump now touts shots of disinfectant, sunlight; slammed||President Donald Trump on Thursday shockingly sought more more research into injecting disinfectants into the body to kill the deadly coronavirus, or the use of UV rays, as the United States inched closer to the 50,000 mark with more than 3,300 fatalities in the last 24 hours.By Friday morning, the US toll had gone up to be 49,963 with 3,332 new fatalities and the number of confirmed cases was 869,172, with 28,819 more.Trump’s suggestions came at the daily briefing of the US coronavirus task force after a presentation of new research that shows the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity, direct sunlight kills it the quickest and some readily available disinfectants finish it off in 5 minutes or much less.“So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous -- whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light -- and I think you said that that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it,” the president asked the presenter, a senior official of the Department of Homeland Security’s science and technology directorate.“Then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning,” he continued, and added, “So it would be interesting to check that.”Disinfectants can be poisonous. And physicians and medical experts were aghast at the president’s suggestions. Deborah birx, coordinator of the president’s task force, wanted no part of the president’s suggestions when he turned to her for affirmation.“Deborah, have you ever heard of that?” the president asked Birx while responding to questions from reporters. “The heat and the light, relative to– certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus?”“Not as a treatment,” Birx said. “I mean, certainly fever is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But not as, I’ve not seen heat …”Trump cut her off: “I think it’s a great thing to look at.”President Trump has previously touted the use of the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus without any proof, arguing there is nothing to lose by trying it.And now this, something that the medical community denounced as dangerous. “My concern is that people will die. People will think this is a good idea,” Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, told The Washington Post. “This is not willy-nilly, off-the-cuff, maybe-this-will-work advice. This is dangerous”.Stanford University’s Eugene Chu wrote on twitter: “Clorox, Tide Pods, and Lysol (disinfectants) will kill the coronavirus. No question about it. But if you are infected, then the coronavirus is inside your cells. If you use any of those disinfectants to kill the coronavirus within your own cells, then you’ll die right along with the coronavirus.”Even the disinfectant makers were troubled by the president suggestions. “As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),” a spokesperson for Reckitt Benckiser, the United Kingdom-based owner of Lysol, told NBC News.As the president continued to be excoriated for the suggestions, the White House said in a statement Friday morning, “President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing. Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-donald-trump-now-touts-shots-of-disinfectant-sunlight-slammed/story-H4lTyEnedrMUPJrXudaXHO.html
24-04-2020||World||Covid-19 in UK: India-origin doctors launch legal challenge on PPE||Two Indian-origin doctors exposed to coronavirus patients have launched a legal challenge to the Boris Johnson government on the allegedly inadequate provision and guidance on personal protection equipment in hospitals; including advise to use plastic aprons if gowns run out .Over 80 medical professionals have passed away in the UK after being infected by the virus in recent days.The challenge has been launched by Meenal Viz, a clinical fellow in medicine, and Joshi, a trainee general practitioner employed by the National Health Service (NHS). Bindmans, the legal firm representing them, said they are married and Viz is pregnant.They are challenging the official guidance on the bases that it is not in line with the international standards set by the World Health Organisation or domestic legislation regarding health and safety at work.Besides, it is claimed that the guidance exposes healthcare workers to a greater risk of contracting Covid-19 and fails to address the greater risks faced by non-white healthcare workers; and it is allegedly unclear and has resulted in inconsistent practices.Joshi and Viz said in a statement: “We are incredibly concerned at the ever-growing numbers of healthcare workers who are becoming seriously unwell and dying due to Covid-19. It is the government’s duty to protect its healthcare workers, and there is great anxiety amongst staff with regards to safety protocols that seem to change without rhyme or reason”.“All we ask for is accountability from decision-makers, and that all evidence leading to these decisions should be published and transparent. We are doctors, we are nurses and we are healthcare workers - we will be there for you in your time of need. We will be there for your family. The government needs to protect us, so that we can protect you”, they added.Basmah Sahib of the law firm said a formal letter before action has been sent to Public Health England and the Department of Health and Social Care, seeking a response by Monday. The challenge is against guidance of April 17 that permitted medical staff to wear plastic aprons with coveralls when full-length gowns run out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-in-uk-india-origin-doctors-launch-legal-challenge-on-ppe/story-gFhKsH2dS0qqHOw7Vws94M.html
24-04-2020||World||To kill coronavirus, Trump suggests injecting disinfectants, bringing UV light ‘inside the body’||President Donald Trump has suggested the possibility of studying injecting disinfectants into COVID-19 patients or bringing UV light “inside” their bodies to kill the deadly virus, drawing immediate flak from health experts while a leading disinfectant producer urged people not to listen to such dangerous speculation.Launching a new scientific study conducted by his department, Homeland Security for Science and Technology Under Secretary Bill Bryan on Thursday said the coronavirus dies at a much more rapid pace when exposed to sunlight and humidity. “The virus dies the quickest in direct sunlight. Isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds,” he told White House reporters in the presence of President Trump at his daily briefing on the COVID-19 situation in the country.Bryan’s remarks left Trump wondering if there was a possibility of injecting the chemical into a person infected with COVID-19 as a deterrent to the virus.“I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute...And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets inside the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that,” the US president told reporters at the press briefing. Trump also raised the possibility of using light to combat the deadly viral infection. “So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous (force), whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light - and I think you said that hasn’t been checked but you’re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you’re going to test that, too. Sounds interesting,” Trump said to Bryan. Trump’s incredulous remarks prompted sharp criticism from health experts who warned people against injecting or ingesting disinfectants, which are highly toxic.“My concern is that people will die. People will think this is a good idea...This is not willy-nilly, off-the-cuff, maybe-this-will-work advice. This is dangerous,” Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, told The Washington Post. Reckitt Benckiser, which owns Lysol and Dettol, said that as a global leader in health and hygiene products, “we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).” “As with all products, our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines. Please read the label and safety information,” the company said in a statement on Friday.Lysol, which is one of the America’s best known cleaning brands, has been named in tweets at least 125,000 times since the White House news conference.US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn, who is also a member of the White House coronavirus task force, warned against ingesting any disinfectants to kill the coronavirus.“I certainly wouldn’t recommend the internal ingestion of a disinfectant,” Hahn was quoted as saying by the CNN. Dara Kass, associate professor of emergency medicine at Columbia University Medical Centre, also asked people to refrain from doing such things.“Please don’t drink bleach or isopropyl alcohol to remove #COVID19 from your saliva,” she tweeted. “It’s horrific,” Kass told the Post.People who consume such chemicals often die. Those who survive usually end up with feeding tubes, a result of their mouth and esophagus being eroded by the cleaning agents, she said.Even as experts from the medical community came forward to challenge Trump’s latest remarks, Deborah Birx, one of the top American public health experts, did not respond to the comments about the light therapy or disinfectant injections.Her lips pressed in a tight line, Brix, who serves as the response coordinator for the White House’s coronavirus task force, was silently listening to Trump’s comments from the sidelines, the Post reported.The US has reported over 869,170 COVID-19 cases and nearly 50,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-suggests-injecting-disinfectants-bringing-uv-light-inside-the-body-to-kill-covid-19/story-Yv0unDcfp3jNvYkninmsjP.html
24-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: In a first since January, China reports single digit increase in Covid-19 cases||China on Friday reported six new confirmed Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours with new cases dropping to a single digit for the first time since January when the government began to announce daily numbers.The national health commission (NHC) said four among the six were domestically transmitted while the remaining were imported cases.There was no Covid-19-related death on Thursday for the ninth consecutive day, the NHC said.The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Hubei, the central Chinese province hardest hit in the outbreak, dropped to below 50 on Thursday, also for the first time, health authorities said.“As of Thursday, no new confirmed or suspected cases had been reported in the province for the 20th consecutive day,” the NHC spokesperson Mi Feng said on Friday in Beijing.The number of confirmed cases in Hubei was 47 on Thursday.As of Thursday, China reported a total of 1,618 imported cases, including 32 in critical condition, and 34 new asymptomatic cases, including one from abroad.Meanwhile, Guangzhou, capital of southern China’s Guangdong province, has started novel coronavirus tests on 208,000 teachers, staff, and students in their final year of junior and senior high schools, local authorities said.“As of Thursday noon, the city has completed nucleic acid tests on 193,000 teachers and students in graduating classes in high schools,” according to a report by the official news agency, Xinhua.Among the total, about 38,000 have received the results, which all were negative, the report added.Meanwhile, according to the tabloid, Global Times, several border cities in southwest China have conducted drills featuring simulated illegal border crossings in order to further enhance efforts to prevent imported cases of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-in-a-first-since-january-china-reports-single-digit-increase-in-covid-19-cases/story-k1ExBoW289UzXVFLNGREIL.html
24-04-2020||World||With Covid-19 fears looming this Ramadan, Asia’s Muslims keep faith and distance||Governments of Asian nations with large Muslim populations urged people to keep their distance while observing their faith as Islam’s fasting month of Ramadan began on Friday, shrouded in fear over the coronavirus.Early outbreaks in Asia, home to the bulk of the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims, were traced in many cases to pilgrims returning from Iran and Saudi Arabia, as in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or gatherings of Islamic groups, as in India and Malaysia.During Ramadan, set to begin on Friday or Saturday, depending on the sighting of the new moon, Muslims join their families to break the fast at sunset, go to mosques to pray and look to spend time with relatives.But the risk of full-blown epidemics has changed priorities, with curbs imposed on large gatherings for prayers and public iftars, or meals to break the fast. “Just like when we fast, we must struggle and fight against our desires,” Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said in a televised address to his country, one of the hardest hit by the virus in Southeast Asia.“It doesn’t matter that we cannot pray together at the mosque. Perhaps this is a God-given opportunity for us to pray with our families at home instead.”On Thursday, his government extended curbs on movement until May 12, cancelled popular evening bazaars and banned attendance at mosque prayers as well as travel back to people’s hometowns. In neighbouring Indonesia, which has the world’s biggest Muslim population, President Joko Widodo repeated a call for people to work and pray at home during a national address. Indonesia has identified 7,775 infections, and 647 deaths, for Asia’s highest toll outside China, where the disease emerged.On the island of Java, Tatan Agustustani, 52, and his family were busy clearing furniture from their lounge room to make way for prayer mats.“It’s the same in the mosque or at home,” said Agustustani, who lives in Bogor, on the outskirts of Jakarta, the capital. “For me, no matter where we are, prayers must go on, even though we cannot pray in the mosque.”But that message appeared lost in Aceh, the sharia-ruled province at the far western tip of the archipelago nation, as worshippers crowded into a mosque for tarawih prayers on the eve of Ramadan.Some said their fate was not in their hands, although many wore masks as they lined up shoulder-to-shoulder to pray.“In our belief, it is God who decides when we will die,” said one devotee, Taufik Kelana. “But we will stay alert, like wearing a mask.”In Brunei, the tiny oil rich sultanate that shares the island of Borneo with Malaysia and Indonesia, mosques have been temporarily closed and people urged to pray at home. Brunei has reported 138 infections.NO IFTARIn South Asia, Ramadan is expected to start on Saturday. Leaders of India’s 160 million-strong Muslims have urged people to heed the nationwide lockdown throughout the month. The lockdown in India, which has recorded 23,076 infections, including 718 deaths, is set to end on May 3.“If the lockdown does not end on May 3 or soon after, it will be a Ramadan unlike any in my 55 years,” said Salim Mohammed, a property agent in the western city of Ahmedabad.Muslims, who form 12 percent of India’s population of 1.3 billion, faced renewed pressure from Hindu hardline groups tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling alliance and vigilante groups after a large number of infections were linked to a religious gathering of a Sunni missionary group.The Tablighi Jamaat event in mid-March drew participants from across India, neighbouring Bangladesh and even Indonesia and Malaysia.The reputed All India Islamic Centre of religious teaching will livestream recitation of two chapters of the Koran, the Muslim holy book, from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. each day.“This is the best way to pray to Allah and keep everyone safe,” said its chairman, Khalid Rashid Firangi Mahali.“There should be no Roza Iftaar parties at all. Instead that money should be used for food and rations for the poor.”Bangladesh has ordered mosques to restrict Ramadan evening prayers to 12 people and banned iftar gatherings, while Sri Lanka has closed mosques to the public.Doctors in Pakistan are worried by the government’s decision to lift curbs on mosque congregations for Ramadan.Pakistan has 11,155 virus infections with 237 deaths, but doctors, and the government, say the outbreak has yet to peak.Heeding doctors’ advice, the government of the southern province of Sindh ordered tarawih prayers performed at home, limiting Friday mosque gatherings to three to five people.“All I can say is it is another test by Allah,” said Nur Alam, 65, a refugee in Bangladesh, whose son was shot dead during the Myanmar military crackdown of 2017, in which hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled into the neighbouring country.“I’ll fast and will keep praying to Allah. The virus would go away. May Allah keep everyone safe out there and everywhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-covid-19-fears-looming-this-ramadan-asia-s-muslims-keep-faith-and-distance/story-wdLUJ8v56uvI1Yv3LOBLII.html
24-04-2020||World||Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trial on humans begins with caution||The first two volunteers in the human trial for a vaccine against Covid-19 were innoculated at the University of Oxford on Thursday evening, with experts expressing cautious optimism and much of the world anticipating its success.Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the university, is hopeful of developing the vaccine by September, with initial results expected by mid-May. The Oxford project is one of nearly 80 such initiatives across the globe to develop a vaccine for Covid-19.One of the two innoculated on Thursday was named as Elisa Granato, a microbiologist.As the trial was rolled out on Friday on more volunteers, the university sounded a note of caution: “A high proportion of vaccines are found not to be promising even before clinical trials. Moreover, a significant proportion of vaccines that are tested in clinical trials don’t work”.“If we are unable to show that the vaccine is protective against the virus, we would review progress, examine alternative approaches, such as using different numbers of doses, and would potentially stop the programme”, it said.The two volunteers are among over 1,100 between the ages of 18 and 55 recruited for the trial in Oxford, Bristol, Southampton and London. Half of them receive the vaccine and the other half (the control group) receive a widely available meningitis vaccine.The vaccine produced in the university is based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, intended to test against Covid-19 in healthy volunteers. It aims to assess whether healthy people can be protected from COVID-19 with the vaccine called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is made from a virus (ChAdOx1), which is a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees, that has been genetically changed so that it is impossible for it to grow in humans.The volunteers are given an E-diary to record symptoms for a week after receiving the vaccine and attend a series of follow-up visits, when a blood sample will be taken and the E-diary reviewed. The blood samples will be used to assess the immune response to the vaccine.“If participants develop COVID-19 symptoms during the study, they can contact a member of the clinical team, and we will assess them to check whether they have become infected with the virus. If a participant was very unwell, we would call our colleagues in the hospital and ask them to review the volunteer if appropriate”, the university added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-trial-on-humans-begins-with-caution/story-01gSRHNcB6BQMuE6MtRugI.html
24-04-2020||World||France to test nicotine substitutes as treatment for Covid-19||Researchers in France will test whether nicotine could be used to treat Covid-19.“It’s an interesting possibility,” Health Minister Olivier Veran on France Inter radio. “We’ll know more soon.”Doctors at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris observed that few Covid-19 patients hospitalized were smokers. They also speculated that the new virus may involve receptors in the body that respond to nicotine. To investigate whether nicotine might have some protective mechanism, they will conduct clinical tests using patches, including one on health-care workers.The French scientists’ approach runs counter to mainstream thinking on nicotine: The World Health Organization has said smoking probably increases the risk of complications from Covid-19.The idea isn’t to get more people addicted to nicotine or smoking, which kills about 70,000 people each year in France.“There are substitutes to nicotine that can be developed in laboratories that would enable to avoid its addictive effects,” Veran said.Separately, Veran pointed to a French study of 170 patients with Covid-19 that suggests people develop enough antibodies to have immunity to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-test-nicotine-substitutes-as-treatment-for-covid-19/story-UtKOKCOfhvOOFhECPVvcuN.html
24-04-2020||World||US House approves $500 billion coronavirus bill in relief package||The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a $484 billion coronavirus relief bill on Thursday, funding small businesses and hospitals and pushing the total spending response to the crisis to an unprecedented near $3 trillion.The measure passed the Democratic-led House by a vote of 388-5, with one member voting present. House members were meeting for the first time in weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Lawmakers, many wearing masks, approved the bill during an extended period of voting intended to allow them to remain at a distance from one another in line with public health recommendations.The House action sent the latest of four relief bills to the White House. Republican President Donald Trump, who backs the measure, said he would probably sign it into law on Thursday evening.The Republican-led Senate had passed the legislation on a voice vote on Tuesday. But threats of opposition by some members of both parties prompted congressional leaders to call the full chamber back to Washington for the House vote despite state stay-at-home orders meant to control the spread of the virus.The House also approved a select committee, with subpoena power, to probe the U.S. response to the coronavirus. It will have broad powers to investigate how federal dollars are being spent, U.S. preparedness and Trump administration deliberations.Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the panel was essential to ensure funds go to those who need them and to prevent scams. Republicans said the committee was not needed, citing existing oversight bodies, and called the panel’s creation another expensive Democratic slap at Trump. The committee was approved on a vote of 212-182, along party lines.The $484 billion aid bill was the fourth passed to address the coronavirus crisis. It provides funds to small businesses and hospitals struggling with the economic toll of a pandemic that has killed almost 50,000 people in the United States and thrown 26 million out of work, wiping out all the jobs created during the longest employment boom in U.S. history.A handful of lawmakers opposed the legislation, including Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents a severely affected area of New York and believes Congress should do even more - and Republican Thomas Massie, known as “Mr. No” for his frequent opposition to spending bills.“This is really a very, very, very sad day. We come to the floor with nearly 50,000 dead, a huge number of people, and the uncertainty of it all,” Pelosi said during debate on the bill.Congress passed the last coronavirus relief measure, worth more than $2 trillion, in March, also with overwhelming support from both parties.

24-04-2020||World||US House passes $500 billion coronavirus bill in latest relief package||The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a $484 billion coronavirus relief bill on Thursday, funding small businesses and hospitals and pushing the total spending response to the crisis to an unprecedented near $3 trillion.The measure passed the Democratic-led House by a vote of 388-5, with one member voting present. House members were meeting for the first time in weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Lawmakers, many wearing masks, approved the bill during an extended period of voting intended to allow them to remain at a distance from one another in line with public health recommendations.The House action sent the latest of four relief bills to the White House. Republican President Donald Trump, who backs the measure, said he would probably sign it into law on Thursday evening.The Republican-led Senate had passed the legislation on a voice vote on Tuesday. But threats of opposition by some members of both parties prompted congressional leaders to call the full chamber back to Washington for the House vote despite state stay-at-home orders meant to control the spread of the virus.The House also approved a select committee, with subpoena power, to probe the U.S. response to the coronavirus. It will have broad powers to investigate how federal dollars are being spent, U.S. preparedness and Trump administration deliberations.Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the panel was essential to ensure funds go to those who need them and to prevent scams. Republicans said the committee was not needed, citing existing oversight bodies, and called the panel’s creation another expensive Democratic slap at Trump. The committee was approved on a vote of 212-182, along party lines.The $484 billion aid bill was the fourth passed to address the coronavirus crisis. It provides funds to small businesses and hospitals struggling with the economic toll of a pandemic that has killed almost 50,000 people in the United States and thrown 26 million out of work, wiping out all the jobs created during the longest employment boom in U.S. history.A handful of lawmakers opposed the legislation, including Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents a severely affected area of New York and believes Congress should do even more - and Republican Thomas Massie, known as “Mr. No” for his frequent opposition to spending bills.“This is really a very, very, very sad day. We come to the floor with nearly 50,000 dead, a huge number of people, and the uncertainty of it all,” Pelosi said during debate on the bill.Congress passed the last coronavirus relief measure, worth more than $2 trillion, in March, also with overwhelming support from both parties. It was the largest such funding bill ever passed.Trouble aheadThe next step will be harder. The two parties have set the stage for a fight over additional funding for state and local governments reeling from the impact of lost revenue after Republicans refused to include such funds in the current relief bill.Trump has said he supports more funding for states, and has promised to back it in future legislation.Congressional Republicans have resisted.

But the Taliban’s spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted late Thursday to lambaste the government’s offer, citing ongoing disagreements over a potential peace process and a delayed prisoner exchange as reasons to keep fighting.“Asking for ceasefire is not rational and convincing,” wrote Shaheen as he accused the government of putting prisoners’ lives at risk during the outbreak.Under a landmark US-Taliban deal signed earlier this year, the Afghan government and the insurgents were by now supposed to have concluded a prisoner swap and started talks aimed at bringing about a comprehensive ceasefire.The latest round of bickering comes after dozens of Afghan security forces personnel were killed in a fresh wave of violence launched by the insurgents this week.The attacks have mostly been limited to rural areas and small towns. Under the US-Taliban deal, the insurgents have agreed not to attack cities.American and other foreign forces have pledged to quit Afghanistan by July 2021 provided the Taliban stick to several security guarantees and hold talks with the government.Ghani has been calling for a lasting ceasefire with the Taliban for years, only to be ignored by the increasingly emboldened insurgents.The Taliban instead have mocked Ghani’s government, referring to them as “puppets” controlled by foreign powers, and have roundly refused to engage in peace talks as they intensify attacks on Afghan forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-reject-afghanistan-govt-ceasefire-offer-during-ramzan-as-country-battles-covid-19/story-Ogrt0GsxoPUnV9iPuJxsML.html
24-04-2020||World||Gulf’s migrant workers lying sick, hungry as cases rise||When all nine men in his dormitory caught coronavirus, 27-year-old Nurudhin was bused to a remote quarantine camp -- becoming one of many migrant workers Gulf states are struggling to accomodate adequately.The oil-rich Gulf is reliant on the cheap labour of millions of foreigners -- mostly from India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka -- many of whom live in squalid camps far from the region’s showy skyscrapers and malls.But the spread of coronavirus, alongside shrinking oil-driven economies, has left many workers sick and countless others unemployed, unpaid and at the mercy of unscrupulous employers.“There is nothing in my room except a small bed. I have to share a bathroom with 20 to 30 people,” said Nurudhin, a draftsman from India who was hospitalised before being taken to a remote isolation facility for blue-collar workers in the United Arab Emirates.“There is no WiFi. Not even a television. But the situation in my room was even worse,” he said of his crowded quarters in Abu Dhabi, which proved a fertile ground for the disease.Despite strict curfews in force for weeks, the Gulf states with the biggest populations of foreign workers -- Saudi, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar -- are still reporting rising numbers of coronavirus cases.Riyadh says foreigners account for 70 to 80 percent of recently discovered cases.To try to reduce transmission, Gulf authorities have moved workers from camps into temporary lodgings, while establishing mass screening centres and using drones in some neighbourhoods to warn people against congregating.‘Worried about our brothers’The UAE has been the most vocal among Gulf countries in demanding governments repatriate workers, many of whom have been laid off or gone unpaid as business halts and oil prices plummet.As of April 20, some 22,900 foreigners had been repatriated on 127 flights from otherwise closed airports, officials said.But India, which has 3.2 million citizens in the UAE alone, has refused to cooperate, saying that repatriating and quarantining millions of returning citizens would be a logistical and safety nightmare.Bangladesh has reluctantly agreed to take back thousands of its citizens to avoid punishment from Gulf states in the future, its Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen said.“If we don’t bring them home... they won’t recruit people from us once their situation improves,” he told AFP, adding that thousands of undocumented workers and hundreds of prisoners are being flown back, including a planeload from Saudi Arabia last week.Pakistan has allowed repatriations to proceed but warned it is hindered by the lack of testing and quarantine facilities at its airports. Its diplomats in Dubai appealed to Pakistanis not to go to the consulate, after a large number -- desperate to return home -- gathered to demand seats on limited special flights.“We are worried about our brothers in the Gulf. The lockdown and closure of daily business in the Gulf have rendered many overseas Pakistanis without a livelihood,” Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said last week.A UAE spokesman said it owed migrant workers a “debt of gratitude” and that it was providing healthcare, food and accommodation, and relaxing immigration rules for those with expiring visas. Hungry and isolatedThe pandemic has highlighted the problem of migrant workers living and working in conditions that leave them vulnerable to disease, said Rothna Begum, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.Attempts by Gulf states to curb the virus were inflicting more hardship, with lockdowns that left workers short of food and water, she told AFP, adding that charities stepping in were overwhelmed.“Workers who are still required to work are being put on buses where they cannot socially distance, and sent to sites where social distancing is not being practised or protective equipment and sanitation is not adequately provided,” she said.Millions of migrant workers face future uncertainty as the now unwanted workforce is haggled over by their governments and host countries.“I want to go back to my country... I don’t have any money and I don’t want to spend more time here,” said an Egyptian man in Kuwait City who is being held at a camp for immigration offences.Javed Paresh, a construction worker in the emirate of Sharjah, is among the tens of thousands of Pakistanis who have registered to fly home.“I have not been paid for the last six months. I just want to go home and see my family. My family will die of hunger as I am unable to send them money for many months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gulf-s-migrant-workers-lying-sick-hungry-as-cases-rise/story-6s4pVfQV9sahmAnm9Wf64M.html

The masks, which preceded promised cash payments some households urgently need, have been the subject of derision online even before their distribution, from their small size to the two-a-household limit.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAnd now reports of dirty or otherwise defective masks from people who have received them have forced the Health Ministry to order improvements in quality inspection. Itochu Corp. and Kowa Co., the companies that manufactured most of the cloth masks, have said they will recall those that haven’t been delivered.The masks have become known as “Abenomask,” a riff on the prime minister’s flagpole “Abenomics” policy that also means “Abe’s Mask,” and the well-meaning but shambolic roll-out has become symbolic of Abe’s stop-start management of the coronavirus crisis.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Friday that there are no plans to halt the distribution, which he said was “a necessary step” amid the national mask shortage.There may be a delay in the distribution due to the recall, Suga said, and that the government plans to continue the delivery to help give the people “peace of mind.”The initial plan to distribute the masks had already met with disapproval, with 68% of those surveyed in a Mainichi poll conducted April 18 and 19 saying they didn’t back the plan.Abe’s support rate has been dropping amid dissatisfaction both in his tackling of the virus and his moves to limit the economic fallout. He has expanded the state of emergency order from initial seven prefectures to the entire country, while ordering cash handouts of 100,000 yen to all residents, backtracking on a previous plan for larger handouts for those most in need.The government is slated to make a decision on whether to extend the emergency status during the upcoming Golden Week holiday season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abenomask-abenomics-unmasks-abe-s-inability-to-contain-pandemic-in-japan/story-mSwXmMSdVAMx80drxVgsdP.html

It’s not like Indians are physically immune to Covid-19, they are mentally immune,” Zhang Wenhong told Chinese students in India during an online video interaction arranged by the Chinese embassy on Wednesday.“The Indians have their peaceful mind,” said Zhang, a leading figure in China’s Covid-19 strategy. He is the director of Huashan Hospital’s Department of Infectious Disease in Shanghai.Zhang also said that though the number of infections is increasing in India, it is far below the level in the United States.Also Watch l PM Modi explains the biggest lesson COVID-19 has taught India “We are seeing an increase in terms of number of confirmed cases in India. Right now, the number of confirmed cases in India is increasing, but India has a larger population than the United States so the infection rate is actually lower than India,” said Zhang.Zhang also said that infection in India will not increase more than 10 per cent. “So, 90 per cent of people around you are clean from the virus,” he assured Chinese students.More than 23,000 people have been infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus, and 718 have died in India, according to the Union health ministry data on Friday morning.With 17,610 active cases, 4,749 people cured or migrated and 718 deaths, India’s Covid-19 tally reached 23,077, according to the health ministry’s dashboard at 8 am.The figures have come on the 31st day of a national lockdown to halt the spread of the disease, which has infected 2,708,470 people and killed 1,90,788 across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indians-mentally-immune-to-covid-19-chinese-expert-tells-students/story-s75blUpROgHByypteZMLXM.html
24-04-2020||World||Experimental virus drug remdesivir failed in human trial||The experimental coronavirus treatment remdesivir has failed in its first randomized clinical trial, inadvertently released results showed Thursday, dampening expectations for the closely watched drug. A draft summary went online briefly on the website of the World Health Organization (WHO) and was first reported by the Financial Times and Stat, which posted a screenshot.But Gilead Sciences, the company behind the medicine, disputed how the now-deleted post had characterized the findings, saying the data showed a “potential benefit.” The summary said the Chinese trial involved 237 patients, with 158 on the drug and 79 in a control group. Remdesivir was stopped early in 18 patients because of side effects.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe authors said remdesivir was “not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement” compared to the control.After a month, 13.9 percent of the patients on remdesivir had died compared to 12.8 percent of those in the control group. The difference is not statistically significant.The WHO told the Financial Times that the draft is undergoing peer review and was published early in error.Trials continueA spokesman for Gilead told AFP: “We believe the post included inappropriate characterizations of the study,” saying it was terminated early due to low enrollment and was therefore not statistically meaningful.“As such, the study results are inconclusive, though trends in the data suggest a potential benefit for remdesivir, particularly among patients treated early in disease,” the spokesman added.The study does not represent the final word on the matter, and there are several large-scale trials in advanced stages that should soon provide a clearer picture.Remdesivir, which is administered intravenously, was among the first drugs suggested as a treatment for the novel coronavirus and as such has great hopes riding on it. Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the research, said “the trial was too small in numbers recruited” to detect either benefit or risk.But he added: “If the drug only works well when given very early after infection, it may be much less useful in practice.”Last week, Stat reported it had shown significant efficacy at a Chicago hospital where patients who are part of one of the major trials are being treated.The US National Institutes for Health also reported it had proven effective in a small experiment on monkeys. Remdesivir, which previously failed in trials against Ebola, belongs to a class of drugs that act on the virus directly -- as opposed to controlling the abnormal and often lethal autoimmune response it causes.It mimics one of the four building blocks of RNA and DNA and gets absorbed into the virus’s genome, which in turn stops the pathogen from replicating.The antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are also being widely used on COVID-19 on a so-called “compassionate basis” pending results from large trials, with early studies decidedly mixed.Other therapies that are being studied include collecting antibodies from COVID-19 survivors and injecting them in patients, or harvesting antibodies from genetically-engineered mice that were deliberately infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experimental-virus-drug-remdesivir-failed-in-human-trial/story-20DaQtwARfgH9yQG3w0InL.html
24-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: France testing if nicotine can protect people from contracting Covid-19||Nicotine could protect people from contracting the coronavirus, according to new research in France, where further trials are planned to test whether the substance could be used to prevent or treat the deadly illness. The findings come after researchers at a top Paris hospital examined 343 coronavirus patients along with 139 people infected with the illness with milder symptoms. They found that a low number of them smoked, compared to smoking rates of around 35 percent in France’s general population.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “Among these patients, only five percent were smokers,” said Zahir Amoura, the study’s co-author and a professor of internal medicine. The research echoed similar findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine last month that suggested that 12.6 percent of 1,000 people infected in China were smokers. That was a much lower figure than the number of regular smokers in China’s general population, about 26%, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The theory is that nicotine could adhere to cell receptors, therefore blocking the virus from entering cells and spreading in the body, according to renown neurobiologist Jean-Pierre Changeux from France’s Pasteur Institut who also co-authored the study.The researchers are awaiting approval from health authorities in France to carry out further clinical trials. They plan to use nicotine patches on health workers at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris -- where the initial research was conducted -- to see if it protects them against contracting the virus. They have also applied to use the patches on hospitalised patients to see whether it helps reduce symptoms and also on more serious intensive care patients, Amoura said. The researchers are looking into whether nicotine could help to prevent “cytokine storms”, a rapid overreaction of the immune system that scientists think could play a key role in fatal Covid-19 cases. But with further research needed, experts are not encouraging people to pick up smoking or use nicotine patches as a protective measure against the virus. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “We must not forget the harmful effects of nicotine,” said Jerome Salomon, France’s top health official. “Those who do not smoke should absolutely not use nicotine substitutes”, which cause side effects and addiction, he warned.Tobacco is the number one killer in France, with an estimated 75,000 deaths per year linked to smoking. France is one of the hardest hit countries by the coronavirus in Europe, with more than 21,000 deaths and over 155,000 reported infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-france-testing-if-nicotine-can-protect-people-from-contracting-covid-19/story-umqQ0ryLHN4i89XvSFdTpN.html

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested COVID-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others. The overall death toll in the country remained at 4,632, with no death reported on Thursday. As of Thursday, the total confirmed COVID-19 cases in China reached 82,804, the NHC said.Hubei province and its capital Wuhan -- the epicentre of the coronavirus -- reported no new COVID-19 case or death in the last few days. China lifted the lockdown in Wuhan on April 8, allowing people to travel both inside and outside the city.Meanwhile, Chinese Internet and e-commerce giants Alibaba Group, JD dot com and Tencent have launched booking services for COVID-19. The services have been launched as China accelerates COVID-19 nucleic acid testing to promote epidemic prevention and control and speed up the resumption of production, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Ali Health, Alibaba’s health care subsidiary, has offered testing appointments in 10 cities, including Shanghai and Beijing, starting from April 21. It will extend the service to 28 more cities this week, it said.JD Health, JD.com’s health care subsidiary, and WeChat, Tencent’s social media platform, also launched similar booking platforms for COVID-19 tests in Beijing, Guangzhou and other cities.Guangzhou, capital of southern China’s Guangdong province, has started novel coronavirus tests on 208,000 teachers, staff and students in their final year of junior and senior high schools ahead of their reopening.As of Thursday noon, the city has completed nucleic acid tests on 193,000 teachers and students in graduating classes in high schools. As many as 38,000 people have received the results, all of which were negative.Grade three students in Guangzhou will return to school on April 27. As of Thursday, Hong Kong reported 1,035 coronavirus cases, including four deaths, Macao registered 45 cases and Taiwan 427, including six fatalities.

24-04-2020||World||Oxford University pushing science to the limit in Covid-19 vaccine hunt||Oxford University is launching a human trial of a potential coronavirus vaccine, with the daunting aim of making a successful jab available to the public later this year.Of the more than 100 research projects around the world to find a vaccine -- described by the United Nations as the only route back to “normality” -- seven are currently in clinical trials, according to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Such trials are already underway in China and the United States and are due to begin at the end of this month in Germany, where the federal vaccine authority gave the green light on Wednesday.The British government strongly supports Oxford University’s work, and the first human trials were to start on Thursday, Health Minister Matt Hancock said.He hailed the “promising development”, pointing out that it would normally take “years” to reach such a stage of vaccine development.In its first phase, half of 1,112 volunteers will receive the potential vaccine against COVID-19, the other half a control vaccine to test its safety and efficacy.The volunteers are aged between 18 and 55, are in good health, have not tested positive for COVID-19 and are not pregnant or breastfeeding.Ten participants will receive two doses of the experimental vaccine, four weeks apart.Professor Sarah Gilbert’s team hopes for an 80 per cent success rate, and plans to produce one million doses by September, with the aim of making it widely available by the autumn if successful.But the teams carrying out this research say on their website that this timetable is “highly ambitious” and could change.The government’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty acknowledged on Wednesday that the likelihood of getting a vaccine within the year was “incredibly small”.“If people are hoping it’s suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly into everything is gone, that is a wholly unrealistic expectation,” he warned.The strategy of not waiting for each step to be completed before launching production is a financial “gamble”, according to Nicola Stonehouse, professor of molecular virology at the University of Leeds.But the current crisis makes it a necessary gamble, she told AFP.The Oxford vaccine is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus, which is modified to produce proteins in human cells that are also produced by Covid-19.It is hoped the vaccine will teach the body’s immune system to then recognise the protein and help stop the coronavirus from entering human cells.The adenovirus vaccine is known to develop a strong immune response with a single dose and is not a replicating virus, so cannot cause infection, making it safer for children, the elderly and patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes.The government, under fire in the media over its handling of the crisis, set up a task force last weekend to coordinate research efforts and to develop capability to mass-produce a vaccine as soon as it is available, wherever it comes from.It is also supporting research at Imperial College London, which hopes to start clinical trials in June.Their research focuses on a vaccine exploiting a different principle, using RNA, the messenger molecules that build proteins in the cells, to stimulate the immune system.Finding a vaccine is the only possible way to bring the world back to “normality”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week, calling for an acceleration of projects.The UN on Monday adopted a resolution calling for “equitable, effective and rapid” access to a possible vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-university-pushing-science-to-the-limit-in-covid-19-vaccine-hunt/story-KQ6L5rp1Sd47NTp5GdFbDL.html

More than 95 per cent of the country’s 330 million people are under stay-at-home order as a result of the social mitigation measures including social distancing being enforced till May 1. Trump on Thursday indicated that this might be extended beyond May 1, but forcefully advocated the need to gradually open up the economy that is safe. In the past few weeks, more than 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits and the figure is soon likely to cross 40 million, as per some estimates. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have projected a negative growth in the US in 2020.Also read: Sunlight, heat and humidity weakens coronavirus, says US official “To keep America gaining momentum, every citizen needs to maintain the vigilance, and we all understand that very well we’ve gone over it many, many times this includes practising good hygiene, maintaining social distance, and the voluntary use of face covering,” he said. “Safe and phased reopening of our economy it’s very exciting, but it does not mean that we are letting down our guard at all in any way; on the contrary, continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy to get our country back to work to take our country back,” Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on coronavirus. The data and facts on the ground suggest that the US is making great progress, he said. In 23 states, new cases have declined. In the peak week 40 per cent of American counties have also seen a rapid decline in new cases. As many as 46 states report a drop in patients showing coronavirus-like symptoms, he said. Trump said that the US is very close to a finding a vaccine for Covid-19. “We are very close to testing... when testing starts it takes a period of time but we will get it done,” he said. According to Vice President Mike Pence, data continues to show promising signs of progress in the New York Metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans all appear to be passed their peak and “we are seeing consistent declines” in hospitalisation and cases in regions across the country. Pence heads the White House Task Force on Coronavirus. “Our task force actually believes that if we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead including phased reopening... by early summer, we can be in a much better place as a nation with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us,” he said.

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced that restaurants and retail outlets would be allowed to reopen. “We want to have the majority of businesses open before May 1,” Lee said. “We are working around the clock to get Tennesseans safely back to work in 89 of our counties with the majority of businesses in a position to begin opening their doors next week,” he said at separate news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-us-very-close-to-testing-covid-19-vaccine-says-president-donald-trump/story-AdnnAifF8Y9asbEFmwXyIP.html
24-04-2020||World||Sunlight, heat and humidity weaken coronavirus: US official||The coronavirus appears to weaken more quickly when exposed to sunlight, heat and humidity, a U.S. official said on Thursday in a potential sign that the pandemic could become less contagious in summer months.U.S. government researchers have determined that the virus survives best indoors and in dry conditions, and loses potency when temperatures and humidity rise - and especially when it is exposed to sunlight, said William Bryan, acting head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate.“The virus dies quickest in the presence of direct sunlight,” he told a White House news briefing.The findings could bolster hopes that the coronavirus will mimic the behavior of other respiratory diseases like influenza, which typically are less contagious in warm weather.But the coronavirus has also proven lethal in warm-weather places like Singapore, raising broader questions about the impact of environmental factors.President Donald Trump said the findings should be interpreted cautiously, but also claimed vindication for previously suggesting that the coronavirus might recede in summer.“I once mentioned that maybe it does go away with heat and light. And people didn’t like that statement that much,” he said at the briefing.Also Read: Oxford University pushing science to the limit in Covid-19 vaccine huntSixteen U.S. states are laying plans to restart their economies and ease regulations designed to slow the spread of the pandemic. Georgia and South Carolina are allowing some businesses to reopen this week - a move that health authorities say could lead to more deaths because they do not have enough tests to assess how many people are infected.Trump’s administration says states should wait until they have proof that infection rates have dropped steadily for two weeks.Vice President Mike Pence said states should allow hospitals and other medical facilities to resume elective surgeries, an important source of revenue that some governors have banned in order to keep hospitals clear for coronavirus patients.Trump said Americans might need to maintain social distancing into early summer, even though some states were showing signs of progress.Trump has encouraged protests against social-distancing restrictions in some states. But he criticized Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican, for moving too quickly.“I want the people in Georgia to be safe, and I don’t want this thing to flare up because you’re deciding to do something that is not in the guidelines,” he said.More than 874,000 people in the United States are known to have been infected and over 49,600 have died of COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, according to a Reuters tally.Also Read: ‘US very close to testing Covid-19 vaccine’, says president Donald Trump18 hours versus two minutesOn nonporous surfaces like stainless steel, the new coronavirus takes 18 hours to lose half its strength in a dark, low-humidity environment, Bryan said.In a high-humidity environment, that half-life dropped to six hours, and when the virus was exposed to high humidity and sunlight, the half-life dropped to two minutes, he said.Researchers found a similar effect with the coronavirus that was suspended in the air - simulating the coughing or sneezing that often spreads the disease. In a dark room, the virus maintained half its strength for an hour. But when exposed to sunlight, it lost half its strength in 90 seconds, Bryan said.Researchers also found that isopropyl alcohol was a more effective disinfectant than bleach, he said.Trump said researchers should try to apply their findings to coronavirus patients by inserting light or disinfectant into their bodies.“Is there a way we can do something like that by injection, inside, or almost a cleaning?” he said. “It would be interesting to check that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sunlight-heat-and-humidity-weakens-coronavirus-us-official/story-0xiDf5xDx2SajETzNC8cOP.html
24-04-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak pushes US unemployment toward highest since Great Depression||Unemployment in the US is swelling to levels last seen during the Great Depression of the 1930s, with 1 in 6 American workers thrown out of a job by the coronavirus, according to new data released Thursday. In response to the deepening economic crisis, the House passed a nearly $500 billion spending package to help buckled businesses and hospitals.More than 4.4 million laid-off Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, the government reported. In all, roughly 26 million people — the population of the 10 biggest U.S. cities combined — have now filed for jobless aid in five weeks, an epic collapse that has raised the stakes in the debate over how and when to ease the shutdowns of factories and other businesses.In the hardest-hit corner of the U.S., evidence emerged that perhaps 2.7 million New York state residents have been infected by the virus — 10 times the number confirmed by lab tests.A small, preliminary statewide survey of around 3,000 people found that nearly 14% had antibodies showing they had been infected, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Just in New York City, with a population of 8.6 million, Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot said as many as 1 million may have been infected.In Washington, many House lawmakers wore face masks and bandannas — and some sat in the otherwise vacant visitors gallery to stay away from others — as they debated the latest spending package. A near-unanimous vote sent it to President Donald Trump in the evening.Anchoring the bill is the administration’s $250 billion request to replenish a fund to help small- and medium-size businesses with payroll, rent and other expenses. Trump said the bill “will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll.”Abroad, there was mixed news about the epidemic. Some countries, including Greece, Bangladesh and Malaysia, announced extensions of their lockdowns. Vietnam, New Zealand and Croatia were among those moving to end or ease such measures.In Africa, COVID-19 cases surged 43% in the past week to 26,000, according to John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The figures underscored a recent warning from the World Health Organization that the virus could kill more than 300,000 people in Africa and push 30 million into desperate poverty.Brazil’s health ministry confirmed 407 deaths due to the outbreak in the last 24 hours, a daily high for the country.Huge lines have formed at food banks from El Paso, Texas, to the Paris suburbs, and food shortages are hitting Africa especially hard.At a virtual summit, European Union leaders agreed to set up a massive recovery fund to help rebuild the 27-nation bloc’s ravaged economies. While no figure was put on the plan, officials said 1-1.5 trillion euros ($1.1-1.6 trillion) would be needed.The coronavirus has killed nearly 190,000 people worldwide, including more than 100,000 in Europe and about 47,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from official government figures. The true numbers are almost certainly far higher.In the U.S., the economic consequences of the shutdowns have sparked angry rallies in state capitals by protesters demanding that businesses reopen, and Trump has expressed impatience over the restrictions.Some governors have begun easing up despite warnings from health authorities that it may be too soon to do so without sparking a second wave of infections. In Georgia, gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys can reopen Friday. Texas has reopened its state parks.Few Americans count on Trump as a reliable source of information on the outbreak, according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About 23% said they have high levels of trust in what he tells the public, while 21% said they trust him a moderate amount.On the economic front, few experts foresee a downturn as severe as the Depression, when unemployment remained above 14% from 1931 to 1940, peaking at 25%. But unemployment is considered likely to remain elevated well into next year and probably beyond, and will surely top the 10% peak of the 2008-09 recession.Janet Simon, laid off as a waitress at an IHOP restaurant in Miami, said she has just $200 in her name and is getting panic attacks because of uncertainty over how she will care for her three children. Simon, 33, filed for unemployment a month ago, and her application is still listed as “pending.”“I’m doing everything to keep my family safe, my children safe, but everything else around me is falling apart,” Simon said. “But they see it, no matter how much I try to hide my despair.”Corey Williams, 31, was laid off from his warehouse job in Michigan a month ago and saw his rent, insurance and other bills pile up while he anxiously awaited his unemployment benefits. That finally happened on Wednesday, and he quickly paid $1,700 in bills.“It was getting pretty tight, pretty tight,” he said. “It was definitely stressful for the last few days.”While the health crisis has eased in places like Italy, Spain and France, experts say it is far from over, and the threat of new outbreaks looms large.“The question is not whether there will be a second wave,” said Dr. Hans Kluge, the head of the WHO’s Europe office. “The question is whether we will take into account the biggest lessons so far.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized some German states for moving too briskly in trying to reopen their economies. Germany has been praised for its approach to the pandemic and has a much lower reported death toll than other large European countries.“We’re not living in the final phase of the pandemic, but still at the beginning,” Merkel warned. “It would be a shame if premature hope ultimately punishes us all.”Governments are bearing that risk in mind with the onset of Ramadan, the holy month of daytime fasting, overnight festivities and communal prayer that begins for the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims with this week’s new moon. Many Muslim leaders have closed mosques or banned collective evening prayer to ward off infections.The virus has already disrupted Christianity’s Holy Week, Passover, the Muslim hajj pilgrimage and other major religious events.Authorities in the capital of Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority nation, extended restrictions to cover all of Ramadan. Turkey banned communal eating during the holiday.Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan bowed to the country’s clerics, refusing to close mosques despite doctors’ warnings that such gatherings could further spread the virus in a country with a fragile health care system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-pushes-us-unemployment-toward-highest-since-great-depression/story-crzCVqhnrc8upgGoD1i28O.html

24-04-2020||World||Trump rejects ‘incorrect’ reports on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s health||US President Donald Trump on Thursday rejected reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was ailing, criticizing his frequent nemesis CNN for running the story.“I think the report was incorrect, let me just put it that way,” Trump told reporters. “I’m hearing they used old documents.”Trump declined to say if he had direct knowledge from North Korea that Kim was fine. He instead attacked cable news network CNN, with which the US leader has an acrimonious relationship.“I think it was a fake report done by CNN,” Trump said at a daily briefing on the coronavirus pandemic, before refusing to take further questions from a journalist of the network.CNN, quoting what it said was an anonymous US official, on Monday reported that Washington was “monitoring intelligence” that Kim was in “grave danger” after undergoing surgery.Daily NK, an online media outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, separately said that Kim underwent a cardiovascular procedure earlier this month and was recovering at a villa in North Pyongan province.It said that Kim, who is in his mid-30s, had needed urgent treatment due to heavy smoking, obesity and fatigue.‘A good relationship’ Trump’s denial of the report came two days after he declined to comment on the matter, saying only that he wished Kim well.South Korea, which is still technically at war with the North, earlier said it had seen no unusual movements in its neighbor.Trump has met Kim three times in historic summitry and has voiced admiration for him, although hopes have dimmed for reaching a comprehensive agreement.“I hope he’s not in medical trouble. I hope he’s not. I have gotten along very well with him,” Trump said Thursday.“Remember you would have been in a war with North Korea if I didn’t get elected president.”Trump declined to state when he was last in touch with Kim, saying: “We have a good relationship with North Korea, as good as you can have.”Shortly before reports emerged on Kim’s health, Trump said he had received a “nice note” from the leader, but North Korea denied sending any message.North Korea has fired off a series of rockets as it demands concessions from the Trump administration, which says that international sanctions should remain until the regime fully denuclearizes.Kim was conspicuously absent on April 15 from celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather Kim Il Sung, the regime’s founder -- the most important day on the North Korean political calendar.The flamboyant basketball star Dennis Rodman -- who until Pompeo and Trump had been the highest-profile American to meet the reclusive Kim -- said that he was “praying for his speedy recovery.” “I hope it’s just a rumor that Marshal Kim Jong-Un is sick,” Rodman told celebrity gossip site TMZ. “Hopefully I will find out more soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rejects-incorrect-reports-on-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-s-health/story-CEgXVwiNl59MtWpPCHbQfJ.html
