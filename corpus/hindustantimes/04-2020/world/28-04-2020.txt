This is no problem,” he said. “This is going to blow over.”The Washington Post reported Monday that Trump was repeatedly warned in his daily intelligence briefing in January and February -- a document the paper said he seldom reads -- that the virus posed a threat to the US“I would have to check,” Trump said of the report. “I want to look as to the exact dates of warnings.”Fauci said on NBC’s Today show on Feb. 29 that Americans didn’t need to change to change their daily routines yet to avoid infection, but warned that could change. The Trump administration endorsed social-distancing practices that have crippled the economy on March 16, after they had already been adopted by many businesses, state governments and ordinary Americans.A top CDC official, Nancy Messonnier, warned Feb. 25 that the agency expected “community spread” of the virus and that “disruption to everyday life might be severe.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-defends-covid-19-predictions-after-report-surfaces-that-us-ignored-warnings/story-PCDADCsGBJwzyVpvsDQnvM.html
28-04-2020||World||Nirav Modi remanded to custody, extradition trial from May 11||Fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi was on Tuesday again remanded to prison as British authorities confirmed that his extradition trial will begin as scheduled on May 11, unlike that of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, whose hearing has reportedly been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Modi, 49, who is wanted in India to face charges of major financial offences, including fraud, faces India’s second extradition request made recently on the basis of two new charges relating to ‘causing disappearance of evidence’ and intimidating witnesses.Assange is facing extradition to the United States to face charges of leading classified information.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed that Modi’s five-day trial would begin on May 11. Modi, who is lodged in the Wandsworth jail since his arrest in March last year, has been refused bail four times in the Westminster Magistrates Court and the high court.The second extradition request was certified by home secretary Priti Patel on February 20, the CPS said, adding that the two new charges are part of the case brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the multi-crore fraud case,Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, the first brought by CBI, and the second by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The CBI case relates to the fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding; the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.On the two new charges, CPS said: “The Government of India has issued this further extradition request…Put shortly, those offences relate to allegations that NDM (Nirav Deepak Modi) has interfered with the CBI investigation by ‘causing disappearance of evidence’ and intimidating witnesses (‘criminal intimidation to cause death’)”.It added that the hearing scheduled from May 11 will go ahead, but the two additional offences part of the CBI case will be dealt with at a separate later hearing, probably in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-remanded-to-custody-extradition-trial-from-may-11/story-hzBFFrrrojRjuz97MZgzdP.html
28-04-2020||World||US body recommends India be designated for religious freedom violations||A US commission mandated to monitor religious freedoms around the world on Tuesday recommended the Trump administration should add India to a list of countries seen by the US as systematic and egregious violators and sanction Indian government agencies and officials responsible for it.The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) cited the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which fast-tracks Indian citizenship for non-Muslim refugees fleeing persecution, and “nationwide campaigns of harassment and violence against religious minorities” as its reasons.In its 2020 annual report released Tuesday, the commission recommended that the US government (technically, the state government) should designate India a “Country of Particular Concern” (CPC), for “engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations”. India was on the commission’s for Tier 2 list of countries to be watched in 2019.This is the first time since 2004 that USCIRF recommends #India as a Country of Particular Concern #USCIRFAnnualReport2020The commission also recommended that the US government should impose targeted sanctions against Indian government agencies and officials responsible for religious freedom violations, freeze their assets in the United States and ban them from entering the country.It separately recommended to US congress to continue to hold hearings on the state of religious freedoms in India.It could not be immediately ascertained if the recommendation were binding and whether the Trump administration would indeed accept those meant for the the US government. It had ignored a previous recommendation by the commission in December to sanction Union home minister Amit Shah if the CAA was enacted.The Citizenship (Amendment) Act in #India "potentially exposes millions of Muslims to detention, deportation, and statelessness when the government completes its planned nationwide National Register of Citizens" USCIRF Vice Chair @nadinemaenza #USCIRFAnnualReport2020India had dismissed the USCIRF’s December recommendations as “guided only by its prejudices and biases” and has in the past denied its officials entry into the country.The commission held a hearing on India’s citizenship laws and changes and the state of religious freedom in March at which the CAA and a proposed National Register of Citizens had been criticized by expert witnesses as aimed as India’s Muslim minorities.USCIRF Chair @tperkins discusses #India saying "We are seeing impunity for violence by non-state actors committed against religious minorities." #USCIRFAnnualReport2020The commission recommended re-designating Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan as CPC and adding to it along with India, Nigeria, Russia, Syria, and Vietnam. It also sought for Cuba, Nicaragua, Sudan, and Uzbekistan to be kept on the next tier of special watch list and add 11 more: Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Central African Republic (CAR), Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-body-recommends-india-be-designated-for-religious-freedom-violations/story-3WZbbYfa22vBulTcPlXsaN.html

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government wants to provide financial assistance to producers of protective equipment and has ramped up its orders for PPE abroad. A German military plane brought 10 million medical masks from China on Monday.The Finance Ministry has made available an additional 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) for medical protection gear to help hospitals and doctors contain the spread of the coronavirus.German states have made wearing a mask compulsory on public transport and in shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-doctors-pose-naked-online-to-protest-lack-of-ppe/story-LcjrKLtEmh0SKjBhUYS0CO.html

The meeting also discussed a host of measures, ranging from healthcare to trade and financial sustainability, which could be part of a common approach to fight the pandemic.The New Development Bank (NDB), established by Brics to mobilise resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects, will allocate up to $15 billion for loans to help the member states boost their economies amid the pandemic, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said.“We decided to set up a special loan instrument to finance projects for the economic rebuilding of Brics countries. In total, we decided to allocate up to $15 billion to this, and we believe this can be a very good foundation at the stage our economies leave the crisis behind to restore economic activities,” he told a news briefing after the video conference.The meeting, Lavrov said, discussed a “huge set of measures”, including cooperation in healthcare, trade, financial sustainability and employment, as part of a coordinated approach to the Covid-19 crisis. Further discussions on these issues will be held during upcoming sectoral meetings of the five countries, he added.A virtual meeting of economic experts of Brics states is expected to be held on Wednesday, and healthcare experts are expected to hold a similar meeting on May 7.Russia’s finance minister Anton Siluanov and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman were elected chairperson and vice-chairperson of the NDB’s board of governors during a virtual meeting on April 22. That meeting also the discussed the creation of an “emergency assistance facility” of $15 billion to meet emergency needs of Brics states. The NDB said it plans to earmark $10 billion for crisis-related assistance, including support for the economic recovery of Brics states.Addressing Tuesday’s meeting, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said the challenge posed by Covid-19 “underlines all the more the need for reform of multilateral systems and that reformed multilateralism was the way forward”, according to a statement from the external affairs ministry.Brics, which accounts for almost 42% of the global population and has a substantial share of investment and trade, has an “important role to play in shaping the global economic and political architecture”, he said.Jaishankar said the pandemic had severely impacted the global economy and output by disrupting trade and supply chains, and this had led to loss of jobs and livelihoods. “We need to provide support to businesses, especially MSMEs, to tide over the crisis and ensure livelihoods are not lost,” he said.He spoke of India’s efforts to coordinate the response to Covid-19 in South Asia, including the creation of the Saarc Emergency Fund. India is also providing pharmaceutical aid to nearly 85 countries, including many in Africa, as grants.Lavrov also said there was no alternative to a multilateral approach to combating challenges such as Covid-19 and that multilateral institutions were facing a test. The Brics states, he said, will deepen cooperation at global platforms such as the UN, G20, WHO, WTO and IMF.The world community should unite to “ensure the most positive outcome of our efforts for our countries and our citizens”, Lavrov said. These efforts were being undermined by unilateral sanctions imposed on some countries, he added.“We support the plea of the UN Secretary General and the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights to at least suspend, and at best lift, these unilateral sanctions, imposed by bypassing the UN Charter,” he said.Asked about the US administration’s decision to cut funding for the WHO, Lavrov said the “common opinion” of Brics states is that UN’s health body is an “important instrument and a unique platform” that has the best professionals from around the world.Besides Jaishankar and Lavrov, Brazil’s foreign minister Ernesto Araújo, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, and South Africa’s foreign minister Grace Naledi Pandor joined the video conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brics-states-to-create-15-billion-fund-to-aid-rebuild-covid-battered-economies/story-Vs8ojOLpIQuQcnpRIxY0gP.html

28-04-2020||World||Multiple US intelligence alerts on Covid-19 went unheeded: Report||US intelligence agencies raised alarm about coronavirus in classified briefing material prepared for President Donald Trump with increasing frequency over January and February, a period that is seen as a squandered opportunity to aggressively prepare the country for the epidemic.The warnings came in more than a dozen of briefing papers called the President Daily Brief, the Washington Post reported Monday, adding to a growing body of news accounts and reports of the botched and delayed response of the Trump administration to the epidemic.The first mention of the virus in the PBD came in early January.According to the report, by Tuesday morning, four months after, it had killed 52,256 — 1,378 in just the past 24 hours — and infected 988,490, up by 22,412 over the previous day.These intelligence alerts, the newspaper reported, failed to register on the President who tends to skip the daily briefings and does not pay much attention to the oral summaries he prefers two or three times a week.The first major action taken by the Trump administration to fight the outbreak came in late-January with a ban on travelers from China, except US citizens. But the administration did do much for all of February, a period of squandered opportunity to beef up essential medical supplies, protective equipment and begin social-distancing and other mitigation efforts.The president continued to play down the gravity of the crisis. “It’s like a miracle, it will disappear,” he said February 26. “Just stay calm. It will go away,” he said on March 10, the day before the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic, as the Post report noted as an instance of the president’s failure to grasp the seriousness of the situation.The president has insisted, however, that there was no delay in his response to the crisis and has cited the January travel ban as the highlight of his administration’s response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multiple-us-intelligence-alerts-on-covid-19-went-unheeded-report/story-vkOjgQkNl5XRYHqDUyVaiJ.html
28-04-2020||World||North Korean defectors unable to shed light on Kim Jong Un’s health||Defectors from North Korea say many of their relatives and contacts were unaware of the international speculation over leader Kim Jong Un’s health or were unwilling to discuss the issue in clandestine calls made from the South.Two defectors told Reuters their relatives in North Korea did not know that Kim has been missing from public view for almost two weeks, said they didn’t want to discuss the issue, or abruptly hung up when the supreme leader was mentioned.Kim’s health is a state secret in insular North Korea and speculation about him or his family can invite swift retribution.Another defector said some people in the North have nevertheless been privately talking of Kim’s whereabouts after he failed to appear at a key state holiday on April 15, but only in very closed circles.Kim’s absence from public ceremonies on the birth anniversary of his grandfather and founder of the country, Kim Il Sung, was unprecedented. That has led to days of speculation in the international community over his health and whether the nuclear-capable state was headed toward instability.“I talked to my sister and my niece this morning and they had no clue about these reports and rumours about Kim Jong Un’s health,” Lee Soon-hee, 59, told Reuters on Monday. “When I told them, they were so cautious about discussing it. North Koreans have a very limited knowledge of these things.”Also Read: South Korea’s ministers say they know North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s locationLee defected to the South in 2009.South Korean officials say they have not detected any “unusual movements” in North Korea, and one foreign resident living in Pyongyang told Reuters that life appeared to be going on as usual.The South Korean minister in charge of North Korean affairs said on Tuesday fear of catching the coronavirus could have kept Kim away from the April 15 state ceremonies. Kim Heung-kwang, who defected to South Korea in 2004 and now runs an academic group that researches North Korea, said he spoke to two contacts in North Korea about the speculation.Also Read: Where is North Korea’s Kim Jong Un? Here’s what is possibleOne, a government official, said that he had been wondering about Kim Jong Un’s lack of public appearances and had noticed an increase in calls from security officials to stay focused on internal policies, Kim Heung-kwang told Reuters.Another person was not aware of the reports and warned him “not to be fooled by such lies,” Kim said. Lim Hee-joo, a defector who runs a restaurant in Seoul, said almost no one in North Korea had any idea about Kim Jong Un’s health or whereabouts.“Not even the people in the central party,” she said. “They are so scared that they don’t even think of looking into it or think about it, to begin with, as they fear they might get arrested.” North Koreans are keenly aware they could face punishment for discussing the Kim family in any way except to shower them with glowing praise, said Sokeel Park, of Liberty in North Korea, a group that works with defectors.“That doesn’t mean people don’t take that risk, some people do,” Park said. “But it’s still a super sensitive issue.”“It’s a little like the pope not showing up for Christmas.” he said of Kim’s absence from the April 15 celebrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korean-defectors-unable-to-shed-light-on-kim-jong-un-s-health/story-DKqS29zrRvvjPsSH2f3U2N.html
28-04-2020||World||Sharma, Arora, Rathod, Riyat: UK mourns Covid-19 deaths||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday led the United Kingdom for a minute’s silence to remember the hundreds of doctors, nurses, carers and other key workers who died of Covid-19, many of them of Indian origin and other non-white individuals.As mass circulation tabloids and mainstream news media highlight the disproportionate number of deaths of non-white people, mostly immigrants and their descendants, there are indications that their contribution to British society is being more widely recognised.A sombre looking Johnson – who had a brush with death after being hospitalised with virus infection – stood in silence at the cabinet table in Downing Street, flanked by chancellor Rishi Sunak and cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill.It is a reflection of tens of thousands of Indian doctors and health care professionals arriving in the UK over recent decades and taking up key jobs in the National Health Service that the dead include several professionals from the 1.5 million strong Indian community.Medical staff of Indian heritage who passed away include Jitendra Kumar Rathod, Manjeet Singh Riyat, Krishan Arora, Rajesh Kalraiya, Pooja Sharma, Jayesh Patel, Vivek Sharma, Kamlesh Kumar Masson, Amarante Dias, Sophie Fagan, Hamza Pacheeri and Amrik Bamotra.Health secretary Matt Hancock on Monday announced a 60,000-pound compensation scheme for the family of health workers who pass away after being infected by the virus. The Home Office has announced a free year-long extension of visa of Indian and other non-EU such workersHancock said: “Nothing can make up for the tragic loss of a loved one during this pandemic. We owe a huge debt to those who die in service to our nation and are doing everything we can to protect them”.“Financial worries should be the last thing on the minds of their families so in recognition of these unprecedented circumstances we are expanding financial protection to NHS and social care workers delivering publicly funded care on the frontline”.Home secretary Priti Patel said the controversial immigration health surcharge, which is also applicable to doctors and other health professionals coming to the UK and is payable at the time of applying for the visa, is under review, following demands that it be scrapped.The surcharge, which is due to be increased from £400 to £624 per year per person in an immigrant’s family, has come in for much criticism from stake-holders, including organisations such as the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sharma-arora-rathod-riyat-uk-mourns-covid-19-deaths/story-tAeFQdnfOFTdYYS1WyeWyN.html
28-04-2020||World||Bernie Sanders assails New York’s decision to cancel its primary||New York canceled its June 23 presidential primary in response to the coronavirus pandemic, citing a state law that permits the vote to be called off if the races are uncontested.Bernie Sanders’s campaign said the decision was an “outrage,” and called upon the Democratic National Committee to reverse it.Sixteen states and one territory have postponed votes or moved to mail-only ballots, but New York is the first state to cancel its primary altogether. It was initially slated to hold the vote on April 28 but that was postponed until June by Governor Andrew Cuomo in late March. State election officials said they decided to call off the election to protect public health and because Joe Biden was unopposed for the Democratic nomination after Sanders’s withdrawal from the race earlier this month.Sanders has endorsed Biden, but wants to stay on the ballot in the remaining primaries to rack up delegates for influence at the convention.“Today’s decision by the state of New York Board of Elections is an outrage, a blow to American democracy, and must be overturned by the DNC,” Sanders campaign adviser Jeff Weaver said in a statement. “Just last week, Vice President Biden warned the American people that President Trump could use the current crisis as an excuse to postpone the November election. Well, he now has a precedent thanks to New York state.”Weaver added that the decision was not requested by either campaign or the DNC and demanded that New York switch to vote by mail instead.“New York has clearly violated its approved delegate selection plan. If this is not remedied, New York should lose all its delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention and there should be a broader review by the Democratic Party of New York’s checkered pattern of voter disenfranchisement,” Weaver said.New York state sends 320 delegates to the Democratic nominating convention.David Bergstein, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said New York’s allocation of delegates would need to be approved by the party.“Any substantive change to a state’s first determining step in allocating delegates like this one will need to be reviewed by the DNC’s Rules and By-Laws Committee,” Bergstein said. “Once the state party submits an updated selection plan on how they plan on allocating delegates, the committee will look at that plan and make a determination.”New York Board of Elections Commissioner Andrew Spano, a Democrat, said he had concluded there was no point in moving forward with the primary “just for the purposes of issues at a convention.”Board of Elections Co-Chair Douglas Kellner, also a Democrat, said that Sanders’s withdrawal from the race and his endorsement “effectively ended the real contest” for the nomination. “What the Sanders supporters want is essentially a beauty contest that, given the situation with the public health emergency that exists now, seems to be unnecessary and indeed frivolous,” Kellner said.New York has been the state hardest hit in the US by Covid-19 with 288,045 confirmed cases as of Monday and 22,376 deaths -- triple that of New Jersey, the state which has had the second biggest number of fatalities and cases.At least 10 people in Wisconsin contracted the virus after voting in the state’s primary election earlier this month that was held despite attempts to postpone it by the governor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bernie-sanders-assails-new-york-s-decision-to-cancel-its-primary/story-3GBTdz6XxavtQClw7QQ8NN.html
28-04-2020||World||Over 200,000 H-1B workers could lose legal status by June||Manasi Vasavada has less than three weeks left before she loses her legal right to be in the country. The dental practice in Passaic County, New Jersey, where Vasavada, 31, has worked for almost two years closed its doors in mid-March due to Covid-19. She has been on an unpaid leave of absence ever since.  Vasavada is in the country on an H-1B visa, a temporary visa program designed for people with specialized skills. H-1B recipients can only remain in the country legally for 60 days without being paid. Her husband Nandan Buch, also a dentist, is in the country on an H-1B visa that expires in June. They have been watching the days tick by with growing fear.There may soon come a point when the couple can’t stay and can’t go: India, their home country, has closed its borders indefinitely. They also have a combined $520,000 in student loans from the advanced dental degrees they completed at US universities, which would be nearly impossible to pay back on the salaries they would earn in India. The stress has caused Buch, also 31, to start losing his hair. Neither of them is sleeping well. “Everything is really confusing and dark right now,” said Vasavada. “We don’t know where we will end up.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAs many as 250,000 guest workers seeking a green card in the US—about 200,000 of them on H-1B visas—could lose their legal status by the end of June, according to Jeremy Neufeld, an immigration policy analyst with the Washington D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. Thousands more who are not seeking resident status may also be forced to return home, he said. About three-quarters of H-1B visas go to people working in the technology industry, though the exact levels vary year by year. Tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs in the last two months, but workers on visas are vulnerable in ways native-born workers aren’t. H-1B visas, for instance, are tied to a specific location and employer who commits to paying the recipient a minimum salary. Furloughing recipients, reducing their wages, and in some cases allowing them to work from home violates visa requirements. H-1B workers who are terminated have 60-days to find another job, transfer to a different visa or leave the country. Even if they don’t lose their jobs, workers can find themselves in a dilemma if they can’t get their visas renewed during this period of disruption.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe visa crisis is causing “a catastrophe at a human level and an economic level,” said Doug Rand, who worked on technology and immigration policy in the Obama administration before co-founding Boundless Immigration Inc., a company that helps people navigate the immigration system. H-1B workers often have families who also rely on their jobs for authorization to stay in the country, including children who may have spent their entire lives in the US “It’s just a mess,” Rand said. In a letter sent to the State and Homeland Security departments on April 17, TechNet, a lobbying group whose members include Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, joined a coalition of trade groups calling for relief for foreign-born workers. The letter requested a delay in work authorization expiration dates until at least Sept. 10. “Without action, these issues will lead to hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs and have profound negative economic effects,” the letter read.The tech industry is crucial to supporting offices working remotely, helping doctors provide telehealth services and keeping students learning at home, said Alex Burgos, senior vice president of federal policy and government relations at TechNet. ‘We’ve seen the administration extend tax filing deadlines,” he said, and similar flexibility in visa programs makes sense “because no one here is at fault in any way.”The Trump administration has not responded to the letter. A US Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson declined to say if the agency would extend visa deadlines but said it may provide special support for people affected by circumstances beyond their control when requested. The administration has taken a consistently hard-line stance on immigration and foreign-born workers. The number of non-immigrant visas issued in 2019 declined for the fourth consecutive year, to 8.7 million from 10.9 million in 2015, according to the State Department. Last month, the department closed embassies and consulate operations with little guidance to those who risk falling into illegal status. In-person services at US Citizenship and Immigration Services, a unit of the Department of Homeland Security, have been suspended since March 18 and won’t resume until June 4 at the earliest, a 78-day gap in service. On April 20, President Donald Trump tweeted that he planned a temporary ban on all immigration to protect American jobs; the following day he announced an executive order blocking most people coming from outside the US from receiving green cards for 60 days. This raised the threat of further disruptions for companies who employ many foreign-born workers. On the day the president announced his executive order, Luis von Ahn, co-founder and chief executive of the language-learning startup Duolingo Inc., posted a message on Twitter saying a green card ban would force the company to move jobs abroad. Von Ahn is an immigrant from Guatemala, and one-fifth of Duolingo’s 250-person staff are on H-1Bs or other visas. The company plans to boost staff by 50% to keep up with a spike in usage that corresponds with the pandemic. “We have definitely felt the practical impact of processing delays,” said Duolingo spokesman Sam Dalsimer. ‘There’s also a psychological impact on employees whose futures and abilities to remain here are even more uncertain than ever.’ In one case, Duolingo has been trying to hire an engineer who was recently let go from another tech company. The worker is in the US on an O-1 visa, which is designated for individuals with extraordinary ability. Now with added pandemic delays, Duolingo estimates he’ll have to wait 6 to 9 months for his visa and work authorization. In the meantime, he can’t work for the company or leave the USThe companies facing the hardest decisions, though, are those reducing staff in response to the pandemic. Some are choosing to furlough US-born workers and fire foreign employees whose visas require them to be paid. Others are choosing to keep H-1B workers on staff to maintain their legal status, while firing US workers. There’s risk in either approach, because employers who treat workers differently based on their immigration status expose themselves to potential discrimination lawsuits, according to immigration and employment lawyer Rebecca Bernhard, partner at Dorsey & Whitney LLP. For some workers, a stable future in the US suddenly seems distant. Shawn Noronha, a 23-year-old Australian living in San Francisco, was let go from his job at a fintech startup, in January. He found a new position with an enterprise software startup willing to sponsor his visa. But before he could get to an Australian consulate to update his paperwork Covid-19 hit. Noronha changed his status from a working visa to a tourist visa, which gives him until the end of June to stay in the US He is spending his free time baking, taking walks and learning Python, a programming language. But without a regular paycheck he’s eating into his savings. The recent tweets from President Trump about tightening restrictions on immigration have him questioning his choice to migrate to the US ‘It’s made me think, have I made the right choice?” said Noronha. “Should I just go back home and maybe chase the American dream later on in life?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-200-000-h-1b-workers-could-lose-legal-status-by-june/story-Xmfoatk8Y2n1LKlVqF8i1N.html
28-04-2020||World||New Zealand tames virus; France, Spain reveal lockdown exits||France and Spain, two of the worst-hit countries in the coronavirus pandemic, were laying out separate roadmaps Tuesday for lifting their lockdowns, while signs emerged that the virus has been all but vanquished in New Zealand and Australia.But on the other side of the globe, Brazil was emerging as a new hotspot for infections. And new doubts were raised over whether Japan would be able to host the already postponed Summer Olympics next year without the development of a vaccine.The key question of when to reopen schools loomed around the world as nations seek to restart their battered economies.Although the coronavirus seems to affect children far less seriously than adults, many officials, teachers and parents are concerned about the health risks that school openings could pose. Some point to the difficulties of ensuring that children stick to social distancing and frequent hand washing, and to the health risks for teachers.But many parents would struggle to return to work without schools being open, hampering efforts to counter the world’s deep economic tailspin.In France, President Emmanuel Macron wants schools to start reopening May 11, but teachers, parents and some mayors are raising alarms. The government says parents can decide whether to send their children back to class and is releasing more details later Tuesday.Joel Wilmotte is among a growing number of French mayors refusing to re-open their schools, at least for now.“I am not against the reopening of schools,” he said on the Facebook page of his northern town of Hautmont.But he listed seven reasons why he’s not ready to do so, including ill-equipped teachers and cleaning staff and a poll that suggests that most French parents oppose school reopenings. So he’s keeping his town’s six schools closed “until further notice.”Greece, which has managed to keep its coronavirus death toll low at 136 people, was also releasing more details Tuesday about easing its lockdown but schools remained a tricky topic.Schools will be reopened “gradually, with conditions” and subject to constant review, said the Health Ministry’s coronavirus spokesman, infectious diseases specialist Sotiris Tsiodras. No opening date has yet been set.Scientists agree children are less at risk from the virus and appear to transmit it less than adults, said Tsiodras.Hard-hit Italy, however, is keeping schools closed until September. That is putting parents in the difficult position of returning to work without access to their typical fallback babysitters: grandparents, who are now considered off-limits because they are the most vulnerable to the virus.Emer McCarthy, who works in the Vatican’s child protection office, tweeted that Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte had addressed a lockdown exit “for everyone except Italy’s children. Incredible. No mention of schools, childcare options, nothing. But football yes. #ChildrenNotSeenNotHeard.”In China, where the pandemic began, schools began opening on Monday, but only to seniors at middle and high school levels preparing for exams. Class sizes were cut to no more than 30.China’s daily number of new cases has fallen into the single digits, but authorities remain vigilant over the possibility of a second wave of infections.In the United States, which has the world’s highest death toll at more than 56,000, President Donald Trump said states should “seriously consider” reopening their public schools before the end of the academic year, even though dozens already have said it would be unsafe for students to return until the summer or the fall.“Some of you might start thinking about school openings, because a lot of people are wanting to have the school openings,” Trump said. “ Young children have done very well in this disaster.”Trump also admitted the number of virus deaths could reach 70,000 in the U.S., after citing 60,000 several times this month.The number of confirmed infections worldwide has risen to over 3 million and the confirmed death toll has topped 211,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true toll of the pandemic is likely much higher because of limited testing, mild cases that are missed, flaws in counting the dead and governments that may be trying to conceal the extent of their outbreaks.Italy, Spain, France and Britain accounted for more than 21,000 virus-related deaths each.In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has insisted COVID-19 is just a “little flu” and claimed there is no need for the type of restrictions that have slowed the infection’s spread elsewhere.Brazil, Latin America’s most populous country with 211 million people, has reported 4,600 deaths and 67,000 confirmed infections. But the true numbers are believed to be vastly higher given the lack of testing and the many people who haven’t sought hospital care.Medical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major Brazilian cities have warned t hat their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse or are too overwhelmed to take any more patients. There are also signs that a growing number of Brazilian victims are dying at home.“We have all the conditions here for the pandemic to become much more serious,” said Paulo Brandão, a virologist at the University of Sao Paulo.Bolsonaro says Brazilians need to resume their lives to prevent an economic meltdown but most state governors have adopted restrictions to keep people home and slow the virus’s spread.New Zealand, on the other hand, reported just three new infections Tuesday. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said people had done an incredible job of breaking the chain of virus transmission but cautioned they needed to remain vigilant.“There may still be some smoldering ashes out there, and they have the potential to become a wildfire again, if we give them the chance,” she said, quoting a microbiologist.Her government loosened its lockdown, which had shuttered schools and most businesses. Surfers hit the waves at dawn Tuesday, builders returned to construction sites and baristas fired up espresso machines.In Australia, hundreds returned to the water after Sydney’s iconic Bondi Beach reopened to swimmers and surfers. Still, people can only use the beach during daylight, cannot linger and are limited to ensure social distancing. Australia has reported only 83 virus deaths, less than the tolls reported by over 25 U.S. states.But the virus is still a long-term foe. The president of the Japan Medical Association, Yoshitake Yokokura, said he thinks it will be difficult to hold the rescheduled Tokyo Summer Olympics even in 2021 without an effective coronavirus vaccine.Japan and the International Olympic Committee agreed to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Games until July 2021 due to the pandemic. Japan is under a monthlong state of emergency amid a rapid increase of infections and medical workers say hospitals are overburdened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-tames-virus-france-spain-reveal-lockdown-exits/story-Bjf8fI2mDra5QODEiRJdKP.html
28-04-2020||World||The coronavirus pandemic is accelerating coal’s demise||You can add coal to the list of global commodities struggling during the pandemic. Prices haven’t yet turned negative (like oil), but coronavirus is accelerating the demise of the dirtiest fossil fuel.Social distancing measures mean energy demand has fallen across the board. Some of the smallest declines, however, are in the electricity sector. That should have been good news for coal. But it hasn’t turned out that way.In much of the world coal power is currently more expensive than gas and renewables, which explains why its share in the electricity mix has fallen in Europe, India, China, and parts of the U.S. The power markets in these four regions are large and varied. That makes the uniformity of coal’s decline even more surprising.But perhaps it shouldn’t be. Policymakers and activists have spent years trying to reveal the true costs of coal’s environmental impacts, with the aim of making the fuel economically less attractive. Nearly half the world’s coal power plants are now running at a loss, according to the think tank Carbon Tracker. Europe is a prime example of how to manage coal’s exit systematically. In the past two weeks, Austria and Sweden announced that they have shut their last coal-fired power plants. They’ve now joined Albania, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Norway as countries without coal in their electricity mix. Today, the U.K.’s grid operator posted a new record—nearly 19 continuous days—of not using coal for electricity.Kathrin Gutmann, campaign director for Europe Beyond Coal, walked me through the lessons Europe can teach the world. At a federal level, three policies have proven to be most effective: pollution regulation on power plants to lower emissions of sulfur, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter (coal produces more of all these than gas); a tax or price on carbon dioxide emissions (coal emits double the carbon per unit of energy compared to gas); and mandates to increase the share of renewables in the electricity mix.But that’s not enough. Difficulties at the local level also need to be addressed. Unlike solar and wind, coal power can be turned on and off when needed. That means grid operators need to figure out alternatives for when the use of coal ends—be it converting the power plants to using gas, installing batteries, or finding ways of importing clean electricity from other regions whenever needed.The local challenges are bigger for countries and regions that mine coal and provide well-paying jobs for thousands of people. The end has to come with a plan to transition coal-dependent livelihoods. For instance, Germany is looking at a package worth $55 billion as compensation for regions and companies that rely on coal. Similarly, the European Union is working on a “just transition fund” that could invest as much as $111 billion in even more coal-reliant countries like Poland.Two further policies are needed to ensure that coal’s demise doesn’t just happen but comes fast enough. First, deadlines to phase out coal need to based on climate science. France, Sweden, Slovakia, Portugal, U.K., Ireland and Italy plan on exiting coal by 2025, which is in line with the science.Not everyone is getting it right. Germany plans to exit coal by 2038, which is too late for meeting Paris climate agreement goals, said Gutmann. Even 2030, the phase-out date of choice for the Netherlands, is likely the latest possible date for a European country if global warming is to be kept under 1.5 degrees Celsius.Second, setting those deadlines in stone through some form of legislation goes a long way to ensure that short-term political thinking doesn’t get in the way. The U.K. and France have been praised for setting regulation goals tied to emissions efficiency, which leaves coal power with few loopholes.If nothing else works, be prepared to get sued. Environmental group Urgenda won a case against the Dutch government, forcing the country to cut its 2020 emissions by 25% compared to 1990 levels. On Friday, the government announced it will curtail coal power plants to meet those goals.After years of tinkering, there are now many strategies to end the dominance of coal for good. The job has become easier because technological forces have made alternatives cheaper. Coal’s end is inevitable, and it may happen sooner than many think.Akshat Rathi writes the Net Zero newsletter on the intersection of climate science and emission-free tech.

28-04-2020||World||Arthritis drug shows ‘significant’ promise in severe Covid-19 cases: Study||The arthritis drug tocilizumab has shown early promise in preventing extreme inflammation in gravely ill COVID-19 patients, according to a French clinical study.The treatment, which suppresses the body’s natural immune response, was found to reduce “significantly” the number of deaths or life support interventions compared with a control group of patients.The study, carried out by the Paris university hospital trust (AP-HP), looked at 129 people hospitalised with moderate or severe viral pneumonia, which occurs in 5-10 percent of Covid-19 patients.Half received two injections of tocilizumab as well as standard treatment with antibiotics, while the control group received only standard treatment.While the results are yet to be published, those involved in the research said it showed clear “clinical benefit” of tocilizumab treatment.AP-HP said it had decided to publicise the study before publishing official results “for public health reasons”.They stressed however that further research was needed on the effectiveness of the drug and the potential for side effects.Tocilizumab, sold under the brand names Actemra and RoAcemtra, is commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It is a lab-synthesised antibody that inhibits against a specific protein receptor involved in the body’s natural immune response. Researchers believe the drug might be able to stave off a state of heightened immune response known as cytokine storms -- where the body’s reaction to a foreign body such as a disease or chemical creates acute inflammation. Cytokine storms can be deadly and occur in severely ill Covid-19 patients.Tocilizumab currently costs around 800 euros ($870) per injection.Several existing drugs, including anti-viral medicines, are currently being trialled worldwide for Covid-19 treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arthritis-drug-shows-significant-promise-in-severe-covid-19-cases-study/story-JKjGFXhqL2aIWKU0SSlK5K.html
28-04-2020||World||Iraq officials say IS targets intelligence bureau; 3 wounded||A militant wearing a suicide vest struck an intelligence bureau in northern Iraq on Tuesday, wounding at least three members of the security personnel, Iraqi officials said, blaming the attack on the Islamic State group.Iraqi security forces had spotted two men, one wearing an explosive vest and a driver, approaching the gate of the Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism Directorate in the Qadisiyah neighborhood in the northern city of Kirkuk, a security official said.The man hurled a grenade and then detonated his explosives vest before entering the premises, the official said. The other man, apparently the driver, sped away from the the scene.There was no claim of responsibility by the Islamic State group, which was largely defeated in Iraq in 2017 but still maintains sleeper cells to target Iraqi forces. Suicide bombings were a hallmark of the militant group, which at the height of its power in 2014 controlled nearly a third of both Iraq and Syria.A senior Iraqi intelligence official told The Associated Press that the department “had knowledge that Daesh would carry out a suicide operation against the Intelligence Directorate, but we did not know on which day.”Daesh is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. Both the security official and the senior intelligence official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.The attack was the first attempted suicide bombing in recent months, coming amid minor IS attacks in the provinces of Kirkuk, Diyala and Salahaddin. The provinces’ rugged terrain is difficult to police and a territorial dispute between the federal government in Baghdad and Iraq’s semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region has led to security gaps in the area.The US-led coalition recently withdrew troops from its bases in the region, including in Kirkuk, in line with a planned drawdown of forces that would reduce the coalition’s presence to bases in Baghdad and the western Anbar province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-officials-say-is-targets-intelligence-bureau-3-wounded/story-VfapZikVJU68Yduo5X7QgM.html
28-04-2020||World||South Korea says Kim Jong Un may be trying to avoid coronavirus||Fear of catching the coronavirus could have kept North Korean leader Kim Jong Un away from state ceremonies for a key holiday in mid-April, a South Korean minister said on Tuesday as speculation swirled over Kim’s whereabouts and health.The speculation erupted following Kim’s unprecedented absence from public ceremonies on the April 15 birth anniversary of his grandfather and founder of the country, Kim Il Sung.Kim has not been seen in public since.The last time official media in the secretive North Korean state reported on Kim’s whereabouts was when he presided over a meeting on April 11, but there have been near-daily reports of him sending letters and diplomatic messages. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicSouth Korean officials emphasise they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea and have cautioned against reports that Kim may be ill.North Korea has said it has no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but given the fact that the country has taken stringent steps to head off an outbreak, Kim’s absence from the ceremonies is not particularly unusual, Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees North Korea engagement, told lawmakers.“It is true that he had never missed the anniversary for Kim Il Sung’s birthday since he took power, but many anniversary events including celebrations and a banquet had been cancelled because of coronavirus concerns,” the minister said at a parliamentary hearing.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakHe said there were at least two instances since mid-January where Kim Jong Un was out of sight for nearly 20 days. “I don’t think that’s particularly unusual given the current (coronavirus) situation.”The unification minister described reports that Kim had undergone a heart procedure, and that a Chinese medical team had travelled to North Korea, as “fake news.”Also Read: Not just Kim Jong Un: A look at past disappearances of North Korean leaders, officialsCiting three people familiar with the situation, Reuters reported on Saturday that China had dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on Kim Jong Un, though it was unclear what the trip signalled in terms of Kim’s health.U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he has a good idea how Kim Jong Un is doing and hopes he is fine, but would not elaborate.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he was aware of reports on Kim’s health and he was paying close attention to developments.Also Read: South Korea’s ministers say they know North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s locationNorth Korea had cancelled some large events, and imposed a border lockdown and quarantine measures in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus.But if Kim Jong Un is hiding out due to fears surrounding COVID-19, it would “puncture a hole in the state media narrative of how this crisis has been perfectly managed”, said Chad O’Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea.“If he is merely trying to avoid infection, it should theoretically be very easy to release photos or videos of a healthy-looking Kim,” he said.SIGNS OF LIFEAn authoritative source familiar with U.S. intelligence reporting said on Monday it was entirely possible Kim had disappeared from public view to avoid exposure to COVID-19 and the sighting of his presidential train in the coastal resort area of Wonsan did suggest he may be there or have been there recently.But the source said that since there was no authoritative backing for such a conclusion, U.S. agencies were also still considering the possibility Kim might be ill, even seriously.38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, said on Saturday that satellite images from last week showed a special train that was probably Kim’s at Wonsan, lending weight to reports he had been spending time in the resort area.Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean diplomat who defected to South Korea in 2016, said that the train could be a deception tactic used by North Korea to mask Kim’s movements.“North Korea always perceives that U.S. spy satellites are monitoring the North and is prepared for it,” he said in a post on Facebook.North Korean media reports suggest that Kim is still carrying out his duties, Unification minister Kim said, although some experts say they are not necessarily conclusive.“I agree with the South Korean government’s assessment that there is no reason to think Kim Jong Un is not performing his duties,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former North Korea open source intelligence analyst for the U.S. government. “That said, I would not read too much into letters signed by Kim Jong Un. I would guess that most of them are not written by him anyway.” (Reporting by Hyonhee Shin and Josh Smith; Additional reporting by Sangmi Cha in Seoul, and Mark Hosenball in Washington; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan & Simon Cameron-Moore)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-says-kim-jong-un-may-be-trying-to-avoid-coronavirus/story-Jtg1EgIbPoVEAYeqfHYvkK.html
28-04-2020||World||Extensive contact tracing, isolation key to control Covid-19 spread: Report||Extensive contract tracing, isolating cases, and testing may reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, and favour control of the Covid-19 outbreak, suggests a study carried out in China. However, the researchers from the Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, China, caution that the impact of contact tracing to rapidly isolate people who could be infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) depends on identifying asymptomatic cases. Published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, the study of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts found that contact tracing reduced the length of time people were infectious in the community over 4 weeks in Shenzhen, China. According to results from In Shenzhen, authorities identified whom to isolate based on their contact with confirmed cases, as well as isolating people who already had symptoms, the researchers said. The new study found that contact tracing increased the speed at which new cases were confirmed by 2 days -- an average of 5.5 days initially, reduced to 3.2 with contact tracing. It also reduced the amount of time it took to isolate infected people by 2 days -- from an average of 4.6 days down to 2.7. There were only three deaths in the study group during the study period, the researchers said. “The experience of Covid-19 in the city of Shenzhen may demonstrate the huge scale of testing and contact tracing that’s needed to reduce the virus spreading,” said Ting Ma from the Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhe “Some of the strict control measures enforced here, such as isolating people outside their homes, might be unlikely to be replicated elsewhere, but we urge governments to consider our findings in the global response to Covid-19,” said Ma. To achieve similar results, the researchers noted that other countries might be able to combine near-universal testing and intensive contact tracing with social distancing and partial lockdowns. “Although no lockdown measures were introduced in Shenzhen until the end of our study period, Wuhan’s lockdown could have significantly restricted the spread of coronavirus to Shenzhen,” Ma said. For the current study, the researchers analysed data from 391 people diagnosed with Covid-19 after they showed symptoms, and 1,286 of their close contacts. The contacts were tested irrespective of whether they had symptoms in order to identify infected people who were asymptomatic. The data gave insights into the type of contact most likely to lead to transmission. Close contacts were defined as people who shared a household with infected patients up to 2 days before they started showing symptoms, or interacted with them socially by travelling or eating together. For people who were isolated because they showed symptoms of Covid-19, it took an average of 4.6 days for them to be isolated following the first signs of infection. Contact tracing reduced this to an average of 2.7 days, the researchers found. For people diagnosed with Covid-19 after being contact traced and tested (87 people), a fifth (17 out of 87 people) had not yet developed any symptoms, and 30 per cent (25 out of 87) did not have a fever, they said. The length of time for which a person remains infectious is not yet known, but reducing the amount of time that infected people interacted with others appears to have helped reduce the virus spreading, the researchers said. The researchers highlight several limitations to their study, including that it is impossible to trace every potential contact an individual has. Contact tracing therefore focuses on close contacts who are most likely to be infected. They note that some infected travellers to Shenzhen could have been missed if they were only tested due to symptoms such as a fever. Their contacts might also have been missed if they were asymptomatic, because the PCR test is not sensitive enough to pick up every case, according to the researchers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extensive-contact-tracing-isolation-key-to-control-covid-19-spread-report/story-VWp2QQt10k3wZMc3NOqULP.html
28-04-2020||World||USD 90 billion could protect 700 million poor in Covid-19 pandemic: UN||The UN humanitarian chief said Monday that USD 90 billion could provide income support, food and a health response to the coronavirus pandemic for 700 million of the world’s most vulnerable people — a price tag just 1 per cent of the USD 8 trillion stimulus package the 20 richest countries put in place to safeguard the global economy.Mark Lowcock told a video briefing most experts agree that the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t reached the poorest parts of the world, but may peak in the next three to six months.He said about 700 million people — 10 per cent of the world’s population — are most vulnerable and concentrated in about 30 to 40 countries which already receive humanitarian assistance and will see a big drop in incomes as the virus spreads and governments impose restrictive measures and lock downs.“If you wanted to protect them against that drop in income, then probably for about USD 60 billion you could do that,” Lowcock said.And for something like USD 30 billion, he said, people facing the threat of starvation can get food, and the health response to Covid-19 can be financed.Lowcock said probably two-thirds of the USD 90 billion could come from international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.“They would need to change the terms on which they provide assistance to some people,” he said.“So, for example, they would need to reduce interest rates and provide some debt relief. But they have the firepower if they were given a bit more subsidy to probably meet about two-thirds of the costs.” Lowcock said the remaining one-third could be financed by a one-time increase in government development assistance.He said the argument he’s making is that a one-off 20 per cent increase “will save you having to deal with a 10-year problem.” “USD 90 billion is a lot of money but it is an affordable sum of money,” he said.The UN is not going to appeal for USD 90 billion, Lowcock said, but “what I am suggesting is a lot of the suffering and loss of life can be contained within sums of money which are imaginable.” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres did launch a USD 2 billion appeal on March 25 to help vulnerable and conflict-torn countries in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and South America tackle the coronavirus pandemic.Lowcock said he is encouraged the appeal has received a little over USD 1 billion in one month, including 300 million euros from Germany announced Monday evening.On May 7, he said, a revised appeal will be launched seeking additional resources because the pandemic is growing and new countries need help.Lowcock stressed that many things about Covid-19 aren’t known including how it spreads in countries that are warmer and more humid, how it interacts with other illnesses like malaria and HIV/AIDS, how it acts in situations where there is a lot of malnutrition and hunger, its impact in low income countries where people on average are younger, and whether people who recover have some protection against a future infection.Lowcock, who is the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, expressed hope that scientists will find the answers to these and other questions in the coming months.In the poorest parts of the world, he said, “the growth in case numbers is not yet as exponential as we’ve seen in, for example, in North America and Europe.” He said the curve is accelerating in African and cited some recent modeling by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine “suggesting that many African countries will have a thousand new cases a week by May 1, and a few weeks after that could be getting 10,000 cases a week.” Restrictive measures imposed by governments to tackle the pandemic are likely to have a bigger impact in poorer countries than wealthier ones because of the number of day laborers and hungry people who can’t survive on their own resources, he said.“But the biggest impacts, we expect ... will arise from the economic consequences of the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usd-90-billion-could-protect-700-million-poor-in-covid-19-pandemic-un/story-lcOLbvaC2qhk8ZYrgLi5CO.html
28-04-2020||World||Not just Kim Jong Un: A look at past disappearances of North Korean leaders, officials||While Kim Jong Un’s two-week absence has inspired speculation and rumors that he is gravely ill, he is not the first member of North Korean’s ruling elite to disappear from public view.Some absences were caused by real trouble, including deaths, illness or purges. But frequently the so-called disappearances have simply shown the disconnect between insatiable curiosity about what’s happening inside the isolated, nuclear-armed nation and the thick cloak of secrecy surrounding its leadership.A look at past cases of missing North Korean officials and when reports about the demise of leaders were premature:KIM IL SUNGBefore his death in 1994, there was arguably no person South Koreans hated and feared more than North Korea’s state founder Kim Il Sung. His forces launched a surprise attack on the South in June 1950, triggering a devastating war that drew massive intervention by the United States and China and killed and injured millions of people before an armistice halted fighting three years later.He also dispatched commandos in a failed attempt to assassinate the South Korean president in 1968 and sent agents to plant bombs that killed 21 people, including several South Korean cabinet ministers, during a presidential visit to Myanmar in 1983.When South Korean newspapers reported him as dead in November 1986, the public, at least for a few hours, was overwhelmed with euphoria but also panic about instability on the border.The reports began circulating on Nov. 16 when the Chosun Ilbo published a short story by its Tokyo correspondent who reported rumors in Japan that Kim Il Sung had died. Things took a strange turn the next day when South Korea’s military spokesman announced that the North Koreans used loudspeakers on the mine-strewn border to announce that he was shot to death.Chosun released an extra edition to report the story on Nov. 17 — a Monday when newspapers hadn’t usually published — before using seven pages to describe Kim Il Sung’s assassination on Nov. 18, under the now infamous front-page headline “Kim Il Sung shot dead.”Other newspapers wrote similar stories, adding to a frenzy that abruptly ended hours later when Kim Il Sung appeared alive and well at an airport in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, to greet a visiting Mongolian delegation.Chosun, South Korea’s biggest newspaper by circulation, never published a correction. But it formally apologized over the story last month while marking the 100th anniversary of its founding.The newspaper also apologized over a 2013 report that said North Korean singer and senior ruling party member Hyon Song Wol had been executed. Hyon reappeared in public in May 2014 and is now considered as one of the most powerful women in North Korea, accompanying Kim Jong Un to several international summits.KIM JONG ILKim Jong Il, the famously reclusive father of the current ruler, also was the subject of countless reports and rumors about his demise.In 2004, a massive explosion at a North Korean train station on its border with China inspired rumors of an assassination attempt as he had passed through hours earlier on his way back from Beijing. The collision of two fuel-carrying trains reportedly killed and injured thousands of people, but a link to the leader’s travel was never confirmed.Chatter about Kim Jong Il’s death following his 2008 stroke became so frequent that it prompted South Korea’s financial regulator in 2009 to investigate whether the rumors were being deliberately spread to manipulate stock markets.When Kim Jong Il did die in December 2011, following years of deteriorating health and diminishing public appearances, the outside world had no clue until the North’s state media announced it two days later.His once-powerful sister, Kim Kyong Hui, has had her own share of premature reports about her death. CNN on May 2015 cited a North Korean defector to report that Kim Jong Un had her poisoned to death. The 73-year-old made her first public appearance in about six years in January, sitting near her nephew during a concert.KIM JONG UNConflicting reports over the past week have said Kim is either “gravely ill,” “in a vegetative state” or “perfectly fine” following heart surgery that may or may not have happened.In 2014, Kim vanished from the public eye for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. South Korea’s spy agency said he had a cyst removed from his ankle.In 2016, South Korean media quoted intelligence officials as saying Kim had had a former military chief executed for corruption and other charges. But months later, North Korea’s state media showed Ri Yong Gil alive and serving in new senior posts.Kim Jong Un was last seen in public on April 11 when he presided over a ruling party meeting on coronavirus prevention. He even missed the April 15 birthday celebration for his late grandfather Kim Il Sung for the first time since taking power in 2011. State media have since reported his engagement in routine, but non-public activities. They say he’s sent greetings to the leaders of Syria, Cuba and South Africa and expressed gratitude to citizens of merit, including workers building tourist facilities in the coastal town of Wonsan, which is where some speculate he is staying.While it’s possible that Kim could pop up anytime, continuing a family tradition of media resurrections, some experts say that his health will become an increasing factor in years ahead, considering his weight, smoking habits and other supposed health problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-just-kim-jong-un-a-look-at-past-disappearances-of-north-korean-leaders-officials/story-TCg9Ufyxn1H27HkgmFcvlN.html
28-04-2020||World||Covid-19 lockdown: Texas is open, California’s closed and US’ states go their own way||The Trump administration promised Americans that expanded coronavirus testing would give states the information they need to restart their economies, but Texas has already heard enough.Governor Greg Abbott said Monday that malls, restaurants and movie theaters could re-open Friday. “The lives saved are priceless, but the price has been steep,” Abbott said.About an hour earlier, roughly 1,300 miles west, California Governor Gavin Newsom admonished citizens for flocking to the Pacific over the weekend, which led to images of beaches packed with frolickers. He said his stay-home order would stand, and encouraged people to be patient: “The only thing that could set us back is our individual collective behavior.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe difference in approach by the country’s two most-populous states provides a striking picture of a nation eager to get back to business, but still unclear how. Some states are banding together, with the so-called Western States Pact adding Colorado and Nevada to its ranks Monday. That means its safety-first policies will cover a combined 60 million residents. Others, like Texas and Ohio, laid out ambitious reopening plans despite uncertainty that Trump’s promised testing will materialize.The proliferation of plans, with their byzantine phases and conditions varying across regions -- and even within states -- reinforced just how divided the country remains on how and when to reopen the economy. Trump inadvertently summed up the challenge Monday when asked what advice he had for America’s governors.“We recommend that they do it as quickly as possible,” the president said. “But safely.”Grand PlansThe administration plans to rely on drug retailers and lab-testing companies to provide mass testing and said Monday it would partner with Walmart Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. If successful, it could be the biggest expansion yet of testing capacity in the U.S. The goal is to have all 50 states test at least 2% of residents, with an emphasis on the elderly and minority communities that have seen the highest mortality rates.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakTrump has been frustrated by questions about the federal government’s failure to provide help as more than 56,000 Americans have died, and has said states should shoulder more of the burden. Monday’s blueprint makes a point of saying the federal government will play a supporting role.That leaves it to state leaders to decide when they’re ready to resume commerce.Ohio, like Texas, will gradually start to reopen businesses Friday, though at a slower pace. Dental offices and veterinary clinics can open this week, though retail businesses are still two weeks from opening, said Governor Mike DeWine.Getting AlignedNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, meanwhile, said some parts of the state could re-open in May, while New Jersey’s stay-at-home order will continue indefinitely, said Governor Phil Murphy. Their paths diverged even though both states are yoked in a Northeast coalition that includes Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, among others.In Louisiana, Governor John Bel Edwards extended the state’s stay-at-home order until at least May 15, and Hawaii Governor David Ige over the weekend extended his order until June.“What we’re seeing is different circumstances in different states, and also different attitudes in different states,” said Jim Wilcox, a professor of economic analysis and policy from the University of California’s Haas School of Business. “This is not terribly surprising to see 50 different flowers blooming here.”Trade groups for some of the world’s largest retailers on Monday called for a uniform program among states, including the opening of warehouses and distribution centers in unison. Cuomo on Monday also stressed the need to work with counterparts in the Northeast, where states are close and travel is easy.“We have to coordinate as a region,” Cuomo said. “Everybody in that region has to have the same policy when it comes to schools, when it comes to transportation, when it comes to testing, when it comes to tracing. And that region’s plan has to fit in to our overall multi-state plan.”Green MagnetsBut that aspiration will likely prove difficult. Even opening rural areas, which are less densely populated, could cause issues as people flock to enjoy those newly opened businesses and parks, as they did on California’s beaches.“The minute you open up two to three parks, either a county park or a state park, you’ve got the rest of the counties, if not the rest of the regions, showing up,” said Murphy of New Jersey.The key for many states to reopen has been reliable and widespread testing -- something that Trump promised Monday in a press conference while pointing out that the U.S. has completed more tests than any other country. But the number of tests per day, a key metric, is still hundreds of thousands of tests shorter than the 500,000 experts estimate are needed.In California, for example, Newsom said last week the state needs to conduct from 60,000 to 80,000 tests per day. As of last week, that number was just over 16,000, though he was optimistic Monday that the state would be able to open in “weeks, not months” so long as people continue to practice social distancing.A major risk to restarting businesses is that new infections may take weeks to manifest as confirmed cases or hospital visits. The delay between contracting the virus and showing symptoms, believed to be as long as two weeks, could present a challenge to determining whether a state’s plan is working safely. States that aren’t patient may make decisions based on premature data from other states, Wilcox said.“The longer that gestation period is, the tougher it is to know you’ve gone too far -- or that you haven’t opened as much as you could have safely,” he added. “It seems to me an awful lot of this difficulty is because of this long lag.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-lockdown-texas-is-open-california-s-closed-and-us-states-go-their-own-way/story-xR6k3GFjY8hKU0HfSfWmYJ.html

28-04-2020||World||Where is North Korea’s Kim Jong Un? Here’s what is possible||The Day of the Sun -- the April 15 holiday celebrating Kim Jong Un’s late grandfather, Kim Il Sung -- has long been the most important date on North Korea’s political calendar. This year, the supreme leader failed to show.Kim Jong Un’s absence from an event he has often used to signal strength at home and abroad sparked a global search for explanations. Two weeks later, the whereabouts of the 36-year-old leader has become one of the world’s great mysteries, fed by internet rumors, satellite photos and anonymously sourced reports.Here’s some possible scenarios being discussed:1. Recovering From SurgeryThe first credible report that something was wrong with Kim was also among the least alarming. The Daily NK, a Seoul-based news outlet that gathers information from people inside North Korea, reported April 21 that Kim underwent a “cardiovascular surgical procedure” the previous week and was now mostly recovered.The report, attributed to a single unidentified person, did offer several specific details, including that Kim was treated at the Hyangsan Medical Center on the outskirts of Pyongyang. While no governments have verified the report, South Korean officials later said that Kim was believed to be conducting “normal activities” in a rural part of the country assisted by close aides, actions that could be consistent with the recovery explanation.Also read: South Korea’s ministers say they know North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s location“Kim Jong Un is alive and well,” Moon Chung-in, a special adviser to South Korea’s president, told Fox News on Sunday. Moon, however, added that Kim had been staying in the coastal resort area of Wonsan since April 13, something that would clash with the Daily NK account.2. In ‘Grave Danger’Hours after the Daily NK article, CNN provided a far more worrying assessment of Kim’s health, reporting that the U.S. was monitoring intelligence that suggested he was in “grave danger” after surgery. Bloomberg News separately reported that U.S. officials were told that Kim was in critical condition, but were unsure of his current status.While U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he believed the CNN report was “incorrect” and based on “old documents,” rumors about Kim’s deteriorating condition only accelerated on social media. On Saturday, Reuters reported that the Chinese Communist Party’s International Department dispatched a team including medical experts to North Korea on Thursday to advise on Kim. The news service, which cited three people familiar with the situation, said it was unclear what the delegation signaled about Kim’s health.Also read: On Kim Jong Un’s health, Donald Trump says ‘have a very good idea, but can’t talk’China’s foreign ministry, which is separate from the International Department, said only that it had sent reagents for coronavirus testing to North Korea. “That is not the same as a medical team,” ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters Monday in Beijing.3. Just Social DistancingThe Chinese medical team could also point to what’s now a more common health concern: Covid-19. Although North Korea has disclosed no infections, the country has quarantined thousands of people and the U.S.’s top general in South Korea has said he was “fairly certain” the country has cases. China has been sending experts around the world to help combat the pandemic that began on its soil.The Seoul-based JoongAng Daily newspaper reported Monday that the North Korean leader was in self-quarantine. The paper, citing an unidentified person in China, said that Kim was monitoring his health after one of his bodyguards was confirmed with the coronavirus infection. That’s why China sent some 50 medical staff to North Korea, the newspaper said.4. Hurt in Military DrillsThe search for Kim has repeatedly led back to eastern tourist enclave of Wonsan, the site of a palatial family compound and frequent missile tests. Satellite photos analyzed by the website 38 North showed that a train resembling the armored one used by North Korea’s leaders was parked at the local railway station last week.The eastern coastal area saw a burst of military activity, including cruise missile tests and fighter jet maneuvers, on April 14 -- the day before Kim failed to show up for Day of the Sun events about 230 kilometers (140 miles) to the west in Pyongyang. Ri Jong Ho, a high-profile North Korean defector who now lives in the U.S., told the Seoul-based DongA Daily newspaper that Kim may have been injured in the exercises.Also read: Not just Kim Jong Un: A look at past disappearances of North Korean leaders, officialsStill, it would be unusual for North Korean military officials to allow their top leader to get close enough to the action to get hurt. Also, the satellite photos don’t confirm the train’s presence in the area until April 21. Images from April 15 show no train.5. Seeking AttentionSome such as Yoon Sang-hyun, a South Korean lawmaker who heads a committee on inter-Korean relations, have wondered whether Kim devised the disappearance as a way to draw attention to the regime. Yoon speculated that the North Korean leader would have to show up in public in the next couple of weeks to avoid a destabilizing debate about his grip on power and potential successors.“If he doesn’t, it’s a real big issue,” Yoon told reporters Monday, according to the DongA Daily. “Kim is apparently not running the country as he would normally do now.”There’s also a good chance the world may never get a satisfying explanation. Kim similarly vanished from state media for six weeks in 2014, prompting speculation that he had been sidelined by gout, an ankle injury or was even overthrown in a coup. He subsequently showed up walking with a cane. No reason for his absence has ever been given.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-is-north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-here-s-what-is-possible/story-HrBFbP8udKkHcy34mVCZ0K.html
28-04-2020||World||US tightens restrictions on technology exports to China, Russia and Venezuela||The Trump Administration announced new export control actions to prevent efforts by entities in China, Russia, and Venezuela to acquire American technology that could be used for development of weapons, military aircraft, surveillance through civilian supply chains.“It is important to consider the ramifications of doing business with countries that have histories of diverting goods purchased from US companies for military applications,” said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.“Certain entities in China, Russia, and Venezuela have sought to circumvent America’s export controls, and undermine American interests in general, and so we will remain vigilant to ensure US technology does not get into the wrong hands,” Ross said.Prominent among the rule changes include expansion of Military End Use/User Controls (MEU), removal of license exception civil end users (CIV) and elimination of license exception additional permissive reexports (APR) provisions.The new rule, expands MEU license requirements controls on China, Russia, and Venezuela to cover military end-users in all three countries, as well as items such as semiconductor equipment, sensors, and other technologies sought for military end use or by military end-users in these countries.It seeks to removes a license exception for exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) to civilian end-users in countries of national security concern for National Security- (NS) controlled items.The new rule also proposes to eliminate certain provisions of a license exception for partner countries involving the reexport of NS-controlled items to countries of national security concern to ensure consistent reviews of exports and reexports of US items.US Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and an outspoken China hawk, in a statement said that this was long due.“This rule is grounded in two basic truths: Modern war is high tech and China’s so-called ‘private sector’ is fake. Chairman Xi has erased any daylight between China’s businesses and the communist party’s military,” Sasse said.“We didn’t win the Cold War by selling cruise missiles to the Soviets, and we’re not going to beat China by selling semiconductors to the People’s Liberation Army. These rules are long overdue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tightens-restrictions-on-technology-exports-to-china-russia-and-venezuela/story-la8Cr0WvQV3r2BdSuU4IuN.html
28-04-2020||World||Italy, UK explore possible Covid-19 link to children’s Kawasaki disease||Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of severe inflammatory disease among infants who are arriving in hospital with high fevers and swollen arteries.Doctors in northern Italy, one of the world’s hardest-hit areas during the pandemic, have reported extraordinarily large numbers of children under age 9 with severe cases of what appears to be Kawasaki disease, more common in parts of Asia.In Britain, doctors have made similar observations, prompting Health Secretary Matt Hancock to tell a coronavirus news briefing on Monday that he was “very worried” and that medical authorities were looking at the issue closely.In the United States, a leading paediatric society says it has yet to see something similar.Kawasaki disease, whose cause is unknown, often afflicts children aged under 5 and is associated with fever, skin rashes, swelling of glands, and in severe cases, inflammation of arteries of the heart. There is some evidence that individuals can inherit a predisposition to the disease, but the pattern is not clear. England’s national medical director, Stephen Powis, told the British briefing he had become aware of reports of severely ill children with Kawasaki-like symptoms in the past few days but stressed it was too early to determine a link with the coronavirus.“I’ve asked the national clinical director for children and young people to look into this as a matter of urgency. ... We’re not sure at the moment,” Powis said.In Italy, paediatricians are also alarmed.A hospital in the northern town of Bergamo has seen more than 20 cases of severe vascular inflammation in the past month, six times as many as it would expect to see in a year, said paediatric heart specialist Matteo Ciuffreda.Ciuffreda, of the Giovanni XXIII hospital, said only a few of the infants with vascular inflammation had tested positive for the new coronavirus, but paediatric cardiologists in Madrid and Lisbon had told him they had seen similar cases.He has called on his colleagues to document every such case to determine if there is a correlation between Kawasaki disease and COVID-19. He aims to publish the results of the Italian research in a scientific journal.‘Multi-organ inflammation’Ciuffreda said his first case of apparent Kawasaki disease was a 9-year-old boy who came to the hospital on March 21, at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, with high fever and low blood oxygen levels. He tested negative for the coronavirus.A scan showed the child had an enlarged coronary artery, a hallmark of severe cases of Kawasaki disease, he said.“The little boy worried me a lot, with a violent multi-organ inflammation affecting both heart and the lungs,” Ciuffreda said. “I feared he wouldn’t survive, but surprisingly, in the course of a few days, he took a positive turn and he got better.”Kawasaki disease was anecdotally linked 16 years ago to another known coronavirus, though it was never proven. The research was carried out after another, related coronavirus known as NL63 was found in a baby showing symptoms of Kawasaki disease in 2004.Ian Jones, professor of virology at the University of Reading in Britain, said the NL63 virus uses the same receptor as the new coronavirus to infect humans, but he also stressed it was too early to draw conclusions.“We just have to wait and see if this becomes a common observation,” he said.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has yet to see something similar in the United States, which has the greatest number of coronavirus infections and deaths.”We are not aware of any reports of this phenomenon in the United States,” Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, who chairs the academy’s committee on infectious disease, said in an email, referring to a potential link between COVID-19 and Kawasaki-type symptoms.Dr. Sean O’Leary, a paediatric infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital Colorado who is part of that AAP committee, said his hospital has seen several cases of Kawasaki this year, but none in the more than 30 children admitted for COVID-19.“Even if it is related, is a very rare complication,” he said. “If it were more common, we’d already have a pretty good idea about it in the United States.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-uk-explore-possible-covid-19-link-to-children-s-kawasaki-disease/story-N9RUfdJngJz4y9672pzG0L.html

It started from China in December, and has so far devastated more than 200 countries. The total number of Covid-19 affected patients has crossed three million.The virus has spread from United States to Europe, with Italy leading the European tally in terms of fatalities. In India, meanwhile, the number of coronavirus disease Covid-19 cases crossed the 29,000-mark on Tuesday.Here is a list of 10 countries with most number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities:United StatesThe US has been hardest hit by the spread of Covid-19. It has recorded almost a million cases and the number of dead has surpassed 55,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The country’s death toll is inching towards 58,000-mark - the number of US troops killed during the Vietnam War.SpainThe European country has the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world, at 2,29,422. The number of deaths in the country is above 23,000.ItalyItaly is not far behind from Spain in number of Covid-19 cases. The country, known for its best medical facilities, has 1,99,414 positive cases and the second-highest number of coronavirus deaths at 26,977. Its Lombardy region has been the hardest hit.FranceWith 1,64,589 cases, France has taken the next spot in the countries worst affected by the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19. The number of people who have died from coronavirus infection in France rose by 437 to 23,293.GermanyOne of the power houses of Europe, Germany has recorded 1,58,758 cases of coronavirus disease Covid-19. However, death tol in the country - at 5,750 - is far lower as compare to other European neighbours. The low death rate in Germany is attributed in part to it having imposed a strict lockdown earlier than other countries relative to when the first case was detected.BritainThe number of Covid-19 cases has reached 1,57,149 in the United Kingdom. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is the first high-profile leader to have contracted the disease. He spent more than a week in hospital - three of them in the intensive care - and returned to work on Monday. The number of fatalities in the country stands at 21,092.TurkeyThe country has recorded 1,12,261 cases of coronavirus disease Covid-19. Ninety five more people have died in the country due to Covid-19, taking the death toll to 2,900, health ministry data showed.IranIran is one of the Middle Eastern countries hardest hit by the pandemic. The death toll from Covid-19 in Iran has risen to 5,806, the country’s health ministry said on Monday. The total number of diagnosed cases of new coronavirus in Iran has reached 91,472.RussiaRussia overtook China in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, when its tally climbed above 87,000, as pressure rose on the government to consider easing lockdown restrictions for businesses. Almost 800 (794 to be exact) people have died of the disease in the country. The world’s largest country by territory has been on lockdown since President Vladimir Putin announced the closure of most public spaces in late March.ChinaThe country from where the coronavirus infection spread to the world, has 82,836 positive cases, including 648 patients who were still being treated and 77,555 people discharged from hospitals.

28-04-2020||World||Covid-19: UK’s finance minister Sunak unveils loan scheme for small businesses||UK’s finance minister Rishi Sunak has unveiled a 100 per cent state-backed ‘Bounce Back Loan Scheme’ for the country’s small businesses to help them tide through the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. The Indian-origin UK Chancellor of the Exchequer on Monday told the House of Commons that the new fast-track finance scheme, to open from next Monday, would help bolster the existing package of support available to crisis-hit UK businesses. Under the scheme, qualifying small businesses can apply online to borrow between 2,000 pounds and 50,000 pounds as interest-free loans for the first 12 months.“Our smallest businesses are the backbone of our economy and play a vital role in their communities. This new rapid loan scheme will help ensure they get the finance they need quickly to help survive this crisis,” Sunak said. “This is in addition to business grants, tax deferrals, and the job retention scheme, which are already helping to support hundreds of thousands of small businesses,” he said. Sunak said his coronavirus support schemes had already provided over 15 billion pounds for business over the last few weeks, which will be further boosted with this new scheme. The scheme has been designed to ensure that small firms who need vital cash injections to keep operating can get finance in a matter of days. It comes alongside the 6 billion pounds awarded in business grants, supporting 4 million jobs through the job retention scheme and generous tax deferrals supporting hundreds of thousands of firms, the UK’s Treasury Department said. It said it had been consulting extensively with business representatives on the design of the new scheme, which will provide lenders with a 100 per cent guarantee for the loan and pay any fees and interest for the first 12 months. No repayments will be due during the first 12 months. The loans are expected to be easy to apply for through a short, standardised online application, and they should reach businesses within days providing immediate support to those that need it as easily as possible. “Our small businesses are vital in ensuring our communities thrive and will be crucial in creating jobs and securing economic growth as we recover. This rapid loan scheme offers additional protection so small companies across the country can get access to the finance they need immediately, as part of the unprecedented package of support we have put in place,” UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said.Firms will be able to access these loans through a network of accredited lenders. The government will work with lenders to ensure loans delivered through this scheme are advanced as quickly as possible and agree a low standardised level of interest for the remaining period of the loan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-s-finance-minister-rishi-sunak-unveils-loan-scheme-for-small-businesses/story-P4AdHV0Q8l4dymwVGS0pAL.html

There is a hunger for getting our country back, and it is happening, and it is happening faster than people would think,” he said.Responding to questions, Trump said his administration is recommending states to reopen their economies as quickly as possible but safely.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “We want everyone to be safe and I think you are seeing that. You’re seeing a lot of governors get out and they want to open it up. Many are thinking about their school system not a long way to go in the school system right now for this season, for this year but I think you will see a lot of schools open up even if it’s for a very short period of time,” he said.“I think it would be a good thing because as you see in terms of what this vicious virus goes after young people seem to do very well. Young people seem to do very well. So I know that there are some governors that aren’t necessarily ready to open up their states but they may be ready to open up their school systems. We will see but that is their choice. But the word is safety. Rapid but safety,” said the president.“I built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And one day, because of something that should have never been allowed to happen, we had to close our country.

Every year, 12 million girls become mothers while they themselves are still children. “These frustrations and, frankly, failures to address them by those in power today, fuel declining confidence in political establishments and institutions. And when such a cycle takes hold, it is all too easy for extremist groups to exploit the anger and despair, and the risk of radicalization climbs,” he said.The UN chief noted that “we can already see such groups taking advantage of the Covid-19 lockdowns, intensifying their efforts on social media to spread hatred and to recruit young people who may be spending more time at home and on line.” He made the remarks during a meeting to review the five years since its adoption of a landmark resolution on youth, peace and security.Also read: Why WHO chief says ‘the world should have listened then, carefully’Issuing a call to action on youth, peace and security, Guterres said the “world cannot afford a lost generation of youth, their lives set back by Covid-19 and their voices stifled by a lack of participation. Let us do far more to tap their talents as we tackle the pandemic and chart a recovery that leads to a more peaceful, sustainable and equitable future for all.” With over 1.54 billion children and youth out-of-school and young people acutely feeling the impact of the COVID19 crisis, Guterres said countries must do more to harness the talents of young people to address the crisis and its aftermath.In presenting his first report on Security Council resolution, the UN chief said youth were already confronting numerous challenges even before the pandemic, including in accessing education, or through being affected by violence and conflict. Those pressing for peace or upholding human rights have been threatened.Despite these obstacles, young people across the world have joined the common fight against the coronavirus disease, supporting both frontline workers and people in need. And they continue to push for change.UN Youth Envoy Jayathma Wickramanayake spoke of the need for more meaningful partnerships between young people and the civil society organizations and government institutions that work on the youth, peace and security (YPS) agenda.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “To date, there are no national action plans on YPS but I’m pleased to note that in some countries, these are in the process of development,” she said.“For a national roadmap to be successful, a participatory, transparent and youth–led process with adequate resources are needed.” Issuing his four-point call to action for the Council, Guterres urged members to do more to address the various challenges facing young people. He also called for investment in youth participation, but also in their organizations and initiatives.Also read: US ‘well-positioned’ to handle Covid-19 pandemic, says WHO’s emergencies chief“We must strengthen human rights protections and protect the civic space on which youth participation depends,” he said. “And fourth, we must emerge from the COVID-19 crisis with a determination to recover better – massively increasing our investment in young people’s capacities as we deliver the Sustainable Development Goals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-can-t-afford-a-lost-generation-of-youth-due-to-covid-19-crisis-says-un-chief/story-rXpQw9j7OgaYNWMw3lE4pK.html

The largest number of them are in the US: more than 56,000 deaths and over 10 lakh infections.After the US, Europe has been the worst hit by the virus. In India, mainly because of the early and aggressive preventive measures, the fatalities have remained low at 886 and infections at 28,000. Leaders of these countries including the US, the UK and Germany increasingly believe that the unfortunate deaths of so many people and destruction of the global economy could have been avoided, if China had shown transparency and shared the information about the virus in its early phases.Also read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayAs such many countries have started talking about claiming compensation from China.Trump, during the Rose Garden press conference, was asked about Germany planning to send a bill to China for euro 130 billion for the damages. “Would your administration look at doing the same?” “Well, we can do something much easier than that. We have ways of doing things a lot easier than that,” Trump replied. “We haven’t determined the final amount yet,” but “it is very substantial”.“If you look at the world, I mean, this is a worldwide damage. This is a damage to the US but this is a damage to the world,” said the US president.Also read: China ‘concerned’ as India decides to stop use of Chinese Covid-19 test kitsTrump said there are “a lot of ways” one can hold China accountable for the spread of the virus. “We’re doing very serious investigations, as you probably know. We are not happy with China,” he said.“We are not happy with that whole situation because we believe it could’ve been stopped at the source. It could’ve been stopped quickly and it wouldn’t have spread all over the world. And we think that should have happened. So, we’ll let you know at the appropriate time, but we are doing serious investigations,” Trump said.In recent weeks, there has been an increasing support towards the move to hold China accountable.“China has been untruthful and unforthcoming since the beginning of this pandemic. We must hold them accountable for this cover up,” Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith said in a tweet.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage On Monday, Congressman Earl L. “Buddy” Carter signed on to a resolution establishing a bicameral, bipartisan joint select committee to investigate the origins of and China’s handling of the 2019 novel coronavirus.“We know China has lied and covered up important information about Covid-19 since the beginning,” said Carter.“Now, thousands of Americans have died, people have lost their jobs and the world has been turned upside down. Congress has the responsibility to investigate the origins of the virus and the extent of China’s deception. The American people have been devastated by this disease and they deserve answers. We should approve this resolution without delay and get to work as soon as possible,” he said.In a related development, Congressmen Alex X. Mooney and Matt Gaetz, Senator Martha McSally and a bicameral coalition of over 50 other lawmakers sent a letter to House and Senate leadership requesting that no Covid-19 relief funds be given to China’s state-run bio-agent laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).“After the damage the coronavirus has inflicted upon the world, US taxpayer dollars should no longer be sent to labs we know conduct sloppy research and dangerous experiments. I commend President Trump’s response to this invisible enemy and his determination to hold China accountable for its actions,” Mooney said.Reports indicate that for years WIV has received taxpayer dollars from the US National Institutes of Health for secretive and dangerous laboratory research on coronavirus-infected bats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-damage-to-the-world-trump-says-very-serious-investigation-against-china-on/story-TrPbSQmoDbUMtpPt975a1H.html

28-04-2020||World||Is Brazil the next big hotspot as other nations ease up?||Brazil is emerging as potentially the next big hotspot for the coronavirus amid President Jair Bolsonaro’s insistence that it is just a “little flu” and that there is no need for the sharp restrictions that have slowed the infection’s spread in Europe and the US.As some US states and European countries moved gradually Monday to ease their limits on movement and commerce, the intensifying outbreak in Brazil — Latin America’s biggest country, with 211 million people — pushed some hospitals to the breaking point, with signs that a growing number of victims are now dying at home.“We have all the conditions here for the pandemic to become much more serious,” said Paulo Brandão, a virologist at the University of Sao Paulo.Brazil officially reported about 4,500 deaths and almost 67,000 confirmed infections. But the true numbers there, as in many other countries, are believed to be vastly higher given the lack of testing and the many people without severe symptoms who haven’t sought hospital care.Some scientists said over 1 million in Brazil are probably infected. The country is heading into winter, which can worsen respiratory illnesses.Worldwide, the death toll topped 210,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The number of dead in the US surpassed 55,000 — close to the 58,000 US troops killed during the Vietnam War. Italy, Britain, Spain and France accounted for more than 20,000 deaths each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-brazil-the-next-big-hotspot-as-other-nations-ease-up/story-lSidQjdVdFpXMdrIr9fWNO.html

28-04-2020||World||‘You are a miracle’: Home care of Covid-19 patients is new front in coronavirus fight in US||Ruth Caballero paused outside an unfamiliar apartment door, preparing to meet her new patient.She covered the knob with a plastic bag. Put on a surgical gown, then a heavy-duty N95 mask, a lighter surgical mask on top. Cap, face shield, shoe covers. Hand sanitizer between each step of the process. Finally, the nurse donned two sets of gloves and knocked on the door with her elbow, ready to care for her first coronavirus patient.After about three weeks in a hospital, the man was home in his New York apartment but still so weak that sitting up in bed took some persuading.“You made it out of the hospital, so you are a miracle,” Caballero told him. “Now let’s keep you out of the hospital.”Home health care is becoming a new front in the national fight against COVID-19 as some patients come back from hospitals and others strive to stay out of them.Home care nurses, aides and attendants — who normally help an estimated 12 million Americans with everything from bathing to IV medications — are now taking on the difficult and potentially dangerous task of caring for coronavirus patients.While Americans are being told to keep to themselves, home health providers and their clients still largely have to engage in person, often intimately. Many agencies are ramping up phone or video visits but can’t always get paid for them, and even the smartest phone can’t physically dress a wound or get someone to the bathroom.Like their colleagues in hospitals and nursing homes, home care workers have faced a scarcity of protective equipment, but with a lower public profile. Some agencies have scoured for masks at nail salons, auto body shops and tattoo parlors, said William Dombi, president of the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, an industry group.The crisis is testing the industry, but it’s also a moment of pride for workers who have often felt under-recognized.“It is a challenge to keep the business operational, but it’s an opportunity,” Dombi said. “We’re getting a chance to establish what can be done.”Coronavirus care at home has expanded rapidly in the last few weeks. At least some agencies in most states are now taking COVID-19 patients referred after hospitalization or nursing home care or as an alternative to them, Dombi said.Still, some patients have struggled to get care. After being diagnosed with coronavirus-related pneumonia late last month, Penny Wittbrodt contacted multiple agencies around her home in Winchester, Kentucky. None was then accepting COVID-19 patients, she said, though her doctor was able to arrange home oxygen. Wittbrodt, who has asthma and a history of respiratory hospitalizations, is still not well, though she’s had some relief at times.A retired home health nurse, Wittbrodt feels such care is especially valuable in the pandemic.“Home health would expose far less people to COVID than hospitalization,” she said.New York-based Americare Inc. has taken about 100 COVID-19 patients released from hospitals, and over 200 of the agency’s other patients also have tested positive or shown symptoms, VP Bridget Gallagher said.Every corporate staffer including the CEO is calling protective gear suppliers, but the agency still counts its stock of N95 masks every day.“We’re doing what we can, but I have to be honest: None of it feels like enough,” said Gallagher, who’s also on the board of the Home Care Association of New York State.For many agencies, chronic staff shortages are amplified by absences due to illness or quarantine. And workers are grappling with patients’ fears while reckoning with their own risk.The surgical mask and gloves that Washington home health aide Adassa Clarke now wears rattle her patient, who has Alzheimer’s disease and relies on a wheelchair. The patient doesn’t have COVID-19 but can’t retain what she’s been told about an illness going around.“What’s going on? Do I have a germ? Am I dying?” she asks, according to Clarke. Sometimes, the patient breaks into tears.At 65, Clarke herself is in an age group at higher risk of severe cases of COVID-19, and she’s trying to stay home as much as she can.But patients “come first,” said Clarke, a certified nursing assistant.“I just feel like the more I help, the more I keep going,” she said.A home health nurse with Chicago-area patients with COVID-19, Vanessa Pepino-Adraneda is extra-vigilant about protective gear and other precautions. Pepino-Adraneda also girds herself by focusing on caring for her patients and allowing herself moments of sadness, frustration or exhaustion.“I try my best to protect my sanity amidst all this chaos,” she said.For some people, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause severe illness or be fatal. For most people, it carries mild symptoms or none at all, meaning some patients could have the virus and not know it.The Visiting Nurse Service of New York, one of the nation’s largest home health agencies, currently has nearly 400 COVID-19 patients, and another nearly 300 referrals await, Executive Vice President Dan Savitt said. Separately, about 80 confirmed and presumed coronavirus patients are getting hospice care.As an industry, “I do feel like we’ve risen to the challenge,” he said.When the agency first told Caballero and other nurses in late March that COVID-19 patients were coming, “I won’t say that I wasn’t nervous,” Caballero says.She was relieved, though, to see the protective equipment the agency issued. And her first visit, to the man in the apartment, went well. When she called later that night, he was not only sitting up but had gotten into a chair.The person who would have been her next coronavirus patient died before visits began.Caballero is now caring for several COVID-19 patients. They came home debilitated and fearful, afraid that hospitals “sent them home to die,” she says.She encourages them to take step after small step: to sit on the side of the bed, to walk to the bathroom, to have a meal at the kitchen table.“It is a challenge. This disease has taken so many lives,” she says, but “I’m so blessed and so honored and so grateful that these patients are coming home.”“Think about it -- there but for the grace. It could be I.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-are-a-miracle-home-care-of-covid-19-patients-is-new-front-in-coronavirus-fight-in-us/story-b4DGkS0on4InN4xoNDxkYJ.html
28-04-2020||World||UK team begins Covid-19 vaccine trials, aims to get efficacy results by September||A vaccine to halt the coronavirus pandemic could be available as early as this year for vulnerable groups such as health-care workers, even faster than initially thought, according to a key group at the heart of the global development effort.The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which is funding nine different coronavirus vaccine projects, has previously suggested a shot could be ready within 12 to 18 months, an already ambitious target. That assessment didn’t account for the possibility of companies working closely together to accelerate the process, faster enrollment in human trials and other factors, according to Richard Hatchett, the head of the Oslo-based organization.“These are all things we are looking at now as potential opportunities to perhaps deliver vaccines even faster than the 12 to 18 months we were discussing,” he said on a call Monday.As the number of coronavirus infections globally nears 3 million, the pressure is growing to come up with therapies and vaccines to combat the contagion. Dozens of companies around the world are pursuing a vaccine, among them Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Inc.Also read: Bill Gates’s coronavirus vaccine could be ready in 12 monthsA University of Oxford team led by Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology, has begun trials of a potential vaccine and aims to get efficacy results as soon as September. Manufacturing is already underway.Caution UrgedSome experts have called for caution, noting that most vaccines go through years of tests before they hit the market, and that 12 to 18 months would be extraordinarily fast. The coronavirus shots moving most rapidly are made with new technologies that have never proven useful in humans.Hatchett said he doesn’t want to overpromise, but several vaccines backed by CEPI may enter a second phase of testing as soon as late spring or this summer. That means the first could become available in 2020 if they prove to be safe and effective, probably on an emergency-use basis. In that scenario, they might be accessible only to certain at-risk populations before being deployed more widely.Developers are mindful of examples in the past where rapid vaccine development “unfortunately led to bad outcomes,” he said. “We take it with the utmost seriousness. We cannot cut corners. It’s absolutely critical that we ensure safety and efficacy.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage With experimental vaccines progressing, governments and health groups are turning to the challenge of producing enough doses to meet global demand and ensuring that shots are distributed equitably. The coalition wants to set up manufacturing in every region of the world and has been talking with other groups including Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which helps developing countries finance and distribute vaccines.“Given the economic disruption that is caused by the pandemic and the global interconnectedness of the economy, if we don’t address the pandemic everywhere, we will still be at risk,” Hatchett said.Global CoordinationThe head of Sanofi, Paul Hudson, raised questions last week about Europe’s ability to manufacture enough doses and said the US may be in a position to vaccinate first, thanks to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a government agency that backs vaccine development.“We should really have a global perspective and make sure we don’t end up limiting the access because it’s produced in certain countries,” Erna Solberg, Norway’s prime minister, said on the call with CEPI’s head.Also read: Indian firm ready to begin producing possible vaccineCEPI has secured commitments for about half of the $2 billion it estimates will be needed to develop the vaccines, and it may invest in 15 or more programs, Hatchett said.The coalition is partnering with companies including Moderna and Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., along with institutions such as Oxford and the University of Queensland in Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-team-begins-covid-19-vaccine-trials-aims-to-get-efficacy-results-by-september/story-RPPrxhUSZW18pDxahf1DEO.html
28-04-2020||World||Masks, temperature checks, customers’ logs mark ‘new normal’ at US restaurants||With staff wearing masks, checking customers’ temperatures and using disposable paper place mats, some of the nation’s restaurants reopened for dine-in service as states loosened more coronavirus restrictions. But many eateries remained closed amid safety concerns and community backlash.Restaurants in Georgia and Tennessee and Anchorage, Alaska, welcomed diners back, albeit for a different dine-in experience than before the pandemic forced restaurants to close or limit their services to take-out and delivery.In Louisiana, the governor said restaurants will be allowed to seat people outside starting Friday, though without wait service at the tables.In Georgia, dine-in service and movie screenings were allowed to resume a few days after some other businesses, including barbershops, gyms, tattoo shops and nail salons, began seeing customers Friday.“We’re ecstatic to have them back,” said Chris Heithaus, who manages 87 Waffle House restaurants. “A lot of people, I think, want to get back to the new normal, which will be social distancing and all that. But they will be able to eat inside the restaurant.” At the popular chain known for hash brown breakfasts and its ability to stay open in the face of natural disasters, the “new normal” included employees wearing masks, booths closed to keep customers apart and traditional plastic place mat menus replaced by paper menus.Gov. Brian Kemp announced last week that he would relax restrictions despite health experts’ warnings of a potential surge in infections and disapproval from President Donald Trump.Kemp issued 39 requirements that restaurants must follow, including observing a limit of 10 customers per 500 square feet and ensuring that all employees wear face coverings.Anchorage began allowing restaurants, hair salons and other retails locations to open Monday, three days after the rest of Alaska began relaxing restrictions. Seating must be limited to 25 percent of capacity, and only members of the same household can sit at a table.A log with every customer’s first and last name and contact phone number must be maintained by the restaurant and kept for 30 days in case it’s needed for contact tracing. All employees must wear fabric face masks, and customers are encouraged to wear them unless eating.In Tennessee, state officials allowed restaurants to reopen in 89 of Tennessee’s 95 counties starting Monday. At Tony Gore’s Smoky Mountain BBQ & Grill in Sevierville, only a few tables of dine-in guests had come in by Monday afternoon, and each diner — as well as employees — had to have their temperature checked with an infrared thermometer gun.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “Everybody has really been great about that part of it,” restaurant general manager Keith Carter said of the temperature checks. “We figured we would have some people who would be like, ‘That’s kind of weird.’ I think they see that it’s just a precaution.” In Madison, a small antebellum town in Georgia about 96 kilometres from Atlanta, the Madison Chop House Grille took similar cautionary steps.The staff put big blue X marks on certain tables and removed chairs to let patrons know they could not sit there. When employees arrive, they have to take their temperature and record it on a white board that’s visible to customers.The restaurant only had about six tables of people for dine-in lunch service, said general manager, Mary Spoto.“Every customer who’s come in here has thanked us for being open, but unfortunately it was really slow,” Spoto said.Many other restaurants decided it wasn’t yet time to reopen. Dennis McKinley had planned to open two of the three branches of his Atlanta-area restaurant, the Original Hot Dog Factory. But Monday morning he decided not to open after all, citing community opposition.McKinley estimates he got about 40 calls over the weekend from politicians, community leaders and customers urging him not to reopen for dine-in service.“Ultimately, the Original Hot Dog Factory can’t make it without the community’s support, so I felt it was important to hold back and wait,” he said.He plans to wait until state and local officials are on the same page. In the meantime, his staff continues to work on takeout and delivery orders.Collins Quarter, Anthony Debreceny’s café and bar in Savannah’s downtown historic district, remained closed Monday along with three other restaurants he owns. Debreceny said many other restaurateurs he knows were also holding off, particularly those who rely on tourists for much of their business.“Customers aren’t ready,” Debreceny said. “Today’s going to be an interesting test. I think there’s a lot of people waiting to see what the social media backlash is going to be like.” Right now, Debreceny said, he doesn’t anticipate reopening until late June.

28-04-2020||World||Why has Spain been hit so hard by the coronavirus pandemic?||In Spain, one of the hardest-hit countries in the pandemic, the coronavirus spread quickly and widely without being detected, especially among the elderly, experts told AFP.While they stressed it was too early to carry out a detailed analysis, the experts pointed to the country’s sociable lifestyle and close ties between young and older family members as significant factors in the virus’s spread.Low mortality, high spreadWhile Spain has the world’s highest coronavirus death toll per capita after Belgium, its mortality rate -- the percentage of infected patients who die -- stands at 10.4 percent, below other hard-hit nations like Italy, France and Britain.“The problem here is the size of the epidemic, the great quantity of infections which we had at the epidemic peak,” said Fernando Rodriguez, a public health professor at Madrid’s Autonomous University.Only the United States has more confirmed COVID-19 cases than Spain, although national variations depend greatly on the number of tests that are carried out.A study carried out by the Polytechnic University of Catalonia estimated that more than two million of Spain’s 47 million people are infected.Late detectionThe virus “circulated under the radar a lot” before the government ordered a near total nationwide lockdown on March 14, said the head of epidemiology at Barcelona’s Hospital Clinic, Antoni Trilla.Unusually warm weather helped spread the virus.“The weather was fantastic during the last weeks of February and the first week of March and people were out on the streets, very close to one another,” said Rodriguez.This sped up the spread of the virus and “in very little time there was community transmission,” he added.Kisses and hugsLifestyle could also have played a role in a country where people spend a lot of time outside in groups eating out, having drinks, attending religious processions, protesting or just going for a walk.In Spain, as in Italy, “people hug and touch each other a lot, here people are constantly kissing, even at work,” said Ildefonso Hernandez, a professor of public health at the Miguel Hernandez University in Alicante.In addition, Spain has the most people living in flats of any European Union country, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.“Our cities are built vertically, there is a lot of density and this can also facilitate the transmission of the epidemic,” Rodriguez said.Close contact with seniorsWhile Spaniards have a long average lifespan and the country has a high number of seniors who are more vulnerable to the virus, its share of the population over 65 is lower than other nations that have suffered fewer COVID-19 deaths, such as Germany.But older people in Spain have more contact with younger family members who can pass on the virus to them, Ildefonso Hernandez said.“Older people in northern Europe are more secluded and there is more family distance,” he said.In Spain, families “are much tighter, the interaction between youths and seniors is very high,” he added.It is common for several generations to live under the same roof in Spain. The average age a young adult moves out of the home in Spain is 29.5, compared to 18.5 in Sweden and 21.1 in Denmark, according to Eurostat.Nursing homesFamilies also frequently visit relatives who live in nursing homes, which became tragic focal points of the pandemic in Spain, Hernandez said.The health ministry does not provide figures for the number of deaths from COVID-19 at nursing homes.But the governments of the two hardest-hit regions, Madrid and Catalonia, reported a combined total of around 8,000 confirmed and suspected deaths from the disease at retirement homes.Residents of nursing homes are “very old, very fragile,” said Trilla.“They are not healthcare establishments and were not prepared for this. That caused a fire of colossal proportions,” he added.Strained health care systemSpain’s public healthcare system is ranked in the top 10 in the world by the World Health Organization (WHO), but it has suffered deep spending cuts since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.While it has a strong primary care network, hospitals have fewer beds than the European average, which forced them to improvise during the pandemic.Like banks with little solvency “they did not pass the stress test,” said Guillem Lopez-Casasnovas, an economist and expert on healthcare systems at Barcelona’s Pompeu Fabra University who has worked as an advisor to the WHO.“When you live day to day, you get the most out of what you have, but you don’t have enough muscle to respond to a major stressor like now,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-has-spain-been-hit-so-hard-by-the-coronavirus-pandemic/story-Tg4mtBt3aklwY1QAPSkcoI.html
