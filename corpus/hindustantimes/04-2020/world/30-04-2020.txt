The number of patients in ICU is falling. We have so far succeeded in the first and most important task we set ourselves as a nation. To avoid the tragedy that engulfed other parts of the world. Because at no stage has our NHS been overwhelmed”.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageFive mega hospitals were quickly set up with help from the military, but after admissions slowed, the NHS was left with considerable capacity. Figures released on Friday said the number cases across settings in the UK were 171,253.Johnson said: “And it is thanks to that massive collective effort to shield the NHS that we avoided an uncontrollable and catastrophic epidemic where the reasonable worst case scenario was 500,000 deaths. And so I can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope”.Responding to growing demands that the government announce steps to exit the current lockdown, Johnson said he would set out a “comprehensive plan” next week, and highlighted ongoing efforts to develop a vaccine in the UK.The University of Oxford and the biopharma major AstraZeneca on Friday announced a not-for-profit collaboration for large scale production and distribution if a vaccine produced by the former currently under human trials succeeds by September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-over-26-700-deaths-pm-boris-says-uk-is-past-peak/story-ioHBMhAEuDF0iVayBvGbfP.html

Health officials issued new guidance on Wednesday that such staff should not be deployed in the frontline of treating patients stricken by the virus.NHA England figures show that 15 per cent of the dead were from the BAME (official categorised as Black and Asian Minority Ethnic) communities. The Indian sub-category constitutes 3 per cent, accounting for 560 deaths, followed by those of Caribbean and Pakistani origin.According to Kamlesh Khunti, medical expert at the University of Leicester, the reasons Indian and other non-white people figure more in the statistics, despite accounting for only 14 per cent of the UK population, include many coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, working in public-facing occupations, holding different cultural beliefs and behaviours or being at high risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.People of south Asian origin are considered more susceptible to diabetes, heart and other diseases. A majority of those passing away from coronavirus have underlying health conditions, which make recovery more challenging.Medical staff of Indian heritage who passed away include Jitendra Kumar Rathod, Manjeet Singh Riyat, Krishan Arora, Rajesh Kalraiya, Pooja Sharma, Jayesh Patel, Vivek Sharma, Kamlesh Kumar Masson, Amarante Dias, Sophie Fagan, Hamza Pacheeri and Amrik Bamotra.London boroughs such as Brent, Barnet, Ealing and Harrow with large population of Indian origin figure among the areas with the most number of cases. There are reports that funeral services catering to the Indian community have sees more cases than usual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indians-top-grim-list-of-non-whites-dying-of-covid-19-in-uk/story-CMQhHt5W7tY4UVRz0jS24O.html

30-04-2020||World||US intel: Coronavirus not manmade, still studying lab theory||US intelligence agencies have concluded that the new coronavirus was “not manmade or genetically modified” but say they are still examining whether the origins of the pandemic trace to contact with infected animals or an accident at a Chinese lab.The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the clearinghouse for the web ofspy agencies, comes as President Donald Trump and his allies have touted the as-yet-unproven theory that an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak, was the source of the global pandemic that has killed more than 220,000 worldwide.In recent days the Trump administration has sharpened his rhetoric on China, accusing the geopolitical foe and vital trading partner of failing to do act swiftly enough to stop the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19 or sound the alarm to the world about the outbreak.“The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,” said the statement. “The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”Trump addressed the theory earlier this month, saying, “More and more, we’re hearing the story.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added, “The mere fact that we don’t know the answers — that China hasn’t shared the answers — I think is very, very telling.”Pompeo also pressed China to let outside experts into the lab “so that we can determine precisely where this virus began.”Scientists say the virus arose naturally in bats. Even so, Pompeo and others have pointed fingers at an institute that is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It has done groundbreaking research tracing the likely origins of the SARS virus, finding new bat viruses and discovering how they could jump to people.“We know that there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology just a handful of miles away from where the wet market was,” Pompeo said two weeks ago. The institute has an address 8 miles, or 13 kilometers, from the market.US officials say the American Embassy in Beijing flagged concerns about potential safety issues at the lab in Wuhan in 2018, but have yet to find any evidence the virus originated there nearly two years later.The Chinese government said Thursday that any claims that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory are “unfounded and purely fabricated out of nothing.”Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang cited the institute’s director, Yuan Zhiming, as saying the lab strictly implements bio-security procedures that would prevent the release of any pathogen.“I would like to point out again that the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue, and it should be studied by scientists and professionals,” Geng said.Geng also criticizedpoliticians who have suggested China should be held accountable for the global pandemic, saying they should spend their time on “better controlling the epidemic situation at home.”But a Chinese government spokesman, Zhao Lijian, demonstrated that China was not above sowing confusion in the face of the pandemic. He tweeted in March the falsehood that the virus might have come from theArmy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-intel-coronavirus-not-manmade-still-studying-lab-theory/story-8nDJ8McXNeAITQL4XgOkWN.html
30-04-2020||World||California to shut down beaches, US toll and job-losses continue to rise||California state could shut down its beaches and public parks even as it takes tentative steps to join other states that are reopening for business by lifting stay-at-home orders that worked so successfully and prevented a full-fledged flare-up of Covid-19 cases after an initial surge.California and Washington are often cited as model states for how they shut out the virus. But they are now getting ready to reopen as others. Washington has already allowed some businesses to resume and California governor Gavin Newsom has unveiled a broad outline of a four-phase opening.For now, he is not taking chances and is expected to issue orders Thursday shutting down beaches and some parks after the crowds that descended on them last weekend.“This virus doesn’t take the weekends off,” Newsom said during his daily Covid-19 briefing. “The only thing that will set us back is people stopping to practice physical distancing and appropriate social distancing. That’s the only thing that’s going to slow down our ability to reopen this economy.”Many states have reopened in recent days as the number of news Covid-19 cases continued to slow down, as have those for hospitalizations and fatalities. Cumulative totals also continued to look daunting — the number of confirmed infections rose by 27,327 in the last 24 hours to 1.04 million and the toll to went up by 2,612 to 60,999 Thursday.The toll on the economy and the livelihood of Americans also continued to rise. New data released Thursday showed 3.8 million more people filed for unemployment benefits last week, taking the six-week total of people left jobless by the lockdown ordered by states to combat the epidemic to 30 million. States now want to remove these restrictions. So does President Donald Trump. He told reporters Wednesday that the federal social-distancing guidelines that expire on Thursday will be “fading out”. He added that the states “getting it going, and we are opening our country again”. Many of those restrictions are now included in the reopening guidelines, public health officials explained.New York, the epicenter of the American epidemic, is also taking baby steps towards and announced plans to roll out a phased “unpause” from May 15. New cases and fatalities are going down but not as quickly as desired, as Governor Andrew Cuomo has stated repeatedly.In a sign of continued challenges confronting state, 100 bodies were found piled up in unrefrigerated trucks outside a funeral home in New York city Wednesday. The city has arranged for refrigerated truck to temporarily store bodies to ease the pressure on overwhelmed funeral homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-to-shut-down-beaches-us-toll-and-job-losses-continue-to-rise/story-ycq8bwTES6Jl3ir14wce2O.html

No one was injured.The unidentified person fired multiple rounds from what some reports said was a high-powered assault rifle.“This morning at approximately 2:15 am, US Secret Service officers responded to the Embassy of Cuba following reports of shots fired,” the Secret Service said in a statement.“One individual was arrested for being in possession of an unregistered firearm as well as unregistered ammunition, assault with the intent to kill, and possession of a high capacity feed device.“No injuries were reported at the scene.”Washington’s police department confirmed the incident but said an investigation was in the hands of the Secret Service, which often handles investigations involving foreign diplomats. Local media said the person arrested was a man who fired about 30 rounds from an assault rifle-type weapon.The embassy, located on 16th Street at the edge of the Adams Morgan neighborhood, a normally bustling area full of bars and restaurants but which has been stilled by the coronavirus shutdown.The administration of President Donald Trump has chilled relations with Havana, reversing course after an opening initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama.In October 2017, it expelled 15 Cuban diplomats after a rash of incidents in which US embassy staff in Cuba reported as yet unexplained head pains, dizziness and hearing loss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/assailant-opens-fire-on-cuban-embassy-in-washington-one-person-arrested-report/story-4uqJWmkspNCqOJqNYnBJTL.html
30-04-2020||World||Labour now keen to rebuild trust with India, Indians in UK||Labour leader Keir Starmer on Thursday made the first moves to rebuild trust with New Delhi and the Indian diaspora by insisting that controversial issues such as Jammu and Kashmir should not be allowed to divide communities in the United Kingdom.The Labour party under former leader Jeremy Corbyn came in for stringent criticism from large sections of the Indian community in the UK and India for passing a resolution at the party’s conference in September last that called for external i ntervention in the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.While the ministry of external affairs in New Delhi rejected the resolution, calling it “uninformed and unfounded”, the party raised hackles in the UK before the December election when some of its members were perceived as supporting violence before the Indian high commission. The developments had some impact on the fortunes of Labour candidates during the election, while the resolution remains part of its approach to the Kashmir dispute. Starmer’s olive branch was received with cautious optimism in Indian circles. Starmer’s overture came following a meeting with the executive of the Labour Friends of India, a lobby group within the party, co-chaired by Rajesh Agarwal, deputy mayor of London. The leader also promised to work towards fielding more Indian-origin candidates in elections.Starmer said: “Britons of Indian origin contribute so much to the UK and to the Labour party. I’m committed to working closely with Labour Friends of Indian to rebuild trust with the community”.“We must not allow issues of the sub-continent to divide communities here. Any constitutional issues in India are a matter for the Indian Parliament and Kashmir is a bilateral issue for India and Pakistan to resolve peacefully. Labour is an internationalist Party and stands for the defence of human rights everywhere”.Starmer, who was seen as a unifying candidate during the party leader’s election, is due to meet the Indian high commissioner shortly. The shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy had an interaction with envoy Ruchi Ghanashyam this week.Starmer added: “A Labour Government under my leadership will be determined to build even stronger business links with India and to co-operate on the global stage on issues such as climate change. I look forward to meeting the Indian high commissioner in due course to open a renewed dialogue between the Labour Party and the people of India.”Traditionally the party of choice for the Indian community, Labour has been haemorrhaging support in recent elections, with many young, aspirational members gravitating towards the Conservative party, particularly since David Cameron became party leader in 2005.Agrawal said: “I really welcome his commitment to rebuilding strong links between the Labour party and the Indian community. This has been a great start and Keir has achieved a lot in the short span of couple of weeks”.“Labour Friends of India will work closely with him and will continue to promote UK-India ties as well as continuing to raise any issues from the community to the leadership”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/labour-now-keen-to-rebuild-trust-with-india-indians-in-uk/story-KyaxUAJGMCTXvGkKuGIYBL.html
30-04-2020||World||Italy PM Conte battles local leaders over Covid-19 lockdown||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte Thursday criticised regional chiefs for defying the government and lifting lockdown measures early, saying it risked undoing efforts to prevent a second coronavirus wave.He also rebutted opposition accusations that he was robbing Italians of their constitutional rights.“Initiatives involving less restrictive measures are contrary to national rules and are therefore to all intents and purposes illegitimate,” Conte told parliament.Regions south of Rome have suffered relatively few deaths from Covid-19 and local officials have been among the most vocal opponents of the two-month shutdown.Calabria in the south allowed bars and restaurants with outside tables to open to the public on Thursday.But areas of the north have also begun to open up.Veneto region, which was among the first to be hit by the virus but has suffered far fewer deaths than neighbouring Lombardy, lifted a range of restrictions including on takeaways, pizzerias and some shops on Monday.“We cannot allow the efforts made to be in vain because of rashness at this delicate stage. Moving from the policy of ‘let’s close everything’ to ‘let’s reopen everything’, would risk irreversibly compromising these efforts,” Conte said.While some businesses have been allowed to reopen, the lockdown will not begin to be lifted nationwide until May 4 and even then it will happen gradually over a series of weeks.‘Freedom’Conte said officials would carry out some 150,000 tests in May to see how many people were developing antibodies to fight the virus. An app to trace contacts between potentially infected people would be voluntary, he said.Evidence of a rise in infections could lead to restrictive measures being reintroduced locally.The virus reproduction number (R0) in Italy was currently between 0.5 and 0.7 -- meaning 10 virus sufferers infect between five and seven other people. Should it rise again to 1.0, intensive care units would once again be overwhelmed, he said.Conte’s speech to the lower house was delayed after opposition members complained that the prime minister was not wearing a mask.The League party, whose members took off their own obligatory masks, forcing the speaker to temporarily suspend the session, spent Wednesday night occupying both chambers of parliament.The far-right party’s head Matteo Salvini has accused Conte of extending the lockdown because it was the easy option and stripping Italians of their fundamental freedoms.He has said his party was deliberating whether to join grassroots protests called for Saturday.Conte said the accusations were “profoundly unjust” and the saving of lives was a “primary good” that trumped other rights.His lockdown may be unpopular but it was not an electoral programme designed to please anyone, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-pm-conte-battles-local-leaders-over-covid-19-lockdown/story-qn8So9Om0yUboMOAt4NU7M.html

But the Boris Johnson government and experts are working to put in place facilities to produce the vaccine on a large scale if it succeeds.Under the agreement, AstraZeneca would be responsible for development and worldwide manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine.Pascal Soriot of AstraZeneca, said: “As Covid-19 continues its grip on the world, the need for a vaccine to defeat the virus is urgent. This collaboration brings together the University of Oxford’s world-class expertise in vaccinology and AstraZeneca’s global development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities”.“Our hope is that, by joining forces, we can accelerate the globalisation of a vaccine to combat the virus and protect people from the deadliest pandemic in a generation.”Alok Sharma, business secretary, added: “This collaboration between Oxford University and AstraZeneca is a vital step that could help rapidly advance the manufacture of a coronavirus vaccine”.The Oxford vaccine project is among over 80 across the globe working to produce the vaccine, as the death toll and number of cases continue to mount in various countries.Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, said: “Our partnership with AstraZeneca will be a major force in the struggle against pandemics for many years to come. We believe that together we will be in a strong position to start immunising against coronavirus once we have an effective approved vaccine”.“Sadly, the risk of new pandemics will always be with us and the new research centre will enhance the world’s preparedness and our speed of reaction the next time we face such a challenge.”The Oxford vaccine entered Phase I clinical trials last week to study safety and efficacy in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years, across five trial centres in England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-astrazeneca-pact-if-covid-19-vaccine-trial-succeeds/story-2PnHuUjiBsUFg894982oKL.html

It has infected more than 1 million Americans and has thrown the US economy into a deep recession.“There are many things I can do,” Trump told Reuters. “We’re looking for what happened.”Geng reiterated during Thursday’s briefing that China was a victim of the epidemic and not its accomplice, adding that attempts by “certain politicans” to shift the blame away from their poor handling of the outbreak to Beijing would only “expose the problems of the US itself”. “The US should know this: the enemy is the virus, not China,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-has-no-interest-in-meddling-in-2020-us-presidential-polls/story-a5lIqSzovrY8loQ0R06hEK.html

So they will be brought back from Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Estates. Some flights will be operated from Sudan, Kenya and the UK,” Dawn news quoted Yusuf as saying.The number of Covid-19 cases reached 15,759 in Pakistan after 874 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours, health authorities said. Three hundred forty six people have died of the disease so far in the country.Punjab province is the worst hit with 6,061 cases, followed by Sindh with 5,695, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa with 2,313, Balochistan with 978, Gilgit-Baltistan with 333, Islamabad with 313 and Pakistan-cccupied Kashmir with 66 cases.So far 4,052 patients have recovered while the total active cases in the country were 11,361.Pakistan’s Ministry of National Health Services said that local transmission was 84 per cent and foreign travel 16 per cent.The government said that 3,560 patients were admitted across the country in 717 hospitals with Covid-19 facilities, while others were isolated at their homes.Among the high profile people who got infected by the coronavirus includes Governor of Pakistan’s southern Sindh province Imran Ismail, a very close aide of Prime Minister Imran Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-has-lowest-covid-19-mortality-rate-says-minister-as-country-records-highest-single-day-fatalities/story-miOdsaASrBakVIocCVYEHK.html
30-04-2020||World||SEALs tried to locate US citizen taken captured by Afghan militants||In the days following the capture of an American contractor in Afghanistan earlier this year, Navy commandos raided a village and detained suspected members of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network while the US intelligence community tried to track the cellphones of the man and his captors, The Associated Press has learned.While the circumstances surrounding the abduction remain unclear, the previously unreported operation described by multiple American officials over the past month shed new light on early efforts to locate Mark R. Frerichs, a contractor from Illinois whose disappearance has been shrouded in mystery and whose case has been the subject of minimal public discussion by the US government.The new details emerge as violence and political infighting in Kabul threaten to scuttle a Taliban peace deal with the US Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo voiced frustrations after a failed attempt to mediate a power struggle between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and political rival Dr. Abdullah Abdullah. The Trump administration said it would cut $1 billion in aid to Afghanistan.Washington has urged Kabul to release Taliban prisoners, which is part of the peace agreement, arguing the detainees were at risk of spreading the coronavirus.But there are no public indications Frerichs, a Navy veteran, has been part of negotiations between the US and Taliban leadership, or that his release is part of any peace deal.“The Taliban kidnapped my brother in January. In February, the US signed a peace deal with the Taliban. My brother wasn’t part of the deal. Now we are arranging for the Taliban and Afghan government to exchange thousands of prisoners,” Charlene Cakora, one of Frerichs’ sisters, said in a statement provided to the AP. “Why can’t we make an American hostage be one of them?”Frerichs’ father, Art, said in a statement that though he has faith in President Donald Trump and Pompeo, “I just need them to tell their people negotiating with the Taliban that America won’t lift a finger until my son comes home. He’s a veteran. This is America. We don’t leave people behind.”The Pentagon and US Special Operations Command declined to comment on the SEALs raid. The rescue effort is being coordinated through the FBI-led, multiagency Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which said in a statement that it was working with its partners to ensure “that Mark Frerichs and all Americans held hostage abroad are returned home.” It encouraged anyone with information about the case to come forward.The State Department said it was aware of an American who’d been abducted in Afghanistan.“The welfare, safety and security of Americans is the Trump Administration’s highest priority,” the department said. “The United States will continue to push for the safe return of this and all other U.S citizens through all relevant channels.”A former US national security official who is advising the Frerichs family called on Washington peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to resolve the situation and that “he is aware of Mark’s presence, but it does not appear yet that he understands that he needs to get him home.” The former official insisted on anonymity to speak candidly since the official sometimes works with the Trump administration.U.S. officials believe Frerichs, 57, of Lombard, Illinois, was held for at least some time in Khost, an eastern province along the border with Pakistan and its so-called tribal regions, a mountainous area that has historically been a haven for Taliban and al-Qaeda militants.The former national security official said that Frerichs has been in Afghanistan for about a decade working on commercial projects and was not a US government contractor.“The first 96 hours is crucial,” a senior US government official briefed on the case told the AP on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. “If they’re not recovered in the first few days, it becomes harder every minute after.”Though no formal demands are known to have been made, US intelligence officials believe Frerichs was captured by members of the Haqqani network, a militant group aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Haqqanis have strong links to North Waziristan, a tribal region in Pakistan, south of Afghanistan’s Khost province.The Obama administration designated the Haqqani network as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012 for its ties with the Taliban and the group’s attacks on US military and civilian personnel. Though the Haqqanis are known to carry out assassinations and kidnappings for ransom, Taliban leadership has not acknowledged Frerichs’ capture.“I have not received any information about him,” said a Taliban source who asked not to be named. “There has been no clue despite my contacts with every side to get information.”In November, the Afghan government released three prominent members of the Haqqani network in exchange for an American citizen and an Australian professor abducted in 2016. Pompeo characterized the prisoner swap as a “goodwill gesture.”Rep. Michael Waltz, a Florida Republican and Army veteran who led the teams that searched for Bowe Bergdahl after the Army soldier abandoned his post in 2009 and wound up captured by the Taliban, said the Taliban frequently hides American hostages until they can move them over the border into Pakistan.“I have real concerns about suggestions that the Taliban are serious about peace, that the Taliban are upholding their end of the deal when — as we speak today — they are holding a former Navy veteran and American citizen hostage that they took, again, during the peace negotiations,” Waltz said in an interview.The search area for Frerichs began in Khost and extended south to the province of Kandahar, according to the senior US government official and a second official at the Defense Department.Members of the elite Naval Special Warfare Development Group, more familiarly known as SEAL Team Six, who were involved in the Frerichs effort had spent late January working to recover the bodies of two American service members who died when their aircraft crash-landed in Ghazni in central Afghanistan, according to the two US officials.The bitter winter weather that limited overhead surveillance of the airplane wreckage by US military drones also worked against officials during the later SEAL operation on the night of Feb. 3. Periods of poor-to-nonexistent visibility ultimately delayed a planned intelligence-gathering operation on a known Taliban location, said the senior US government official, who has direct knowledge of the raid.Once the weather cleared, the SEALs loaded onto helicopters and flew to the undisclosed location. The senior official declined to disclose the exact location of the province for operational security reasons.The senior US government official and the Defense Department source with knowledge of the raid, who also requested anonymity, said the SEAL platoon was not met with any Taliban resistance and that once at the compound, they detained several alleged Haqqani militants and uncovered a weapons cache. It’s not known if the weapons cache was destroyed at the scene or given to Afghan security forces.The suspected Haqqani members were questioned about Frerichs’ whereabouts and ultimately turned over to the Afghan government, according to the senior US government official.On Feb. 4, American intelligence officials received a report that Frerichs had possibly been moved to Quetta, Pakistan, a historical haven for the Taliban, the two officials said. But the information was deemed not credible enough to warrant a special operations mission, according to the senior US government official.The report also conflicted with signals intelligence US officials had at the time. Signals intelligence is information gathered from the electronic signals that are broadcast from devices like portable radios and cellphones. The information can be used to track the movements of individuals or eavesdrop on conversations, known in the spy business as low-level voice intercepts.US intelligence officials continued to receive location pings from the suspected cellphones of Frerichs and his captors, but the trail went cold on Feb. 5, according to the senior US government and Defense Department officials.While the senior US government official would not say where exactly the last location ping for Frerichs came from, the official said it was near where he was captured. The AP was not able to determine how the US intelligence community knew to target these specific cellphones to monitor.“Operationally, the reason why time is critical in a kidnapping is because you can close the distance quicker, ideally immediately or by utilizing sources,” said the senior US government official. “This is not the case right now. He could be two houses down from where he was taken and we would not know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seals-tried-to-locate-us-citizen-taken-captured-by-afghan-militants/story-o4zp4nw7DNNWADftBa9PxI.html

The Kremlin this week extended until May 11 a “non-working” period when Russians would stay at home but still receive their salaries as part of sweeping efforts to contain the virus.Yet the measure has brought uncertainty to the economy and business owners struggling to pay full salaries to employees while shutting their doors to customers.Despite the steady increase in cases, Putin said that Russia may begin to gradually lift different quarantine regimes throughout the country from mid-May. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Yet Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on Wednesday extended a ban on entry for foreigners into the country, which was due to expire Thursday, until “the fight against the infection is over and the epidemic situation has improved.”The pandemic has thwarted several major political events for the Kremlin this year, with Putin cancelling a massive military parade on May 9 commemorating the 75th anniversary of victory in World War II. The Kremlin also postponed an April 22 vote on landmark constitutional reforms, which would have paved the way for Putin, 67, to potentially stay in power until 2036.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-witnesses-record-daily-spike-coronavirus-cases-top-1-00-000/story-gA3sMeDYvffHNRKjFYzeDP.html

As of Tuesday, the country had counted nearly 72,000 positive cases, 5,017 deaths, and a 7% death rate.When asked during the same news conference about mounting fatalities, President Jair Bolsonaro answered, “So what? What do you want me to do about it?” before joking that even though his middle name means messiah in Portuguese, “I can’t make miracles.”The leader has refused to follow World Health Organization guidance on combating the virus throughout the outbreak. On the domestic front, he’s criticized governors who called for quarantines, fired his health minister for advocating for restrictions and containment measures, and personally took to the streets without a protective face mask, shaking hands and visiting crowded bakeries and markets as a rebellious gesture.Even as increasing numbers of Brazilians fall victim to the virus, some businesses across the country have taken Bolsonaro’s lead. Popular clothing store Hering announced Tuesday it would immediately reopen their 104 stores, and more than 50 shopping malls are back in business, welcoming crowds of masked consumers.In other places in the country, the outbreak is ravaging fragile health systems: hospitals overwhelmed, and beds and ventilators in short supply. Images of hastily-dug cemetery plots in Sao Paulo are splashed across front pages of international newspapers. Some local leaders, including the governors of Ceara and Sao Paulo states and the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, have extended their quarantine periods to cope with the escalating damage inflicted by what the president had at one pointed derided as just “a little flu.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-curve-in-brazil-on-the-rise-death-toll-hits-5000/story-6QikfwvS2vf1WUJ8IsEVRL.html
30-04-2020||World||‘Major strategic achievement’: Xi Jinping hails China’s Covid-19 battle||Chinese President Xi Jinping has termed China’s battle against Covid-19 as a major strategic achievement, as the ruling Communist Party is all set to hold the postponed Parliament session on May 22 amid a steady decline in the coronavirus cases. China’s National Health Commission (NHC) on Thursday said the country reported only four new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the total number to 82,862, while no death due to the disease was registered. The virus has claimed 4,633 lives in the country. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here China’s arduous efforts to contain the coronavirus have brought a decisive outcome to the fight of defending Hubei and its capital city Wuhan, Xi told a high-powered Central Committee meeting of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on Wednesday. The nationwide battle against the epidemic has gained major strategic achievements, the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Xi as saying. Xi said Hubei, including Wuhan, should continue strengthening community-level epidemic prevention and control. He asked officials to make efforts to contain the virus case at Heilongjiang Province bordering Russia, where a large number of Chinese returning from Russian cities were tested positive for coronavirus.The meeting emphasised the need to accelerate work resumption and business reopening, help companies especially micro, small and medium-sized enterprises address difficulties, and promote the recovery of pillar industries such as auto manufacturing, electronic information, new materials and bio-medicine, the report said.The meeting stressed accelerating farm production and expanding sales channels for agricultural products to boost income for farmers. The Hubei province and its capital Wuhan -- where the COVID-19 first emerged in December last year -- were the epicentres of the deadly virus, which later turned into a pandemic, bringing the world to a standstill.The Covid-19 pandemic continues its explosive growth overseas, Xi said, noting the mounting pressure to prevent imported infections and the growing complexity of stemming domestic epidemic resurgence. Xi demanded no relaxation in epidemic control to safeguard the hard-earned achievements, the report said.According to the NHC, all the four Covid-19 patients reported on Wednesday were imported cases.The number of imported cases rose to 1,664, including 13 patients in severe condition, it said. The CPC Central Committee meet was held amid mounting pressure for an international inquiry into the origin of coronavirus and the allegations that the deadly virus was originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) before it spread across the world and wreaked havoc.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage China has come under increasing global pressure over lack of transparency in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far infected over 3,193,960 people and claimed more than 227,640 lives across the world.State-run CGTN TV on Wednesday reported that American scientists are working with their Chinese counterparts to investigate the origin of the novel coronavirus, a prime demand of US President Donald Trump and several other countries. The report said the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDCP) is facilitating the cooperation between Dr Ian Lipkin, Director for Centre for Infection and Immunity of Columbia University, and Prof Lu Jinhai of Sun-Yat-Sen University of Guangzhou to conduct the probe.“The two are working together to determine whether the virus emerged elsewhere in China before Wuhan in December” last year, the report said.It is not yet clear whether the investigation has the official consent of the US government, it said.Besides the US, the UK, Australia and Germany have also called for more transparency from Beijing on the COVID-19 origin.China on Wednesday announced to hold the annual meeting of its Parliament --National People’s Congress (NPC), which was postponed in March due to Covid-19, from May 22, signalling that the pandemic which paralysed the country for over three months is finally under control.Official media said the meeting period of the NPC, which has over 3,000 deputies, could be shortened and held through video link. However, no official announcement has been made so far.The annual session of the national advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), is also expected to be held in Beijing on May 21, official media reported.Dubbed as the annual political season, the NPC and CPPCC sessions -- which together have over 5,000 members, are held every year in early March during which the CPC unveils its national agenda for the year, including the annual budget and formulates new laws.According to the National Health Commission, 77,610 coronavirus patients have been recovered so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-strategic-achievement-xi-jinping-hails-china-s-covid-19-battle/story-K8sy0mUUDcjaKZ2NIhQsgJ.html

30-04-2020||World||US finds tentative cure for Covid-19, hunts chutes for a vaccine||A sliver of hope ran through a nation ravaged by a new virus and shuttered at home after a top US government scientist announced Wednesday that data from ongoing federal trials demonstrated that an antiviral drug can significantly shorten the duration of the illness and hasten recovery from coronavirus.News reports indicated the US Food and Drug Administration could fast-track the approval process to make this medicine, remdesivir by Gilead, available widely.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Anthony Fauci, a top epidemiologist and member of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task-force told reporters, prefacing the announcement as “quite good news”.The trial, which was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that Fauci leads, showed “a drug can block the virus”, Fauci added and described it as “a new standard of care” for treating Covid-19.The top epidemiologist, who has become the most trusted member of the task force, compared the development to the trial 36 years ago in 1986 that led to the HIV antiviral AZT, a drug that had then shown only “modest” efficacy but became the base for better and more improved treatments over the years.Remdesivir is not a vaccine and cannot prevent Covid-19. It can treat Covid-19 better than any other drug around now.It could not be immediately ascertained if remdesivir will be available in India at the same time as in the US and some countries in Europe.But industry experts have speculated in recent days that any company that finds a cure or vaccine to the virus that has infected millions around the world and killed upwards of 200,000 people may have to look to countries with established production capabilities to produce enough for not any single country but beyond.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Early data about the efficacy of the drug, as revealed by Fauci, show that in randomized placebo-controlled trials (in which some patients are administered the drug and others are given inactive mock alternatives, with neither cohort aware of what they are getting) spanning multiple countries, mortality was lower among remdesivir recipients by 8% to placebo’s 11%, and the recovery periods were 11 days to 14 for the two cohorts.The second data point was the more important of the two, according to medical experts. “The primary endpoint was the time to recover -- namely, the ability to be discharged,” Fauci said while announcing the “good news”.And it was celebrated thus across the country from the White House, where President Trump happily acknowledged it as much as he let Fauci do the explaining. Investor interest perked as well despite dismal projections all around of an economy shrinking at a far greater rate than since 2008.Most TV and radio news outfits kicked off their programmes Wednesday with the “good news” about remdesivir even as they went on to urge caution.Americans have grown skeptical about claims of touted cures — the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and even some household disinfectants — as the epidemic has continued to cross new and grimmer milestones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-finds-tentative-cure-for-covid-19-hunts-chutes-for-a-vaccine/story-Ckcj4Z3yyIGhvCjlA3H2jO.html
30-04-2020||World||Antiviral drug remdesivir could hold promise in fight against Covid-19: Study||An investigational antiviral drug could hold promise in devising a treatment for Covid-19. In a trial, evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of the drug remdesivir in coronavirus patients, it was found that the administration of the drug in patients with a severe manifestation of Covid-19 achieved improvement. “The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist who oversaw the study, told reporters at the White House as reported by news agency AFP.It was found that coronavirus patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status when compared to those taking a 5-day treatment course.The trial was conducted by Gilead Sciences, Inc., a research-based biopharmaceutical company headquartered in California, US, with operations in over 30 countries. This study determined if a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir, would achieve similar results as the 10-day course of the drug. The effectiveness of the drug was measured in terms of clinical improvement reported in patients ranging from improvement in breathing, increased level of oxygen support to hospital discharge. “Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry,” the study stated.  Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.The study found that patients who received remdesivir within 10 days of the onset of Covid-19 symptoms had improved outcomes when compared to those who were treated after over 10 days of symptom onset. Nearly 50% of patients in the 5-day treatment showed clinical improvement in 10 days while for those in the 10-day treatment group it was 11 days to report improvement in health. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14. “These data are encouraging as they indicate that patients who received a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir experienced similar clinical improvement as patients who received a 10-day treatment course,” said Aruna Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, and one of the lead investigators of the study. “While additional data are still needed, these results help to bring a clearer understanding of how treatment with remdesivir may be optimized, if proven safe and effective,” she added.Remdesivir is not licensed or approved globally. Multiple studies are underway to access if the agent is a safe and effective mode of treatment for coronavirus. Experts have called for further research on the drug and its effectiveness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antiviral-drug-remdesivir-could-hold-promise-in-fight-against-covid-19-study/story-ukYAC7MJubnx9vAUuXAAvO.html
30-04-2020||World||Half of the world’s workers could lose livelihoods: ILO||Nearly half of the entire global workforce is in immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed by the coronavirus pandemic, the International Labour Organization (ILO) warned on Wednesday.The UN agency said the risk fell on those workers in the informal economy, and three-quarters of them, some 1.6 billion people were at risk in the second quarter of 2020.The ILO said an expected further sharp decline in working hours, due to the Covid-19 crisis, meant that these workers were in “immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed”.In its third report on the coronavirus crisis, the ILO warned of the impact on the most vulnerable in the labour market, who are often in the hardest-hit sectors.The 1.6 billion people stand in line to suffer “massive damage to their ability to earn a living”, said ILO director-general Guy Ryder.The ILO said the global workforce was 3.3 billion people, of which more than two billion worked in the informal economy - in jobs characterised by a lack of basic protections, no possibility to work from home and no income replacement during the lockdown.“Staying home means losing their jobs, and without wages, they cannot eat,” the report said.It said that almost 1.6 billion informal economy workers, accounting for 76% of informal employment worldwide, were significantly impacted by lockdown measures. More than 95% of them are working in units of fewer than 10 workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/half-of-the-world-s-workers-could-lose-livelihoods-ilo/story-6ebZl0B6WeotoMluWgo7gM.html
30-04-2020||World||South Africa records highest daily Covid infections as easing of lockdown approaches||South Africa reported its highest daily coronavirus infection in a 24-hour cycle Wednesday, just a day before the countrywide lockdown moves down to the phase-4 of a five-phase plan to combat Covid-19.There had been a 73% daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 infections, with 354 new cases taking the total to 5,350, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said Wednesday evening. There were also 10 deaths overnight, raising the toll toll to 103.The Health Department attributed these large figures to a proportionate increase in the number of tests conducted.“The total number of tests conducted to date is 197,127, of which 11,630 were done in the last 24 hours. This is the highest number of tests done in a 24-hour period, representing a 66% increase relative to the previous day’s tally. “Additionally, we have also recorded the highest Covid positive result yield from a 24-hour cycle of testing at 3%,” the statement said.The department also expressed concern that that the number of new cases in the Western Cape Province had almost doubled from 133 on Tuesday to 264 on Wednesday.“In the past 24 hours, the Western Cape contributed to 75% of the total new cases nationally, while only contributing 30% of total tests over the same period.“These concerning trends have prompted us to plan for additional support to be deployed to the province to help contain the spread of Covid-19. The province has been asked to recruit additional personnel and 30 Cuban doctors will also be sent to reinforce the human resource capacity.” As many as 200 doctors from Cuba who arrived in South Africa on Monday are currently in quarantine before being deployed to assist local medical personnel across the country.South Africa has been on an extended 45-day national lockdown that ends on April 30.From May 1, the country will be on the phase-4 of the lockdown, during which there will be slight changes, mainly allowing prepared food deliveries and the sale of cigarettes, both of which were previously prohibited.Some industries will be allowed to gradually start operating again, with strict restrictions regarding number of workers, social distancing and PPE availability.A decision which was expected this week on the reopening of schools and other educational institutions has been deferred to an indefinite date amid reports that many schools will not be ready for the required social distancing and sanitisation processes; as well as concerns raised by both parents and teachers about the risks involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-records-highest-daily-covid-infections-as-easing-of-lockdown-approaches/story-ucVvwlMi2MihLxCCzmMGMI.html
30-04-2020||World||Covid-19: 35 US states release formal opening plans||As many as 35 of the 50 American states have released formal opening plans, as US President Donald Trump on Wednesday exuded confidence that much better days are ahead for the country that has seen more than 61,000 deaths over the past two months due to Covid-19.“We mourn, and I have to say this so strongly we mourn every life tragically lost to the invisible enemy. And we are heartened that the worst of the pain and suffering is going to be behind us,” Trump said, during a White House roundtable with industry executives on “Opening Up America Again”.By Wednesday, more than 61,000 Americans have lost their lives due to coronavirus and over 10 lakhs have tested positive with Covid 19; the highest for any country in the world. Most industries and business activities remain shut and over 95 percent of the country’s 330 million population have been under stay-at-home orders. Over 26 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits and the number is expected to go up to more than 30 million.The US economy has come to a standstill. It grew by negative 4.8 percent in the first quarter. On Wednesday, Trump exuded confidence that economy would be back to track by the fourth quarter.“We think we really have crossed a big boundary, and much better days are ahead, and I often say I see the light at the end of the tunnel very strongly,” Trump said.“We are seeing tremendous pent-up demand, and it’s a beautiful thing to see, so it’s wonderful to have America industry leaders, and that is what you are, true leaders to the White House,” he told the industry leaders.“This demand is going to be incredible. I think next year is going to be an incredible year for our economy. I think the fourth quarter is going to be really, really good,” he added.Thanks to the devotion of the American people, the number of new cases continues to decline, the United States has now conducted nearly six million tests, far more than any other nation, the President said. “And so much has been learned about what we are fighting, and if it does rear up a little bit in the fall or even a lot, we will be able to put it out. We will put out the embers,” he added.Vice President Mike Pence said he is encouraged by the progress, and even the hotspots around the country cases are levelling off and in some areas going down. “Hospitalizations are declining even in the greater New York City area.” “That is a testament to the American people to the way the American people now nearly 45 days ago embraced the guidelines to slow the spread. And as we come to the end of this mitigation period, states across the country have all embraced those same mitigation and social distancing efforts,” he said. “The American people have put them into practice. We have saved lives, we have protected the vulnerable, we have reserved our healthcare system, and we are well on our way to healing our land,” he added.It was just on April 16 that Trump laid out a plan for opening up America again. “And we sit here today. I am informed that 35 states have already released formal opening plans many of which are consulting directly with our team here in the administration and we are going to continue to work with all of them,” Pence said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-35-us-states-release-formal-opening-plans/story-c9CFRTXMMvNm0PzNnQHJ5K.html
30-04-2020||World||Trump says he won’t extend Covid-19 social distancing guidelines||President Donald Trump said Wednesday the federal government will not be extending its coronavirus social distancing guidelines once they expire Thursday, and his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, predicted that by July the country will be “really rocking again.”Meanwhile, Trump said he plans to resume official travel with a trip to Arizona next week. And he said he’s hoping to hold mass campaign rallies in the coming months with thousands of supporters, even though medical experts have said there is little hope of having a vaccine by then.Click here for full Covid-19 coveragePutting a positive face on the latest grim numbers — the US death toll has now surpassed those in the Vietnam War — Trump delivered his daily upbeat update and Kushner described the administration’s much-criticized response to the pandemic as “a great success story.”Trump also talked up the good news the day provided: hopeful results for a possible Covid-19 treatment. But the government announced dismal new economic numbers as the pandemic took hold and shut down much of the country.The US economy shrank at a 4.8% annual rate in first quarter of the year — a precursor to far grimmer reports that are expected this summer from the severe recession triggered by the pandemic.The White House has been trying to pivot to a new stage of the crisis, focused on efforts to reopen the nation’s economy state-by-state amid concerns that lifting restrictions too quickly and without sufficient testing and contact tracing will spur a resurgence.“We’re heartened that the worst of the pain and suffering is going to be behind us,” Trump said as he led a roundtable with executives from companies like Hilton and Toyota.Trump laid out a vision of a return to pre-coronavirus normalcy — “with or without” a vaccine — with packed restaurants and filled stadiums. That vision flies in the face of sober assessments from doctors who say the country will need to embrace a “new normal” that includes extended social distancing and mask-wearing.“I don’t want people to get used to this,” Trump told reporters. “I see the new normal being what it was three months ago.”To underscore his confidence, Trump announced that he plans to resume out-of-state travel after spending more than a month mostly cooped up in the White House. He said he’s planning a trip to Arizona next week, followed by a possible trip to Ohio, even as much of the country remains under effective lockdown with all but essential travel banned.“We’re going to start to move around and hopefully in the not-too-distant future, we’ll have some massive rallies and people will be sitting next to each other,” he said, adding that having people spaced out in accordance with social distancing guidelines “wouldn’t look too good.”Click here for Covid-19 updatesHe didn’t say exactly when he envisioned such rallies returning, but said the timing would depend, in part, on the states, since some have had far fewer cases than others. The federal government and most states have urged residents to avoid mass gatherings and to remain at least six feet apart.The announcement came after Trump said he will not be extending the White House’s “30 Days to Slow the Spread” guidelines when they expire Thursday.“They’ll be fading out because now the governors are doing it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he met with John Bel Edwards, the Democratic governor of Louisiana.Those guidelines — which were originally supposed to last 15 days and were then extended an additional 30 — encouraged Americans to work from home and avoid restaurants, group gatherings and discretionary travel and advised older Americans and those with serious underlying health conditions to isolate themselves.Vice President Mike Pence said the guidelines have been incorporated into the new guidance issued by the White House earlier this month that lays out how states can gradually ease restrictions and begin to reopen as the rate of new cases slows.Edwards, who recently extended Louisiana’s stay-at-home order through May 15, is currently under fire from Republican lawmakers in his state. While he was in Washington, some GOP legislators were trying to rally support to take the extraordinary step of trying to override the governor’s emergency decision-making.But Trump commended Edwards on the job he’s done after New Orleans became one of the nation’s coronavirus hot spots. “I just wanted to congratulate you,” Trump said.At the same time, Trump’s campaign released a digital ad praising elements of the federal response. It is set to reach residents of 17 battleground states featuring Democratic governors whose approval ratings have skyrocketed during the crisis.The White House on Wednesday was also pointing to the prospect of an experimental drug, Remdesivir, which proved effective against the virus in a major new study.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, said the drug reduced the time it takes patients to recover by 31% — 11 days on average versus 15 days for those just given usual care.“It’s highly significant,” said the usually cautious doctor. “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.”The White House and Trump in particular have been eager to give the country positive news as they work to move past the crisis and rebuild the economy, even as the country’s death tally continues to rise. The US has now recorded more than 58,000 deaths from the virus, surpassing the total number of Americans who were killed in the Vietnam War. More than 1 million people have now tested positive.Trump said that number has risen so high because of an increase in testing. The country has dramatically improved its testing after a slow and rocky start, but many health experts say the country still must do more — as many as 5 million tests a day — to safely reopen. Otherwise, they warn, cases will skyrocket as Americans return to work.“The only thing worse than an unnecessarily slow recovery is a reversed recovery,” Joshua Bolten, the president of the Business Roundtable, an association of prominent CEOs, said during the White House event.Meanwhile, Kushner, who has been helping lead response efforts, said in an interview with “Fox and Friends” that he believes May will be “a transition month” and that, “by June, a lot of the country should be back to normal. And the hope is that ... by July the country is really rocking again.”“I think that we’ve achieved all the different milestones that are needed,” he claimed. “So the federal government rose to the challenge, and this is a great success story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-won-t-extend-social-distancing-guidelines/story-AVTo7VmZROm4NUmwDaE7uL.html
30-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update- ‘They misled us’: Donald Trump on WHO’s handling of Covid-19 pandemic||President Donald Trump Wednesday termed the World Health Organization “literally a pipe organ for China” and said the United States will soon come out with its recommendations on the global body, followed by one on Beijing.“They misled us,” he said of the WHO on the coronavirus outbreak. “We will have a recommendation pretty soon but we are not happy with the World Health Organization,” Trump told reporters at his Oval Office of the White House.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Trump has launched an investigation into the WHO’s role in the spread of coronavirus and have accused it of siding with China during the pandemic. Pending an investigation, the President has stopped US aid to the WHO. The investigation would look into the role of China and as to how coronavirus spread from its Wuhan city.“On world health with China to follow,” Trump said when asked to clarity about his comment on recommendation. “On the World Health Organization or a recommendation on China or what do you mean?” he was asked.“What are you hoping to learn about China and the World Health Organization with this investigation you have commissioned with the intelligence agencies?” he was asked.“It is coming in and I am getting pieces already and we are not happy about it and we are by far the largest contributor to WHO,...and they misled us. I don’t know. They must have known more than they knew because they came after what other people knew that weren’t even involved,” Trump said.“We knew things that they didn’t know and either they didn’t know it or they didn’t tell us or you know right now they are literally a pipe organ for China. That is the way I view it,” he said.Trump said, while the US on an average has given the WHO a financial aid between USD400 and USD500 million, and China is giving USD38 million. “And yet, they seem to work for China and they should have been in there early, they should have known what was going on and they should have been able to stop it,” he said.Responding to a question, the President said that there are lots of different people whom the US can give this money to. “We can give this money to lots of different incredible groups. There are a lot of groups out there. It doesn’t have to go to the WHO. We can give it to groups that are very worthy and get much more bang for your buck, but we’re going to make a decision in the not-too-distant future,” Trump said.“You talk about stopping the spread or stopping the embers that could have been stopped there.

They are going to Italy very, very big time to Italy but they are going all over the world but they are not going into China,” he said.As such Trump said his Administration is “coming up with a very distinct recommendation”. There is nothing positive about what happened in China having to do with this subject, he said reiterating that China could have stopped the virus at the source.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “They didn’t have to let airplanes fly out and loads of people come out and we are lucky,” he said.

Nov 3, it’s a good number’: Trump rules out deferring US polls“I can’t imagine a rally where you have every fourth seat full.... That wouldn’t look too good,” he added.“I hope that we’re going to be able to do some good old-fashioned 25,000 person rallies where everyone’s going wild because they love our country.” At a meeting with industry leaders, Trump sounded an upbeat message, insisting that the US economy will quickly bounce back from the staggering costs of the shutdown required to stop the spreading novel coronavirus.Also read| Two-thirds of Americans believe Covid-19 will disrupt November election: SurveyDespite some experts’ warnings that widespread social distancing will have to remain in effect until a vaccine is made, Trump predicted that the danger would fade by itself and said that the United States was equipped to extinguish any “embers.” “We’re looking for vaccines, we’re looking for therapeutics also,” he said. “I’m not relying on that (vaccines), I hope that’s going to happen.” “I want to get back (to a full economy) with or without (a vaccine), but obviously we have to wait till it’s gone. It will be gone,” he said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Asked how the virus would be eradicated without a vaccine, which is not expected to be available soon, Trump responded: “It’s going to go.

30-04-2020||World||Donald Trump erupts at campaign team as his poll numbers slide||President Donald Trump erupted at his top political advisers last week when they presented him with worrisome polling data that showed his support eroding in a series of battleground states as his response to the coronavirus comes under criticism.As the virus takes its deadly toll and much of the nation’s economy remains shuttered, new surveys by the Republican National Committee and Trump’s campaign pointed to a harrowing picture for the president as he faces reelection.While Trump saw some of the best approval ratings of his presidency during the early weeks of the crisis, aides highlighted the growing political cost of the crisis and the unforced errors by Trump in his freewheeling press briefings.Trump reacted with defiance, incredulous that he could be losing to someone he viewed as a weak candidate.“I am not f—-ing losing to Joe Biden,” he repeated in a series of heated conference calls with his top campaign officials, according to five people with knowledge of the conversations. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.The message to the president was sobering: Trump was trailing the former Democratic vice president in many key battleground states, he was told, and would have lost the Electoral College if the election had been held earlier this month.On the line from the White House, Trump snapped at the state of his polling during a series of calls with campaign manager Brad Parscale, who called in from Florida; RNC chair Ronna McDaniel, on the line from her home in Michigan; senior adviser Jared Kushner; and other aides.Echoing a number of White House aides and outside advisers, the political team urged Trump to curtail his daily coronavirus briefings, arguing that the combative sessions were costing him in the polls, particularly among seniors. Trump initially pushed back, pointing to high television ratings. But, at least temporarily, he agreed to scale back the briefings after drawing sharp criticism for raising the idea that Americans might get virus protection by injecting disinfectants.Trump aides encouraged the president to stay out of medical issues and direct his focus toward more familiar and politically important ground: the economy.Even as Trump preaches optimism, the president has expressed frustration and even powerlessness as the dire economic statistics pile up. It’s been a whiplash-inducing moment for the president, who just two months ago planned to run for reelection on the strength of an economy that was experiencing unprecedented employment levels. Now, as the records mount in the opposite direction, Trump is feeling the pressure.“We built the greatest economy in the world,” Trump has said publicly. “I’ll do it a second time.”Trump’s political team warned that the president’s path to reelection depends on how quickly he can bring about a recovery.“I think you’ll see by June a lot of the country should be back to normal, and the hope is that by July the country’s really rocking again,” Kushner told “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday morning. But other aides, business leaders and economists predict a far longer road toward recovery.Representatives for the RNC and the Trump campaign did not comment on the polling or last week’s phone calls.According to people familiar with the incident, Trump vented much of his frustration at Parscale, who served as the bearer of bad news.Trump has long distrusted negative poll numbers — telling aides for years that his gut was right about the 2016 race, when he insisted that he was ahead in the Midwest and Florida. At the same time, Parscale and other Trump aides are talking up the sophistication of their data and voter outreach capabilities this time.The president and some aides have had simmering frustrations with Parscale for a while, believing the campaign manager — a close Kushner ally — has enriched himself from his association with Trump and sought personal publicity. Trump had previously been angered when Parscale was the subject of magazine profiles. This latest episode flared before the campaign manager was featured in a New York Times Magazine profile this week.Aides have grown particularly worried about Michigan — which some advisers have all but written off -- as well as Florida, Wisconsin and Arizona.Trump announced Wednesday that he will visit Arizona next week — his first trip outside Washington in a month — as he looks to declare that much of the nation is ready to begin reopening after the virus.The president has mocked Biden, his presumptive general election rival, for being “stuck in his basement” in his Delaware home during the pandemic.Trump said Wednesday that he hopes to soon visit Ohio, a battleground state that Trump carried handily in 2016 but that aides see as growing slightly competitive in recent weeks.Aides acknowledged that the president’s signature rallies would not be returning anytime soon. Some have privately offered doubts that he would be able to hold any in his familiar format of jam-packed arenas before Election Day, Nov. 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-erupts-at-campaign-team-as-his-poll-numbers-slide/story-Ko6INWxtMuL1xmo4beu66M.html

Search and rescue efforts are currently underway,” it added.The statement did not give details on how many personnel were on board, although a Greek military source earlier said it was believed the aircraft had been carrying six people.Initial reports said the helicopter had been over international waters 50 nautical miles off the Greek island of Kefalonia, the Greek air force said.Italian, Greek and Turkish frigates also took part in the patrol that had moved from Greek to Italian waters on Wednesday, with the Greek frigate remaining in Greek waters.Greek naval and air forces were ready to assist in a rescue operation “if Italy requests it”, a military source told AFP.A spokesperson for Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), which plans and carries out all NATO operations, added: “I confirm there has been an incident involving a helicopter from a ship under NATO command.“There is currently a search and rescue operation being conducted and national notifications taking place.”hec/har/to/rma/jah||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-nato-helicopter-goes-missing-off-greece/story-oXzyX3ckBk3yafXB0OeHkO.html
30-04-2020||World||Joe Biden under pressure to address sexual assault allegation||His campaign has strongly denied it but pressure is mounting on Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential hopeful, to personally respond to a sexual assault allegation made by a former Senate aide.Tara Reade, 56, claims that the assault took place in 1993, when she was a 29-year-old staff assistant in the office of Biden, then a US senator from Delaware.Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager and communications director, issued a statement dismissing the allegation but there has been no comment so far from the 77-year-old former vice president himself.“Vice President Biden has dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women,” Bedingfield said in the April 13 statement.“What is clear about this claim: it is untrue,” she said. “This absolutely did not happen.”The denial has however done little to calm media coverage of the claims, which have drowned out other news about Biden, such as his search for a running mate, who he has pledged will be a woman.President Donald Trump’s campaign manager Brad Parscale has flooded his Twitter feed with mocking references to Reade’s allegation, ignoring the string of accusations made by women against his own candidate.More than a dozen women have accused the real estate mogul of sexual misconduct before he became president, including a writer who claims he raped her in a Manhattan department store.Biden has not been asked directly about Reade’s allegation in the interviews he has given from his Delaware home, where he has been confined because of the coronavirus pandemic.The question has also not come up at the various online events he has held, including one on Tuesday during which 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton endorsed his White House bid.- ‘Had me up against the wall’ -According to Reade, the assault took place in August 1993 in a hallway on Capitol Hill.“We were alone, and it was the strangest thing,” Reade said in a late March interview on the Katie Halper Show podcast. “There was no, like, exchange, really, he just had me up against the wall.“His hands were on me and underneath my clothes and, yeah, he went, he went down my skirt but then up inside it and he penetrated me with his fingers,” she said.“He was kissing me at the same time,” she said.Reade said she pulled away and Biden allegedly said: “‘Come on man, I heard you liked me.’““For me everything shattered at that moment,” Reade said.Reade has since recounted her story to several other media outlets and according to US press reports, she filed a complaint with the Washington police in early April but did not name Biden.Other women have accused Biden of touching or embracing them inappropriately in the past, and Reade’s initial claims were similar -- less severe than her most recent allegations.The New York Times reported that it had interviewed Reade on multiple occasions, along with her friends and others who worked for Biden in the early 1990s. According to the Times, no former Biden staffers corroborated her account, and a pattern of misconduct was not uncovered.A friend said Reade had told her about the alleged assault at the time. A second friend said Reade told her in 2008 of a traumatic experience while working in Biden’s office.Reade said she had also related the incident to her brother.The allegations have led some supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, who dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination and endorsed Biden, to call on the former vice president to end his White House bid.“Now is the time to deal with the ramifications of Tara Reade’s accusations, not this fall,” said Claire Sandberg, the former national organizing director of the Sanders campaign.“There is simply no moral justification for Biden to continue as the presumptive nominee,” Sandberg said. “Out of respect for survivors and for the good of the country, he should withdraw from the race.”elc/cl/sst||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-under-pressure-to-address-sexual-assault-allegation/story-e6xLTqM85UMixDyYppBg4K.html
30-04-2020||World||Antiviral drug shows some hope in US govt-run study||Gilead Sciences Inc. said early results from a US-government-run study showed its experimental drug to treat coronavirus helped patients recover more quickly than standard care, suggesting it could become the first effective treatment for an illness that has turned modern life inside-out.Gilead shares jumped as much as 7.1% Wednesday after the company’s statement. The news appeared to boost the entire U.S. stock market as well, with the S&P 500 gaining 2.4% despite data showing a deep contraction in the U.S. economy in the first quarter of the year.The company issued a news release early Wednesday commenting on the study from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases without providing details of the results.Anthony Fauci, the head of NIAID and the government’s top infectious-disease specialist, said at a White House meeting with President Donald Trump and Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards that the trial showed a significant positive effect on the virus and that the results “were quite good news.”Fauci called the study the “first truly high-powered randomized placebo-controlled trial” of remdesivir.Gilead’s share price and the broader stock market have been churned in recent weeks by a series of early looks and leaks of trial data on the drug, called remdesivir. Last week, the market swooned after apparently discouraging results from a Chinese trial were accidentally posted on a World Health Organization web page. Data confirming those more downbeat results were published in the U.K. medical journal The Lancet on Wednesday.Remdesivir, which was originally developed to treat other novel viruses, has placed Gilead at the head of the race to develop a treatment for Covid-19. The drug, which has also been tested on Ebola, hasn’t been approved for use anywhere in the world.A separate study released by Gilead on Wednesday said remdesivir appears equally effective when it’s given over just five days, rather than the 10-day course used in NIAID and other trials. But the Gilead study doesn’t have a comparison group.The five-day regimen “could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir,” said Merdad Parsey, Gilead’s chief medical officer.Taken together, the studies could signal a profound shift in the race to get the novel coronavirus under control. The availability of a treatment could allow the world to start reopening economies, as well as offer psychological relief to billions of people who have been self-isolating to hide from the virus.In the most severe cases, Covid-19 can lead to respiratory failure and death. More than 1 million cases have been confirmed in the U.S., and over 200,000 people have died around the globe from the illness.Multiple trials of the drug are being conducted. The NIAID trial measured how quickly patients taking it were able to be removed from supplemental oxygen therapy or were discharged from the hospital. It’s not known yet how much benefit the Gilead drug gave patients, and if it will make a meaningful difference in their care.The trial, run by the National Institutes of Health, aimed to sign up about 800 patients to test the drug and give a definitive answer as to whether it can help treat the illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antiviral-drug-shows-some-hope-in-us-govt-run-study/story-yqIrMrWjbgUD5gjmAR7NzO.html

Symonds had been expected to give birth in early summer.“The prime minister and Ms Symonds are thrilled to announce the birth of a healthy baby boy at a London hospital this morning,” a spokesperson said. Johnson returned to work on Monday, a month after testing positive for Covid-19, which he said had threatened his life. Symonds also had symptoms of the virus but recovered swiftly.The couple, who have been living together in Downing Street since Johnson became PM in July, announced in February that they were expecting their first child.Focusing on population infected by coronavirus and suspending treatment of cancer patients in the UK could lead to deaths of over 18,000 infected by the malignancy, experts forecast.According to campaign group Macmillan Cancer Support, nearly 18,000 people with cancer in England could die as the pandemic has forced hospitals to suspend treatment and deterred patients from seeking NHS care. Cancer should not be “the forgotten C”, it said.Research by the group shows that an extra 6,270 people in England recently diagnosed with cancer could die from it over the next 12 months as a result of the disruption caused by the virus, and the additional toll taking into account those living with cancer could be 17,915.A further 765 deaths from the coronavirus have been reported in the UK. The total toll rose by 3,811 as the country added historical data to its running total.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-a-covid-survivor-becomes-a-father/story-LrWqeMxUDV6CiBCokoXYwN.html
30-04-2020||World||British coronavirus death toll now world’s third-worst||Britain’s death toll from the coronavirus outbreak jumped to 26,097 on Wednesday -- the second-highest in Europe behind Italy and third-highest in the world -- as the government took into account fatalities outside hospital, including care homes, for the first time.The increase came after surprise news that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had become a father again at age 55, several months earlier than expected, and just weeks after he was taken to hospital with Covid-19.Downing Street announced that his partner, Carrie Symonds, 32, gave birth to a healthy baby boy, prompting messages of congratulation from across the political spectrum at home and abroad.The rare good news was soured however by the additional 4,419 deaths in the overall coronavirus death toll, just as Johnson, who returned to work on Monday, is under pressure to ease a month-long lockdown.Until now, Britain had reported only deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 in hospital but there has been mounting concern about high numbers of unreported victims in the wider community.On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics said deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending April 17 were running at roughly double the five-year average and were the highest weekly total since 1993.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Wednesday said there were an additional 3,811 deaths included in the outbreak since the start of March, on top of figures from the last 24 hours.“They don’t represent a sudden surge in the number of deaths,” he told reporters.According to an AFP tally from official sources at 1300 GMT on Wednesday, Britain has now leapfrogged the tolls in France and Spain and is the second-worst affected country in Europe, behind Italy’s 27,359 deaths. The United States has the world’s worst death toll with 58,355.- Second peak -Britain has widened its testing regime for Covid-19 to care homes, the over-65s and people unable to work from home, as part of increased measures to curb the outbreak.A total of 85 frontline workers in the state-run National Health Service (NHS) have died from the coronavirus, and 23 in social care, according to the government.There remain questions about the provision of personal protective equipment to medics and others dealing with patients, and the availability of testing. Raab, who has deputised for Johnson during his illness and recovery, warned the government is not yet ready to ease lockdown restrictions.“This issue of a second spike and the need to avoid it, it’s not a theoretical risk,” he said.“Having relaxed restrictions in Germany over the last week, they’ve seen a rise in the transmission rate of coronavirus.“We’re in a delicate and dangerous moment. We’re coming through the peak, but we’re not there yet.”- ‘Relief and joy’ -Britain shut non-essential shops and services, and ordered people to stay at home except to shop for groceries and medicines, on March 27.A review of the measures is expected on May 7, amid dire warnings about the economic impact and indications of frustration at the continued confinement.Johnson held a lunchtime telephone call with the leader of the main opposition Labour party, Keir Starmer who has called for more clarity on the lockdown exit plan.Starmer earlier joined well-wishers in congratulating Johnson on becoming a father again, particularly after his recent experience. Symonds also displayed Covid-19 symptoms but was not tested.“Whatever differences we have in this house, as human beings we all recognise the anxiety the prime minister and Carrie must have gone through in these past few weeks,” he told parliament.“I really hope this brings them incredible relief and joy.”Johnson had to spend three nights in intensive care, and later admitted his illness “could have gone either way”.He was present for the birth at an unnamed NHS hospital in London and would be taking some paternity leave later in the year, his spokesman said.Johnson has at least five other children, including four with his second wife, Marina Wheeler, from whom he split in 2018.He also had a daughter as a result of an extra-marital affair while he was mayor of London, according to a 2013 court case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-coronavirus-death-toll-now-world-s-third-worst/story-9yDxyhP9ioSfaVZzXs1cyI.html

We don’t have any information to report today, we’re watching it closely,” Pompeo told Fox News after being asked about conflicting reports about Kim’s health.Pompeo said the United States was also monitoring the situation more broadly in North Korea, given the risk presented by the coronavirus.“There is a real risk that there will be a famine, a food shortage, inside of North Korea too,” he added. “We’re watching each of those things closely, as they have a real impact on our mission set, which to ultimately denuclearize North Korea.”President Donald Trump met Kim three times in 2018 and 2019 in an attempt to persuade him to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States. While talks have stalled, Trump has continued to hail Kim as a friend.Pompeo did not elaborate on the risk of famine in North Korea, but a North Korean economic delegation was due in Beijing this week to discuss food supplies and trade issues as the coronavirus outbreak has severely disrupted the country’s food supply, two people with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.Impoverished and isolated North Korea is prone to food shortages. As many as 1.1 million people died during the famines of the 1990s, according to South Korean estimates.Also read: With Kim Jong Un’s health status unclear, his uncle suddenly relevant after 40 yrs abroadOfficials in South Korea and the United States have said Kim may be staying at a coastal resort to avoid exposure to the new coronavirus, and have expressed skepticism about media reports he had some kind of serious illness.
