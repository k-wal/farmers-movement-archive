New York, the worst hit state with nearly 5,500 fatalities (more than 4,000 in New York City alone), is looking at a “projected plateau” in hospitalization numbers.The disproportionately high death rate among American Americans has emerged as a new worry. “We’re seeing tremendous evidence that African Americans are affected at a far greater percentage number than other citizens of our country,” President Trump said at the daily White House briefing by the coronavirus task force.Nation-wide figures are not available yet, but the evidence is unmistakable from some state numbers. African Americans comprise just 14% of the population in Michigan but account for 40% of the fatalities; they are 32% of the population in Louisiana but 70% of all deaths. Black Americans make up 30% of Chicago but 68% of fatalities. These numbers are based on data published by states and news media outlets; there is no nation-wide data available yet, but the White House coronavirus task force is expected to release a compilation shortly.Public health officials and experts have blamed the high death rate to the high incidence of underlying conditions such as blood pressure and heart ailments, diabetes, asthma and obesity among African Americans, linked to poverty and the comparative lack of healthcare facilities among some communities.US Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who is African American, and 45-years-old, addressed the underlying issues speaking about himself. “I and many black Americans are at higher risk for COVID (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus). That’s why we need everyone to do their part to slow the spread,” he told CBS.He is pre-diabetic, has high blood pressure and suffers from asthma. “So I represent that legacy of growing up poor and black in America,” Adams said.As the president acknowledged for the first time the growing concerns about African Americans being most at risk, he said, “We are doing everything in our power to address this challenge, and it’s a tremendous challenge,” Trump said. “It’s terrible.” He added that Anthony Fauci, country’s premier epidemiologist and member of the task-force, is “is looking at it very strongly.”Deborah Birx, coordinator of the task force, added, “We don’t want to give the impression that the African American community is more susceptible to the virus; we don’t have any data that suggests that. What our data suggests is they are more susceptible to more difficult and severe disease and poorer outcomes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-us-toll-nears-13-000-african-americans-hit-hardest-by-covid-19/story-oTDQuJsc5SintE4Q4Hj4VN.html

At that time, Pakistan was the only country not to be represented by its head of government.The external affairs ministry said in a statement that all Saarc countries, except Pakistan, participated in Wednesday’s video conference discussed the impact of travel restrictions and the larger Covid-19 situation on intra-regional trade.All the countries present during the video conference contributed to discussions on a wide-ranging trade-related agenda in the spirit of “shared interest and a problem-solving approach”. They recognised that the pandemic is “likely to have a considerable adverse impact on trade in the Saarc region”.The trade officials stressed that new ways should be identified to sustain and expand intra-regional trade until normal trade channels are restored. “The imperative need to maintain essential trade within the Saarc region was viewed as an important thrust area for favourable consideration,” the statement said.Specific issues addressed during the conference included facilitation of trade through pragmatic solutions such as provisional clearance of imports at preferential duty with suitable conditions, provisional acceptance of digitally signed certificates of origin, acceptance of scanned copies of documents for clearing imports by customs and release of payments by banks, and resolving issues related to exports and imports at land customs stations.The impact of health issues such as Covid-19 on regional trade and measures to mitigate it emerged as a new focus area for discussion within the larger framework of trade facilitation under Saarc, and the need to enhance the quantum of intra-Saarc trade was highlighted, the statement said.The seven states that joined the conference proposed to remain in touch through a designated focal point in each country, and the Indian side offered to coordinate this exercise, the statement said.This will also enable further interaction on ideas and proposed actions for the early restoration of normal trade in the region after movement restrictions related to Covid-19 are lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-skips-virtual-saarc-meet-on-overcoming-covid-19-impact-on-regional-trade/story-sFYPp0o2Egi4jebCseT06J.html
08-04-2020||World||Bernie Sanders suspends 2020 Democratic presidential campaign||Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign for the White House on Wednesday during a conference call with staff, making former Vice President Joe Biden the presumptive nominee to face Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election.Sanders plans to address supporters during a livestream at 11:45 ET (1545 GMT), a statement said.The U.S. senator from Vermont, a democratic socialist whose progressive agenda pulled the party sharply to the left, shot to an early lead in the Democratic race but faded quickly after losing South Carolina in late February as moderate Democrats consolidated their support behind Biden’s campaign.The departure of Sanders, the last remaining rival to Biden, sets up a battle between the 77-year-old former vice president and Trump, 73, who is seeking a second four-year term in office.Sanders’ decision to step aside came with the country in the grip of a coronavirus outbreak that upended the nominating elections schedule, with some primaries postponed and others up in the air. Sanders had been his party’s front-runner just a month ago.Sanders, who also mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge in 2016 to eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, had been under pressure to halt his campaign after Biden won resounding victories in primary contests on March 17 in Florida, Arizona and Illinois.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bernie-sanders-suspends-2020-democratic-presidential-campaign/story-aWJvsyJVbdsWbwtlchNx3N.html
08-04-2020||World||Britain’s Johnson ‘responding to treatment’ but remains in intensive care||Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson was “responding to treatment”, his spokesman said Wednesday, as the 55-year-old leader spent a third day in intensive care battling the coronavirus.The disease has struck at the heart of the British government and infected more than 55,000 people across the country and killed nearly 6,200.“The prime minister remains clinically stable and is responding to treatment,” his official spokesman said. “He continues to be cared for in the intensive care unit in St Thomas’ Hospital. He is in good spirits.”Earlier, junior health minister Edward Argar told Sky News the Conservative leader was “not on ventilation”.The latest update came as newspapers urged Britons to keep their stricken leader at the forefront of their minds, with the country in lockdown to try to stem the spread of COVID-19 in its third week.“He stayed at work for you... now pray at home for him,” The Sun tabloid splashed across its front page. “Boris ‘will pull through’“ said the Daily Express.Deputising for Johnson, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the PM “a fighter” and predicted “he’ll be back, leading us through this crisis in short order”.Johnson is the most high-profile government leader to become infected with COVID-19 and messages of support flooded in from across Britain and the world.He was admitted to intensive care on Monday evening after spending Sunday night in hospital following concerns he still had a cough and high temperature 10 days after being diagnosed with COVID-19.His transfer to intensive care is unprecedented for a prime minister during a national emergency.For many people, it brought home the seriousness of the disease that has so far seen 6,159 deaths in Britain, with a record 786 more reported in a daily update on Tuesday. Fresh figures are expected later on Wednesday. ‘Work goes on’ Despite the record daily death toll, there was more encouraging news with the number of new daily cases remaining at a roughly stable 3,643.Downing Street also said on Wednesday that it was still too soon to say whether stringent social distancing measures introduced on March 23 for an initial three-week period would be eased at all.A review is expected take place next week as planned, despite suggestions of a power vacuum at the top of the British government given the PM’s hospitalisation.“We’ve set out that we would make a further announcement in three weeks and there’s no change to that, no change at all to the timeline,” Johnson’s spokesman said.The country does not have a formal constitutional role of deputy prime minister, and experts said Raab would need the support of the rest of the cabinet to make any big decisions.‘Enormous shock’ Johnson announced on March 27 that he had coronavirus and went into self-isolation in a flat above his Downing Street office.But on Monday evening he was moved to intensive care in London’s St Thomas’ hospital after his condition worsened.The prime minister has received messages of support from around the world, with US President Donald Trump sending best wishes to his “very good friend” while Russian leader Vladimir Putin said Johnson’s “energy, optimism and sense of humour” would see him through.For some, Johnson’s larger-than-life personality has made his hospitalisation all the more shocking.His biographer Andrew Gimson said Johnson always made him feel upbeat, and “now here he is the stricken one”.“This is an enormous shock, completely unfamiliar territory for all those who know him,” he told BBC radio.Experts said it was not uncommon for coronavirus patients to move to intensive care, but said it showed Johnson’s condition was serious.“There is no doubt this turn of events means Boris Johnson is extremely sick,” said Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London.Still shaking hands The British government was criticised for initially refusing to follow other European countries in requiring people to stay home as the virus spread rapidly across the globe.Johnson himself said in early March that he was still shaking hands with people.Two weeks ago, he ordered a nationwide lockdown, but parliament continued to sit for several days after and Westminster became a hotspot for the virus.Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, have both been infected, although they have since recovered.Johnson’s pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, moved out of Downing Street after some staff fell ill.Meanwhile, Number 10 also revealed on Wednesday that it expected its chief Brexit negotiator David Frost to “speak early next week” to his European Union counterpart Michel Barnier to agree a timetable for “remote” talks in April and May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-s-johnson-responding-to-treatment-but-remains-in-intensive-care/story-WUxh7uTeV7TywcreZrr5yI.html

All citizens and residents other than those in essential services require a permit to leave their homes.Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the country, has come to a virtual halt with its famous mega-malls and sprawling hotels shuttered.Life under the lockdown has raised many questions among anxious citizens. One Emirati man contacted police to ask whether he needs a permit to visit his second wife, the Gulf News daily reported, without saying what the answer was.Polygamy is allowed in the country, with men allowed to have four wives at the same time, in accordance with Islamic law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-suspends-marriage-and-divorce-during-virus-lockdown/story-stgBde5P0dItlPTbNaS9TJ.html

China contributed $44 million, it said.“We are still in the acute phase of a pandemic so now is not the time to cut back on funding,” Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, told a virtual briefing when asked about Trump’s remarks.Dr Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to the WHO Director-General, also defended the U.N. agency’s relationship with China, saying its work with Beijing authorities was important to understand the outbreak which began in Wuhan in December.“It was absolutely critical in the early part of this outbreak to have full access to everything possible, to get on the ground and work with the Chinese to understand this,” he told reporters.“This is what we did with every other hard-hit country like Spain and had nothing to do with China specifically.”Aylward, who led a WHO expert mission to China in February, defended WHO recommendations to keep borders open, saying that China had worked “very hard” to identify and detect early cases and their contacts and ensure they did not travel.“China worked very, hard very early on, once it understood what it was dealing with, to try and identify and detect all potential cases to make sure that they got tested to trace all the close contacts and make sure they were quarantined so they actually knew where the virus was, where the risk was,” he said.“Then they made it very clear that these people would not and could not travel within the country, let alone internationally,” he added.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been lavish in his praise of China from early in the outbreak, praising President Xi Jinping’s “rare leadership”.David Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who led WHO’s response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, said that any U.S. funding cut would be a huge blow.“If the WHO loses its funding it cannot continue to do its work. It works on a shoe-string budget already,” Heymann said in London. “Of course it would be disastrous for the WHO to lose funding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-rejects-china-centric-charge-after-trump-criticism/story-4nihzogYdeu2blG3ocv24O.html

I can also tell you that he has been sitting up in bed and engaging positively with the clinical team”, Sunak said.“The Prime Minister is not only my colleague, my boss but my friend; my thoughts are with him and his family. The news about the PM reminds us how indiscriminate this disease is”, he added, as the UK entered the third week of the three-week lockdown.Concerns continued to swirl in Westminster of a power vacuum at the top of the government with foreign secretary Dominic Raab deputising for Johnson “where necessary”, with the extent of his powers limited.New figures showed the biggest rise so far in daily deaths by 938 to 7,097. The number of cases in hospitals also rose to 60,733, but health officials said the data showed that the number of the patients needing critical care is flattening.Sunak announced £750 million for the charity sector and also promised to match pound-for-pound the money raised by BBC’s Big Night to raise funds for the National Emergencies Trust on April 23, committing a minimum of £20 million.He has previously announced over £330 billion pounds to help the economy, besides picking up 80 per cent of the salary bill of the employed and self-employed sector affected by the pandemic.Officials said Raab will not have the prime minister’s weekly audience with Queen Elizabeth, will not be able to appoint or dismiss ministers, nor take major decisions unless with the concurrence of the cabinet. Security-related questions have also been raised.The business of government continues, officials say, with Raab chairing meetings related to the coronavirus response. The immediate major decision the new arrangement will need to take is whether the current lockdown needs to extended.The Guardian said in an editorial: “The government now finds itself in uncharted waters, as the epidemic in Britain moves towards an anticipated peak roughly a week from now. Unfortunately, the arrangement the prime minister leaves behind is murky and potentially unstable”.“This lack of clarity over leadership matters…But if a leadership vacuum does begin to emerge, some form of cross-party arrangement may need to be considered to ensure continuing public consent for tough decisions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/questions-over-uk-power-vacuum-as-pm-boris-johnson-stays-stable/story-gDxGqOxHRasnIZx6bICtTM.html

The masks are being returned, and the vendor has committed to a full refund,” a statement from the Mayor’s office said.These masks were meant for health care workers and carers at long-term care homes where the most vulnerable demographic, the elderly, are looked after. The city is investigating whether any employees had “possible exposure to COVID-19” due to the faulty masks.Toronto is now scrambling to identify an appropriate grade masks for purchase on “a priority basis, as the loss of this inventory makes for a significant shortfall of surgical masks for the city.”This news from Toronto comes even as Canada received eight million face masks from China. Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said that more masks are expected from there, while the government has found various sources for over 230 million masks.Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the government will collaborate with Canadian companies for speedily manufacturing 30,000 ventilators. Trudeau said during his daily media briefing that, “To keep our frontline workers safe and care for Canadians with COVID-19, we need a sustainable, stable supply of these products, and that means making them at home.”These efforts come even as groups representing frontline healthcare workers blasted the government for its ineptitude in proving personal protective equipment or PPE to those treating and caring for coronavirus patients. These statements came during a virtual Parliamentary committee hearing. According to the national broadcaster CBC, Dr Sandy Buchman, president of the Canadian Medical Association told MPs that they felt “betrayed.”“Asking health care workers to be on the front lines of this pandemic without the proper equipment is unacceptable. Shortages must be addressed immediately and information about supplies must be disseminated. People’s lives are on the line,” Buchman said. His views were echoed by Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions. “”Front line workers across the country who are directly involved in the care of presumed and confirmed COVID-19 patients are not being provided with the PPE they need to do their jobs. That’s simply outrageous and unacceptable in a world-class health system like ours,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-shortage-of-masks-in-canada-s-toronto-after-city-returns-substandard-chinese-import/story-Yb9zhiNOX52arpGSKYNoSI.html
08-04-2020||World||‘Painful lesson’: how a military-style lockdown unfolded in Wuhan||As the world grapples with the escalating coronavirus pandemic, China reopened the city of Wuhan on Wednesday, allowing its 11 million residents to leave for the first time in over two months, a milestone in its effort to combat the outbreak.But while the operation to contain Wuhan’s coronavirus outbreak has been hailed as a success by China and many international health experts, it didn’t come easy.Using virus case data, official reports and over a dozen interviews with officials, residents and scientists in Wuhan, Reuters has compiled a comprehensive account of how the military-style quarantine of the city unfolded.SCIENTIST TOURWuhan health authorities reported the first case of what turned out to be the new coronavirus in December, and the first known death linked to the virus in early January.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicCity officials insisted the situation was under control for the first two weeks of January, downplaying the possibility of human-to-human transmission as they focused on a seafood and wildlife market where the outbreak was believed to have started.But troubling signs were emerging.Hospital respiratory wards began reaching capacity by around Jan 12, and some people were being turned away, a half dozen Wuhan residents told Reuters.But at least up to Jan. 16, Wuhan’s government said that no new cases of the disease had occurred for about two weeks, and the city continued as normal. Diners packed restaurants, shoppers flocked to commercial districts, and travellers headed to train stations and airports for their Lunar New Year holidays.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakMinimal measures were put in place to take the temperatures of residents in public places, or encourage them to wear protective masks, residents said.“We ordinary people did not know that we needed to take protective measures,” said Wang Wenjun, whose uncle died of the coronavirus on Jan 31.But that changed after Jan 18, when a team of scientists sent by the central government in Beijing arrived in Wuhan.Leading the group was 83-year-old Zhong Nanshan, an epidemiologist credited with raising the alarm in China about the spread of another coronavirus, SARS, in 2003. Over two days, the team investigated the source and scale of Wuhan’s outbreak, inspecting the seafood and wildlife market and other sites.As the scientists toured Wuhan, their mood darkened as the scale of the crisis became clear, said a source familiar with the trip.A day before the scientists arrived, four new cases were confirmed in Wuhan, none of which had apparent links to the market.That cast doubt over local authorities’ previous assertions that there was no substantial evidence of human-to-human transmission, which would have required them to impose drastic containment measures on the city.The scientists’ visit was the third by an expert group since the end of December as suspicion in Beijing grew that the virus was transmissible and local officials had concealed the challenges they faced containing the disease, according to an academic on the Jan 18 trip and a scientist who visited on Jan 2. Another trip took place on Jan 8.During the Jan 18 visit, the team made several discoveries that had been previously undisclosed to the public by local officials.Over a dozen healthcare workers had been infected, efforts to track close contacts with other confirmed cases had dwindled, and hospitals had not conducted a single test before Jan. 16, Zhong and other experts on the team announced a few days after their trip to Wuhan.On Jan 19, the group of about a half dozen scientists returned to Beijing, where they reported their findings to the National Health Commission, which formulates China’s health policy.The experts recommended that Wuhan be put under quarantine and that hospital capacity be rapidly expanded, according to two sources who were briefed on the discussions. Zhong himself had suggested the lockdown measures, they said. Zhong and the commission did not respond to requests for comment.One of the sources said the proposal was initially rejected by Wuhan government officials because they feared the economic impact, but they were overruled by the central authorities.On the evening of Jan 20, the central government set up a taskforce in Wuhan to spearhead the fight against the epidemic.The lockdown of Wuhan had been put in motion.Ye Qing, deputy chief of the statistics bureau in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, said it was only when Zhong announced his findings that he began to realize the seriousness of this epidemic.Wuhan officials, he said, reacted far too late. “If the government had sent out a notice, if they had asked everyone to wear masks, to do temperature checks, maybe a lot fewer people would have died.”He added: “It’s a painful lesson with blood and tears.”Later tracing of virus patients showed that people confirmed to have the virus travelled from Wuhan to at least 25 provinces, municipalities and administrative regions across China before the lockdown plan went into action.The Wuhan government and the National Health Commission in Beijing did not respond to requests for comment.LOCKDOWNThe ripple effects of events in Beijing were soon felt in Wuhan.On Jan 22, senior officials in Wuhan received a written government notice telling them not to leave the city, or report their whereabouts if they had, according to two local government sources.The directive offered no further details, but at about 8 p.m. that night, some officials received notice by telephone that the city would be shut off the next morning, the sources said.The lockdown was publicly announced at 2 a.m., sending thousands of Wuhan residents scrambling to find a way out.But access into and out of the city was quickly closed off, with public transportation shut down and the use of private cars banned. Residents were soon after restricted to their homes.Having seized control of the crisis, Beijing also removed a number of key officials from Wuhan and Hubei province.Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, who kept his job, made a frank admission in an interview with state media a few days later that party-reporting mechanisms had stifled early action.“Information should have been released more quickly,” he said. The process had been slowed by officials in Wuhan being “obliged to seek permission” before fully disclosing information to the public, he said.‘NEW NORMAL’Almost two months after the lockdown was imposed, China has started allowing residents to leave the city, as well as permitting domestic flights and inter-city trains. Wuhan has reported just one new case in the past week, and around 93% of all cases have recovered, according to official data.As other countries consider Wuhan-style quarantines, those numbers have come under increased scrutiny, however. U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that China’s numbers were “on the light side,” drawing the ire of Beijing.China has also only just begun reporting data on asymptomatic cases – those in which carriers can transmit the disease without feeling symptoms - in the past week. That followed a public backlash on social media in China that the key numbers had been omitted from the official tally, raising concerns that such cases could lead to a second wave of infections.Xue Lan, a professor at Tsinghua University who is a member of a government coronavirus task force, said precautions put in place for the lockdown – like social distancing - would likely become a part of life in the future in China.“From now on our social lives will enter a new normal,” Xue said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/painful-lesson-how-a-military-style-lockdown-unfolded-in-wuhan/story-0lCTWrhrttw9AjI6bSodyH.html

08-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: Is the world anywhere close to ‘flattening’ the Covid-19 curve?||The trajectory of coronavirus outbreak differs from country to country, however, the trend shows that the virus multiplies and rapidly touches a peak. After peaking, the Covid-19 curve begins to flatten before it takes a downward course similar to that of China.According to the data exhibited by Johns Hopkins University, some of the countries that have reported the highest number of cases and fatalities related to Covid-19 now seem to be flattening the virus curve. What does ‘flattening’ the curve mean?“Flattening the curve involves reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases from one day to the next,” as mentioned on the University’s data centre page for Covid-19. Last month, China had declared that its coronavirus peak is finally over. The total number of cases in the country have not crossed 82,000 for over a month now. The rate of fatalities also seems to have hit a plateau. Countries and the Covid-19 curveSo, when exactly does a country begin to flatten its coronavirus curve? The answer is when it starts seeing a drop in the number of fresh cases and maintains the trend.Italy, for example, seems to be levelling off its number of new cases but is still struggling to contain the number of fatalities. “When a country has fewer new COVID-19 cases emerging today than it did on a previous day, that’s a sign that the country is flattening the curve,” Johns Hopkins University describes. What data showsThe University’s map of a 5-day moving average of top 10 Covid-19 affected countries suggests the coronavirus curve could be flattening. The numbers are calculated by averaging the values of that day, the two days before, and the two next days. According to the University data, 6 out of 10 highly coronavirus-affected nations seem to be reporting a drop in the daily number of fresh Covid-19 cases. These include Italy, Spain, the United States, Iran, Netherlands and Germany. According to the estimates, the UK, France, Belgium continue to report more Covid-19 cases on a daily basis but not at a rate as before. China reported 39 new coronavirus cases as of Sunday, up from 30 a day earlier.Crucial stageThe United States and the UK are at a crucial stage with respect to their coronavirus trajectories. The cases in the US and the UK are still rising but not at a pace like before, therefore, there emerges a chance for these countries to flatten the curve if the rate of new cases stabilises without new spikes. US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the country might be getting to the top of the “curve” of the coronavirus outbreak and said he did not see an early written warning about the pandemic from a top White House aide. The president said he was reluctant to talk about it but that the country might be on track for far fewer deaths than projected. What could upend the ‘flattening’?However, this is just with respect to the top 10 most affected countries in the world. Nations like India, Pakistan and Indonesia have begun to report a rapid rise in the number of coronavirus cases.The coronavirus curve flattened when the Chinese outbreak peaked and the contagion had not reached the West and other countries. Even when the top 10 most affected countries manage to flatten the curve, it may get upended if the virus reaches new regions or gets out of control in densely populated countries like India.More than 80,000 people across the globe have lost their lives to Covid-19. The virus has infected over a million people worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-is-the-world-anywhere-close-to-flattening-the-covid-19-curve/story-CRsjszAsksvICaQOFjmbtI.html
08-04-2020||World||Swiss Army’s biggest call-up since World War II amid Covid-19, Wuhan reopens: 10 points||The United States continues to see a surge in coronavirus cases. Out of over a million Covid-19 cases across the globe, nearly 4 lakh come from America. More than 80,000 people across the globe have lost their lives to Covid-19. The contagion hasn’t even spared world leaders like UK PM Boris Johnson.  Italy, Spain, France and Germany also grapple with the rise in coronavirus cases and fatalities. New York City in the US, continues to be one of the biggest Covid-19 hotspots in the world. Here are the key Covid-19 developments from across the globe:1. Spain’s daily deaths rose on Tuesday for the first time in five days, with 743 people succumbing overnight compared with 637 in the previous 24 hours. Total cases rose to 140,510 and the death toll was at 13,798.2. Total infections in Germany rose by 4,003 in the past 24 hours to 103,228, climbing for the second straight day after four previous days of drops. The death toll rose by 254 to 1,861.3. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was set to spend a second night in intensive care on Tuesday, while his foreign minister led the government’s response. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said he was self isolating as a family member has symptoms.4. In the Swiss Army’s biggest call-up since World War II, thousands of soldiers have been sent to support health workers, while hundreds have been confined to barracks after potential exposure.5. France has officially registered more than 10,000 deaths from coronavirus infections on Tuesday, becoming the fourth country to go beyond that threshold.6. US President Donald Trump said the United States might be getting to the top of the “curve” of the coronavirus outbreak and reiterated that he wants to get the US economy reopened soon.7. New York state is nearing a plateau in the number of patients hospitalized, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, while total infections in the country rose to 374,329, with the death toll reaching 12,064.8. US President Donald Trump sharply criticized the World Health Organization on Tuesday, accusing it of being too focused on China and issuing bad advice during the outbreak and saying he would put a hold on US funding for the agency.9. Covid-19 is killing African-Americans at a higher rate than the US population at large, according to preliminary numbers from Louisiana, Michigan and Illinois that officials say point to disparities in health and healthcare access.10. The Chinese city where the coronavirus epidemic first broke out, Wuhan, ended a two-month lockdown on Wednesday, but a northern town started restricting the movement of its residents amid concerns of a second wave of infections in mainland China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-army-s-biggest-call-up-since-world-war-ii-amid-covid-19-wuhan-reopens-10-points/story-G59aOumhSteaf1lwhYaz0N.html
08-04-2020||World||Coronavirus rakes up racism in US, Donald Trump says infections in African-Americans higher||Infecting nearly four lakh people and killing over 12,000 others, the coronavirus pandemic has brought up the deep-seated issue of racism in the United States, especially with President Donald Trump announcing that African-Americans have higher rates of infection in the country.During a White House press briefing, Trump said evidence shows that African-Americans have higher rates of COVID-19 infection in the US and his administration is actively engaging to address this challenge, Xinhua news agency reported.“It’s been disproportional,” Trump told reporters, adding that he is very concerned about the terrible numbers of infected African-Americans.Higher rates of pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity and asthma, within people of colour and minority communities may contribute to the phenomenon, as well as their higher use of public transportation, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.“We are very concerned about that. It is very sad. There is nothing we can do about it right now except to give them the best possible care to avoid complications,” Fauci said.Trump also said that the White House would release data on coronavirus cases by race in the near future.US Vice President Mike Pence said the “risk of tragedy” is “very real.”“It is a reminder that we have to be very careful with people with underlying health conditions,” he added.Los Angeles County released a partial racial breakdown of coronavirus fatalities for the first time on Tuesday, showing African-Americans are more likely to die from COVID-19.“When we look at these numbers by the total population of each group, African Americans have a slightly higher rate of death than other races,” said L.A. County Health Director Barbara Ferrer.The number of COVID-19 cases in the United States has topped 396,223 as of 20:00 on Tuesday (local time), with 12,722 deaths, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-rakes-up-racism-in-us-donald-trump-says-infections-in-african-americans-higher/story-Ab8yptgDuEgcRKeDprpQSM.html

Over 50,000 people in Wuhan caught the virus, and more than 2,500 of them died, about 80 per cent of all deaths in China, according to official figures.Watch: Wuhan lockdown lifted after 76 days, huge crowds seen at airport Restrictions have eased in recent days as the capital of Hubei province saw just three new confirmed infections in the past 21 days and only two new infections in the past fortnight.“You have no idea! I was already up around 4 am. I felt so good. My kids are so excited. Mum is finally coming home,” 39-year-old Hao Mei told news agency AFP as she waited to board a train. Mei, a single parent from the nearby city of Enshi, said her two children had been home alone since she got stuck in Wuhan, where she works in a school kitchen.Up to 55,000 people are expected to leave Wuhan on Wednesday just by train, according to government estimates.Buses and cars were also on roads out of the city on Wednesday morning, after barricades on its outskirts were dismantled with the ban on outbound travel being lifted at midnight.“Wuhan has lost a lot in this epidemic, and Wuhan people have paid a big price,” a 21-year-old man surnamed Yao, who was heading back to his restaurant job in Shanghai, told AFP.“Now that the lockdown has been lifted, I think we’re all pretty happy.”“Wuhan deserves to be called the city of heroes,” blared an announcement over the passenger announcement system at one of the city’s train stations on Wednesday.But even as people leave Wuhan, new imported cases in the northern province of Heilongjiang surged to a daily high of 25, fuelled by a continued influx of infected travellers arriving from Russia, which shares a land border with the province. Suifenhe City in Heilongjiang restricted the movement of its citizens on Wednesday in a similar fashion to that of Wuhan.Residents must stay in their residential compounds and one person from a family can leave once every three days to buy necessities and must return on the same day, said state-run CCTV.In Jiaozhou City in the eastern province of Shandong the risk level had risen from low to medium, according to a post on an official website, but it gave no details why. The state-run People’s Daily newspaper warned on Wednesday that opening up of Wuhan “does not mean releasing control”.Wuhan residents have been urged not to leave their neighbourhood, their city and even the province unless absolutely necessary. People from Wuhan arriving in the Chinese capital Beijing will have to undergo two rounds of testing for the virus. China maintains strict screening protocols, concerned about any resurgence in domestic transmissions due to virus carriers who exhibit no symptoms and infected travellers arriving from overseas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-felt-so-good-joy-relief-as-lockdown-in-city-of-heroes-wuhan-ends/story-Evj3g1T03qVNcRN19dcJZM.html
08-04-2020||World||China’s Wuhan lockdown ends, but local coronavirus cases rise across country||The Chinese city where the coronavirus epidemic first broke out, Wuhan, ended a two-month lockdown on Wednesday, allowing people to leave the city, if they were healthy, amid concerns of a second wave of infections as cases in mainland China rose.China sealed off the city of 11 million people in late January to stop the spread of the flu-like virus to other parts of the country. Over 50,000 people in Wuhan caught the virus, and more than 2,500 of them died, according to official figures.But restrictions have eased in recent days as new infections dropped to a trickle. Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, saw just three new confirmed infections in the past 21 days.

More than 10,000 travellers have left the city by plane so far as flights resume at Wuhan Tianhe airport. Flights to Beijing and international locations have not been restored.“I’m very happy, I’m going home today,” migrant worker Liu Xiaomin told Reuters as she stood with her suitcases inside Wuhan’s Hankou railway station, bound for Xiangyang city.Wuhan residents have also been urged not to leave their neighbourhood, their city and even the province unless absolutely necessary. People from Wuhan arriving in the Chinese capital will have to undergo two rounds of testing for the virus. China maintains strict screening protocols, concerned about any resurgence in domestic transmissions due to virus carriers who exhibit no symptoms and infected travellers arriving from overseas. IMPORTED CASESAsymptomatic patients and imported infections have become China’s chief concern.Mainland China’s new coronavirus cases doubled in 24 hours as the number of infected overseas travellers surged, and new asymptomatic infections more than quadrupled.New confirmed cases rose to 62 on Tuesday from 32 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said, the highest since March 25. New imported infections accounted for 59 of the cases.The number of new asymptomatic cases rose to 137 from 30 a day earlier, the health authority said on Wednesday, with incoming travellers accounting for 102 of the latest batch.Chinese authorities do not count asymptomatic cases as part of its tally of confirmed coronavirus infections until patients show symptoms such as a fever or a cough.As of Tuesday, 1,095 asymptomatic patients were under medical observation in China, with 358 of them travellers arriving from abroad. To stem infections from outside its borders, China has slashed the number of international flights and denied entry to virtually all foreigners. It also started testing all international arrivals for the virus this month.Screening of travellers arriving overland was also recently tightened.As of Tuesday, the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 81,802, including 3,333 fatalities, the National Health Commission said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-wuhan-lockdown-ends-but-local-coronavirus-cases-rise-across-country/story-u4dj6jytplLmtLjVnRDRaO.html
08-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: British PM Boris Johnson battles Covid-19, spends second night in intensive care||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was spending a second night in intensive care battling the coronavirus which has infected more than 55,000 across the country and killed nearly 6,200.“He stayed at work for you... now pray at home for him,” The Sun tabloid splashed across its front page Wednesday while the Daily Express said: “Boris ‘will pull through’.”Deputising for Johnson, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he was “confident he’ll pull through, because if there’s one thing I know about this prime minister, he’s a fighter and he’ll be back, leading us through this crisis in short order”.In an update Tuesday evening, the prime minister’s spokesman said his “condition is stable and he remains in intensive care for close monitoring.” He earlier said the 55-year-old Conservative leader was receiving “standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any other assistance” and had not required a ventilator.Johnson is the most high-profile government leader to become infected with Covid-19 and messages of support flooded in from across Britain and the world.He was admitted to intensive care on Monday evening after spending Sunday night in hospital following concerns he still had a cough and high temperature 10 days after being diagnosed with Covid-19.His transfer to intensive care is unprecedented for a prime minister during a national emergency.For many people, it brought home the seriousness of the disease that has so far seen 6,159 deaths in Britain, with a record 786 more reported in a daily update on Tuesday.Despite the record daily death toll, there was more encouraging news with the number of new daily cases remaining at a roughly stable 3,643.In a round of broadcast interviews, senior minister Michael Gove insisted the “work of government goes on”.He later said he was now staying at home after a family member displayed mild coronavirus symptoms.Raab chaired the daily coronavirus meeting in the prime minister’s place on Tuesday.“There is a clear plan... the government and the cabinet are working together to implement that plan,” Johnson’s spokesman said when asked if there was a power vacuum in Britain.The country does not have a formal constitutional role of deputy prime minister, and experts said Raab would need the support of the rest of the cabinet to make any big decisions.The most pressing issue is a review expected next week on whether to continue the nationwide lockdown introduced on March 23 to try to stem the spread of Covid-19.Johnson announced on March 27 that he had coronavirus and went into self-isolation in a flat above his Downing Street office.But on Monday evening he was moved to intensive care in London’s St Thomas’ hospital after his condition worsened.The prime minister has received messages of support from around the world, with US President Donald Trump sending best wishes to his “very good friend” while Russian leader Vladimir Putin said Johnson’s “energy, optimism and sense of humour” would see him through.For some, Johnson’s larger-than-life personality has made his hospitalisation all the more shocking.His biographer Andrew Gimson said Johnson always made him feel upbeat, and “now here he is the stricken one”.“This is an enormous shock, completely unfamiliar territory for all those who know him,” he told BBC radio.Experts said it was not uncommon for coronavirus patients to move to intensive care, but said it showed Johnson’s condition was serious.“There is no doubt this turn of events means Boris Johnson is extremely sick,” said Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London.The British government was criticised for initially refusing to follow other European countries in requiring people to stay home as the virus spread rapidly across the globe.Johnson himself said in early March that he was still shaking hands with people.Two weeks ago, he ordered a nationwide lockdown, but parliament continued to sit for several days after and Westminster became a hotspot for the virus.Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, have both been infected, although they have since recovered.Johnson, who has been prime minister only since July last year, is not known to have any underlying health issues, although he has struggled with his weight.Johnson’s pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, moved out of Downing Street after some staff fell ill.But she said on Saturday she had just spent a week in bed with symptoms, although she has not been tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-british-pm-boris-johnson-battles-covid-19-spends-second-night-in-intensive-care/story-qN8rTWN9AmLefKAAtlPqDN.html
08-04-2020||World||Who is Dominic Raab?||The man deputising for coronavirus-stricken UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a 46-year-old former lawyer, an ardent Brexiteer and a black belt in karate, who until three years ago was not in government but now leads the UK from Downing Street.Educated in Oxford and Cambridge, Dominic Raab was first elected in 2010 from Esher and Walton in Surrey and held a junior ministerial role in the governments led by former PMs David Cameron and Theresa May, before being promoted as the Brexit secretary by May.He resigned in protest against May’s Brexit deal in December 2018 and returned as the foreign secretary when Johnson became the prime minister in July 2019, dealing with India in his key role, particularly during the violence outside the Indian High Commission in late 2019.Raab then interacted with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, deploring the violence outside the mission but also telling MPs in the House of Commons that the Kashmir dispute has implications for human rights.Before entering politics, Raab, son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938, was a lawyer for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and appeared for various clients in international and competition law.He ran against Johnson to become the leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister in 2019, criticising his personality style as ‘bluff and bluster’, but was eliminated in earlier rounds. He is married to Brazilian marketing executive Erika Ray and the couple has two sons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-dominic-raab/story-0eY8Y7MONTSDILO0aWAMNL.html
08-04-2020||World||Covid-19: ‘Wuhan virus’ no more, US and China in truce||Suddenly, it’s no longer the “Wuhan virus.”The United States and China have reached a truce in a vitriolic feud over the coronavirus pandemic, with the two powers each seeing at least a tactical interest in cooling down.President Donald Trump, hardly known for the delicacy of his word choices, has dropped his provocative term “Chinese virus” and held back from criticizing Beijing’s response since a telephone call, on March 26 US time, with his counterpart Xi Jinping.And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- who so insisted on saying “Wuhan virus” that the Group of Seven foreign ministers could not issue a joint statement -- has been talking of cooperation.“We know that this is a global pandemic, and this is the time for every country to work together to resolve that,” Pompeo told reporters Tuesday when asked about China.Beijing infuriated the United States last month when a foreign ministry spokesman spread a conspiracy theory that US troops brought the virus to Wuhan.Cui Tiankai, China’s gentlemanly ambassador to Washington, struck a highly different tone in an op-ed in The New York Times in which he spoke of his affection for Americans and promised China would do “whatever it can to support the United States.”State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus welcomed Cui’s remarks but called, civilly, on China to share virus data and allow free speech.“True cooperation requires transparency and real actions, not just rhetoric,” she said.Not time for ‘blame game’ Whatever the faults in China’s response, many observers saw Trump’s blaming of Beijing as a political ploy as he faces criticism for not acting sooner to stop COVID-19, which has killed more than 12,000 people in the United States.But with medical supplies in dangerously short supply, Trump also needs China, which produces half of the imported masks in the United States.“Washington certainly does not want to alienate Beijing to the point that it bans the sale of medical equipment to the United States,” said Elizabeth Economy, director of Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.“It also reflects a broader sentiment within much of the United States that this is not the time to play an international blame game -- the priority should be on saving American and other lives.”Economy said the Trump administration may also feel that it no longer needs to be as upfront, especially when other countries have also stepped up criticism of Beijing.She doubted that the newfound tone would improve the rest of the relationship, which was already tense before the pandemic.The Trump administration has vowed to confront China on multiple fronts, including on its human rights record and military buildup, with the State Department just Monday criticizing Beijing over the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing trawler.Goal to ‘keep Trump calm’ From China’s standpoint, the friction also has limited benefits, especially when Beijing is seeking to cast itself around the world as a pandemic benefactor.The State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which tracks foreign propaganda, says Chinese state social media have already phased out conspiracy theories blaming the United States.For China, the goal is to “keep Trump calm and to try to prevent unnecessary damage from taking place, and keeping that channel open between you and Trump,” said Douglas Paal, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Paal, a former Asia adviser to presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said that China also had an eye on US elections in November.China’s top priority is to revive global demand for its exports and initially thought that Trump’s re-election would be its best outcome, fearing that the rival Democrats would intervene more forcefully on human rights as well as on trade, Paal said.But Paal was struck by an overall positive portrayal in Chinese state media of Joe Biden, the likely Democratic nominee.Biden as vice president invested heavily in building a relationship with Xi, China’s most powerful leader in decades.China also sees a “historic strategic opportunity” to expand its power as Trump has weakened US alliances, Paal said.“My reading of the official media suggests that they’re less committed to getting Trump re-elected than they were a year ago,” Paal said.“And therefore they don’t have as many ambitions for doing things with Trump. They can stand back and just take care of their own interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-wuhan-virus-no-more-us-and-china-in-truce/story-ET9lBVwvp4WgH8DdE9DzXP.html
08-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Hydroxychloroquine saved life of Michigan state lawmaker, says Donald Trump||A Democratic party’s state legislature from Michigan has credited hydroxychloroquine for saving her life from coronavirus, US President Donald Trump said Tuesday, adding the politician has thanked him for promoting the malaria drug. Amidst an intense debate on side effects of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19, Trump has been actively promoting the drug as an option when there is no viable treatment for the dreaded virus which has so far taken more than 12,800 Americans’ lives, including a record over 2,000 in just one single day on Tuesday.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  Michigan State Representative Karen Whitsett has said she and her husband could save their lives from coronavirus only after they started taking hydroxychloroquine. She asked her doctor to prescribe this after she saw President Trump touting for this drug on a news channel.“This is a woman I thought she was going to die. I mean, she is a Democrat representative, highly respected woman, African-American woman. ...the way she told the story was beautiful. I asked my husband to go and get it. He got it. She is now okay. I mean, she was interviewed last night on television, and she thanked me,” Trump told reporters at the White House.Also read: India partially eases restrictions on export of anti-malarial drug“She thanked me even in a tweet. She said I want to thank President Trump. He saved my life. Look, I don’t say that happens with everybody, but that’s a beautiful story. There are many of those stories. And I say try it (hydroxychloroquine),” he said in response to a question.The US Food and Drug Administration has given temporary approval of the malaria drug in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. It is being experimented on more than 1,500 coronavirus patients in New York. Anticipating it will work, the Trump Administration has procured more than 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine. It has also placed a major order from three Indian companies. After an initial hold on its export, the Indian government has now allowed its export to the US.Responding to questions, Trump said he has been hearing great results about it.But the drug has to be prescribed by a doctor, he added.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“Doctors have to recommend it. I’m not a doctor. I’m just saying we hear great results. And some people say let’s go to a laboratory, let’s test it for a couple of years.

As we speak there are people dying,” Trump asserted.In an interview to Detroit Free Press Journal, Rep Whitsett said she was tested for the coronavirus and learned Monday her results were positive. She said that “less than two hours” after taking hydroxychloroquine, she began to feel relief, the daily reported. When asked by the Free Press if she thinks Trump may have saved her life, Whitsett said, “Yes, I do” and “I do thank him for that.” “I appreciate that woman. She was great. You have to see it to believe it, the way she spoke. It was like a miracle. And this was not a fan of mine, but she’s a fan of mine now and I’m very honoured by it,” Trump told reporters.

08-04-2020||World||Donald Trump upends coronavirus oversight, removing key official||President Donald Trump is moving aggressively to challenge the authority and independence of agency watchdogs overseeing his administration, including removing the inspector general tasked with overseeing the $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue package that passed Congress with bipartisan support.In four days, Trump has fired one inspector general tied to his impeachment, castigated another he felt was overly critical of the coronavirus response and sidelined a third meant to safeguard against wasteful spending of the coronavirus funds.The actions have sent shock waves across the close-knit network of watchdog officials in government, creating open conflict between a president reflexively resistant to outside criticism and an oversight community tasked with rooting out fraud, misconduct and abuse.The most recent act threatens to upend scrutiny of the $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue effort now underway, setting the stage for a major clash between Trump, government watchdogs and Democrats in Congress who are demanding oversight of the vast funds being pumped into the American economy.“We’re seeing since Friday a wrecking ball across the IG community,” said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a government watchdog group.The latest broadside came Tuesday when the Defense Department revealed that Trump had removed acting inspector general Glenn Fine, an experienced watchdog official, from his role as head of a coronavirus spending oversight board. It was unclear who might replace Fine, who also lost his title as acting inspector general.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Fine’s abrupt removal “part of a disturbing pattern of retaliation by the president against independent overseers.” Trump, she said, is attempting to “disregard critical oversight provisions that hold the administration accountable to the law.”Trump himself shed little light on the decision as he spoke to reporters Tuesday evening, saying he doesn’t know Fine, but had “heard the name.”A day earlier, Trump had asserted without evidence that an inspector general report warning of shortages of coronavirus testing in hospitals was “just wrong” and skewed by political bias. The report surveyed more than 300 U.S. hospitals.“Did I hear the word inspector general? Really?” Trump said when pressed about the Health and Human Services watchdog report.“Give me the name of the inspector general,” Trump demanded, before asking, “Could politics be entered into that?” The acting Heath and Human Services inspector general, Christi A. Grimm, is a career employee who took over the position early this year in an interim capacity. Most dramatic of all was Friday’s late-night firing of Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general who drew Trump’s disdain for notifying Congress of an anonymous whistleblower complaint on Ukraine. The complaint led to the president’s impeachment.Trump defended the firing by complaining that Atkinson had never spoken with him about the complaint, even though Atkinson’s job is to provide oversight independent of the White House.The dismissal prompted an unusual, sharply worded statement from Justice Department watchdog Michael Horowitz, who chairs a council of agency inspectors general and who last month had announced Fine’s appointment to the pandemic oversight board. Diverging from Trump’s condemnation of Atkinson as “terrible,” Horowitz called Atkinson’s handling of the whistleblower complaint an example of “integrity, professionalism, and commitment to the rule of law.” And he pointedly noted that the inspector general community will continue to do its job, including oversight of the more than $2 trillion in coronavirus aid.The role of the modern-day inspector general dates to post-Watergate Washington, when Congress installed offices inside agencies as an independent check against mismanagement and abuse of power. Though inspectors general are presidential appointees, some, like Horowitz, serve presidents of both parties. All are expected to be nonpartisan. Over the years, inspectors general have exposed grave problems through their investigations and humbled, or even embarrassed, agency leaders and presidential administrations. Monday’s Health and Human Services report that angered the president chronicled long waits for tests and supply shortages at hospitals across the country. Horowitz, meanwhile has identified significant flaws in the FBI’s surveillance during the Russia investigation. Trump has praised Horowitz’s findings even as he’s attacked his credibility for not finding evidence of political bias in the Russia probe, pejoratively describing him last December as an Obama appointee. Former Justice Department inspector general Michael Bromwich said Trump perceives inspectors’ general offices to have a “uniquely threatening function within the executive branch, which is to provide independent oversight of governmental functions.” “It’s just something that doesn’t compute for him,” Bromwich added. “He understands the value of loyalty. He doesn’t understand the value of independence because that can conflict with loyalty.” Even before this week, Democrats and good-government advocates feared that Trump was using the coronavirus rescue package to reward loyalty. He generated consternation by selecting Brian Miller, who works in the White House counsel’s office, to a new Treasury Department position overseeing $500 billion in coronavirus aid to industry. Miller has worked at the Justice Department and was inspector general for nearly a decade at the General Services Administration, which has a $20 billion annual budget and oversees thousands of federal contracts. Though he is respected in the oversight community, Miller’s role in the White House counsel’s office is troubling, watchdog groups said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump for nominating “one of his own lawyers,” and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer questioned whether someone who worked for the president could be independent. Those concerns were accelerated Tuesday with word that Trump was replacing the respected inspector general selected to oversee the pandemic board.“The president now has engaged in a series of actions designed to neuter any kind of oversight of his actions and that of the administration during a time of national crisis, when trillions of dollars are being allocated to help the American people,” Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff told The Associated Press.But Trump has made clear his willingness to flout that system, perhaps foreshadowing the chaos of the last week. As lawmakers were in the final stages of drafting what became the $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue package, he declared, “I’ll be the oversight.” And even when he signed it, he attached a statement that says some of the oversight provisions in the law “raise constitutional concerns” and may not be followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-upends-coronavirus-oversight-removing-key-official/story-c3Pey0y1JHdQTflPXQO9tM.html
08-04-2020||World||Pulitzer Prize announcement to be postponed due to coronavirus pandemic||The Pulitzer Prize Board will postpone the announcement of this year’s winners because some board members have been busy covering the global coronavirus outbreak, the organization announced Tuesday.The announcement of Pulitzer winners in journalism and the arts will be postponed from April 20 to May 4, the board said. Pulitzer Prize administrator Dana Canedy said the board includes many journalists who are on the front lines of reporting on the coronavirus pandemic. “As they focus on this critical mission, this postponement will provide additional time to thoroughly evaluate the 2020 Pulitzer finalists,” Canedy said. She added, “More than ever, this moment highlights journalism’s mission to provide a vital public service. It also demonstrates literature and the arts’ ability to transport and uplift the human spirit during trying times. The Pulitzer Prizes will continue its more than century-long mandate to celebrate such excellence.” The annual awards luncheon, traditionally held at Columbia University in May, will be postponed as well. Details of a fall reception for winners will be announced at a later date.The Pulitzer Prizes in journalism were first awarded in 1917 and are considered the field’s most prestigious honor in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pulitzer-prize-announcement-to-be-postponed-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic/story-0TbMuzwSAqGRMvJXmN1ZmJ.html
08-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Boris Johnson listened to his scientists about coronavirus but they were slow to sound the alarm||It was early spring when British scientists laid out the bald truth to their government. It was “highly likely,” they said, that there was now “sustained transmission” of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.If unconstrained and if the virus behaved as in China, up to four-fifths of Britons could be infected and one in a hundred might die, wrote the scientists, members of an official committee set up to model the spread of pandemic flu, on March 2. Their assessment didn’t spell it out, but that was a prediction of over 500,000 deaths in this nation of nearly 70 million.Yet the next day, March 3, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was his cheery self. He joked that he was still shaking hands with everyone, including at a hospital treating coronavirus patients.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “Our country remains extremely well prepared,” Johnson said as Italy reached 79 deaths. “We already have a fantastic NHS,” the national public health service, “fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease.”Alongside him at the Downing Street press conference was Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser and himself an epidemiologist. Whitty passed on the modelling committee’s broad conclusions, including the prediction of a possible 80% infection rate and the consequent deaths. But he played them down, saying the number of people who would be infected was probably “a lot lower” and coming up with a total was “largely speculative.”Also read: British PM Boris Johnson stable, in ‘good spirits’ in ICUThe upbeat tone of that briefing stood in sharp contrast with the growing unease of many of the government’s scientific advisers behind the scenes. They were already convinced that Britain was on the brink of a disastrous outbreak, a Reuters investigation has found.Interviews with more than 20 British scientists, key officials and senior sources in Johnson’s Conservative Party, and a study of minutes of advisory committee meetings and public testimony and documents, show how these scientific advisers concluded early the virus could be devastating.But the interviews and documents also reveal that for more than two months, the scientists whose advice guided Downing Street did not clearly signal their worsening fears to the public or the government. Until March 12, the risk level, set by the government’s top medical advisers on the recommendation of the scientists, remained at “moderate,” suggesting only the possibility of a wider outbreak.Also read: UK mood more sombre as world leaders wish PM Johnson recovery from Covid-19 “You know, there’s a small little cadre of people in the middle, who absolutely did realise what was going on, and likely to happen,” said John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling and a key adviser to the government, known for his work on tracking Ebola. Edmunds was among those who did call on the government to elevate the warning level earlier.From the outset, said Edmunds, work by scientists had shown that, with only limited interventions, the virus would trigger an “overwhelming epidemic” in which Britain’s health service was not going “to get anywhere near being able to cope with it. That was clear from the beginning.”But he said: “I do think there’s a bit of a worry in terms you don’t want to unnecessarily panic people.”Johnson, who himself has sickened with the virus, moved more slowly than the leaders of many other prosperous countries to adopt a lockdown. He has been criticised for not moving more swiftly to organise mass tests and mobilise supplies of life-saving equipment and beds. Johnson was hospitalized on April 5 and moved to intensive care the next day.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage It is too soon to judge the ultimate soundness of the UK’s early response. If history concludes that it was lacking, then the criticism levelled at the prime minister may be that, rather than ignoring the advice of his scientific advisers, he failed to question their assumptions.Interviews and records published so far suggest that the scientific committees that advised Johnson didn’t study, until mid-March, the option of the kind of stringent lockdown adopted early on in China, where the disease arose in December, and then followed by much of Europe and finally by Britain itself. The scientists’ reasoning: Britons, many of them assumed, simply wouldn’t accept such restrictions.The UK scientists were also mostly convinced - and many still are - that, once the new virus escaped China, quarantine measures would likely not succeed. Minutes of technical committees reviewed by Reuters indicate that almost no attention was paid to preparing a programme of mass testing. Other minutes and interviews show Britain was following closely a well-laid plan to fight a flu pandemic - not this deadlier disease. The scientists involved, however, deny that the flu focus ultimately made much difference.Now, as countries debate how to combat the virus, some experts here say, the lesson from the British experience may be that governments and scientists worldwide must increase the transparency of their planning so that their thinking and assumptions are open to challenge.John Ashton, a clinician and former regional director of Public Health England, the government agency overseeing healthcare, said the government’s advisers took too narrow a view and hewed to limited assumptions. They were too “narrowly drawn as scientists from a few institutions,” he said. Their handling of COVID-19, Ashton said, shows the need for a broader approach. “In the future we need a much wider group of independent advisers.”Michael Cates, who succeeded Stephen Hawking as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, is leading an initiative by the Royal Society, the UK’s leading scientific body, to bring modellers in from other scientific disciplines to help understand the epidemic.“Without faulting anyone so far, it’s vital, where there is such a lot at stake, to throw the maximum possible light on the methods, assumptions and data built into our understanding of how this epidemic will develop,” he told Reuters.In a statement to Reuters, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the government was delivering “a science-led action plan” to contain the outbreak. “As the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans and what we learned from previous exercises has helped us to rapidly respond to COVID-19.”A LOW RISK TO THE PUBLICWhen news came from China in January of a new infectious disease, Johnson had reason to believe his country was well prepared. It had some of the world’s best scientists and a well-drilled plan to deal with potentially lethal pandemics. Perhaps, some scientists say in hindsight, the plan made them slow to adapt.For many years, the Cabinet Office - a collection of officials who act as the prime minister’s direct arm to run the government - took the threat of pandemics seriously. Presciently, it rated pandemics as the Number 1 threat to the country, ahead of terrorism and financial crashes.At the centre of planning was a small group of scientists, among them Edmunds. His research group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine runs one of the two computer modelling centres for epidemics that have mostly driven government policy. The other is at nearby Imperial College. Edmunds remembers that early in the outbreak, the data from China were sketchy, in the period “where the Chinese were trying to pretend that this wasn’t transmissible between humans.”Edmunds and his colleague at Imperial, Neil Ferguson, were part of an alphabet soup of committees that fed advice into the Cabinet Office machinery around the prime minister. Both were founders of the flu pandemic modelling committee, known as SPI-M, that produced the March 2 report warning of more than 500,000 deaths. This committee had met together for nearly 15 years.Ferguson did not respond to a request to be interviewed for this article.Edmunds and Ferguson were also part of NERVTAG, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group. Both too were members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as SAGE, that advises the government in times of crisis. SAGE reports directly to Johnson and the government’s main emergency committee, COBRA.At first, when NERVTAG met on January 13, it studied information from China that there was “no evidence of significant human to human transmission” of the new virus, according to minutes of the meeting. The scientists agreed the risk to the UK population was “very low.”The evidence soon changed, but this wasn’t reflected in the official threat level. By the end of January, scientists in China began releasing clinical data. Case studies published in the British medical journal, The Lancet, showed 17% of the first 99 coronavirus cases needed critical care. Eleven patients died. Another Chinese study, in the same magazine, warned starkly of a global spread and urged: “Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.”Edmunds recalled that “from about mid January onwards, it was absolutely obvious that this was serious, very serious.” Graham Medley, a professor of infectious diseases modelling at the London School and chairman of SPI-M, agreed. He said that the committee was “clear that this was going to be big from the first meeting.” At the end of January, his committee moved into “wartime” mode, he said, reporting directly into SAGE.Dr Jon Read, a senior lecturer in biostatistics at the University of Lancaster, also a member of SPI-M, said by the end of January it was apparent the virus had “pandemic potential” and that death rates for the elderly were brutal. “From my perspective within the sort of modelling community, everybody’s aware of this, and we’re saying that this is probably going to be pretty bad,” he said.But the scientists did not articulate their fears forcefully to the government, minutes of committee meetings reveal.On January 21, scientists on NERVTAG endorsed the elevation of the UK risk warning from COVID-19 from “very low” to “low.” SAGE met formally for the first time the following day about the coronavirus threat. So did COBRA, which was chaired by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who would contract the virus himself in late March. He told reporters after the meeting: “The clinical advice is that the risk to the public remains low.”In response to questions from Reuters, the government’s Department of Health declined to clarify how the risk levels are defined or what action, if any, they trigger. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “Increasing the risk level in the UK is a belt and braces measure which allows the government to plan for all future eventualities.”Two days later, China put the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, into a complete lockdown. Hubei, the surrounding province, would follow. But already, 17 passenger flights had flown directly from Wuhan to Britain since the start of 2020, and 614 flights from the whole of China, according to FlightRadar24, a flight-tracking service. That meant thousands of Chinese, some of them potential carriers, had come to Britain. On April 5, scientific adviser Ferguson said he estimated only one-third of infected people reaching Britain had been detected.As they watched China impose its lockdown, the British scientists assumed that such drastic actions would never be acceptable in a democracy like the UK. Among those modelling the outbreak, such stringent counter-measures were not, at first, examined.“We had milder interventions in place,” said Edmunds, because no one thought it would be acceptable politically “to shut the country down.” He added: “We didn’t model it because it didn’t seem to be on the agenda. And Imperial (College) didn’t look at it either.” The NERVTAG committee agreed, noting in its minutes that tough measures in the short term would be pointless, as they “would only delay the UK outbreak, not prevent it.”That limited approach mirrored the UK’s longstanding pandemic flu strategy. The Department of Health declined a request from Reuters for a copy of its updated pandemic plan, without providing a reason. But a copy of the 2011 “UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011,” which a spokesman said was still relevant, stated the “working presumption will be that Government will not impose any such restrictions. The emphasis will instead be on encouraging all those who have symptoms to follow the advice to stay at home and avoid spreading their illness.”According to one senior Conservative Party politician, who was officially briefed as the crisis unfolded, the close involvement in the response to the coronavirus of the same scientific advisers and civil servants who drew up the flu plan may have created a “cognitive bias.”“We had in our minds that Covid-19 was a nasty flu and needed to be treated as such,” he said. “The implication was it was a disease that could not be stopped and that it was ultimately not that deadly.”While the UK was prepared to fight the flu, places in Asia like China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea had built their pandemic plans with lessons learned from fighting the more lethal SARS outbreak that began in 2002, he said. SARS had a fatality rate of up to 14%. As a result, these countries, he said, were more ready to resort to widespread testing, lockdowns and other draconian measures to keep their citizens from spreading the virus.Scientists involved in the UK response disagree that following the government’s flu plan clouded their thinking or influenced the outbreak’s course. The plan had a “reasonable worst case” scenario as devastating as the worst predictions for Covid-19, they note.Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, and a member of the SPI-M committee, said Covid-19 did behave differently than an expected pandemic flu - for example school closures proved to be far less effective in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. But, broadly, “the government has been consistently responsive to changing facts.”By the end of January, the government’s chief medical adviser, Whitty, was explaining to politicians in private, according to at least two people who spoke to him, that if the virus escaped China, it would in time infect the great majority of people in Britain. It could only be slowed down, not stopped. On Jan 30, the government raised the threat level to “moderate” from “low.”The country’s medical officers “consider it prudent for our governments to escalate planning and preparation in case of a more widespread outbreak,” a statement said at the time. Whitty did not respond to questions from Reuters for this article.A TIME TO PREPAREOn the evening of January 31, Boris Johnson sat before a fireplace in 10 Downing Street and told the nation, in a televised address: “This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama.”He was talking of finally delivering Brexit, or what he called “this recaptured sovereignty.” Until that moment, Johnson’s premiership had been utterly absorbed by delivering on that challenge.With Brexit done, Johnson had the chance to focus on other matters the following month, among them the emerging virus threat. But leaving the European Union had a consequence.Between February 13 and March 30, Britain missed a total of eight conference calls or meetings about the coronavirus between EU heads of state or health ministers - meetings that Britain was still entitled to join. Although Britain did later make an arrangement to attend lower-level meetings of officials, it had missed a deadline to participate in a common purchase scheme for ventilators, to which it was invited. Ventilators, vitally important to treating the direst cases of Covid-19, have fallen into short supply globally. Johnson’s spokesman blamed an administrative error.A Downing Street aide told Reuters that from around the end of January, Johnson concentrated his attention increasingly on the coronavirus threat, receiving “very frequent” updates at least once per day from mid February, either in person or via a daily dashboard of cases.In the medical and scientific world, there was growing concern about the threat of the virus to the UK. A report from Exeter University, published on February 12, warned a UK outbreak could peak within four months and, without mitigation, infect 45 million people.That worried Rahuldeb Sarkar, a consultant physician in respiratory medicine and critical care in the county of Kent, who foresaw that intensive care beds could be swamped. Even if disease transmission was reduced by half, he wrote in a report aimed at clinicians and actuaries in mid-February, a coronavirus outbreak in the UK would “have a chance of overwhelming the system.”With Whitty stating in a BBC interview on February 13 that a UK outbreak was still an “if, not a when,” Richard Horton, a medical doctor and editor of the Lancet, said the government and public health service wasted an opportunity that month to prepare quarantine restriction measures and a programme of mass tests, and procure resources like ventilators and personal protective equipment for expanded intensive care.Calling the lost chance a “national scandal” in a later editorial, he would testify to parliament about a mismatch between “the urgent warning that was coming from the frontline in China” and the “somewhat pedestrian evaluation” of the threat from the scientific advice to the government.After developing a test for the new virus by January 10, health officials adopted a centralised approach to its deployment, initially assigning a single public laboratory in north London to perform the tests. But, according to later government statements, there was no wider plan envisaged to make use of hundreds of laboratories across the country, both public and private, that could have been recruited.According to emails and more than a dozen scientists interviewed by Reuters, the government issued no requests to labs for assistance with staff or testing equipment until the middle of March, when many abruptly received requests to hand over nucleic acid extraction instruments, used in testing. An executive at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford said he could have carried out up to 1,000 tests per day from February. But the call never came.“You would have thought that they would be bashing down the door,” said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. By April 5, Britain had carried out 195,524 tests, in contrast to at least 918,000 completed a week earlier in Germany.Nor was there an effective effort to expand the supply of ventilators. The Department of Health told Reuters in a statement that the government started talking to manufacturers of ventilators about procuring extra supplies in February. But it was not until March 16, after it was clear supplies could run out, that Johnson launched an appeal to industry to help ramp up production.Charles Bellm, managing director of Intersurgical, a global supplier of medical ventilation products based outside London, said he has been contacted by more than a dozen governments around the world, including France, New Zealand and Indonesia. But there had been no contact from the British government. “I find it somewhat surprising, I have spoken to a lot of other governments,” he said.Countering such criticism, Hancock, the health minister, said the government is on track to deliver about 10,000 more ventilators in the coming weeks. One reason Britain was behind some countries on testing, he said, was the absence of a large diagnostics industry at the outbreak of the epidemic. “We didn’t have the scale.”GAME OVERIt was during the school half-term holidays in February that frontline doctor Nicky Longley began to realise that early efforts to contain the disease were likely doomed.For weeks now, doctors and public health workers had been watching out for people with flu-like symptoms coming in from China. Longley, an infectious diseases consultant at London’s Hospital for Tropical Diseases, was part of a team that staffed a public health service helpline for those with symptoms. The plan, she said, had been to make all effort to catch every case and their contacts. And “to start with, it looked like it was working.”But then, bad news. First, on Wednesday the 19th of February, came the shock news from Iran of two deaths. Then, on Friday the 21st, came a death in Italy and a bloom of cases in Lombardy and Veneto regions. Britain has close links to both countries. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy that week.“I don’t think anybody really foresaw what was happening in Italy,” Longley said. “And I think, the minute everybody saw that, we thought: ‘This is game over now.’“Until then, Longley said, everyone felt “there was a chance to stamp it out” even though most were sceptical it could be done long-term. But after Iran and Italy, it was obvious containment would not work. The contact tracing continued for a while. But as the cases in London built up, and the volume of calls to the helpline mushroomed, the priority began to shift to clinical care of the serious cases. “At a certain point you have to make a decision about where you put your efforts as a workforce.”Edmunds noted that Iran and Italy had hardly reported a case until that point. “And then, all of sudden you had deaths recorded.” There was a rule of thumb that, in an outbreak’s early stages, for each death there were probably 1,000 cases in a community. “And so it was quite clear that there were at least thousands of cases in Italy, possibly tens of thousands of cases in Italy right then.”Amid the dreadful news from Italy, the scientists at NERVTAG convened by phone that Friday, 21st February. But they decided to recommend keeping the threat level at “moderate,” where it had sat since January 30th. The minutes don’t give a detailed explanation of the decision. Edmunds, who had technical difficulties and couldn’t be heard on the call, emailed afterwards to ask the warning to be elevated to “high,” the minutes revealed. But the warning level remained lower. It’s unclear why.“I just thought, are we still, we still thinking that it’s mild or something? It definitely isn’t, you know,” said Edmunds.A spokesman for the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, didn’t directly respond to Reuters questions about the threat level. Asked whether, with hindsight, the scientists’ approach was the right one, the spokesperson said in a statement that “SAGE and advisers provide advice, while Ministers and the Government make decisions.”HERD IMMUNITYOn Sunday, March 1st, Ferguson, Edmunds and other advisers spent the day with NHS public health service experts trying to work out how many hospital beds and other key resources would be needed as the outbreak exploded. By now, Italian data was showing that a tenth of all infected patients needed intensive care.The following day, pandemic modelling committee SPI-M produced its “consensus report” that warned the coronavirus was now transmitting freely in the UK. That Thursday, March 5, the first death in the UK was announced. Italy, which reached 827 deaths by March 11, ordered a national lockdown. Spain and France prepared to follow suit.Johnson held out against stringent measures, saying he was following the advice of the government’s scientists. He asserted on March 9: “We are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice.”Indeed, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, SAGE, had recommended that day, with no dissension recorded in its summary, that the UK reject a China-style lockdown. SAGE decided that “implementing a subset of measures would be ideal,” according to a record of its conclusions. Tougher measures could create a “large second epidemic wave once the measures were lifted,” SAGE said.On March 12 came a bombshell for the British public. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, announced Britain had moved the threat to UK citizens from “moderate” to “high.” And he said the country had moved from trying to contain the disease to trying to slow its spread. New cases were not going to be tracked at all. “It is no longer necessary for us to identify every case,” he said. Only hospital cases would, in future, be tested for the virus. What had been an undisclosed policy was in the open: beyond a certain point, attempts to completely extinguish the virus would stop.The same day, putting aside his jokey self, Johnson made a speech in Downing Street, flanked by two Union Jacks and evoking the spirit of Winston Churchill’s “darkest hour” address. He warned: “I must level with you, level with the British public - more families, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.”For most Britons, it came as a shock. Several of the next day’s newspapers splashed Johnson’s words on their front pages.Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, who chaired SAGE, said in a BBC interview on March 13 that the plan was to simply control the pace of infection. The government had, for now, rejected what he called “eye-catching measures” like stopping mass gatherings such as football games or closing schools. The “aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not to suppress it completely.” Most people would get the virus mildly, and this would build up “herd immunity” which, in time, would stop the disease’s progress.But by now, the country was rebelling. Major institutions decided to close. After players began to get infected, the professional football leagues suspended their games. As Johnson still refused to close schools and ban mass gatherings, the Daily Mirror’s banner headline, summing up a widespread feeling, asked on March 13: “Is It Enough?”The catalyst for a policy reversal came on March 16 with the publication of a report by Neil Ferguson’s Imperial College team. It predicted that, unconstrained, the virus could kill 510,000 people. Even the government’s “mitigation” approach could lead to 250,000 deaths and intensive care units being overwhelmed at least eight times over.Imperial’s prediction of over half a million deaths was no different from the report by the government’s own pandemic modelling committee two weeks earlier. Yet it helped trigger a policy turn-around, both in London and in Washington, culminating seven days later in Johnson announcing a full lockdown of Britain. The report also jarred the US administration into tougher measures to slow the virus’ spread.Ferguson was now in isolation himself after catching the virus. Testifying by video link to a committee in Parliament, he explained why he and other scientific advisers had shifted from advocating partial social-distancing measures to warning that without a rigorous shutdown, the NHS would be overwhelmed. The reason, he said, lay in data coming out of Italy that showed large numbers of patients required critical care.“The revision was that, basically, estimates of the proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, which is only done in a critical care unit, roughly doubled,” he said.Edmunds had a different explanation for the policy shift.What allowed Britain to alter course, said Edmunds, was a lockdown in Italy that “opened up the policy space” coupled with new data. First came a paper by Edmunds’ own London School team that examined intermittent lockdowns, sent to the modelling committee on March 11 and validated by Edinburgh University. Ferguson’s revised Imperial research followed.Woolhouse, the Edinburgh professor, confirmed the sequence.Edmunds said these new studies together had demonstrated that if the British government imposed a lengthy period of tougher measures, perhaps relaxed periodically, then the size of the epidemic could be substantially reduced.Still, without a vaccine or effective treatments, it’s going to be hard to avoid a substantial part of the British population getting infected, said Edmunds. “Until you get to a vaccine, there is no way of getting out of this without certainly tens of thousands of deaths,” he said. “And probably more than that.”Now subject to intense public scrutiny, the modelling teams at universities across Britain continue to work on different scenarios for how the world can escape the virus’s clutches. According to Medley, the chairman of the SPI-M pandemic modelling committee, no one now doubts, for all the initial reservations, that a lockdown was essential in Britain.Medley added: “At the moment we don’t know what’s going to happen in six months. All we know is that unless we stop transmission now, the health service will collapse. Yep, that’s the only thing we know for sure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-boris-johnson-listened-to-his-scientists-about-coronavirus-but-they-were-slow-to-sound-the-alarm/story-ixQ75DIBt1zP0YxZaGiSWO.html
08-04-2020||World||New York coronavirus deaths exceed 4,000, topping toll for 9/11 attacks||New York City’s death toll from the coronavirus rose past 4,000 on Tuesday, eclipsing the number killed at the World Trade Center on 9/11. In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson lay in intensive care, believed to be the first major world leader hospitalized with the virus.The twin developments came even as the crisis seemed to be easing or at least stabilizing, by some measures, in New York and parts of Europe, though health officials warned people at nearly every turn not to let their guard down. After 76 days, China finally lifted the lockdown on Wuhan, the city of 11 million where the outbreak began.COVID-19’s toll in New York City is now more than 1,000 deaths higher than that of the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil, which killed 2,753 people in the city and 2,977 overall, when hijacked planes slammed into the twin towers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001.New York state recorded 731 new coronavirus deaths, its biggest one-day jump yet, for a statewide toll of nearly 5,500, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.“A lot of pain again today for many New Yorkers,” he said.But in an encouraging sign, the governor said hospital admissions and the number of those receiving breathing tubes are dropping, indicating that measures taken to force people to keep their distance from one another are succeeding.And alarming as the one-day increase in deaths might sound, the governor said that’s a “lagging indicator,” reflecting people who had been hospitalized before this week. Over the past several days, in fact, the number of deaths in New York appeared to be leveling off.“You see that plateauing — that’s because of what we are doing. If we don’t do what we are doing, that is a much different curve,” Cuomo said. “So social distancing is working.”Still, 6-foot social distancing has become impossible at times in the city’s subway system.With service drastically reduced, essential workers are encountering some busy trains as they head to their jobs. Photos taken in Brooklyn showed riders sitting or standing within a few inches of each other, some not wearing face masks.Across the U.S., the death toll topped 12,000, with around 380,000 confirmed infections. Some of the deadliest hot spots were Detroit, New Orleans and the New York metropolitan area, which includes parts of Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut. New Jersey recorded over 1,200 dead, most of them in the northern counties where many residents commute into New York City.In London, the 55-year-old Johnson was in stable condition and conscious at a hospital, where he was receiving oxygen but was not on a ventilator, officials said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was designated to run the country in the meantime.“For all of us in Cabinet, he is not just our boss. He’s also a colleague and he’s also our friend,” Raab said. “And I’m confident he’ll pull through because if there’s one thing I know about this prime minister, he’s a fighter.”Deaths in Britain reached nearly 6,200, after a one-day increase of almost 800.President Donald Trump trained his anger at the World Health Organization and threatened to freeze U.S. funding for it, saying the international group had “missed the call” on the pandemic and that it was “very China-centric.”Throughout his presidency, Trump has voiced skepticism toward many international organizations and has repeatedly heaped scorn on the WHO. In its most recent budget proposal in February, his administration called for slashing the U.S. contribution to the WHO from an estimated $122.6 million to $57.9 million.Trump suggested the WHO had gone along with Beijing’s efforts months ago to minimize the severity of the outbreak. The WHO has praised China for its transparency on the virus, even though some public health experts regard the country’s figures with suspicion.“They should have known and they probably did know,” Trump said of WHO officials.On Wall Street, a strong rally propelled by signs that the outbreak may be leveling off in some of the hard-hit parts of the world evaporated after the price of crude oil suddenly fell. Stocks ended the day slightly lower.Elsewhere around the globe, Chinese authorities ended the lockdown on Wuhan, allowing residents to travel in and out of the sprawling industrial city. Residents must use a cellphone app showing that they are healthy and have not been in recent contact with anyone confirmed to have the virus.China, which officially recorded more than 82,000 infections and over 3,300 deaths, listed no new cases on Tuesday.In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a month-long state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures because of a spike of infections in the country with the world’s oldest population. The order will close hostess bars and other night entertainment.“My lifestyle will change. These are difficult times” said Yoshiyuki Kataoka, 44, a nightlife industry worker. “Maybe I’ll become a recluse.”In some European hot spots, as in New York, authorities saw signs that the outbreak was turning a corner, based on slowdowns in new deaths and hospitalizations.In Spain, new deaths Tuesday rose to 743 and infections climbed by 5,400 after five days of declines, but the increases were believed to reflect a weekend backlog. Authorities said they were confident in the downward trend.In Italy, with over 16,500 deaths, authorities appealed to people ahead of Easter weekend not to lower their guard and to abide by a lockdown now in its fifth week, even as new cases dropped to a level not seen since the early weeks of the outbreak.“Finally it seems we are beginning to see a lessening of new cases,” said Giovanni Rezza, director of the infectious-disease division of Italy’s national health institute.In France, the number of dead passed the bleak milestone of 10,000, climbing to more than 10,300, said Jerome Salomon, national health director.“We are in the epidemic’s ascendant stage,” he said. “We have not yet reached the peak.” But he offered a glimpse of hope, saying the virus rate is ”slowing a little.”U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said that if Americans continue to practice social distancing for the rest of April, “we will be able to get back to some sense of normalcy.”“I want the American people to know there is a light at the end of this tunnel, and we feel confident that if we keep doing the right thing for the rest of this month, that we can start to slowly reopen in some places,” he said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”One lockdown exception in the U.S. was Wisconsin, which asked hundreds of thousands of voters to ignore a stay-at-home order to participate in its presidential primary Tuesday.Lines were particularly long in Milwaukee, the state’s largest city and a Democratic stronghold, where just five of 180 traditional polling places were open. Many voters across the state did not have facial coverings in line with public health recommendations.Worldwide, about 1.4 million people have been confirmed infected and over 79,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The true numbers are almost certainly much higher, because of limited testing, different rules for counting the dead and deliberate underreporting by some governments.For most people, the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia. About 300,000 people have recovered worldwide, by Johns Hopkins’ count.One of the main models on the outbreak, from the University of Washington, is projecting about 82,000 U.S. deaths through early August, with the highest number on April 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-coronavirus-deaths-exceed-4-000-topping-toll-for-9-11-attacks/story-ecHv90S0gttCtMZBdG2IjI.html

But it is essential if we do not wish to find ourselves in an even worse situation than the one we are experiencing today,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-bans-daytime-jogging-as-coronavirus-deaths-hit-new-high/story-QzO5YyDZaYBvhTFeIr7TPL.html

According to Trump, the WHO “seems to be very biased toward China. That’s not right.” His comments built on an earlier statement on Twitter in which he accused the WHO of being “very China centric.” Trump asked why the WHO had given “such a faulty recommendation,” apparently referring to the UN body’s advice against curtailing international travel to stop the virus which first spread from China.Also read| Blood transfusion from those who have recovered from Covid-19 may help“Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on,” Trump wrote, referring to his decision to ban travel from the country. China faces criticism in Washington, particularly from Republicans, over the way it handled the pandemic and Trump has expressed doubt over the accuracy of Chinese statistics for cases and deaths.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayHowever, Trump himself has been widely criticized for initially downplaying the virus, which he likened to an ordinary flu and said was under control in the United States, before later accepting that it was a national emergency.More than 12,000 Americans have now died from Covid-19.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-donald-trump-accuses-who-of-bias-toward-china-threatened-to-put-hold-on-us-funding/story-m1N59D5SbtFeiNs6I80bAP.html

Pakistan has to comply with the 13 remaining items in the action plan that cover eight key categories. It has to demonstrate that relevant authorities are cooperating to identify and take enforcement action against illegal money or value transfer services and also prove the implementation of cross-border currency controls, the report said.It also has to demonstrate that law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terror financing activity and that such investigations and prosecutions target designated individuals and entities, the report added.Outstanding action areas also include effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all terrorists designated under UN Security Council resolutions 1267 and 1373, including preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets, and prohibiting access to funds and financial services.Pakistan will also have to show it is acting against violations of the UN sanctions by depriving sanctioned terrorists of their resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-meet-in-beijing-pakistan-s-action-on-terror-funding-to-be-reviewed/story-A8ahjUwxznPrNS99UrjpbJ.html
