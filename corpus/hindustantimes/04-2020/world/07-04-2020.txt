The informal discussion will be preceded by a briefing by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.“The WHO really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately, I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation,” Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday. It is not what prompted the outburst but as one Indian analyst put it, Trump had hit the nail on its head.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was elected to the post after China backed him in the May 2017 election as he defeated US-backed Dr David Nabarro, who was the candidate of the UK. Despite the coronavirus being detected in Wuhan in China as early as November 17, 2019, the WHO categorised Covid 19 outbreak as a pandemic on 12 March 2020 when it had crossed the borders and created havoc in Europe. By then, the virus had already killed 1,000 people in the european region.All the 10 non-permanent members of the UN Security Council have backed the informal discussion led by the UNSC President; the post is held by the Dominican Republic. But whether the closed-door discussion will conclude with any outcome depends on the proposals put up and the exercise of veto powers of China and its ally Russia.If President Trump’s tweet is indicative of the US mind, then the vote will be 13 to 2 or 14 to 1 depending on how Russia plays. Other two members of the P5, the UK and France have suffered at the hands of pandemic and so has Europe.While China may say that the pandemic is not a peace and security issue - the argument used to block a request by Estonia for a discussion last month - the economic misery that the pandemic has hurled the world towards a deep crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-sets-stage-for-unsc-meet-on-covid-19-on-april-9-pans-who-china/story-uqEwh7zS2KPGYbgIDAb1ZM.html
07-04-2020||World||‘WHO blew it’: Trump targets health body for ‘faulty’ recommendation over Covid-19||As the number of fatalities crossed 11,000 in the United States Tuesday morning and the country continued to struggle of rising number of cases and shortage of medical supplies, President Donald Trump put the World Health Organization on notice calling it “China-centric” and giving the US bad advice.“The WHO really blew it,” the president wrote on twitter, “For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?”Also read: Trump sets stage for UNSC meet on Covid-19 on April 9; pans WHO, ChinaTrump has touted the February 2 ban on travelers from China as a key part of his administration’s response to the outbreak and that he ordered despite the advice of those who wanted him to “ride it out”. But it wasn’t immediately clear what brought on this sudden outburst against the world body that is trying to organize a united global response to the pandemic that has killed more than 76,000 people and caused 1.3 million confirmed infections around the globe. The WHO had in January recommended countries keep their borders even as it was warning the world about the epidemic which it branded a pandemic in March.American officials and lawmakers have accused WHO of readily certifying Chinese numbers on the outbreak that they believe are grossly suppressed. Rick Scott, a Republican senator, has said WHO is “helping Communist China cover up” the extent of the outbreak and called for a congressional hearing to consider continued US funding of the world body.The United States has exited a number of world bodies and pact on President Trump watch: the Paris Accord on climate change (2017), UNESCO (2017), Iran deal (2018) and UNHCR (2018). And the president has complained about US contributions to world bodies such as the United Nations. The president has been battling criticism himself for botched response to the crisis, including delayed start of mitigation efforts, despite sufficient warnings, including, as reported widely on Monday, by one of his top advisers, Peter Navarro, who wrote an internal White House memo in January warning that that the epidemic could imperil the “lives of millions of Americans”. The president was underplaying the threat at the time.The number of fatalities went up to 11,018 Sunday morning confirmed cases to nearly 370,000. New York state accounted for a third of both the fatalities and cases with more than 4,750 deaths and 131,000 cases. New York city, the epicenter of the American outbreak, had 3,485 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-blew-it-trump-targets-health-body-for-faulty-recommendation-over-covid-19/story-iYPODBhuVDNtFQJpdhOeeJ.html

The previous single-day record was 630, set on Friday.New York has borne the brunt of America’s deadly coronavirus pandemic, accounting for around half the number of deaths across the country.COVID-19 has killed more than 11,000 people in the United States, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University.Cuomo said New York appeared be nearing the peak of its pandemic, with a three-day average of hospitalizations down.He added that intensive care admissions and intubations had also declined.“We’re projecting that we’re reaching a plateau in the number of hospitalizations,” Cuomo told reporters.He said social distancing was working, urging New Yorkers to continue to stay indoors unless absolutely necessary.“I know it’s hard but we have to keep doing it,” Cuomo implored.On Monday, the governor extended a shutdown until near the end of the month, ordering schools and non-essential businesses to remain closed until April 29.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was “too early to draw any definite conclusions” about whether the situation was improving in the Big Apple.“I want to really make sure none of us in public life tell you we have turned a corner until we are absolutely certain,” he told reporters.Elsewhere, a crew member of the military hospital ship USNS Comfort tested positive for the virus, a navy spokesperson told AFP.The vessel arrived in New York last month to relieve the burden on hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.“The crew member is isolated from patients and other crew members. There is no impact to Comfort’s mission, and this will not affect the ability for Comfort to receive patients,” said the spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-registers-record-731-coronavirus-deaths-in-24-hours/story-EzVTcuvLbuJdvo4TfxeV7N.html
07-04-2020||World||UK mood more sombre as world leaders wish PM Johnson recovery from Covid-19||The mood across the United Kingdom turned gloomier when it was announced on Monday night that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been moved to the intensive care unit in hospital, as get-well messages from world leaders poured in.The death toll from the coronavirus pandemic has crossed 5,000 in the UK, with the number of cases testing positive has grown to over 51,000. New mega hospitals are being set up as the National Health Service grapples with the growing challenge.Apart from the inconvenience, and even public irritation by some at the restrictions imposed, there is much despair at not being able to enjoy sunny, increasingly warm weather that coincided with the three-week lockdown imposed from March 23.The stay-at-home message harped on from every media has prompted the vast majority of Britons hunkering down in homes, barely emerging for shopping, walks or essential work. There are concerns that the situation may lead to mental health issues.Johnson’s political friends, foes and others rallied for his quick return to Downing Street, with many calling for national clapping in his support at 8 pm on Tuesday. #ClapForBoris trended, but critics insisted they would not join, given his controversial handling of the pandemic.The government’s approach (’herd immunity’ giving way to lockdown) has come in for much criticism from experts and others, but several critics said the country cannot afford a lack of strong leadership at the top of government, and wished him speedy recovery.Ministers reiterated the core message to stay at home and cited Johnson’s hospitalisation as an example that the virus can affect anyone, and cited his previous robust health maintained by regular runs and cycling as not making him immune to it.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among world leaders wishing Johnson speedy recovery. He tweeted: “You’re a fighter and you will overcome this challenge. Prayers for you good health and best wishes in ensuring a healthy UK”.US President Donald Trump said Americans “are all praying for his recovery”, adding: “I want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine, and a friend to our nation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson. We are very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this afternoon”.Russia President Vladimir Putin wished Johnson a speedy recovery, saying he was “convinced that your energy, optimism and sense of humour will help you overcome the disease”, while French President Emmanuel Macros tweeted: “My full support to Boris Johnson, his family and the British people at this difficult time. I hope he will rapidly overcome this ordeal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mood-more-sombre-as-world-leaders-wish-pm-johnson-recovery-from-covid-19/story-Q3C2chAizhiAsI8HCFMfXJ.html

Downing Street said if Raab were also to be incapacitated, the role would be performed by chancellor Rishi Sunak.Johnson, 55, was described by his spokesperson as being stable, in ‘good spirits’, breathing unassisted and without pneumonia. Queen Elizabeth, members of the royal family, leading individuals across the political spectrum and others wished him speedy recovery.Friends of Johnson recalled his robust health based on playing rugby, tennis and running. Former prime minister David Cameron described him as a “tough and resilient guy”, adding: “He is pretty fit. I have faced him on the tennis court and am sure he will be fine”.Michael Gove, cabinet office minister, announced that he did not have symptoms but is in self-isolation. He is the latest senior figure at the heart of the Johnson government whose movements have been curbed by the virus.Gove said while working from home that Johnson is not on ventilator, but has been administered oxygen: “One of the reasons for being in intensive care is to make sure that whatever support the medical team considered to be appropriate can be provided”.“The prime minister was taken into hospital on Sunday. He was undergoing a series of tests when his condition deteriorated. And the medical advice was that he should be moved to intensive care”, he added.Officials said Raab has full authority of a prime minister but will not be able to appoint or drop ministers in the Johnson government. Raab chaired meetings related to the response to coronavirus on Tuesday.Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, also contracted the virus but is recovering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-boris-johnson-is-stable-in-icu-says-official/story-wnmanm7z9UHQb90WrutHqL.html
07-04-2020||World||China reports zero deaths as once worst-hit Wuhan to lift 76-day lockdown||The first epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic, Wuhan where the novel coronavirus emerged in late December is set to allow residents to travel outside the city on Wednesday for the first time since January 23, ending a 76-day unprecedented lockdown implemented to contain the outbreak.The cautious lifting of the mass quarantine in Wuhan on Wednesday means the sealed city will reconnect its severed transport links with the rest of China: trains will leave the station; flights will take off from the airport and private cars will be able to drive out of city borders.The first steps toward the gradual lifting of Wuhan’s lockdown comes in the backdrop of China on Tuesday reporting zero deaths from the disease for the first time since the national health commission (NHC) started to publish disease data in January.Watch | China to lift traffic ban from coronavirus epicentre Wuhan after 11 weeks A city of around 11 million people, Wuhan was the eye of the virus storm; it has until now accounted for more than 2,500 of the 3,331 Covid-19-related deaths and over 50,000 of the nearly 82,000 infections China has reported.The coronavirus first emerged in the city in December, by most accounts from a seafood and meat market, stealthily and rapidly spreading between humans after it jumped from a host animal to patient zero – not an unusual zoonotic event but which in this case has gone on to assume pandemic proportions, killing more than 70,000 and sickening over 1.3 million globally.The residents of Wuhan didn’t know what had hit them.Instead, the government hit them with the largest urban lockdown in history, which in the weeks since January 23 became tighter and tighter, and spread to the rest of the province of Hubei, virtually locking up 60 million people. Officials and experts, however, have clearly said the outbreak control procedures will remain in place.Wang Zhonglin, Wuhan’s chief of the Communist Party of China (CPC), told a meeting on Sunday that authorities will “…continue carrying out strict community-based monitoring and management, making sure that a rebound in new infections won’t occur following the traffic resumption.”Entry and exit restrictions at and monitoring of residential communities will continue, officials said.Local media reports said restaurants, hotels, shops, buses and subway stations in Wuhan will continue to ask citizens to scan their health codes and register so that their health status and travel history could be monitored.Like in the rest of China, focus in Hubei and Wuhan will also be on asymptomatic and imported cases.The local health commission said Hubei had 690 asymptomatic patients under medical observation.The Chinese mainland reported 32 new imported cases of Covid-19 on MondayBringing the total number of imported cases to 983, the NHC said Tuesday.Of the total imported cases, 285 had been discharged from hospitals after recovery and 698 were being treated in hospitals with 21 in severe condition, the commission said in its daily report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-zero-deaths-as-once-worst-hit-wuhan-to-lift-76-day-lockdown/story-obOasY0jWpwM9RyyUMvUcP.html
07-04-2020||World||What you need to know about the coronavirus right now||Here’s what you need to know about the coronavirus right now:British leader in intensive carePrime Minister Boris Johnson was being treated for worsening coronavirus symptoms in an intensive care unit on Tuesday. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is deputising for him as the country is in a state of virtual lockdown, a situation due to be reviewed early next week.Johnson, 55, was admitted to St Thomas’ Hospital late on Sunday after 10 days of persistent symptoms, including a high temperature. His condition deteriorated rapidly over the next 24 hours, and he has received oxygen.Johnson’s pregnant 32-year-old fiancee, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday that she was feeling better.China marks a milestone - no new deathsFor the first time since the coronavirus outbreak began, China reported no new deaths on Tuesday. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 81,740 as of Monday, while 3,331 people have died, according to its National Health Commission.With mainland China well past the peak of infections in February, authorities have turned their attention to imported cases and asymptomatic patients, who show no symptoms but can still pass on the virus.Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, is due to allow people to leave the city on Wednesday for the first time since it was locked down on Jan. 23 to curb the spread of the virus.Focus on anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquineIn a matter of weeks, the decades-old anti-malaria drug that President Donald Trump has persistently promoted as a potential weapon against COVID-19 has become a standard of care in areas of the United States hit hard by the pandemic — though doctors prescribing it have no idea whether it works.Scientists have detailed biochemical properties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections, as it blocks steps in the replication of certain viruses, and can suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.India will allow some exports of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump urged New Delhi to release supplies of the drug seen as a possible treatment for COVID-19.India could face retaliation for its decision to ban exports of the drug, Trump said late on Monday in Washington.Tentative signs of plateauingThe governors of New York, New Jersey and Louisiana pointed to tentative signs on Monday that the coronavirus outbreak may be starting to plateau in their states, but warned against complacency as the death toll approached 11,000 nationwide.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said statewide deaths from COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus, were up 599 from Sunday, on par with an increase of 594 during the previous 24 hours and 630 on Friday.In neighbouring New Jersey, the state with the second-highest number of cases and deaths, Governor Phil Murphy cited a 12% daily growth rate in confirmed positive cases on Monday, half the rate from March 30.Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards similarly expressed cautious optimism. “New hospital admissions are trending downward,” he told a news conference.World’s tallest statue for sale? Not likelyPolice in India lodged a case this week against an unknown online fraudster who tried selling the world’s largest statue, the Statue for Unity in Gujarat, for $4 billion, claiming the proceeds would be used to help the government of the western state fund its coronavirus fight.Police say cybercrimes have surged 86% in the four weeks since the virus scare gripped India, with scams ranging from free mobile recharges to offers of free Netflix subscriptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-right-now/story-0v0zsW3t0HhGeyHWnLhAHJ.html
07-04-2020||World||World Health Day 2020: 20 habits to give up that are ruining your health||Every year, World Health Day is celebrated to spread awareness on maintaining a healthy lifestyle and various aspects related to ensuring efficient healthcare across the globe. From supporting healthcare professionals to leading campaigns against substance abuse and sounding the bugle to fight some of the leading non-communicable diseases, the World Health Organization settles on a theme every year on World Health Day.The WHO has named this year the ‘International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife’. This year’s World Health Day theme couldn’t be more apt as it is dedicated to honouring the indefatigable nurses and midwives across the globe.As the world unites to honour the many nurses and healthcare workers across the globe, the least we can do is to take a pledge towards maintaining our health. This World Health Day, let us resolve to get rid of some habits that stand in the way of building good health.Let 2020 be the year where we bid adieu to 20 health-damaging habits.1. Sleep deprivationThere’s nothing as bad as depriving your body of sleep. Experts suggest an average adult requires between 8 to 6 hours of sleep every day. Following a routine is of the utmost importance for good health. 2. Binge eatingThis is a shortcut to gaining weight, especially around the waistline. Reach out to healthy snacking like eating nuts instead to binge eating.3. Excessive screen timeLimit screen time, need we say more?4. SmokingSmoking and tobacco consumption kills thousands across the globe every year. It is also one of the leading causes of lung, throat and mouth cancer.5. Excessive alcohol consumptionToo much alcohol consumption at regular intervals can have a debilitating effect on your health. From altering your gut microbiome to affecting stamina, the cons of excessive alcohol consumption are many.6. Prolonged sittingApple CEO Tim Cook had described sitting as the “new cancer” some years ago. Take regular breaks, stretch or go for a quick 5-minute walk while at work - keep moving.7. Processed sugar consumptionSugar is the enemy, experts have often warned. Make a switch to jaggery or honey over refined or processed sugar.8. Excessive refined flour consumptionGive your health a boost by giving indigenous flour a try. Supermarkets these days are full of a variety of flours made from ragi, whole wheat, buckwheat among others that will not only give your regular dishes a delectable spin but also give your health a boost.9. Eating too quicklyChewing your food properly and for long gives the brain and the gut the required time to come into action and digest the food efficiently. 10. Consuming large mealsThe mantra is to exercise portion control. Consuming large meals makes digestion sluggish and makes one feel lethargic. 11. Fast food consumptionFull of empty calories, excessive sodium, sugar and fat - fast foods are something you must say goodbye to on your road to achieving good health. Eat local and fresh as much as possible. Read your labels and steer clear of processed and packaged foods as much as possible. 12. Too much saltExcessive salt consumption has been linked to elevated blood pressure levels and cardiovascular diseases. The World Health Organizations suggests less than 5 grams per day for adults.13. Excessive meat eatingRed meat consumption has often been linked to many lifestyle diseases including cardiovascular ailments. Those who relish their meaty delicacies too often in a week can try giving it a break.14. Not drinking enough waterOur body needs 2-3 litres of water every day. We lose a lot of fluid not just through urine and sweat but while the body performs various essential functions. Dehydration or lack of enough fluids can have severe repercussions on health. 15. Skipping mealsSkipping meals, especially breakfast, regularly can have grave side effects including weight gain, nutrient deficiency, weakness, loss of muscle, et cetera.16. Lack of exercise The World Health Organization recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity in a week for an average adult to maintain optimum health. 17. Eating right before bedtimeOne should eat at least a couple of hours before bedtime to allow smooth digestion and promote good sleep. 18. Not brushing teeth before sleepingBrushing teeth twice a day is essential for maintaining optimum oral hygiene and dental health. 19. Excessive caffeine intakeExcessive caffeine intake has been linked to dehydration and can give rise to sleeping difficulties and anxiety as it revs the nervous system. Consuming caffeine in moderation, less than 1,000 mg a day, can help boost stamina and alertness. 20. Not eating enough fibreFibre is good for the gut. It aids digestion and helps in proper absorption of nutrients by the body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-health-day-2020-20-habits-to-give-up-that-are-ruining-your-health/story-2p5EdFcWyXa5ayVrPoh3HO.html

On Monday morning, AFP saw nine bodies loaded into trucks outside Wyckoff Hospital in Brooklyn.Several undertakers interviewed by AFP said they were struggling to deal with New York state’s coronavirus death toll of more than 500 a day. Between Friday and Saturday, a high of 630 deaths were recorded.“The majority of funeral homes do not have refrigeration or (have) limited refrigeration,” said Ken Brewster, owner of Crowe’s Funeral Homes in Queens.“If you don’t have the space... you need those trucks,” added Brewster, whose small business has been bombarded with requests for funeral services for COVID-19 patients over the past week.Like 9/11’Pat Marmo manages five funeral homes across the city.He is finding it difficult to cope with the stress generated by influx of bodies, particularly because he himself just lost a cousin and close friend to the pandemic.“The hospitals are pushing (us). They want the people picked up (as quickly as possible) and the funeral homes don’t have the facilities to handle these bodies,” he told AFP.Marmo estimates that his homes are currently dealing with three times more bodies that normal and that burials will last well into next month.“It’s almost like 9/11, going on for days and days and days,” he said, referring to the worst terror strikes on US soil back on September 11, 2001.Undertakers are so overcrowded that a city official raised the possibility Monday of carrying out temporary burials in a public park.“Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. It will be done in a dignified, orderly and temporary manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take,” tweeted Mark Levine, a Manhattan council representative.The comments caused quite a stir in America’s most populous city, which has already been transformed by the pandemic, including in Central Park where a field hospital is tending to virus patients.Apex of deaths? The mayor’s spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, stressed that the city government was not considering using local parks as cemeteries.But she added that Hart Island, where around one million New Yorkers are buried in mass graves, may be used “for temporary burials, if the need grows.”Mayor Bill de Blasio himself spoke of the possibility of temporary burials “to tide us over until the end of the crisis.“We are not at that point,” he told reporters, before refusing to give any more details.Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Monday that the number of deaths across New York state had flattened out since Saturday’s high, below 600 a day.He suggested the state may be at the peak of its pandemic, but extended stay-at-home measures until April 29, saying now was not the time to end social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-morgues-overflow-new-york-struggles-with-covid-19-dead/story-OKtK5pVzfAckJniWCjiX1J.html

Indian pharma industry supplies HIV drugs to 8 million patients in south Africa, paracetamol to the UK, 80 % of all drugs to the neighbourhood including Maldives and Mauritius, and will supply hydroxychloroquine to big countries affected by the coronavirus like the US, Spain, Germany and Brazil. For the past three days since the DGFT put a ban on export of hydroxychloroquine on April 4, the empowered committee has been meeting to reconcile the demands of the health ministry and the pharmaceutical industry. We informed all the countries including the US about the change in policy. It is a matter of record,” said a senior South Block official.According to sources, the change in the export policy of critical drugs was communicated to the countries concerned through the External Affairs Ministry early on Monday. The DGFT was told to issue a notification to this effect.The formal announcement by the foreign ministry was made on Tuesday. Also Read: Coronavirus case count to guide India’s lockdown futureAnurag Srivastava, the external affairs ministry spokesperson attributed the decision to “the humanitarian aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic” battle. “We will also be supplying these essential drugs to some nations who have been particularly badly affected by the pandemic,” he said.Behind PM Modi’s decision to lift the export ban is the message that India will not walk out of any commitment on critical drugs particularly at a time when the world is fighting the coronavirus, people familiar with the development said.India has a $ 50 billion pharma industry that employees a vast force and caters to critical drugs for large parts of the world. Some countries such as Maldives, Seychelles and Mauritius are completely dependent on the Indian industry for its supplies.Also Read: There’s light at the end of the tunnel | OpinionSince the US companies had placed hydroxychloroquine orders on 100% export-oriented units in India, the much-needed drug will be supplied almost immediately with the pharma companies sitting on a drug pile.President Trump had called up PM Modi on Sunday, the day after the DGFT banned hydroxychloroquine export on April 5. The government decided to relax the restriction after satisfying itself that India had enough stocks of essential drugs to meet any possible requirement of the health ministry.The DGFT notification on licensing hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol is in the works and will be issued any time soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-modi-s-hydroxychloroquine-export-order-a-covid-19-message-to-the-world/story-ySR32J4ccmcnhrCzARv3jI.html

Their bodies were lying on the ground,” Ayesha Chundrigar, who runs ACF Animal Rescue, told neas agency AFP.“It was so horrific, I can’t tell you.”As the virus pandemic grew, Pakistan’s major cities were plunged into lockdown, forcing many shops to close. Only stalls selling essential goods such as food and medicine were allowed to continue operating.The bodies of about 20 dogs were found dumped in a sewer near Lahore’s Tollinton Market, a hub for pet businesses which had closed leaving animals to starve.The total number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan has sharply increased to 3,864 with more than 500 fresh infections while the death toll reached 54, the health officials said on Monday.The Ministry of National Health Services, in an early morning update on its website, reported that four patients died of coronavirus in the last 24 hours.According to the officials, Punjab has 1,918 cases, Sindh 932, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 500, Gilgit-Baltistan 211, Balochistan 202, Islamabad 83 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 18.The increase in the number of new cases was reported despite hectic efforts to curtail the spread of the virus.The government has extended the partial lockdown until April 14 and asked people to stay at homes and follow social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/horrific-says-activist-as-hundreds-of-lockdown-hit-animals-die-in-pakistan/story-QHXGwT49MWSbe9gpsRVYuO.html
07-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: In Canada, normal life can stay disrupted for ‘several months’, says Justin Trudeau||The current disruption in normal life in Canada could last up to “several months”, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday.The number of persons infected with the Covid-19 virus in the country crossed 16,500 and by Monday evening and the death toll touched 323. Though a nationwide lockdown has not been enforced, restrictions continue to remain in place across the country.“To stay at home, to continue this period of isolation and distance is the best way to get out as quickly as possible, but certainly it will be a case of several weeks, perhaps several months,” Trudeau said in a press conference. Trudeau spoke even as thousands of Canadians became part of the first batch availing a federal bailout package, which provides CA$ 500 per week, to those who have been economically battered by the crisis. Canadians have grave concerns about the period of economic hardship looming. According to a public opinion survey conducted by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute or ARI, 87% of those polled said that “on the economic front, the worst is yet to come.”Trudeau has been in self-isolation since his wife Sophie Gregoire tested positive for the virus in mid-March. However, he has opted to work from home in isolation even after she was given the all clear by doctors. Trudeau indicated that he may return to “office” in the days ahead, though he will largely work from home, in this case Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, since that’s what he and the government has asked “of everyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-in-canada-normal-life-can-stay-disrupted-for-several-months-says-justin-trudeau/story-uiKJ5iLWpO8nwQe2cvImWI.html

He was undergoing a series of tests, his condition deteriorated. And the medical advice was that he should be moved to intensive care at around seven o’clock last night”, he added.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab is deputising for Johnson.

07-04-2020||World||Nearly half a million companies in China shut shop as Covid-19 batters economy: Report||Nearly half a million firms in China have shut shop due to the coronavirus pandemic which devastated the country in the past few months, the local media there reported.Media outlets in China quoted data from Tianyancha, a commercial database that compiles public records, to say that 4,60,000 firms closed permanently in the first quarter ending March.The data also showed that the pace of new firms being established has also slowed significantly, media reports said.Mainland China reported a drop in the new coronavirus cases after closing its borders to virtually all foreigners to curb imported infections, while the central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, saw no new deaths for the first time.Overall, China is stepping up its domestic counter-cyclical measures to combat the epidemic’s hit. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on March 30 lowered the seven-day reverse repo rate to 2.20 per cent from 2.40 per cent, the largest cut in nearly five years. The PBOC cut its one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points to 4.05 per cent on February 20, after various liquidity injections and other policy easing earlier in the year.The PBOC cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the second time this year on March 13, releasing 550 billion yuan.The government is set to unleash trillions of yuan of fiscal stimulus. It aims to spur infrastructure investment, backed by as much as 2.8 trillion yuan of local government special bonds, according to news agency Reuters. The national budget deficit ratio could rise to record levels, Reuters reported quoting sources.The ruling Communist Party’s Politburo had said on March 27 that it would step up macroeconomic policy changes and pursue more proactive fiscal policy. It called for expanding the budget deficit, issuing more local and national bonds, guiding interest rates lower, delaying loan repayments, reducing supply-chain bottlenecks and boosting consumption.Beijing had earlier introduced various small measures and fiscal expenditure such as tax breaks, reduced power charges and fee reductions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-half-a-million-companies-in-china-shut-shop-as-covid-19-batters-economy-report/story-I5UVjndw8U7836wSyUogcO.html

07-04-2020||World||Japan to declare state of emergency over coronavirus||Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will on Tuesday declare a state of emergency in parts of the country, including Tokyo, over a spike in coronavirus infections.“I have decided that a situation gravely affecting people’s life and the economy has occurred. This evening, I plan to call a government headquarters meeting and declare a state of emergency,” Abe said Tuesday.He announced the plan a day earlier, citing “rapid increases of new infections, particularly in urban areas like Tokyo and Osaka”.The declaration is expected to take effect from midnight and will empower governors of seven affected regions to ask people to stay inside and businesses to close their doors.But it stops far short of the sort of lockdown seen in parts of Europe and the United States, with no enforcement mechanism to keep people inside or shutter business, nor penalties for those who fail to comply.Experts and local leaders have pushed for the declaration, and 80 percent of people polled by public broadcaster TBS over the weekend said they backed the move.Seven regions will be affected: Tokyo, neighbouring Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama, the western hub of Osaka and neighbouring Hyogo, and the southwestern region of Fukuoka.The measure is expected to be in place for around a month initially.It comes with pressure growing on the government to take fresh action as medical experts sound the alarm on a spike in infections, with Tokyo reporting a record 143 new cases on Sunday, still far below those seen in many parts of the world.Doctors in the capital warned this week that the city was already in “critical condition”, with hospitals stretched thin.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, who has pushed for the emergency declaration, urged residents on Tuesday to cooperate with requests to limit movement.“It may cause inconvenience in daily life, but I call for everyone’s cooperation because lives are at stake,” she told reporters.In addition to asking people to stay inside and urging the closure of businesses that attract crowds, the measure allows governors to commandeer property for medical purposes.Koike is expected to explain how the measure will apply in Tokyo at a news conference later Tuesday.Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said public transport would not be scaled back but “we will take appropriate measures to reduce person-to-person contacts drastically”.“We will mobilise all possible policies to prevent infections from spreading further,” he added.“I’d like residents in designated regions to act calmly.”The economic impacts of the measure have raised concern, and Abe on Monday unveiled plans for a stimulus package worth around $1 trillion, or 20 percent of gross domestic product.Japan has so far been spared the sort of virus outbreak seen in parts of Europe and the United States, with close to 4,000 confirmed infections and 80 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-declare-state-of-emergency-over-coronavirus/story-OU3tKjbU0elIggjTXacjtM.html

I wish him a speedy and full recovery,” she tweeted.The EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted that “my thoughts are with you and your family.” Barnier is recovering in quarantine in his native France after announcing March 19 that he, too, had tested positive for the coronavirus.“Wishing Boris Johnson all the best and a speedy recovery.

07-04-2020||World||Dominic Raab: A combative lawyer who is now Boris Johnson’s stand-in as UK Premier||With British Prime Minister Boris Johnson fighting for health in the intensive case of a hospital in London, the UK is facing a leadership crisis.The 55-year-old prime minister was taken to the hospital on Sunday night for routine tests after struggling to shake off Covid-19, but his condition worsened during Monday afternoon.Britain has no formal succession plan should the prime minister become incapacitated, but Johnson, 55, has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise for him.Raab is a former Foreign Office lawyer who has been both an ally and a rival to his boss.During the Brexit campaign in 2016, Raab campaigned alongside Johnson successfully to break away from the European Union. Three years later, the pair stood against each other in the Conservative Party’s leadership contest.Raab, who was the Brexit minister under former premier Theresa May, quit after just three months in November 2018 in protest at May’s doomed divorce deal with Brussels that he said offered too many concessions.But when Johnson became Conservative party leader and prime minister after May’s resignation in July last year, Raab was catapulted back into government.His role as foreign secretary also carries the title first secretary of state, implying seniority over all other ministers except the prime minister and making him his de facto deputy.Often combative, he holds a black belt in karate and is a keen boxer.His Czech-born Jewish father came to Britain in 1938 as a six-year-old refugee. He died of cancer when Raab was 12 and his mother brought him up in the Church of England.He competed in karate for 17 years, making the UK squad.After studies, he became an international lawyer at London legal firm Linklaters before joining the Foreign Office in 2000 as an advisor.Raab was posted to The Hague in 2003 to head a team focused on bringing justice to war criminals including Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and Charles Taylor.From 2006 to 2008, he was chief of staff to the Conservatives’ home affairs spokesman David Davis while in opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dominic-raab-a-combative-lawyer-who-is-now-boris-johnson-s-stand-in-as-uk-premier/story-YejeuCSYOwLaIuMCPrqPsJ.html

07-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Rush for masks, toilet paper slows Japan’s household spending decline||Japan’s consumer spending fell in February but at a slower-than-expected pace as households scrambled for protective masks, toilet paper and staple food amid the worsening coronavirus pandemic.But spending on travel and entertainment slumped, government data showed on Tuesday, a sign households were cutting back on non-essential purchases even before travel bans and social distancing policies took effect in March.Analysts expect the hit to consumption from the pandemic to deepen significantly in coming months, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declares a state of emergency on Tuesday that is likely to paralyse activity in major cities, including Tokyo, for a month.“This pandemic is an unprecedented type of economic crisis that deals an immediate blow to consumption and jobs,” said Yasuhide Yajima, chief economist at NLI Research Institute.“We’ll likely see a freefall in consumption in March and beyond of a scale never experienced before. In a crisis like this, Japan has little choice but to embark on helicopter money like other major economies,” he said.Household spending slid 0.3% in February from a year earlier, marking the fifth straight month of declines but a smaller drop than a median market forecast for a 3.9% decline and the 3.9% fall marked in January.Spending on toilet paper jumped 47% in February from a year earlier, while that on domestic package tours slumped 37%.Supply chain disruptions, travel bans and social distancing policies triggered by the pandemic have hit Japan’s economy, which is already on the brink of recession, piling pressure on policymakers to take stronger steps to ease the pain.Abe said on Tuesday the government’s stimulus package to combat the pandemic would be among the world’s biggest and would include direct fiscal spending of $358 billion.It was the first time the premier unveiled the size of direct spending of his package, which he said would total 108 trillion yen - equal to 20% of economic output.The 39-trillion-yen ($358 billion) in spending would be more than double what Japan spent to deal with the hit to growth from the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.While the stimulus could ease the immediate damage from the pandemic, lawmakers are already calling for even bigger spending to prevent bankruptcies and job losses.With the government set to boost bond issuance to pay for the package, the Bank of Japan could ramp up bond buying to keep borrowing costs low, said Yajima of NLI Research Institute.Analysts expect Japan’s economy, which shrank in the final quarter of last year, to post two more quarters of contraction as the pain from the pandemic deepens.Separate data showed inflated-adjusted real wages rose for a second straight month in February, providing some relief for an economy under threat of a deep downturn over the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-rush-for-masks-toilet-paper-slows-japan-s-household-spending-decline/story-QbHXxUKoUBzQjTV8U8hmUK.html

Prime Minister Modi had told the American leader during the call that India “will do all what we can”.The US orders were placed in March. The size of the order could not be ascertained and it was also not clear if they were placed by the US government through the agency spearheading the federal effort boost domestic availability of medical supplies and equipment needed to deal with the outbreak, or private companies.India is one of the largest manufacturer of hydroxychloroquine in the world and banned its export, along with a bunch of other deeming them essential for its own domestic to fight the pandemic. The restriction on hydroxychloroquine was upgraded to a blanket ban, without exemptions on humanitarian and other grounds, on Saturday, the day before Trump called Modi.At the Monday news briefing, President Trump either misheard the reporter’s question, or misunderstood it. He had been asked if was worried about retaliation from other countries against his decision to ban the export of certain medical equipment, which he has in recent days to address shortages at home in the United States, like the one imposed by Prime Minister Modi on hydroxychloroquine.“I don’t like that decision,” the president said. “I didn’t hear that that was his decision. I know that he stopped it for other countries I spoke to him yesterday. We had a very good talk, and we’ll see whether or not that’s his decision. I would be surprised if he would you know because India does very well with the United States.”While correctly acknowledging India had not turned down his request, not yet at least, the president went ahead with his threat of “retaliation”, which he dressed up with his long-running grievance on trade. “For many years they’ve been taking advantage of the United States on trade. So I would be surprised if that was the decision. He’d have to tell me that.”After the failed attempt to seal a trade deal during the February visit the two sides decided to continue talking and aim for a deal some time r later in the year, perhaps after the November 3 general elections in the United States. A joint statement issued by the two sides during the visit said, the two leaders “agreed to promptly conclude the ongoing negotiations, which they hope can become phase one of a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement that reflects the true ambition and full potential of the bilateral commercial relations, advancing prosperity, investment, and job creation in both countries”.The joint statement and a news briefing to wrap up the visit were the last times the American president spoke publicly about trade issues with India, until the Monday briefing.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThere is no proven evidence yet that hydroxychloroquine works against the coronavirus. There have been some studies and trials, but scientists and experts have said they were either too small or without the necessary protocols to establish its effectiveness. Physicians have been using it nevertheless, even in the United States.President Trump has spoken of hydroxychloroquine as a potential “game-changer” many times, with experts of his coronavirus task force adding the usual cautionary note every time that the drug has no proven benefits for Covid-19 patients. The US drug regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, granted “compassionate use” authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine), to be prescribed to severely ill patients in mid-March. Last week, the regulator gave it emergency-use authorization. And it is being tried on COVID-10 patients in New York City, the epicentre of the American outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-threatens-retaliation-if-india-turned-down-his-request-on-malarial-drug-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-vaccine-covid-19/story-c1aIImaEGKw893uO01bVQJ.html

National Health Service guidelines advise those who are self-isolating not go to hospital unless they develop new symptoms or become sufficiently unwell.Johnson, who is not a smoker, said recently that he wanted to lose weight. He plays tennis and while mayor of London used to cycle around the capital.The face of the 2016 Brexit campaign, he won a resounding election victory in December before leading the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Jan. 31.He has faced criticism for initially approving a much more modest response to the new coronavirus outbreak than other European leaders, saying on March 3 that he had been shaking hands with coronavirus patients.He changed tack when scientific projections showed a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom. On Monday, health officials said Britain’s death toll stood at 5,373.Johnson effectively shuttered the world’s fifth-largest economy, advising people to stay at home and the elderly or infirm to isolate themselves for weeks.The virus had already penetrated the British government.Johnson and his health minister tested positive last month and chief medical adviser Chris Whitty also self-isolated. Johnson’s pregnant 32-year-old fiancée, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-taken-to-icu-after-covid-19-worsens/story-opFKOV1WCYhD55pvFCNI7J.html

07-04-2020||World||Covid-19: As US braces for ‘hardest and saddest’ week, Trump sees ‘light at the end of tunnel||Americans braced themselves for the “hardest and saddest” week as coronavirus fatalities are expected to peak in some parts of the country while President Donald Trump maintained he had seen “light at the end of the tunnel”, holding out hope of a turnaround “in not too distant future”.US fatalities from the coronavirus neared 10,000 with 9,653 by Sunday morning with more than 4,150 in New York state and 3,048 in New York City alone, the epicenter of the US outbreak. The state registered a drop in one-day deaths Sunday though and that gave rise to guarded optimism of a “plateauing in the data”.The number of confirmed cases in the United States stood at more than 330,000, accounting for a fourth of the global pandemic count of 1.2 million. New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana continued to be the hardest hit states and New York City, Detroit, New Orleans, Miami among the most impacted cities, with the national capital Washington DC being cited as a growing concern.“This is going to be the hardest and saddest week of most Americans’ lives, quite frankly,” US surgeon general Jerome M Adams told Fox News on Sunday and went on to draw parallels with key pivotal moments in US history and lives. “This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localized. It’s going to be happening all over the country.”Fatalities are expected to peak this week in some parts of the country, public health officials have said, from infections contracted around two weeks ago, before the country began shutting down with enhanced social-distancing measures and stay-at-home orders now in force in all but eight states.US officials had earlier warned the past week and this would be the hardest hit and President Trump sought to prepare Americans for this as the “toughest week” with a grim warning of a “lot of death”. Experts of the White House coronavirus task force have said 100,000 to 240,000 American could die in the epidemic even with the social-distancing measures in place.The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, an independent body often cited by the White House coronavirus task force, has said the projected peak day is still 10 days away, April 16, when 3,130 deaths have been projected nationwide. And New York state is projected to peak on Wednesday (April 8) with projected fatalities to 878 on that day.But the president sought to strike a note of optimism, as he has throughout this unprecedented health crisis, telling reporters at the daily briefing of the task force on Sunday, “We see light at the end of the tunnel. Things are happening. We’re starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. And hopefully in the not too distant future we’ll be very proud of the job we all did.” He doubled down it with the morning after, with a twitter post in all-caps: “LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL”.Asked if the president’s optimism was contradictory to the spike in death being predicted by experts, Anthony Fauci, the epidemiologist who has emerged as the most trusted member of the president’s task force, said, “I don’t think they’re so different. I think we all know that we have to reach a certain point. And that point is going to be a horrific point in terms of death. But it’s also a point at which things are going to start changing.”He said there was a lag time of two weeks in cases and fatalities and the impact of mitigation effort in place now will be seen in two weeks. But, he cautioned, “What you’re hearing about potential light at the end of the tunnel doesn’t take away form the fact that tomorrow or the next day is going to look really bad.”Deborah Birx, the task force coordinator, concurred, but said that “although we’ll see rising number of cases of people who lose their lives to this illness, we’re also hopeful to see a stabilization of cases across these large metro areas where the outbreak began several weeks ago”. The United States has begin to show the effects of social-distancing as was happening in Italy, which had begun to turn after weeks of spiraling cases and death, she added.US Navy commander Brett Crozier whose plea for help for his coronavirus-affected crew led to his dismissal has himself tested positive, in the meanwhile.And a tiger at a New York city zoo has tested positive for coronavirus in a first, the US department of agriculture said in a statement. The animal caught the infection from an employee and this is being called the first human-to-cat transmission of the deadly pathogen. The department went on to caution with people with coronavirus to avoid contact with pets and other animals..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-as-us-braces-for-hardest-and-saddest-week-trump-sees-light-at-the-end-of-tunnel/story-CUkuaKeVycpvZxOw4yRufK.html
07-04-2020||World||Canada asks medical workers treating Covid-19 patients to reuse face masks||Even as medical-grade equipment like face masks are in great demand across the world to protect frontline medical professionals who are dealing with Covid-19 patients, Canada’s seniormost health official has said the country has started exploring the possibility of decontaminating such material for their reuse.Personal protective equipment or PPE like face masks keep medical workers safe as they treat and care for patients suffering from Covid-19 disease. However, with demand high, the supply of such masks has become a matter of contention.Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam has asked hospitals and medical facilities throughout the country not to dispose of used masks since public health officials are looking into whether they can be disinfected for reused.“I think it is one of the most important and I think worthwhile lines of pursuit for PPE right now,” she said, as several entities in the country were working on a process for decontamination that would make the material reusable and safe for healthcare workers.Given this ongoing research, she also asked authorities across Canada to retain such PPE. She said she was “signalling to provinces and territories that certain things shouldn’t be thrown away right now, so that we can actually implement this should we find the actual people who can do this.”Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has already announced that several million masks will be reaching the country early this week from China, even as an amicable resolution to the matter of the United States barring export of such N-95 masks to Canada appears likely. “I am confident we are going to be able to solve this,” Trudeau said.The coronavirus outbreak looks set to tip Canada’s economy into recession and the Liberal government of Prime Minister Trudeau has already announced stimulus measures totaling C$105 billion ($74 billion) in direct spending, or five per cent of gross domestic product.Almost half the cases in Canada are in the province of Quebec, where premier Francois Legault said on Sunday he hoped to see new diagnoses peak in a number of weeks. He also told reporters he was extending a shutdown of non-essential businesses for another three weeks to May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-asks-medical-workers-treating-covid-19-patients-to-reuse-face-masks/story-cY9D587dixdewIBvjzdWvJ.html
07-04-2020||World||Canada govt mulls holding virtual parliament session during Covid-19 crisis||The Canadian government is exploring the possibility of holding virtual sessions of Parliament to pass legislation, as part of emergency measures to counter the impact of Covid-19 crisis.The idea has been mooted by Pablo Rodriguez, a leader of the ruling Liberal Party in the House of Commons, in a letter to the Speaker Anthony Rota, as well as leaders of three major Opposition parties.The proposal comes as the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attempts historic bailout measures for employers and workers across the country. As the coronavirus crisis became pronounced in March, the House of Commons was suspended, but sittings with the minimum number of members required were held on March 23 and 24. While the House remains suspended till April 20, Trudeau has called for another emergency session in the week ahead to pass more measures.Rodriguez’s effort comes in that context, as he wrote to the Speaker seeking to gauge “ability of the House of Commons administration to support and facilitate virtual sittings”. He pointed out that Canadians are working from home and only leaving for essential chores. He stated, “It is only appropriate that Members of Parliament practice these same measures, and adapt the way that we conduct our business during the time the House cannot meet on a regular and normal basis.”While the response from Opposition leaders to this proposal has been positive, it will require changes to the Standing Orders governing the running of the House of Commons, for business to be conducted remotely.The number of people killed by the Sars-CoV-2 virus in Canada has jumped by just over 20 per cent to 258 in a day, officials said on Sunday.On Sunday morning, the number of those diagnosed with Covid-19 had risen by almost 12 per cent to 14,426, the public health agency said. The respective figures on Saturday were 214 deaths and 12,924 positive diagnoses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-govt-mulls-holding-virtual-parliament-session-during-covid-19-crisis/story-6BEO44muwt04X8we0yvgxK.html
