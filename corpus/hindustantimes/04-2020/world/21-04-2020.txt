And that estimate, they said, is 28 to 55 times higher than the 7,994 confirmed cases of Covid-19 reported to the county at the time the study was conducted.“We haven’t known the true extent of Covid-19 infections in our community because we have only tested people with symptoms, and the availability of tests has been limited,” lead investigator Neeraj Sood, said in a statement. He is a professor of public policy. “The estimates also suggest that we might have to recalibrate disease prediction models and rethink public health strategies,” he added, with obvious implications for the rest of the country.New York began antibody testing Monday and these tests form a crucial part of all plans of reopening the country to make sure the virus was not left undetected among asymptomatic populations. But these are only beginning to be tolled out now as the country continues to grapple with a shortage the usual kits. States have asked the federal government for help.As lockdown protests continued across the country three Three Republican-ruled states in the south have announced plans to begin easing the restrictions. South Carolina allowed the the reopening of department stores and flea markets on Monday, Georgia will allow gyms, spas and saloon to start from Friday and Tennessee will not extend the lockdown after April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-la-testing-warns-of-more-infections-than-known-toll-over-42-000/story-KgghlYATgV9meW1ybHMdNM.html

All precautions are in place to make sure his work environment is safe and healthy,” Ghani’s spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said on Twitter.Ghani and his wife were both tested and “both results are negative,” he added.About 20 workers in Kabul’s presidential palace and a dozen more in an adjoining office had contracted the virus, officials told AFP on Saturday.Recent official photos had shown 70-year-old Ghani wearing a mask and gloves, and mainly holding online meetings with officials.But on Tuesday a healthy-looking Ghani appeared on TV and urged Afghans to take the virus seriously.“Coronavirus took all by surprise,” he said. “But we, from the first days, took this virus seriously and by the grace of God the number of fatalities in our country is lower than in other countries,” he said.Neighbouring Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan will also be tested for COVID-19, his doctor announced.The test comes after Faisal Edhi, the owner and operator of Pakistan’s largest private charity, said he had tested positive for the highly contagious disease. He met with Khan last week in Islamabad.Pakistan and Afghanistan, where handshakes and close family gatherings are the norm, have both struggled to persuade citizens to practice social distancing.So far, Pakistan has confirmed at least 192 deaths from coronavirus and Afghanistan 36, but many believe the low numbers are because of limited access to testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-negative-for-coronavirus-after-palace-outbreak/story-SwGBJMdamvsK4mAYrlghOI.html

Two South Korean sources rejected CNN’s report, while a Chinese source said they did not believe Kim was critically ill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-aware-of-reports-about-n-korea-leader-s-health/story-eygtS17ZvUi2UFDVHC9htL.html
21-04-2020||World||If Not Kim Jong Un, who? Possible heirs to North Korea’s throne||The mystery surrounding Kim Jong Un’s health exposes deep uncertainty about North Korea’s line of succession more than eight years after he took power.While the Kim family has ruled for seven decades by passing power between male heirs like other hereditary dynasties, the 36-year-old Kim has named no successor. His own children are still young and the ruling family’s surviving adults all face potential barriers to their rise.Here are some possible successors:Kim Yo Jong, SisterPart royal representative, part personal assistant, Kim Yo Jong has emerged as one of her older brother’s closest aides. Earlier this month, she was reinstated as an alternate Politburo member of the ruling Workers Party of Korea. As such, she’s the only other member of the Kim family with anything approaching real power in the regime.Although she became the first member of the ruling family to visit Seoul and accompanied Kim Jong Un in his summits with U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping, she’s also performed mundane tasks, such as helping the leader extinguish a cigarette during a train stop in China. Whether North Korea’s patriarchal elite will support a relatively young woman as the country’s next “supreme leader” is unclear.Kim Jong Un’s SonA male heir would provide the most conventional line of succession in a dynasty previously ruled by Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, and founded by his grandfather, Kim Il Sung. South Korean intelligence said Kim married Ri Sol Ju, a former singer, in 2009 and is thought to have three children.Problem is, the children have yet to be officially mentioned in state media and the oldest is believed to be a son born in 2010, according to South Korea’s DongA Ilbo newspaper. Dennis Rodman, the offbeat former basketball star who visited North Korea, said in 2013 that he also held a baby daughter named Ju Ae. That would likely require any of the children to rule under some form of regent until they come of age.Kim Han Sol, NephewKim Han Sol, born in 1995, may have become heir-apparent himself if his father, Kim Jong Nam, hadn’t fallen out with Kim Jong Il and gone into exile in the Chinese gambling hub of Macau. Kim Jong Nam was Kim Jong Un’s older half-brother and his most serious rival, frequenting casinos and occasionally criticizing his younger sibling’s regime.Any hopes that Kim Han Sol might have had of returning to Pyongyang were dashed in 2017, when his father was murdered at the Kuala Lumpur airport by two women who smeared VX nerve agent on his face. Chinese police later arrested several North Koreans dispatched to Beijing on suspicion of plotting to kill Kim Han Sol, South Korea’s JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported at the time. His whereabouts remain unknown.Kim Jong Chol, BrotherKim Jong Chol, Kim Jong Un’s only surviving brother, would be another longshot, since he has shown more interest in guitars than politics. Thae Yong Ho, the former No. 2 at North Korea’s embassy in London who defected to South Korea, once said Kim’s elder brother “doesn’t own any official title” adding he’s “just a really talented guitarist.”Kim Jong Il saw his middle son as “girlish,” according to the person who goes by the pen name of Kenji Fujimoto and claims to have been the personal sushi chef for the former North Korean leader. In 2011, South Korean broadcaster KBS captured Kim Jong Chol enjoying an Eric Clapton concert in Singapore. Little else is known about him except that he studied in Switzerland and is a fan of U.S. professional basketball like his brother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-not-kim-jong-un-who-possible-heirs-to-north-korea-s-throne/story-sNQMmCr4OuI2zWtnJzgDFL.html
21-04-2020||World||Donald Trump says will suspend immigrations to save Covid-19 jobs losses||President Donald Trump on Monday said he is temporarily suspending immigration to protect American jobs threatened by the dire economic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak. India has been the top country of origin for legal immigrants to the US in recent years, with over 126,000 in 2017.“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” theAmerican president said in a post on twitter Monday evening.More than 22 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in last four weeks of stay-at-home lockdowns in force in most parts of the United States.It was not immediately clear from President Trump’s tweet what kind of immigrants would be impacted — new immigrants are mostly those applying for Green Cards on professional and family visas, refugees and asylum seekers.The Trump administration was considering suspending some work visas and Green Cards for 120 days, CNN reported Tuesday morning citing sources. HT was not able to independently verify it.But temporary foreign workers hired on H-1B, tourists and business visitors — the most popular visas for Indians — are unlikely to be impacted because they are on non-immigrant visas.The order is likely to be challenged in court, said industry sources.A response was awaited from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services for what to expect, and who are likely to be impacted, or not. It was not clear if immigrations applications already in the system will be frozen because of the order, and if that could happen to Green Cards as well.More than 1 million new immigrants are admitted to the United states every year. India sent the most in 2017 with 126,000 people, according to a Pew study. It was followed by Mexico (124,000), China (121,000) and Cuba (41,000). Overall, people from Mexico comprise the largest group of foreign-born US national in 2018 at 25%, followed by India and China, with 6% each, according to the same report.There were no indications Tuesday when the US president planned to issue the executive order, which could effectively shut down the legal immigration system for an indefinite period.While Trump has striven to block all illegal immigration, a key election promise, he has explicitly and repeatedly supported legal, merit-based immigration. The annual diversity visa, granted to residents of underrepresented countries, have been discontinued and intake of refugees has also been curtailed.The number of immigrant visas have dropped by about 25% from 617,752 in 2016, the year before President Trump took office, to 462,422, according to official US data.There has been a growing chorus of demand from Republican lawmakers and conservative analysts and commentators in recent days demanding a suspension of immigration in view of the increasing job losses due to the epidemic and the shutdown in place to slow and stop it.“25 million Americans are unemployed today. All immigration should be halted until every citizen who wants a job has a job,” Paul Gosar, a Republican congressman from Arizona and staunch Trump ally, wrote on Twitter last week. And Jeff Sessions, former US attorney general and estranged Trump aide who has been an immigration hawk, has called on the federal government to “IMMEDIATELY halt immigration to the United States until Americans are back to work”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-will-suspend-immigrations-to-save-covid-19-jobs-losses/story-2qsYsGlnoiUTvvqC3JQLJJ.html

Later today, at around about 2pm (local time), he will be speaking with President Trump,” the spokesperson said.However, it was stressed that Johnson would be “continuing his recovery at Chequers and isn’t formally doing government work”, with Raab continuing to be in charge as his deputy.Johnson has been recuperating at his prime ministerial country residence in Buckinghamshire since his discharge from St. Thomas’ Hospital in London last week, after he tested positive for coronavirus and had to be shifted into intensive care for a few days as his condition worsened.It is customary for the British prime minister to hold a weekly audience with the monarch, which had been transformed into telephone engagements as the coronavirus lockdown came into force last month. Johnson will now be resuming the phone audience with the Queen, who turned 94 on Tuesday, after a three-week hiatus due to his illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-boris-johnson-on-way-back-to-work-to-speak-to-trump-and-queen/story-MVMUYrtwywMWG84CHYCn4N.html
21-04-2020||World||China extensively censored Coronavirus outbreak info, impact felt globally: Media watchdog||China “extensively” censored information on the coronavirus outbreak, a leading media watchdog has said, adding that the negative effects of Beijing’s “information hyper-control” system have been experienced globally amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated “the many crises” threatening press freedom across the world, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said on Tuesday, unveiling its annual press rankings.The RSF called out authoritarian governments for taking advantage of the international health crisis to push through repressive media laws, censure journalists and censor news.“Both China (177th) and Iran (173rd) censored their major coronavirus outbreaks extensively,” the RSF report said, adding: “China, which is trying to establish a ‘new world media order’ maintains its system of information hyper-control, of which the negative effects for the entire world have been seen during the coronavirus public health crisis”.China has been accused of downplaying and covering up initial information of the coronavirus which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.The severity of the “unknown fever” was downplayed and doctors who attempted to raise the alarm were harassed and detained; medics who shared their concerns within the community were rounded up as “rumourmongers” Until nearly the third week of January, officials did not publicly reveal the full picture of the outbreak, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to travel out of Wuhan.China, since the initial costly missteps, has largely brought the outbreak under control within the country.On Tuesday, the Chinese mainland reported 11 new confirmed Covid-19 cases, with four imported cases, and 37 new asymptomatic.Overall, the China now has over 4,600 deaths and more than 82,700 cases.Separately, RSF’s UK bureau director, Rebecca Vincent told CNN Business that if there had been a free press in China and if the whistleblowers hadn’t been silenced, then this could have been prevented from turning into a pandemic.“Sometimes we can talk about press freedom in a theoretical way, but this shows the impact can at times be physical. It can affect all of our health,” she said.China’s foreign ministry dismissed the RSF’s report.Spokesperson Geng Shuang said that “this organisation has always held deep-rooted prejudice against China and their so-called report is not worth rebutting.”“China upholds the basic national policy of opening up to the outside word, and welcomes foreign media and journalists,” Geng said.“We are opposed to ideological biases against China, publication of fake news in the name of so-called press freedom as well as behaviors that are against journalistic ethics.”Norway topped the global index of media freedom for the fourth year in a row, with Scandinavian countries filling the top spots. Finland came in second, Denmark third and Sweden fourth.“The democratically elected presidents of two countries, Donald Trump in the United States (up 3 at 45th) and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil (down 2 at 107th), continue to denigrate the media and encourage hatred of journalists in their respective countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-extensively-censored-coronavirus-outbreak-info-impact-felt-globally-media-watchdog/story-cpGOiCYvqH4inGkcr8PxJO.html

Altogether 4,632 people have died of the disease, it said.Also, 37 new asymptomatic cases, including two from abroad, were reported on the mainland with 992 cases, including 180 from abroad, were still under medical observation.However, Chinese health officials apprehend a second wave of the coronavirus attack especially from hundreds of Chinese nationals returning from abroad.A Chinese health expert Zhang Wenhong said recently that China could be hit by a second wave of coronavirus cases in November this year as winter returns but by that time the country would be well prepared to deal with COVID-19.Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an emergency situation, some Chinese medics would be injected with coronavirus vaccines.In accordance with how the epidemic develops, in case of emergency, some medical staff would be injected with a newly developed coronavirus vaccine, Gao said, noting that any medicines and vaccines have their own research and development cycles. “I believe we could come up with vaccines with the joint efforts of everyone,” he was quoted as saying by state-run Global Times.China has approved three COVID-19 vaccine candidates for clinical trials.An adenovirus vector vaccine, developed by Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences, was the first to be approved to enter a clinical trial.The first phase of the clinical trial was completed at the end of March, and the second phase started on April 12.It is the first COVID-19 vaccine in the world that has entered the second phase of clinical trial, according to World Health Organisation (WHO), the Xinhua report said. Several countries, including China are speeding up coronavirus vaccine development to cut the time span to few months instead of several years. Concerning the timetable for vaccine research and development, the director of the Chinese CDC said, “if you follow the normal procedure, the vaccine may not come out until the end of this year or early next year,” noting that if the situation continues worsening, medics might be injected with the vaccines by the end of this year. He also emphasised that this won’t be used among normal people, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-may-inject-medics-with-newly-developed-covid-19-vaccine-to-deal-with-any-emergency-health-official/story-2CyAJ1Uq0ei3moVTJJLnGI.html
21-04-2020||World||Pakistan quietly removes 4,000 from its terrorist watchlist: Report||Pakistan has discreetly removed the names of around 4,000 terrorists from its watchlist, including that of one of the major planners of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) startup has revealed.Due to Pakistan’s long history of exporting terror to India and the rest of the world, the country has been placed under grey list by Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global watchdog for terror funding.Dissatisfied with Pakistan’s efforts to curb terror-funding, the FATF in February noted that Islamabad had addressed only 14 points out of 27 conditions to get off the grey list.Also read: 5 times India dissed Pakistan’s propaganda during Covid-19 crisisThe FATF is to again evaluate Pakistan’s progress in June.The New York-based startup Castellum, which automates watchlist compliance, has found that in the last year and a half, Pakistan has deleted “3,800 names from the Proscribed Persons List, without explanation or notification to the public”.The Imran Khan government removed about 1,800 names from its terrorist watchlist since March 9th “without any public explanation, including Zaka ur-Rehman, an alias of the Lashkar-e-Taiba leader and alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks”, the Castellum report said.According to a FATF report, Pakistan’s terrorist watchlist had about 7,600 names in October 2018.Also read| ‘Bizarre’: India dismisses Pak PM’s tweet on discrimination against MuslimsCastellum.AI, which regularly uses new data sources, added the Pakistan Proscribed Persons List to its database on March 9.Between March 9 and March 27, Castellum.AI data showed that the Khan government removed 1,069 names from the Proscribed Persons List, and that all those names then appeared on Pakistan’s official denotified list. Since March 27, another 800 or so names have been deleted.To ensure that the AI looked at only the most likely cases where internationally listed terrorists were removed, the startup first downloaded the official Denotified List, then screening the names against its watchlist database.Following this, the AI removed all matches that did not match all name parts and removed all matches where the listed persons were not citizens of Afghanistan or Pakistan (the Proscribed Persons list seems to only have these two groups).Then the AI ensured that exculpatory information does not exist, for example, IDs that do not match, or news reports that the individual is deceased.The AI also ensured that the name, if not exact, matches an official alias. For example, Zaka Ur Rehman, who is more commonly known as Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi, but has an official alias ‘Zaki Ur Rehman’.“In the case of Zaka Ur Rehman, the difference between Zaka and Zaki fits within the parameters of an accurate phonetic translation. Castellum.AI also searched for the Lashkar-e-Taiba leader’s full name, Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi, on the Pakistan Proscribed Persons list, and he was not on the list. This means that if the removed name is a false positive, that Pakistan has not added the Lashkar-e-Taiba leader to its terrorism watchlist,” the report said.Pakistan’s Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) lead, the National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), has provided no explanation for removal of the names.Castellum.AI provided data to the Wall Street Journal who in turn contacted the Pakistani government for comment.On April 15, an article was published in a Pakistani newspaper, saying that names were removed because “the list has been bloated up to 7,000 names with multiple inaccuracies such as the names of dead individuals, Afghan nationals, untraceable names without proper identifiers”.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text. Only the headline has been changed.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-removes-names-of-4-000-terrorists-from-its-watchlist/story-yAQG1Qst4llUwFSDwZBPKL.html

CNN cited an anonymous U.S. official who said Kim was in “grave danger” after an unspecified surgery.The Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, said it wouldn’t comment on the CNN report or another report by Daily NK, which cited anonymous sources saying Kim was recovering from heart surgery in the capital Pyongyang and that his condition was improving.The presidential Blue House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Speculation about Kim’s health was raised after he missed the celebration of his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, the country’s most important holiday.Also Watch | Coronavirus: S Korea starts own version of odd-even, rations purchase of masks Outside governments and media have a mixed record on tracking developments among North Korea’s ruling elite, made difficult by Pyongyang’s stringent control of information about them.In 2016, South Korea media quoted intelligence officials as saying Kim Jong Un had Ri Yong Gil, a former North Korean military chief, executed for corruption and other charges. But North Korea’s state media months later showed that Ri was alive and in possession of several new senior posts.Kim’s absence from state media often triggers speculations or rumors about his health.

Another 81 who were in the eatery did not. The infections, according to an analysis by Center for Disease Control (CDC) experts in China, took place because the three families were in the draught of the same air conditioner as the index patient, although they were on different tables. The findings now offer new insights -- how the virus travels (it infected only those in the air current while others were safe); the challenge in detecting infected persons (the index patient did not have any symptoms); and consequences for closed, air-conditioned spaces (restaurants, offices, even public transport) -- as the world struggles to determine how people can go back to everyday routines.“On January 23, family A travelled from Wuhan and arrived in Guangzhou. On January 24, the index case-patient (patient A1) ate lunch with 3 other family members (A2–A4) at restaurant X. Two other families, B and C, sat at neighbouring tables. Later that day, patient A1 experienced fever and cough and went to the hospital. By February 5, a total of nine others (four members of family A, three members of family B, and two members of family C) had become ill with Covid-19,” said the research letter published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.The researchers say the infections show the virus was spread through droplets carried in the air-conditioning draught. The lack of infection in others at two tables close by (but not in the line of the air flow), and in other floors of the restaurant appeared to suggest the virus did not spread through “aerosol transmission”. If a virus spreads as an aerosol, it is harder to contain since it lingers in the air for longer and disperses more easily over longer distances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ac-air-flow-spread-covid-19-in-china-restaurant/story-4XU9YVC3bAyAkHahV7bMOO.html

The nurses asked judges to order the defendants to provide masks and other protection to nurses.“These lawsuits were filed to protect our nurses, our patients and our communities from grossly inadequate and negligent protections,” said a statement from Pat Kane, the association’s executive director.The court filings said the hospitals were ignoring requirements by the state’s COVID-19 task force that healthcare workers receive an N95 respirator mask daily, and that the health department was not enforcing it.The Department of Health said it has taken every step necessary to ensure that healthcare workers have the needed support and supplies.Westchester Medical Center Health Network said its focus has been on protecting its workforce, while Montefiore said nurses were attacking the system while their colleagues were working to save lives.The association represents 42,000 nurses in the state, which leads the country with about 233,000 COVID-19 cases. The association said that 9,514 of its registered nurses have tested positive for the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus and that 11 have died.The association asked a state judge to block the Department of Health from enforcing a directive requiring healthcare personnel to return to work only seven days after the onset of COVID-19, even if they still have symptoms.

Children’s Fund (UNICEF).UNICEF said children were nearly half of an estimated eight million people who will be hurt by the loss of about 1.7 million jobs this year as a result of businesses closing, salaries being suspended and other effects of lockdowns in the region.“It is evident that the pandemic is affecting children firsthand. Many families in the region are already becoming poorer due to the loss of jobs especially the daily-paid,” Ted Chaiban, UNICEF’s regional director in the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement issued on Monday from Amman. “Families are struggling to bring food to their table due to containment measures,” he added.About 110 million children are now at home and not in schools in the region, UNICEF said.Humanitarian agencies and NGOs say curfews and lockdowns are already making it difficult or impossible for many to provide for their families.UNICEF estimates that there are 25 million children in need, including refugees and internally displaced people from conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Sudan Palestinian territories, Iraq and Libya.The agency said it was appealing for $92 million to allow it to step up its efforts to combat COVID-19.Millions already lack health care, food, water and electricity in conflict-stricken countries where prices are rising and infrastructure damaged, UN and humanitarian agencies say.“The combination of lack or inadequate basic services, years of conflict in several parts of the region, poverty, deprivation and now COVID-19 are hitting vulnerable children the most, making their hard lives simply unbearable,” Chaiban said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-to-impoverish-millions-of-children-in-middle-east-as-caregivers-lose-jobs-unicef/story-2e252kCTe9AHrrfUm3Ys1H.html

You know, the strategic reserves,” Trump told reporters at his daily coronavirus press conference.“And we are looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves,” he added.Later in the briefing, he specified that he would only buy that amount if Congress authorized the funding -- or if the federal government could rent storage space to third parties for a fee.When prices eventually rebound, these vendors could sell their excess oil.US oil prices crashed to unprecedented lows Monday as futures in New York ended in negative territory for the first time amid a devastating supply glut that has forced traders to pay others to take the crude off their hands.The president had announced his intention on March 13 to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to the brim.As of April 17, it contained 635 million barrels of its current authorized limit of 713.5 million barrels. Stored in a complex of four underground sites along the Gulf coasts of Texas and Louisiana, in the south of the United States, the SPR has a total storage capacity of 727 million barrels. This is intended for use in case of emergencies such as the 1991 Iraq War, or in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-wants-to-use-oil-crash-to-add-75-mn-barrels-to-fill-national-stockpile/story-gdfD4FOjxfKFc0ZCWWXcqO.html

The country’s top court has already ruled governors and mayors can decide on social isolation measures regardless of the federal government’s position. Bolsonaro, meanwhile, wants a quick reopening to stop the deterioration of Brazil’s faltering economy.“Everything done in excess ends up bringing problems. These measures did not reach their goal in some states,” Bolsonaro told journalists in front of the presidential residence in Brasilia. “I hope this is the last week of this quarantine, of this way of fighting the virus.”The Brazilian president favors a less restrictive model in which only those in high-risk groups would be quarantined at home until the end of the outbreak.After Bolsonaro replaced critic Luiz Henrique Mandetta with Nelson Teich as health minister, several governors and mayors said they were considering even stricter isolation measures in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.Teich previously published an article defending quarantine policies, but he has not spoken to the press since a vague introduction speech on Friday and it is unclear what he will do on the job.On Monday evening, Brazil’s health ministry shared a video in which Teich says there will be “a progressive, structured and planned exit from social isolation.” He also promised to raise the country’s capacity of testing from promised 24 million in the next weeks to up to 46 million.Brazil confirmed 113 deaths of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, putting the country’s total at 2,575. More than 40,000 people have contracted the disease in the South American nation, the highest figure in Latin America.For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Bolsonaro’s comments came one day after he met outdoors with dozens of supporters who want the closing of the country’s congress and supreme court. His presence in such demonstration is drawing widespread repudiation in a nation that endured a military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985.The Brazilian president denied he was attacking the country’s democracy at the protest, but said: “I am actually the constitution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-seeks-end-to-social-isolation-measures-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-aUuijDci5Iz2I1YDBSsq6H.html

He and others, however, have previously pointed to the likely future spread of the illness through Africa, where health systems are far less developed.Also read: Oil plunges below $0 for the first time in history amid Covid-19 crisis“Trust us.

It’s a health issue.”“This virus is dangerous. It exploits cracks between us when we have differences,” he said.Tedros said US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staffers have been seconded to work with his agency, suggesting that was a sign of WHO’s transparency.“Having CDC staff (at WHO) means there is nothing hidden from the U.S. from Day One” Tedros said. “Our CDC colleagues also know that we give information immediately to anyone.”In one of his starkest comparisons yet, the UN health agency chief also alluded to the so-called Spanish flu more than a century ago, saying the coronavirus has a “very dangerous combination ... like the 1918 flu that killed up to 100 million people.”Tedros called the illness “Public Enemy No. 1,” and said: “We have been warning from Day One: This is a devil that everybody should fight.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-terms-covid-19-public-enemy-no-1-says-worst-is-yet-ahead-of-us/story-iQkytQz96W2sSyER3lmoEP.html

Manjeet knew so many people here in the hospital, we will all miss him immensely”.Riyat’s colleague, Susie Hewitt, said: “In 2003, Manjeet became one of four consultants in Emergency Medicine at the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary...Manjeet was enormously valued and much loved as a colleague, supervisor and mentor”.“Manjeet’s passion for teaching and contribution to medical education were constant during his career…he had many skills, but was most comfortable as an emergency medicine consultant”, she added. Riyat has left behind his wife and two sons.Earlier this month, cardio-thoracic surgeon Jitendra Kumar Rathod, who gained his qualifications in India and moved to the UK, passed away in Wales. The Cardiff and Vale University Health Board described him as ‘a greatly respected doctor and colleague’.Britain’s health officials have paid tributes to other Indian-origin medical professionals who passed away in recent days, including Jitendra Kumar Rathod, Vivek Sharma, Rajesh Kalraiya, Krishan Arora, Amrik Bamotra, Sophie Fagan and Pooja Sharma.Initial hospital data suggests that minority non-white people in the UK constitute 35 per cent among those in critical care hospitals, prompting an inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-much-loved-indian-origin-doctor-dies-of-covid-19-in-uk/story-X6W71Wbu01ZgQRHBTK8rYJ.html

21-04-2020||World||‘China’s victim, not culprit’: Beijing disses calls for probe into Covid-19 origin||China on Monday rejected Australia’s call for a probe examining the global response to the coronavirus pandemic -- including Beijing’s early handling of the outbreak.Washington and several allies have accused China of failing to adequately respond to the viral disease threat in the weeks after it was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year. US President Donald Trump also cut funding to the World Health Organization after accusing it of mismanaging the crisis and covering up the seriousness of the initial outbreak before it spread around the world and killed more than 165,000 people. But Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the accusations disrespected “the Chinese people’s tremendous efforts and sacrifices” in fighting the contagion. “Any question about China’s transparency in the prevention and control of epidemic situation is not in line with facts,” Geng told a regular press briefing.He was speaking in response to a question about Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, who a day earlier said her country would “insist” on the probe into the response by Beijing and the WHO. Authorities in Wuhan initially tried to cover up the outbreak, punishing doctors who had raised the alarm online in December.There were also questions about China’s recording of COVID-19 infections, as it repeatedly changed its counting criteria at the peak of the outbreak.Chinese scientists have rejected conspiracy theories pushed by some in the US government claiming the virus could have originated at a maximum-security virology lab in Wuhan. But Trump has suggested that China could have been “knowingly responsible” for spreading the infection and could face consequences as a result. bys/gle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-victim-not-culprit-beijing-disses-calls-for-probe-into-covid-19-origin/story-j0yAVjclTr6s128eydZVPJ.html
21-04-2020||World||Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya loses appeal against extradition in UK High Court||Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Monday lost his appeal in the UK High Court against the 2018 order to extradite him to India to face charges of financial irregularities.Mallya, 64, is wanted in India to face charges of financial offences amounting to Rs 9,000 crore borrowed by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines (KFA) from several Indian banks.The case will now go to home secretary Priti Patel for a final decision on his extradition.Justices Irwin and Elisabeth Laing handed down their verdict by email.The flamboyant businessman was ordered to be extradited to India back in December 2018 on a request from the Indian government that has accused him of “knowingly misrepresenting” the profitability of his companies when he sought bank loans in 2009.Also read |  Vijay Mallya phoned lobbyist aide, asked for help to ‘manage his case’: EDIn their 46-page judgement, Justice Irwin and Justice Laing said: “(In) our judgment, the SDJ (senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot) was entitled to find that there was a prima facie case of fraud by false representation…(We) reject the submission that the SDJ was wrong to find a prima facie case of conspiracy to defraud”.The judges rejected the six grounds on which Mallya’s lawyer, Claire Montgomery, had appealed, and upheld Arbuthnot’s judgement.The judges said: “It is clear beyond any doubt that the SDJ directed herself properly. It is clear she had the criminal burden and standard in mind when she considered whether there was a prima facie case”.“The role of an extradition court considering this question is to consider whether a tribunal of fact, properly directed, could reasonably and properly convict on the basis of the evidence. The extradition court is, emphatically, not required itself to be sure of guilt in order to send the case to the Home Secretary”.Also read | ‘Please banks, take your money’: Vijay Mallya appeals again after UK court hearing“The extradition court must conclude that a tribunal of fact, properly directed and considering all the relevant evidence, could reasonably be sure of guilt. There is no basis upon which it could be said the SDJ misunderstood this, or that she misdirected herself”, they added.India’s case for his extradition rests on, what had been described in court proceedings by the prosecution as, the “three chapters of dishonesty”: misrepresentations to various banks to acquire loans, the misuse of the loans and his conduct after the banks recalled the loans.The Crown Prosecution Service, on behalf of the Indian government, argued that there was at least a case that Mallya had to answer back home and a reasonable jury could conclude that the businessman and his company indulged in conspiracy, fraud, and used loans for unintended purposes, including part of the loans going to his motor racing team.Mark Summers, CPS lawyer, reminded Justice Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing of the high court of England and Wales that in extradition cases, British courts are solely required to establish whether the person requested has a prima facie case to answer, not to establish the truth.To that extent, he argued, the magistrates court had taken into account all relevant evidence and had ruled that Mallya had a prima facie case to answer and that he needed to be extradited to India to face trial.Mallya’s lawyer Claire Montgomery, on the other hand, has insisted that Mallya’s inability to repay bank loans was due to a genuine business failure and the result of wider challenges facing the aviation industry at the time.Mallya has, on numerous occasions, alleged that he was prepared to repay the loans. “I have made repeated offers to pay 100% of the amount borrowed by KFA to the Banks… Neither are Banks willing to take money and neither is the ED willing to release their attachments which they did at the behest of the Banks. I wish the FM would listen in this time of crisis,” he tweeted on March 31.In New Delhi, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBII) and ED, which have been pursuing the case against Mallya, welcomed the verdict.“It is a significant achievement in continuing a war against economic fugitives who have been managing to stay away from the judicial process in the country. It also validates the painstaking and meticulous investigation done by the CBI,” CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fugitive-businessman-vijay-mallya-loses-appeal-against-extradition-in-uk-high-court/story-Q7eyztfPTsuexFo8OMsMaM.html
