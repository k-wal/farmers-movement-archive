He is one of the most senior officials to be infected so far.Iran has been scrambling to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus since it reported its first cases on February 19.Earlier Thursday Iran had reported 124 new deaths from the coronavirus, raising its total to 3,160 with more than 50,000 people infected.The announcement came as President Hasan Rouhani warned at a cabinet meeting that the country may still battle the pandemic for another year.“Coronavirus is not something for which we can point to a certain date and say it will be completely eradicated by then,” he said.Rouhani said the virus “may be with us in upcoming months, or until the end” of the current Iranian year, in March 2021.The virus has not spared Iranian lawmakers or other officials.At least 23 of the legislature’s 290 members have tested positive for the novel coronavirus so far, state news agency IRNA said on Tuesday.COVID-19 has also killed at least 12 serving or former government officials, according to official reports.After weeks of refraining from imposing a lockdown or quarantine measures, Tehran decided last week to ban all intercity travel until at least April 8.There is no official lockdown within Iran’s cities, although the government has repeatedly urged Iranians to stay at home to contain the spread of the virus.Iran has closed schools and universities as well as four key Shiite pilgrimage sites, including the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Qom, Iran’s epicentre for the virus.It has also discouraged travel, cancelled the main weekly Friday prayers and temporarily closed parliament.amh/hkb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-parliament-speaker-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-OHYo17XV6uM4MLnCsPcwHM.html

But new infections continued to level off three weeks into the West’s first nationwide shutdown, with 4,668 new infections for a total official caseload of 115,242.Pressure on hospitals in hard-hit Lombardy continued to ease, with more than 800 people recovered and 165 fewer people hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to a day earlier. Intensive care units are still saturated, but overall, Lombardy added just under 1,300 new positive cases, with about half of those infected being treated at home.More than 10,000 medical personnel have been infected nationwide and 69 doctors have died, according to the National Institutes of Health and the Italian association of doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-reports-760-more-deaths-from-virus/story-EcL77KCSTpPnBvnyn5w7qJ.html

02-04-2020||World||Israel’s health minister has coronavirus, was in frequent contact of PM Netanyahu||The new coronavirus forced into isolation Israel’s health minister, who has had frequent contact with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after he tested positive for the disease, the Health Ministry said Thursday.The Middle East has over 82,000 confirmed cases of the virus, most of them in Iran, and over 3,600 deaths. Iran’s Health Ministry said Thursday that the new coronavirus killed another 124 people, pushing the country’s death toll to 3,160.In a rare acknowledgment of the severity of the outbreak by a senior Iranian official, President Hassan Rouhani said the new coronavirus may remain through the end of the Iranian year, which just began late last month, state TV reported Thursday.“We always have to follow the health protocols provided by the health ministry,” Rouhani added.In Lebanon, the Philippines ambassador, Bernardita Catalla, died of complications from the coronavirus Thursday, the Philippines said. Lebanon has recorded 494 cases, including 16 deaths.Israel said Health Minister Yaakov Litzman and his wife, who also contracted the virus, are in isolation, feel well and are being treated.Shortly after the announcement, Netanyahu’s office said he returned to self-quarantine because of contact with Litzman. Netanyahu, who has tested negative, had previously been in isolation after a top aide tested positive for the virus.Hebrew language media reported that the head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency and the National Security Council were asked to self-quarantine because of their interactions with Litzman.Israel has gone into near-lockdown to try to contain the outbreak. It has reported over 6,200 confirmed cases and 29 deaths of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.Israel’s large, insular ultra-Orthodox community, of which Litzman is a member, has been particularly hard hit. In the early phases of the outbreak, some rabbis had pushed back or ignored government-mandated movement restrictions, but resistance appears to have diminished.For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia that can be fatal.In Syria, the government extended the closures of mosques until April 16, nearly a week before the start of the holy month of Ramadan when Muslims spend more time in prayers and worship. It also extended indefinitely a ban on visits to prison and detention facilities, citing concerns over the spread of the virus, and expanded curfew times over weekend days.Rights groups have called on Mideast governments to release thousands of political detainees held in crammed and unhygienic jails. In government-controlled Syria, 10 cases of infection and two deaths were reported, amid concerns the virus may be more widespread.The World Health Organization said it was increasing preparedness in the rebel-controlled, northwestern region of Syria that is home to nearly 4 million people, most of them displaced by the war and repeated government offensives. Only half of the health facilities are functioning in rebel-held territory, where displaced camps are crowded and the virus’ transmission would be fast once it reaches the area.Meanwhile, the pandemic is expected to wipe out $23 billion in passenger revenue from airlines across the Middle East and Africa this year, according to an assessment Thursday by the aviation industry’s largest trade association.The International Air Transport Association said Mideast airlines will see a $19 billion drop in revenue this year, compared to 2019. Airlines in Africa, which include EgyptAir, are expected to see a $4 billion drop. Hundreds of thousands of job in the aviation sector are also at risk across both regions.Saudi Arabia’s revenue loss could exceed $5.6 billion this year, as all pilgrimage flights are currently halted in addition to commercial flights to and from the kingdom. The United Arab Emirates, home to world’s busiest airport for international travel in Dubai, is projected to lose $5.4 billion in revenue.Egypt and Qatar could also see more than $1 billion each in revenue loss, while the aviation sector in South Africa is expected to lose $2.3 billion in potential revenue.IATA said projections are based on assumptions that travel restrictions will continue through the second quarter of 2020. Even if travel recovers partially in the second half of the year, it will be slow and impacted by an overall slump in the global economy and weakened passenger demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-s-health-minister-has-coronavirus-was-in-frequent-contact-of-pm-netanyahu/story-8Mth2J2Td5X6GtqLOxS5QJ.html
02-04-2020||World||Covid-19 updates: Saudi imposes 24-hour coronavirus curfew in holy cities||Saudi Arabia on Thursday extended curfew restrictions on Islam’s two holiest cities to 24 hours to stem the spread of coronavirus as the number of deaths from the disease rose to 21. The announcement comes amid uncertainty over the hajj which is due to take place at the end of July, after authorities this week urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage. “Full 24-hour curfew in Mecca and Medina starting from today until further notice,” the official Saudi Press Agency reported, citing an interior ministry source. The cities were earlier under a 15-hour daily curfew. Authorities have already sealed off Mecca and Medina along with Riyadh and Jeddah, barring people from entering and exiting the cities as well as prohibiting movement between all provinces. Saudi Arabia, which has reported the highest number of infections in the Gulf, is scrambling to limit the spread of the disease at home. On Thursday the health ministry said the deaths from the illness had risen to 21 while 1,885 infections were reported. Last month, Saudi Arabia suspended the year-round “umrah” pilgrimage over fears of the coronavirus pandemic spreading to Islam’s holiest cities. Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year’s hajj. Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from across the world to take part in the hajj, which all Muslims must perform at least once in their lives if able. The Arab world’s biggest economy has also closed down cinemas, malls, restaurants and halted flights as it steps up efforts to contain the virus. King Salman has warned of a “more difficult” fight ahead against the virus, as the kingdom faces the economic double blow of virus-led shutdowns and crashing oil prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-updates-saudi-imposes-24-hour-coronavirus-curfew-in-holy-cities/story-yx6Js5L6HqfnpjyfQWx4ON.html
02-04-2020||World||Iran, US heat up war of words despite coronavirus pandemic||Iran said Thursday it “only acts in self-defence” after President Donald Trump warned it against attacks on US troops in Iraq, as a new war of words heated up despite the coronavirus pandemic.Tensions between the arch-foes flared in Iraq where the United States deployed Patriot air defence missiles prompting neighbouring Iran to warn of consequences and demand a US withdrawal.Both countries have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed more than 5,000 lives in the United States and more than 3,000 in Iran.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that “unlike the US -- which surreptitiously lies, cheats & assassinates -- Iran only acts in self-defence”. “Don’t be misled by usual warmongers, AGAIN,” he said, addressing US President Donald Trump.“Iran starts no wars but teaches lessons to those who do,” he added.Trump warned Iran on Wednesday that it would pay a “heavy price” in the event of further attacks on US troops.He tweeted that “upon information and belief, Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on U.S. troops and/or assets in Iraq”. In response, Zarif tweeted that “Iran has FRIENDS: No one can have MILLIONS of ‘proxies’“Iran responded angrily to the US Patriot deployment warning that Washington risked leading the Middle East to disaster in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.Its armed forces chief of staff said the recent attacks against US bases in Iraq are the “natural reaction” of Iraqi people towards Washington’s continuing military presence.The attacks “have nothing to do with our country. The Americans sometimes attribute such things to us, which is projecting the blame,” Iran’s ISNA news agency quoted Major General Mohammad Bagheri as saying.“Iran has no involvement in these actions and no intention to attack foreign forces,” he said, underlining that Iran would still respond strongly to any aggression.Battle for influence Iran and the US are in a tense battle for influence in Iraq, where Tehran has powerful allies and Washington has close ties to the government.Bases in Iraq housing US troops and foreign embassies, particularly the American mission, have been targeted in more than two dozen rocket attacks since October that Washington has blamed on Iran-backed armed groups.Tensions have risen sharply since Trump withdrew from a landmark nuclear agreement in 2018 and reimposed sweeping sanctions.They escalated in January when the US killed Iran’s Major General Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike near Baghdad airport.Iran retaliated by firing at bases in Iraq housing US troops.While on high alert for a response, Iranian air defences accidentally shot down a Ukrainian airliner minutes after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board.Iran has repeatedly called on the Trump administration to reverse its sanctions policy, which has been opposed even by US allies, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic hit.“This was the best, historic opportunity for the Americans to reverse their wrong path and for once, tell their nation they are not against the Iranian people,” President Hassan Rouhani told a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.Medicines and medical equipment are technically exempt from the US sanctions but purchases are frequently blocked by the unwillingness of banks to process purchases for fear of incurring large penalties in the United States.European nations have delivered medical goods to Iran in the first transaction under the Instex financing mechanism set up to get round US sanctions, Germany said on Tuesday.But it is more than a year since Britain, France and Germany announced the creation of Instex and Iran has questioned European governments’ commitment to seeing it through in defiance of the Trump administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-us-heat-up-war-of-words-despite-coronavirus-pandemic/story-QqNmXReQJUEyGX9x9BkPuN.html
02-04-2020||World||Over 95% who died due to coronavirus in Europe were over 60: WHO||More than 95% of those who have died of coronavirus in Europe have been over 60 but young people should not be complacent, the head of the World Health Organization’s office in Europe said Thursday.Dr. Hans Kluge said age is not the only risk factor for getting a severe case of the virus that has put billions under lockdown and upended the world economy.“The very notion that Covid-19 only affects older people is factually wrong,” he said at an online news conference in Copenhagen. “Young people are not invincible.”Those comments echoed similar statements from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.The U.N. health agency says 10% to 15% of people under 50 with the disease have moderate or severe cases.“Severe cases of the disease have been seen in people in their teens or 20s, with many requiring intensive care and some unfortunately passing away,” Kluge said.He said recent statistics showed 30,098 people have been reported to have died in Europe, mostly in Italy, France and Spain.“We know that over 95% of these deaths occurred in those older than 60 years,” he said, with more than half of the dead over 80.Kluge said more than 80% of those who died had at least one other chronic underlying condition like cardiovascular disease, hypertension or diabetes.“On a positive note, there are reports of people over the age of 100 who were admitted to hospital for Covid-19 and have now — since — made a complete recovery,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-95-who-died-due-to-coronavirus-in-europe-were-over-60-who/story-YbG0aBGn5OIZI5bVkRYK4N.html

02-04-2020||World||Donald Trump casts doubt on Chinese coronavirus figures||President Donald Trump cast doubt on the accuracy of official Chinese figures on its coronavirus outbreak after US lawmakers, citing an intelligence report, accused Beijing of a cover up.“How do we know” if they are accurate, Trump asked at a press conference. “Their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side.”Trump insisted that “the relationship with China’s a good one” and that he remained close to President Xi Jinping.However, controversy around Beijing’s transparency has strained ties, adding to bad feelings triggered by a conspiracy theory in China that the US military was to blame for the virus.Republicans in Congress, pointing to a report by Bloomberg citing US intelligence, expressed outrage that Beijing apparently misled the international community on China’s infections and deaths that began in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.China’s reporting has been intentionally incomplete, with some intelligence officials describing Beijing’s numbers as fake, reported Bloomberg, which highlighted the classified intelligence document sent to the White House last week.China has publicly reported 82,394 confirmed cases and 3,316 deaths as of Thursday, according to a rolling tracker by Johns Hopkins University.That compares to 216,722 cases and 5.137 deaths in the United States, the country with the world’s largest reported outbreak.Asked about the report at a press briefing on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying didn’t directly address it or Trump’s comments, but said that “to slander, to discredit, to blame others or to shift responsibility cannot make up the time that has been lost.”“To carry on lying will only waste more time and cause more loss of life,” she said, adding that politicians who accused China of concealing information were “shameless and without morality.”Republican Senator Ben Sasse attacked Beijing’s numbers as “garbage propaganda.”“The claim that the United States has more coronavirus deaths than China is false,” Sasse said in a statement.“Without commenting on any classified information, this much is painfully obvious: The Chinese Communist Party has lied, is lying, and will continue to lie about coronavirus to protect the regime.”In a statement responding to the report, Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said China is “not a trustworthy partner” in the fight against Covid-19.“They lied to the world about the human-to-human transmission of the virus, silenced doctors and journalists who tried to report the truth, and are now apparently hiding the accurate number of people impacted by this disease,” McCaul said.He and other lawmakers have called on the State Department to launch an investigation into what he called China’s “cover up” of the pandemic.On Tuesday a member of Trump’s coronavirus task force, doctor Deborah Birx, said the medical community saw China’s outbreak as “serious but smaller than anyone expected because I think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-casts-doubt-on-chinese-coronavirus-figures/story-66VI21CwdQTIJMTwY8m3RM.html
02-04-2020||World||North Korea insists it is free of coronavirus||North Korea remains totally free of the coronavirus, a senior health official in Pyongyang has insisted, despite mounting scepticism overseas as confirmed global infections near one million.The already isolated, nuclear-armed North quickly shut down its borders after the virus was first detected in neighbouring China in January, and imposed strict containment measures.Pak Myong Su, director of the anti-epidemic department of the North’s Central Emergency Anti-epidemic Headquarters, insisted that the efforts had been completely successful.“Not one single person has been infected with the novel coronavirus in our country so far,” Pak told AFP.“We have carried out preemptive and scientific measures such as inspections and quarantine for all personnel entering our country and thoroughly disinfecting all goods, as well as closing borders and blocking sea and air lanes.”Nearly every other country has reported coronavirus cases, with the World Health Organization saying on Wednesday that there were nearly one million confirmed infections globally.Aside from China, South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the virus, which has claimed more than 45,000 lives around the world.Experts have said the North is particularly vulnerable to the virus because of its weak medical system, and defectors have accused Pyongyang of covering up an outbreak. The top US military commander in South Korea, General Robert Abrams, said last month he was “fairly certain” the North had confirmed cases of the virus.US President Donald Trump also said North Korea “is going through something” and offered “cooperation in the anti-epidemic work”, in a personal letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.And Choi Jung-hun, a former North Korean doctor who fled to the South in 2012, told AFP: “I heard there are many deaths in North Korea but the authorities are not saying that it’s caused by the coronavirus.”‘Strict control’As part of its anti-virus efforts Pyongyang put thousands of its own people and hundreds of foreigners -- including diplomats -- into isolation and mounted disinfection drives, with state media constantly exhorting citizens to obey health directives.Published images have shown universal face mask use, with the exception of leader Kim Jong Un, who has never been seen wearing one, even though for several weeks the officers alongside him when he supervised firing exercises donned black coverings.More recently his aides have also been seen without face masks, although defector Choi said that did not signal the North’s containment efforts had been widely successful.“Everyone accompanying Kim Jong Un is under strict control and safe from any virus threats,” said Choi.Pyongyang -- which is subject to multiple international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes -- has sought virus-related aid.In February, Russia’s foreign ministry said it provided Pyongyang with 1,500 coronavirus diagnostic test kits at its request “due to the persisting risk of the new COVID-19”.The United Nations has granted sanctions exemptions to relief groups including Doctors without Borders and UNICEF on items such as diagnostic kits, face masks, protective equipment and disinfectants.UNICEF confirmed its shipment of supplies -- requested by the North’s health ministry -- arrived in Pyongyang overland from China last week.The World Health Organisation plans to spend $900,000 to support Pyongyang’s coronavirus response activities, according to data posted on the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-insists-it-is-free-of-coronavirus/story-Aw63KFHXGc5dH7wm6wHOqM.html

The infection has claimed over 40,000 lives across the globe as the pandemic spreads at a “near-exponential” rate. A six-week-old baby became one of the youngest known victims of the contagion. Nearly half of the planet is under some form of a lockdown. While China takes baby steps on the path to recovery, the United States, Italy, France, Spain and Iran continue to grapple with the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths.Here are top global developments in the coronavirus situation.1. In an unprecedented move, the Australian government has announced free childcare during the coronavirus pandemic. 2. The United Kingdom records over 500 deaths in a single day.3. President of Philippines Rodrigo Duterte said that violators of lockdown could be shot dead.4. White House has said that the projections show the number of Covid-19 deaths could go up to 100,000 to 240,000 in the country. 5. China’s Shenzhen has banned the consumption of wild animals, dog and cat meat.6. The United States now accounts for almost a quarter of reported global infections. The country reported its 5,000th death, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The total number of infections rose above 216,000.7. Britain and France reported their highest daily death tolls from coronavirus on Wednesday.8. Italy’s total death toll turned the highest in the world, jumping past 13,000. Spain has witnessed over 9,000 deaths so far.9. The Food and Agriculture Organization, WHO and World Trade Organization said panic buying amid coronavirus pandemic could threaten food supplies across the globe.10. India witnessed the number of cases nearly double in the past week. The number of Covid-19 cases in the country stands at 1,925 including active cases, recoveries and fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-announces-free-childcare-china-s-shenzhen-bans-cat-and-dog-meat-covid-19-updates-from-across-the-globe/story-sWC3QgjDjqCrfCCkDU7VTK.html
02-04-2020||World||Under-fire, PM Boris Johnson says UK will ‘massively increase testing’||Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain would “massively increase testing” amid a growing wave of criticism on Thursday about his government’s failure to provide widespread coronavirus screening.In a video message posted online on Wednesday night from Downing Street, where he has been in self-isolation since announcing on March 27 that he had contracted the virus, Johnson said testing was the “way through”.“We’re also massively increasing testing. As I have said for weeks and weeks this (testing) is the way through,” Johnson said.“This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle, this is how we will defeat it in the end.”He was reacting to condemnation of his government, especially in the media, after officials revealed that just 2,000 out of half-a-million staff in the state-run National Health Service (NHS) had been tested.There have also been reports of staff being turned away from drive-in test centres because they did not have the correct paperwork, or others which were deserted because testing was by appointment only.Figures published Wednesday showed a total of 2,352 people with COVID-19 have died in the UK, an increase of 563, the largest single-day rise. Two of the deaths were medics.Testing for the general public has also been condemned as not being widespread enough. On Tuesday, 10,000 hospital patients and NHS staff were tested in England, well below the daily target of 25,000 and the 70,000 a day achieved in Germany.Various normally pro-government newspapers condemned the plans as “chaotic”, a “scandal” and a “shambles” as the backlash gathered pace.Paul Nurse, chief executive of biomedical research centre the Francis Crick Institute, told the BBC Thursday that the government should summon “the Dunkirk spirit” and let ‘small ship’ labs start screening for the killer disease.So far, Public Health England (PHE), the body tasked with testing, has insisted all screening should be carried out centrally.PHE medical director Professor Paul Cosford defended his organisation’s work.“At the very outset we identified this, we got the tests in place, we designed the tests in our laboratories. We have played our part,” he told BBC radio.Britain is currently in lockdown, with shops shut and the public asked to stay at home to try to limit the spread of coronavirus.The government has promised an enormous package of support for businesses and employees hit by the measures, but is facing questions about how quickly the money is getting through.New government figures show 950,000 people applied for state welfare support known as universal credit in the last fortnight. It is available to the unemployed and those on low incomes.National plane carrier British Airways is expected to announce it will suspend 36,000 staff later on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-fire-pm-boris-johnson-says-uk-will-massively-increase-testing/story-QGVdaUONzO1cvriKaE9a2M.html

02-04-2020||World||Covid-19: US cheers Indian engineers for building low-cost ventilator||Cheering the Indian engineers for building a low-cost ventilator, the US hopes that this invention succeeds and can eventually be mass produced as the critical medical equipment can save many lives from the deadly coronavirus that has killed over 5,000 people in America and 40,000 others globally.The United States, which as per latest projections is expecting between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths due to the coronavirus, requires thousands of ventilators in the next few weeks. It has roped in 11 private sector companies, including car manufacturers and plane makers to build ventilators.“We are cheering on these Indian engineers as they race to build a low-cost ventilator -- a potential game-changer for COVID19,” Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice G Wells tweeted.With support from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineers and production advice from a US-based company, “we hope this invention succeeds & can eventually be produced at scale,” Wells wrote. According to the MIT, in the US alone, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause ventilator shortages of 300,000-700,000 units. An increase in conventional ventilator production is very likely to fall short and with significant associated costs.Mass production of low-cost ventilators by a group of Indian engineers with the support from the MIT engineers and production advice from a US-based company, the US officials hope it would come as a big help to mankind which is racing against time in this fight against the deadly coronavirus.Taranjit Singh Sandhu, India’s Ambassador to the US, described this as an important step in the fight against COVID-19.“Important steps in combating the COVID19,” the ambassador said in a tweet.“Young engineers, with help from doctors and entrepreneurs in India and the US, are developing a low cost ventilator that could save thousands of lives. Here’s wishing them success!” Sandhu said.While the average cost of current ventilators in the US is around USD 30,000, the MIT said that a rapidly assembled volunteer team of engineers, physicians, computer scientists, and others, centered at the MIT, is working to implement a safe, inexpensive alternative for emergency use, which could be built quickly around the world.The team called MIT E-Vent (for emergency ventilator), was formed on March 12 in response to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its members were brought together by the exhortations of doctors, friends, and a sudden flood of mail referencing a project done a decade ago in the MIT class 2.75 (Medical Device Design).Students and faculty working in consultation with the local physicians designed a simple ventilator device that could be built with about USD 100 worth of parts, although in the years since prices have gone up and the device would now cost USD 400 to USD 500 in materials, the MIT said.The key to the simple, inexpensive ventilator alternative is a hand-operated plastic pouch called a bag-valve resuscitator or Ambu bag, which hospitals already have on hand in large quantities, it said.The MIT said that these are designed to be operated by hand, by a medical professional or emergency technician, to provide breaths to a patient in situations like cardiac arrest. As the deadly coronavirus crisis accelerates, a number of countries, including the US and India, are trying to procure ventilators needed for hospitals to deal with the demand caused by the virus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-cheers-indian-engineers-for-building-low-cost-ventilator/story-FHpaOcSJFRvsma9Cqnti2J.html

02-04-2020||World||Coronavirus changes burial rituals for Jews, Muslims||A rising death toll in the coronavirus crisis is forcing a change in Jewish and Muslim burial and mourning traditions in the Holy Land.In Israel, Jewish dead are normally laid to rest in a cloth smock and shroud, without a coffin. Now, the bodies of coronavirus victims are taken for ritual washing - performed in full protective gear - wrapped in impermeable plastic.They are wrapped again in plastic before interment.“Feelings are very much mixed,” said Yakov Kurtz, who works for Chevra Kadisha, the main group overseeing Jewish burials in Israel. “We don’t know what to expect, we don’t know how many dead we will have to tend to. There are many fears.”New decrees for handling the coronavirus dead have been given for Muslim burials, said Sheikh Muhammad Hussein, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and the Palestinian Territories. “This is a rule of necessity and necessities allow for prohibitions, therefore the deceased is not washed, nor shrouded and is buried in a plastic body-bag,” Hussein said. Israel has reported 29 coronavirus deaths so far. The Palestinians have confirmed one fatality so far. Funerals and mourning rituals have changed for everyone since Israeli and Palestinian authorities imposed stay-at-home directives and restricted the size of public gatherings to try to halt the spread of infection.Funerals in Israel can be attended by no more than 20 people in an open space only. Social distancing rules mean that embracing the bereaved is just not done. That has affected the Jewish tradition of Shiva - a seven-day period that begins after a funeral, in which people come to the family home to offer condolences, bring food and reminisce about the departed.In Gaza and the occupied West Bank bereaved families have taken to accepting condolences over social media. Ihab Nasseraldin lost his brother to cancer last week. His body was taken from the hospital to the cemetery, and the family could not hold a service they had planned at Jerusalem al-Aqsa’s mosque. “We buried him and condolences were accepted at the burial site. We had already requested everybody not to shake hands, no hugging or kissing, which is custom here. This was uncomfortable,” said Nasseraldin. Few were able to attend the funeral. Friends and relatives were told not to visit the family home during the customary three-day mourning period.“I truly feel sad that we were not able to pray at al-Aqsa over the body,” said Nasseraldin. “But there is nothing we can do. May God accept this from us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-changes-burial-rituals-for-jews-muslims/story-9npPLvPfqOFGT04T8bnUNL.html

Dress up as usual, put on make-up and dress neatly. OMG! This is what Rina, our Minister of Women, Family & Community Development thinks is important during the #COVID19 lockdown? No tips on how to deal with #DomesticViolence? Just state DV is a crime. pic.twitter.com/FfswtPBIPH In one poster, Malaysia's gender equality movement regresses five decades. Dah la illegitimate govt, incompetent pulak tu. @KPWKMNo wearing makeup saves a ton lots of money which is so important for families with kids now. What’s she thinking!?If this is shown to the world we will be a joke!! Malaysia boleh!After the online posters sparked a public outcry, the ministry removed them.“(It) is extremely condescending both to women and men,” said Nisha Sabanayagam, a manager at All Women’s Action Society, a Malaysian advocacy group.Malaysia is ranked 104 out of 153 countries in the latest World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap index, after scoring poorly on political empowerment and economic participation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-nag-husbands-during-lockdown-malaysia-tells-women-hell-breaks-loose-online/story-5rM9sK4nVbzAfaw3IcIwON.html

Here’s why||Pakistan on Wednesday reported the biggest jump in Covid-19 cases for the third consecutive day as the number of people infected with the deadly disease reached 2,238.The country has also witnessed 31 deaths from the disease.Reports of the lack of adequate screening procedures and squalid living conditions at the quarantine camps at the Taftan border crossing with Iran have raised concerns about the surge in the number of infections.The increase in the number of cases showed that there was little impact of the measures, including partial lockdown, taken so far to reduce the spread of the disease.Also Watch | ‘Pakistan army sending COVID-19 patients to PoK’: Activist Amjad Mirza People have so far refused to listen to the authorities. Officials in Pakistan are scrambling to contain the disease by appealing to the public to remain inside homes and go out only in cases of emergencies. But there was little impact on the masses and in several cities, people were seen roaming out while security officials were trying to convince them to go back to their places.Reports say that mosques have not been shut, despite the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country. An event was organised in Pakistan last month where 2,50,000 people had gathered, showing the casual approach adopted by the authorities in the country in controlling the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.While Saudi Arabia and Iran have announced closure of mosques, Pakistan is yet to take such a decision. Friday prayers have been going on in the mosques in Punjab province which has a population of 110 million. Except the provincial governments in Sidh and Balochistan, no other regional government has taken a decision to close the places of worship.This dilly-dallying by the central government in Pakistan has led Opposition parties to launch an attack on the Imran Khan dispensation.“This government has yet to decide if it wants to properly shut down the country or not. We demand that lockdown should be imposed without any further delay,” Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader and former premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said.Khan, on his part, has said that “coronavirus will be confronted by the force of faith”. Pakistani media cited Jamaat-i-Islami’s general-secretary Liaqat Baloch as saying that the Prime Minister is “confused” over whether or not to impose a lockdown in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-is-failing-in-fight-against-covid-19-here-s-why/story-vsRGOpRY7AR2dTogBIymTM.html

Three other men convicted of Pearl’s murder have been acquitted and ordered to be freed.The Sindh high court’s verdict, which overturned the 2002 conviction an anti-terrorism court, gave its ruling following appeals by the four convicts.Daniel Pearl, a 38-year-old American journalist, was abducted in Karachi while researching a story on Pakistan terrorists for the Wall Street Journal in the months after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States. His remains were later found in a shallow grave on the outskirts of the port city. A graphic video showing Pearl’s decapitation was delivered to the US consulate in the city nearly a month later. In this, the journalist’s captors forced him to say that he was Jewish before slitting his throat.Omar Sheikh’s lawyer Khawja Naveed told AFP that since Sheikh has been in prison since 2002, he was expected to be released, but the court had not yet issued that order, Naveed said.Sheikh, a British citizen of Pakistani origin, was freed by India along with Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Masood Azhar and terrorist Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar in exchange for the passengers of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 hijacked by a group of Pakistani terrorists from Kathmandu to Kandahar in December 1999.Thursday’s verdict was pronounced by a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha on appeals filed by the four men 18 years ago.The high court also dismissed an appeal by the prosecution seeking enhancement of life sentence given to the three other men – Fahad Naseem, Salman Saqib and Sheikh Adil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-sentence-overturned-for-briton-convicted-in-journalist-daniel-pearl-s-2002-murder-court/story-M2QgpfI6uMUwBtoIHMPKmN.html

02-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Donald Trump resists national shutdown, leaving it up to states||President Donald Trump is resisting calls to issue a national stay-at-home order to stem the spread of the new coronavirus despite his administration’s projections that tens of thousands of Americans are likely to be killed by the disease. One by one, though, states are increasingly pushing shutdown orders of their own.Trump said Wednesday he wants to give governors’ “flexibility” on whether a stay-at-home policy is the best option for their constituents, but acknowledged that he’s looking at limiting air and rail travel between hot spots within the United States. The president remains hesitant to press a unified policy even after the White House released “sobering” new projections on Tuesday that 100,000 to 240,000 Americans will likely succumb to the coronavirus even if current social distancing guidelines are maintained.Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Wednesday the nation’s federalist system leaves much of the authority on how to properly respond to catastrophes to individual state governors and local officials.“We trust the governors and the mayors to understand their people and understand whether or not they feel like they can trust the people in their states to make the right decisions,” Adams said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”On Wednesday alone, five more states — Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Nevada and Pennsylvania — added or expanded their stay-at-home orders.But the invocation of federalism in the midst of a crisis that threatens a nationwide body count on par with some of the deadliest American wars suggests that Trump and his advisers are cognizant of the political ramifications of their response. Republican governors in states like Florida, Texas and Nebraska have questioned the necessity of applying strong social distancing rules to rural or exurban areas that haven’t reported much evidence of the virus so far.The lack of a unified, 50-state response also collides with evidence emerging that coronavirus infections are being spread by people who have no clear symptoms, complicating efforts to gain control of the pandemic. A study conducted by researchers in Singapore and published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday is the latest to estimate that around 10% of new coronavirus infections may be spread by people who were infected with the virus but not experiencing symptoms.Even while deferring to governors. the Trump administration has issued guidelines that have urged Americans to work from home if possible, cancel on-site instruction at schools, and avoid large gatherings. The resistance to a more robust response comes even as Vice President Mike Pence said White House models for the coronavirus toll show the country on a trajectory akin to hard-hit Italy.Speaking to CNN, Pence said, “We think Italy may be the most comparable area to the United States at this point.” Italy, which has already recorded more than 13,000 deaths, has issued a nationwide quarantine, shutting down almost all industrial production and offices and largely prohibiting residents from leaving their homes.The White House’s best-case projection for loss of life assumes statewide stay-at-home orders, according to a senior administration official familiar with Trump’s thinking. Trump, the official said, is a believer in federalism and that it is up to individual governors to set restrictions for their states. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.More than 285 million people live in the 40 states where governors have declared statewide shelter-in-place orders or have recommended that residents stay home. In other states — places like Iowa and Nebraska, among others — governors have resisted state-level decisions, but some localities have declared residents should stay at home.According to a poll published Wednesday by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 78% of U.S. adults, including 84% of Democrats and 76% of Republicans, favor requiring Americans to stay in their homes except for essential errands. Americans in states that already had stay-at-home orders in place when the survey began are more likely than those in states that did not to approve of their state’s response, 63% to 51%.Still, Trump — who has conducted long, near-daily briefings on his administration’s response to the virus outbreak over the last three weeks — has been reluctant so far to use his bully pulpit to urge governors to issue orders that would help effectively create a national quarantine.“There are some states that are different,” Trump told reporters Wednesday. “There are some states that don’t have much of a problem.”But there are signs that Trump administration officials are pushing behind the scenes for holdout governors to issue statewide quarantines.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had resisted issuing a statewide order but reversed course and issued one Wednesday as federal and local pressure mounted for him to abandon the county-by-county approach he had implemented.DeSantis, a Republican, told reporters that he decided to issue the order after consulting with Trump and White House advisers.Rep. Donna Shalala, a Florida Democrat, said earlier Wednesday that Trump should be pressing governors for a unified approach to help stem the spread of the disease, calling his response so far “fragmented, weak and uneven.”“He hasn’t made a national plea to say we’re all in this together, and he hasn’t even talked to the governors about all doing the same thing,” Shalala, who was secretary of health and human services under President Bill Clinton, said in an interview.Authority to order quarantines inside states rests almost entirely with states under provisions in the U.S. Constitution ceding power not explicitly delegated to the federal government to states, courts have ruled consistently for years. While the federal government itself can’t order nationwide quarantines or impose quarantines on states, courts have said it has clear power under constitutional clauses regulating commerce to quarantine international travelers or those traveling state to state who might be carriers of deadly diseases.A few legal scholars have argued that the Constitution’s Commerce Clause may vest Trump with powers to impose a multiple state or national lockdown with or without states’ approval, though any such move under that minority interpretation would almost certainly be challenged immediately as unconstitutional.Pence told CNN that leaders and residents of states that haven’t been hard hit are already taking action to slow the virus’ spread.In Nebraska, Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts has said he’s basing his decisions on the advice he gets from public health experts at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, which has dealt extensively with outbreaks and served as a quarantine space for Ebola patients. In Iowa, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds has resisted a mandatory shelter-in- place order, saying the data she looks at doesn’t yet justify it in her state.South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, another Republican, said her voluntary guidance had helped slow the infection rate. “The calls to apply a one-size-fits-all approach is herd mentality, it’s not leadership,” she said.Ricketts, a vocal Trump supporter, has repeatedly said he won’t impose a stay-at-home order in Nebraska but has ordered restaurants either to close their dining areas or allow no more than 10 people inside at once, depending on their location in the state.In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered schools to stay closed through at least May and imposed restrictions that doctors and even his critics say are tantamount to a stay-at-home order for the state. Still, Abbott refused to call it that.“This is not a stay-at-home strategy. A stay-at-home strategy would mean that you have to stay home,” Abbott said. “This is a standard based upon essential services and essential activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-donald-trump-resists-national-shutdown-leaving-it-up-to-states/story-hvmKOOOvOtMlOLKKlGQ33J.html
02-04-2020||World||Social distancing guidelines to stay until no new COVID cases, deaths: White House||Social distancing guidelines will likely stay in place in the US until there are “no new cases and no deaths”, the White House coronavirus task force has indicated while confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country climbed beyond 200,000 and deaths topped 4,700.“The ultimate solution to a virus that might keep coming back is a vaccine”, America’s top infectious diseases doctor Anthony Fauci said at a White House briefing on Wednesday. The US now has the world’s highest caseload from the pandemic, the wail of ambulances loudest in New York which is reporting the most crushing numbers. Trump is bracing the nation for “horrific” days ahead. Fauci said that by the time the US is ready to relax social distancing guidelines, testing capacity would have to be available at scale. “The one thing we hopefully will have in place is a much more robust system of identifying someone who is infected, isolate them and then do contact tracing”, Dr. Fauci said. “A really good program of containment”, Fauci said, will give the US enough flex to “never have to get into mitigation”.“We are in mitigation right now”, Fauci said, referring to the social distancing guidelines that are in place till April 30. Speaking about vaccine development, Fauci said the work is “on target”. “We’re still in Phase 1, there were three doses, we’re in the highest dose now. A few months from now, we’ll be in Phase 2”, Fauci said. Fauci has stuck firmly to his timeline of “a year or year and a half” for vaccine breakthrough. On antibody testing, Fauci confirmed that “there is a lot of activity centred around a passive transfer of antibodies of convalescent plasma” but clarified that this is not the first priority right now. Testing, he said, is the most urgent task before the US.“It is very important to get a feel for the penetrance of infection in society. You get a better feel for what the herd immunity would be”, Fauci explained. This week, the Trump administration revealed for the first time multiple predictive models that are being used to estimate its grim assessment of a 100,000-200,000 coronavirus death toll in the country and stressed that community adherence to social distancing guidelines will be the game changer that will flatten the curve. “There’s no magic bullet. There’s no magic vaccine or therapy. It’s just behaviours. Each of our behaviours, translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days”, Dr Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response co-ordinator, said.“Americans should be prepared for that (death toll). Yes, it is a projection but that’s what it is and we have to be prepared for that”, said Fauci. The 100,000-200,000 death toll projection “assumes full mitigation measures” currently in place. The current guidelines stop short of a complete lockdown, still allowing people to go outside the home for solitary activities and for essential tasks. “We trust the American people to keep that six feet distance when they go out, meet people. That is why we have not issued a complete lockdown”, Birx said. She said that if people maintain “that six feet distance”, they have “controlled” the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-distancing-guidelines-to-stay-until-no-new-covid-cases-deaths-white-house/story-BdpaxYkwSGcdxyHrJdhBCJ.html

Across the United States, hospitals are facing shortages of ventilators. Some medical device makers have agreed to ramp up supplies. But because patients diagnosed with or suspected to have Covid-19 often require breathing support, there is widespread concern that these devices won’t be developed and shipped quickly enough. A total of 932,605 Covid-19 cases have been reported across more than 175 countries and territories with 16,809 deaths reported so far, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

We believe this is one of the youngest lives lost anywhere due to complications relating to COVID-19.”Last week Illinois authorities said they were investigating the death of a child “younger than one year” who had tested positive for coronavirus.According to local media that infant was nine months old. The fast-spreading virus that has caused at least 4,476 deaths in the United States is believed to be more dangerous for older adults, though increasingly it appears to be also sending younger patients to hospital as well.New York state, which Connecticut borders, has been particularly hard hit by Covid-19, accounting for nearly 2,000 of the US deaths.

Department of Economic and Social Affairs warned in a report that the decline could be even deeper if restrictions on economic activities extend into the third quarter of the year and if fiscal stimulus efforts don’t support income and consumer spending.By comparison, it said, the world economy contracted 1.7% during the global financial crisis in 2009.“Fears of the exponential spread of the virus — and growing uncertainties about the efficacy of various containment measures — have rocked financial markets worldwide,” the report noted, “with market volatility surpassing its peak during the global financial crisis and equity markets and oil prices plunging to multi-year lows.”In the best-case scenario, the report said, moderate declines in private consumption, investment and exports will be offset by increases in government spending in the seven major industrialized nations and China, leading to global growth of 1.2% in 2020.In the worst-case scenario, it said, global output would contract 0.9%, “based on demand-side shocks of different magnitudes” to China, Japan, South Korea, the United States and the European Union as well as a 50% decline in oil prices.This scenario “assumes that wide-ranging restrictions on economic activities in the EU and the United States would extend until the middle of the second quarter,” the report said.It said increasing restrictions on the movement of people and lock-downs in Europe and North America “are hitting the service sector hard, particularly industries that involve physical interactions such as retail trade, leisure and hospitality, recreation and transportation services.” Those sectors account for more than a quarter of all jobs in those countries, and as these businesses lose revenue, unemployment is likely to increase sharply, it said.The report said the negative effects of current economic restrictions in richer developed nations will soon spill over into developing countries, which will see lower trade and investment.The severity of the economic impact — “whether a moderate or deep recession” — will largely depend on the duration of restrictions on the movement of people and economic activities in major economies and on the size and impact of fiscal responses, it said.“Urgent and bold policy measures are needed, not only to contain the pandemic and save lives, but also to protect the most vulnerable in our societies from economic ruin and to sustain economic growth and financial stability,” said Liu Zhenmin, the U.N. undersecretary-general for economic and social affairs.The report said fiscal stimulus packages should prioritize health spending to contain the spread of the virus and should provide income support to households most affected by the pandemic.But the outlook remains gloomy.“A sharp decline in consumer spending in the European Union and the United States will reduce imports of consumer goods from developing countries,” the report said. “In addition, global manufacturing production could contract significantly, amid the possibility of extended disruptions to global supply chains.”It noted that several automobile companies have announced large-scale production suspensions in Europe and the United States and many firms worldwide especially in the auto, consumer electronics and telecommunications industries “are facing shortages of intermediate components as exports from China contracted at an annual pace of 17.2 per cent in the first two months of the year.”“More severe and protracted production disruptions would affect a large number of developing economies that are deeply integrated in global supply networks,” it warned.Developing countries, particularly those dependent on tourism and commodity exports, also face face heightened economic risks, including an increasing likelihood of “debt-distress” for many commodity-dependent economies, it said.The report said the recent collapse in global commodity prices is compounding the bleak fiscal outlook for many of these countries, which haven’t fully recovered from the after-effects of sharp commodity price declines in 2014-2016.The report said the worsening pandemic is increasing deep-seated economic anxiety. “Even in many high-income countries, a significant proportion of the population do not have enough financial wealth to live beyond the national poverty line for three months, causing many to fear for their economic security,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-could-shrink-global-economy-almost-1-in-2020-un-report/story-hVDxf03ST6emhZT7MQrXMJ.html
02-04-2020||World||Canada to organise 6 flights out of India for its citizens stranded due to Covid-19 lockdown||The Canadian government will organise half-a-dozen flights home from India for its citizens and permanent residents who have been stranded due to the 21-day national lockdown . The arrangement came about after discussions between the two governments including between India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Canadian counterpart Francois-Philippe Champagne. There will be six flights: Of these four will depart from Delhi and the other two from Mumbai. The first of these flights will depart on Saturday and the last will leave India on Tuesday.An estimated 25,000 Canadian passport holders and PRs remained in India at the time the lockdown to help curb spread of Covid-19 was imposed and as international flights petered out, there was no opportunity for them to return to Canada.But that changed this week, as Champagne tweeted, “We have facilitated a series of commercial flights from Delhi and Mumbai for Canadian travellers stranded in India to return home.” These flights are not being operated by Air Canada but by a foreign airline. The price for the ticket is also steep, at CA$ 2900 each or nearly Rs 1.5 lakh for the one-way journey.The flights will be via London and those who will be allowed to board them are Canadian citizens, PRs, or their closest relatives like spouses, parents, children or grand-children. Canada continues to impose a ban on the arrival of foreign nationals, which was announced in mid-March by its Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the Covid-19 pandemic gripped the world.All those who return to Canada will have to place themselves into self-isolation for a mandatory period of 14 days.Several persons have petitioned the Canadian government to make these arrangements including Ritu Sihota, a resident of Mississauga in the Greater Toronto Area, who collected more than 15,000 signatures for her effort. In that petition, she wrote, “I am calling on Justin Trudeau to get these stranded Canadian back onto Canadian soil ASAP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-organise-6-flights-out-of-india-for-its-citizens-stuck-due-to-covid-19-lockdown/story-kHxYaJzfR84qOp7Lw0pWWP.html
02-04-2020||World||‘How do we know’: US President Trump casts doubt on Chinese coronavirus figures||President Donald Trump cast doubt Wednesday on the accuracy of official Chinese figures on its coronavirus outbreak after US lawmakers, citing an intelligence report, accused Beijing of a cover up.“How do we know” if they are accurate, Trump asked at a press conference. “Their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side.”Trump insisted that “the relationship with China’s a good one” and that he remained close to President Xi Jinping.However, controversy around Beijing’s transparency has strained ties, adding to bad feelings triggered by a conspiracy theory in China that the US military was to blame for the virus.Republicans in Congress, pointing to a report by Bloomberg citing US intelligence, expressed outrage that Beijing apparently misled the international community on China’s infections and deaths that began in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.China’s reporting has been intentionally incomplete, with some intelligence officials describing Beijing’s numbers as fake, reported Bloomberg, which highlighted the classified intelligence document sent to the White House last week.China has publicly reported 82,361 confirmed cases and 3,316 deaths as of Wednesday, according to a rolling tracker by Johns Hopkins University.That compares to 206,207 cases and 4,542 deaths in the United States, the country with the world’s largest reported outbreak.Republican Senator Ben Sasse attacked Beijing’s numbers as “garbage propaganda.”“The claim that the United States has more coronavirus deaths than China is false,” Sasse said in a statement.“Without commenting on any classified information, this much is painfully obvious: The Chinese Communist Party has lied, is lying, and will continue to lie about coronavirus to protect the regime.”In a statement responding to the report, Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said China is “not a trustworthy partner” in the fight against COVID-19.“They lied to the world about the human-to-human transmission of the virus, silenced doctors and journalists who tried to report the truth, and are now apparently hiding the accurate number of people impacted by this disease,” McCaul said.He and other lawmakers have called on the State Department to launch an investigation into what he called China’s “cover up” of the pandemic.On Tuesday a member of Trump’s coronavirus task force, doctor Deborah Birx, said the medical community saw China’s outbreak as “serious but smaller than anyone expected because I think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-do-we-know-trump-casts-doubt-on-chinese-coronavirus-figures/story-ELFxKSOVxewMsedCkaJt6L.html
02-04-2020||World||Coronavirus Update: COP26 UN climate change conference in Glasgow postponed due to Covid-19||The COP26 UN climate change conference scheduled to take place in Glasgow in November has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic after a decision was taken during a ‘virtual meeting’ on Wednesday evening attended by UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was one of the leaders due to attend the meeting that will now take place in 2021, which will be hosted in Glasgow by the UK in partnership with Italy. The COP26 president-designate is business secretary Alok Sharma.The Scottish government announced this week that the SEC Arena, where COP26 was due to take place, will be turned into a field hospital to cope with coronavirus cases.Sharma said: “The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19. That is why we have decided to reschedule COP26”.“We will continue working tirelessly with our partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis and I look forward to agreeing a new date for the conference”.Espinosa added: “Covid-19 is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, but we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term. Soon, economies will restart”.“This is a chance for nations to recover better, to include the most vulnerable in those plans, and a chance to shape the 21st century economy in ways that are clean, green, healthy, just, safe and more resilient”.Several experts and officials involved with the Paris Agreement endorsed the postponement.Ajay Mathur, director-general of The Energy and Resource Institute, said: “The momentum for climate action has accelerated considerably, and we will have to ensure that this momentum is sustained even as CoP26 is moved to 2021”.“However, this postponement was the right decision - it highlights the centrality of the individual citizens of the world, and of their safety, security, and well-being. We need to keep this centrality in mind as we move to maintain and enhance momentum on climate action, while building a safer, healthier and more resilient global economy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-cop26-un-climate-change-conference-in-glasgow-postponed-due-to-covid-19/story-ghzEnxmAyj1SP4h5XMR53K.html
02-04-2020||World||Coronavirus Update: Will reach 1 mn Covid-19 cases, 50,000 deaths in next few days, says WHO||The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) voiced deep concern on Wednesday about “the rapid escalation and global spread” of COVID-19 cases from the new coronavirus, which has now reached 205 countries and territories.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that his agency, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) backed debt relief to help developing countries cope with the pandemic’s social and economic consequences.“In the past five weeks there has been a near-exponential growth in the number of new cases and the number of deaths has more than doubled in the past week,” Tedros told a virtual news conference in Geneva where the U.N. health organization is based.“In the next few days we will reach 1 million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide,” he said. China, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged in December, reported dwindling new infections on Wednesday and for the first time disclosed the number of asymptomatic cases, which could complicate how trends in the outbreak are read. Its latest figures excluded 130 new sufferers of the highly contagious disease who do not show symptoms, its statistics showed.Asked about the distinction, Dr. Maria ver Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist who was part of an international team who went to China in February, said WHO’s definition included laboratory-confirmed cases “regardless of the development of symptoms”.“From data that we have seen from China in particular, we know that individuals who are identified, who are listed as asymptomatic, about 75 percent of those actually go on to develop symptoms,” she said, describing them as having been in a “pre-symptomatic phase”. The new coronavirus causes the respiratory disease COVID-19.The outbreak continues to be driven by people who show signs of disease including fever and cough, but it is important for the WHO to capture that “full spectrum of illness”, she added.Tedros, referring to proposed debt relief, said: “Many countries, developing countries cannot really support their societies especially during lockdowns, especially those community members who work for their daily bread. That is why we call on the international community to have debt relief to support those countries.“We are proposing an expedited process to support countries so their economies are not getting into crisis, (and) their communities are not getting into crisis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-will-reach-1-mn-covid-19-cases-50-000-deaths-in-next-few-days-says-who/story-4xfD89A0HYA81RbqwkMkHN.html
02-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: Lockdown, emergency measures averted greater epidemic in China, says study||The lockdown of the first Covid-19 pandemic epicentre Wuhan city and the highest emergency response put in place in the rest of China delayed the spread of the outbreak and reduced case numbers by hundreds of thousands by February 19, a new study published this week said.Drawing inferences from statistical and mathematical analyses of human mobility and transmission control measures, the study said “…control measures were strongly associated with the containment of Covid-19, potentially averting hundreds of thousands of cases by February 19, day 50 of the epidemic.”The study published in the academic journal Science on Tuesday was conducted by 22 scientists from China, the US, and the UK.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageTo quantitatively investigate the impact of travel restrictions and social distancing measures on infection spread, according to Chinese state media, the researchers used a unique geocoded repository of data on Covid-19 epidemiology, human movement, and public health intervention in China in an analysis that spanned from December 31, 2019, to February 19, 2020.The epicentre Wuhan was put under a lockdown within that period, on January 23, as China was shutting down for the Chinese New Year (CNY) holidays.Also read: Genetic sequencing takes lead in Covid-19 vaccine development“In summary, this analysis shows that transmission control (non-pharmaceutical) measures initiated during CNY holidays, including the unprecedented Wuhan city travel ban and the Level 1 national emergency response, were strongly associated with, though not necessarily the cause of, a delay in epidemic growth and a reduction in case numbers during the first 50 days of the Covid-19 epidemic in China,” the researchers said.Without the travel ban on Wuhan or the national emergency response, there would have been approximately 744,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases outside Wuhan by February 19, the model suggests.“With the ban alone, there would have been approximately 202,000 cases; and while with the national emergency response alone, the figure would have decreased to roughly 199000,” according to the study.On average, the travel ban delayed the arrival time of Covid-19 in cities by an estimated 2.91 days, according to the study.Also read: Case study of first US community spread patient offers vital Covid-19 cluesCities that implemented a Level 1 response before cases were reported had 33.3% fewer laboratory-confirmed cases during the first week of their outbreaks, the data show.The analysis showed that “…suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings, which were introduced at different times in different places, were associated with the overall containment of the epidemic.”The authors noted the limitations of the study including that the “…number of people who have developed Covid-19 during this epidemic, and therefore the number of people who were protected by control measures, is not known precisely, given that cases were almost certainly under-reported”.“However, in view of the small fraction of people known to have been infected by February 19 (75,532 cases, 5.41 per 100,000 population), it is unlikely that the spread of infection was halted and epidemic growth reversed because the supply of susceptible people had been exhausted,” the researchers inferred.The study adds a note of caution because the number of “susceptibles” in China is far from over.“This implies that a large fraction of the Chinese population remains at risk of Covid-19; control measures may need to be reinstated, in some form, if there is a resurgence of transmission.”The study also puts a question mark on whether the same model can be replicated elsewhere.“Whether the means and the outcomes of control can be replicated outside China, and which of the interventions are most effective, are now under intense investigation as the virus continues to spread worldwide”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-lockdown-emergency-measures-averted-greater-epidemic-in-china-says-study/story-CztCnVJgY1cvRazJidECoO.html
02-04-2020||World||Australian police enforces lockdown for three months||Australia’s most populous state said on Thursday police enforcement of restrictions on personal movement intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus would last three months, as the number of new cases continued to slow.After a federal government order limiting groups of people gathering outside to two, Australian states have instructed their police to issue fines of up to A$11,000 ($6,672) to people who violate the restrictions.In New South Wales, home to nearly a third of Australia’s 25 million population, police have also threatened prison terms of up to six months for people who violate the rules.“When is the turn-off period for these orders? It is 90 days,” state police commissioner Mick Fuller said in a televised news conference.“People will have gotten the message by then, hopefully. And we won’t be talking about the powers, we’ll be talking about what does it look like coming out of this?”Police in NSW and other states have already started issuing tickets to people suspected of breaching orders that the authorities themselves have called “draconian”.Like countries around the world, Australia has ordered the shutdown of restaurants, cafes, bars, movie theatres and instructed people to stay inside unless they are shopping for food or taking their daily exercise as it tries to contain the flu-like illness. So far, about 5,000 people have been infected in Australia, and 22 have died.In NSW, which has about half the country’s coronavirus cases, authorities reported 116 new cases in the past 24 hours, slightly less than the previous day’s increase. Nationwide, health authorities have said the infection rate appears to have slowed in recent days but that it is too early to say definitively.On the other side of the country, a standoff continued on Thursday between immigration officials and foreign-owned cruise ships which were refusing to leave Western Australian waters despite being ordered to do so.Cruise ships are responsible for at least 20% of Australia’s coronavirus cases, and a source of public anger after hundreds of passengers from Carnival Corp’s Ruby Princess were allowed to disembark in Sydney and hundreds later tested positive for COVID-19.In the wake of that incident and amid fears cruise ships were essentially super carriers of the virus, the federal government barred them from docking at Australian port, except in emergencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-police-enforces-lockdown-for-three-months/story-OpjbgBW4nmGso5OX7HgmnL.html
02-04-2020||World||10% global GDP needed to tide over Covid-19 crisis: UN||The Covid-19 crisis is likely to have a profound and negative effect on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change because of which a post-crisis coordination mechanism is vital to ensure that all countries have adequate fiscal space to recover, the March 2020 report of the United Nations stated. Titled ‘Socio-Economic Impact of Covid-19: Shared Responsibility, Global Solidarity’, the report offers suggestions on global responses to tackle the pandemic, which included creating a corpus fund of at least 10% of the global GDP, debt restructuring to help fragile economies, and dismantling sanctions and other trade barriers, especially to allow medicinal and related products. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe cost of remittances - a lifeline in the developing world - should be brought as close to zero as possible, the report stated, adding that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international financial institutions will be critical to this endeavour. Also Read: Genetic sequencing takes lead in Covid-19 vaccine developmentSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by all member states of the UN back in 2015, and aimed at improving the future of countries across several areas, including environment, health care, gender equality, education and sustainable living by 2030. The Paris Agreement signed in 2016, meanwhile, aims to specifically combat climate change. According to the report, the pandemic’s impact on the environment is likely to be positive in the short term as drastic reduction in economic activity has reduced CO2 emissions and pollution in many areas. However, once countries resume economic activity, the report warns of the “significant risk” that nations would be tempted to divert all political capital and limited financial resources away from the implementation of the SDGs. If this were to happen, the negative impact would be felt across sectors, the UN report warned.“A hard truth is that we could have been better prepared for this crisis. The MDGs and the SDGs could have put us on track towards a world with access to universal health coverage and quality health care... Instead… most countries are characterised by weak, fragmented health systems that do not ensure the universal access and capacity needed to face the Covid-19 health crisis,” the report said.MDGs or Millennium Development Goals, set in 2000 to be achieved by 2015, are a set of eight global goals aimed at reducing poverty. Had countries achieved the MDGs or SDGs better, then the health care crisis facing even developed nations like the US, as well as the developing nations of South Asia, would be better equipped to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. However, as it stands, more than 50% of the world’s rural population and over 20% of the urban population lack legal health care coverage, while 2.2 billion people lack access to water depriving people of the most basic and effective prevention measure against the Covid-19 virus, frequent hand-washing, the report stated.Calling for a concerted global effort to tackle the crisis, the UN report offered a host of suggestions to avoid the impending humanitarian crisis after the pandemic has run its course.“This is the moment to dismantle trade barriers, maintain open trade, and re-establish supply chains. Tariff and non-tariff measures as well as export bans, especially those imposed on medicinal and related products, would slow countries’ action to contain the virus. Import taxes or restrictions on medical supplies need to be waived,” it stated. “Sanctions imposed on countries should be waived to ensure access to food, essential supplies and access to Covid-19 tests and medical support. This is the time for solidarity, not exclusion,” the UN report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-global-gdp-needed-to-tide-over-crisis-un/story-i021VH5E6KEB3jEWepOVoL.html
