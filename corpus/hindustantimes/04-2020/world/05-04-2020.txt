New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana states remain the hardest hit, with New York City bearing the brunt of it. Washington DC, Colorado and Pennsylvania are emerging worries, health officials have said. Washington state, which reported the first death in February, and California, which was the first state to issue stay-at-home orders, have kept their numbers low and are being touted as the model for social-distancing for others.The next week will be tough, as US officials has been warning for a while. They have warned of 100,000 to 240,000 fatalities in all despite the social-distancing measures in place, without which deaths could be as high as 2.2 million. And in anticipation of the peak, they stepped up preventive measures to include — as a recommendation, not mandatory — masks or face covering in public, and stepped up procurement of protective gear for health workers such as gowns, masks and gloves.“The next two weeks are extraordinarily important,” said Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. “This is the moment to not be going to the grocery store, not going to the pharmacy, but doing everything you can to keep your family and your friends safe, and that means everybody doing the six-feet distancing, washing their hands.”The grim warning came amidst projections that New York, Louisiana and Detroit in Michigan, the three hotspot regions with the highest incidence of cases, will be hitting their peaks together in six to seven days.New York state had reported 3,565 fatalities till Sunday morning, with 2,624 in New York City along; the total number of cases in the state that continues to be the epicenter of the American coronavirus epidemic, followed by New Jersey with 846, Michigan with 504 and Louisiana with 409 deaths.While the situation remains dire in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo said at his daily briefing on Sunday that over the last few days “the number of deaths has been dropping for the first time”. But he hastened to add it was too early to know what to make of it, though new hospitalizations are also down.The struggle for resources continued, despite Trump administration’s claims to the contrary. New York is still short of ventilators that are needed for several ill Covid-19 patients. “The number of beds doesn’t really matter anymore. We have the beds. It’s the ventilators, and then it’s the staff,” the governor said. He has appealed to other states to send over their supplies and health professionals to help the state at this time, promising to reciprocate when they needed it, in a rolling pattern.Over 66,000 people have died in the pandemic globally and there have been more than1.25 million confirmed cases. It has wreaked havoc on economies around the world, including the richest nations — an estimated 10 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the last two weeks. Developing countries are expected to be hit the hardest. “In three to six weeks, Europe and America will continue in the throes of this — but there is no doubt the center will move to places like Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro and Monrovia,” said Ashish Jha, Director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, to the Washington Post. “We need to be very worried.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-trump-warns-of-toughest-week-with-a-lot-of-death/story-RhhxYbxt4vE69m7PtEiFzH.html

05-04-2020||World||UK Covid-19 death toll likely to be between 7,000 and 20,000: Epidemiologist||A key epidemiologist advising the Boris Johnson government on Sunday reiterated expert modeling that the coronavirus death toll in the United Kingdom is likely to be between 7,000 and 20,000, as latest figures put the figure at 4,313.Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, whose modeling prompted the government to shift strategy from the controversial ‘herd immunity’ to lockdown and other measures, said it is not yet clear when restrictions could be eased. UK hospitals are dealing with 41,093 cases.A special message from Queen Elizabeth was due to be telecast to the UK and the Commonwealth at 8 pm UK time on Sunday (0030 of Monday India time).Ferguson told BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “There is no point, having gone through this effort, in releasing a lockdown at a point where case numbers are still high and will resurge even faster than we have seen before”.“We want case numbers to get to a low point where we can start substituting other measures for the most intrusive and economically costly aspects of the current lockdown,” he said, adding that the death toll could be “anywhere between about 7,000 or so up to a little over 20,000”, he added.According to quotes released before the queen’s message, she is expected to say: “I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time. A time of disruption in the life of our country: a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.”“I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country.”Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader, told Sunday television that “serious mistakes” had been made by the Boris Johnson government while dealing with the pandemic, but had reached an arrangement to receive ministerial briefings and wanted to be constructive.“But asking those difficult questions matters. You can see that when difficult questions were asked on testing things began to move. The same thing with equipment on the frontline; scrutiny is important here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-19-death-toll-likely-to-be-between-7-000-and-20-000-epidemiologist/story-LgmvcGeRtIYo31s5p67W4H.html
05-04-2020||World||Ten of 72 Indian coronavirus patients recover in Singapore||Ten of the 72 Indian nationals infected with the novel coronavirus in Singapore have recovered and the rest are mostly in stable condition, India’s High Commissioner Jawed Ashraf said on Sunday. Over 700 Indian nationals, including over 70 tourists and students, are stranded in the island nation due to non-availability of flights. They are being helped by the high commission with their visa extension and where requested with food and accommodation, the envoy told PTI. “We are working with Singapore’s Manpower and Foreign Affairs Ministries to help Indian nationals in every way,” said Ashraf, who joined Singapore’s Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran, Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad and Member of Parliament Murali Pillai during a visit to an Indian workers dormitory on Saturday. Of the 72 Indian nationals infected by COVID-19, 21 are permanent residents, 28 are on employment passes (and their dependents), 18 are on work passes (of whom 16 are workers living in dormitories) and five are on short term visits to Singapore. Many of these infected Indians had travelled to America and Europe. A few of the workers had visited India before being confirmed as COVID-19 patients, though it is not definite where they were infected, according to Ashraf. The high commissioner has assured the Indian workers that the Singapore Government will look after them, provide medical treatment if they fall sick, and will work with employers to address salary-related issues. Management of dormitories will also try to ensure smooth functioning of remittance services from dormitories. The high commissioner has asked the Indian workers to stay calm and positive and follow all hygiene and social distancing protocol in the dormitories. Those workers affected by the four-week shut down of construction sites and other workplaces, as part of the disinfection and cleaning up of sites and premises hit by COVID-19, are assured of their salaries and welfare by the Singapore authorities. “There is no need to worry and be concerned as the Singapore authorities have assured of all helps and the Indian High Commission is available 24/7 with emergency phone numbers and online services to help,” said Jawed Ashraf. Tens of thousands Indian nationals are working in Singapore’s labour intensive sectors -- construction and shipyards -- some of which are coronavirus clusters after large number of COVID-19 cases were identified there. The livelihood of foreign workers will be taken care of, as Singapore ramps up measures to fight the spread of the coronavirus, said Minister for Communications and Information Iswaran on Saturday. Speaking to reporters after a 30-minute dialogue with foreign workers at a dormitory in Jurong industrial estate, Iswaran said the government’s top concern is their health and well-being, along with that of Singapore residents. “The second thing is that they have concerns around their livelihood, as well as their welfare, and these are things that the Ministry of Manpower is working with other government agencies, as well as the dormitory authorities to address,” The Straits Times quoted Iswaran as saying after visiting foreign workers on Saturday. “We want to assure the workers that we are doing our best to address these concerns and ensure that they are able to navigate this period of closure with some level of peace of mind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ten-of-72-indian-coronavirus-patients-recover-in-singapore/story-kVev68PP6B6DmUdLoITrOP.html

Pope Francis called the pandemic a tragedy on Sunday that must be faced with courage and hope.“Today, in the tragedy of a pandemic, in the face of the many false securities that have now crumbled, in the face of so many hopes betrayed, in the sense of abandonment that weighs upon our hearts, Jesus says to each one of us: ‘Courage, open your heart to my love’,” the pope said.Palm Sunday marks the arrival of Jesus in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. Easter Sunday on April 12 celebrates his resurrection from the dead.But many of the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics are observing the sacred days under home confinement -- just like the 83-year-old pontiff.Pope Francis has been communicating with the outside world by video so that crowds do not gather to see and hear him in one of the world’s most famous squares.Vatican City itself has been closed to tourists for nearly a month as part of global efforts to stop the spread of a disease that has officially killed more than 65,000 people worldwide.The Argentine-born pontiff went on to call on the faithful to overcome their fears and remember that they are not alone.“When we have our back to the wall, when we find ourselves at a dead end, with no light and no way of escape, when it seems that God himself is not responding, we should remember that we are not alone,” the pope said in his prayer.Pope Francis himself went down with a cold in late February and was reportedly tested for COVID-19 twice as a precaution because seven people in the Vatican have caught the virus.The Vatican says the pope is now in good health.Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter a week later on April 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-calls-for-courage-as-he-livestreams-palm-sunday-mass-due-to-coronavirus-tragedy/story-KkC2wu3fDp2shvDwHlzQCM.html
05-04-2020||World||Spain witnesses drop in coronavirus deaths for third day||The rate of the coronavirus outbreak continues to slow in Spain, the country with the second most infections behind the United States.Spain recorded 6,023 confirmed new infections on Sunday, taking the national tally to 130,759. That is down from an increase of 7,026 infections in the previous 24-hour period, confirming the downward tendency of the past week.Confirmed new deaths also dropped to 674 fatalities, taking the national tally to 12,418. That is the first time new deaths have fallen below 800 new fatalities in the past week.As its outbreak loses steam, Spain’s government has started to cautiously consider when it can start to reactivate an economy that has been shut down and put hundreds of thousands out of work.“We are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez told the nation Saturday.But to get there, Sánchez announced that he would ask the Parliament to extend the state of emergency by two more weeks, taking the lockdown on mobility until April 26. He added that a team of experts is also studying how to plan for a gradual loosening of restrictions to reactive the country’s dormant economy and social life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-witnesses-drop-in-coronavirus-deaths-for-third-day/story-ofGxY103GtvNk6XsmtkPsM.html
05-04-2020||World||Donald Trump warns ‘toughest week’ ahead as global coronavirus deaths top 60,000||US President Donald Trump warned Americans to brace for a “very horrendous” number of coronavirus deaths in the coming days, ahead of a rare speech by Queen Elizabeth II on Sunday aimed at rallying hard-hit Britain.Global deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic have soared past 60,000, with Europe continuing to bear the brunt of the virus which has left roughly half the planet confined at home.There are now more than 1.2 million confirmed cases across the globe, and around 65,000 people have died since the virus first emerged in China late last year, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.Trump said the United States was entering “a time that’s going to be very horrendous” with “some really bad numbers.”“This will probably be the toughest week,” he said at the White House. “There will be a lot of death.”At the same time, the president stressed the US -- where infections have surpassed 300,000 -- cannot remain shut down forever.“Mitigation does work but again, we’re not going to destroy our country,” he said. “I’ve said it from the beginning -- the cure cannot be worse than the problem.”Over 45,000 global deaths have been in Europe, with Britain reporting a new daily high in fatalities, taking the overall toll to 4,300 out of nearly 42,000 cases.Queen Elizabeth II is to make a rare, “deeply personal” speech on Sunday to urge people to rise to the challenge posed by the coronavirus, and personally thank frontline healthcare workers.“I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,” she will say, according to extracts released Saturday.The pandemic has hammered the global economy, with businesses hit hard as people are forced to stay indoors to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.Governments have rolled out massive, unprecedented stimulus programs to ease the pain, but economists have warned that the crisis could worsen poverty levels with millions of jobs lost.Poor economies, such as Iraq, are struggling, with charities and volunteers rallying to provide food to the needy.“This is more dangerous than Daesh,” said Iraqi volunteer Mustafa Issa, referring to the Islamic State jihadist group that swept through a third of the country in 2014. Tide turning in Italy? At the Vatican, Pope Francis is expected to livestream his Palm Sunday Mass. St. Peter’s Square is usually packed by Catholic faithful for the occasion, but this year, it will be empty because of coronavirus containment measures.There was, however, some encouraging news from Europe over the weekend.Worst-hit Italy cheered after seeing its number of intensive care virus cases drop for the first time -- from 4,068 on Friday to 3,994 on Saturday.Even some of the most cautious Italian health officials seized on the figures as evidence that the tide may be turning in the deadliest disaster the country has faced since World War II.“This is a very important data point,” said civil protection service chief Angelo Borrelli, adding that it “allows our hospitals to breathe.”The daily rise in new infections across Italy has also slowed. It reported 681 new deaths on Saturday, down from a peak of almost 1,000 just over a week ago.Spain, which is under a near-total lockdown, saw a second successive daily fall in coronavirus-related deaths with 809 fatalities.The total number of deaths in Spain now stands at 11,947, second only to Italy.Although the number of new cases also slowed, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced an extension of the country’s lockdown until April 25.At a field hospital in Madrid set up at a conference centre, staff applauded whenever a patient was healthy enough to be discharged.One of them was 59-year-old builder Eduardo Lopez who gave a “10/10” rating to the staff who cared for him “with tenderness and a great dose of humanity.” ‘We need you’ New York state, the US epicenter, saw a record 630 deaths in a single day and Governor Andrew Cuomo warned the worst was yet to come. The state has recorded a total of 3,565 deaths.Cuomo also cautioned that already strained hospitals were not prepared.New York City appealed for licensed medical personnel to volunteer their services. “Anyone who’s not already in this fight, we need you,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said.Trump said 1,000 military personnel, mostly doctors and nurses, would be deployed to help in the city, which he described as “the hottest of all the hot spots.” U-turn on masks Several Western countries including the US, Germany and France have in recent days encouraged the use of masks in public despite earlier saying that only carers needed to cover their faces.The U-turn has angered and confused some citizens, and spurred a flurry of online tutorials for DIY masks.The advice came after some studies suggested the new coronavirus can be spread through speaking and breathing, not just coughing and sneezing.US authorities said wearing a simple homemade mask or scarf could help stem rocketing infection rates.The World Health Organization is reviewing its guidance but has said it worries that masks could give “a false sense of security,” leading people to be more casual about hand washing and social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-warns-toughest-week-ahead-as-global-coronavirus-deaths-top-60-000/story-ucTROG1PhnXgaAOvV7QZEM.html

The US has so far repatriated around 37,000 Americans stranded overseas due to the pandemic and is planning to bring another 22,000 of its citizens, many of whom are in South Asia, especially India, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Ian Brownlee told reporters during a conference call on Friday.  “We have repatriated roughly 37,000 US citizens from over 60 countries on more than 400 flights. It includes over 20,000 Americans repatriated in the past week alone,” Brownlee said. He said the US State Department has approximately 70 flights scheduled in the coming days which should bring back several thousand more US citizens. “South Asia now has the most US citizens wishing to return. So far the US has brought home almost 1,000 Americans from South Asia and are working aggressively to assist thousands more who have expressed an interest in returning,” Brownlee said. “The total number we’re looking at overseas at this point is about 22,000. The greatest number of those – certainly the plurality of those – are in South and Central Asia, many of them in India,” he added. Brownlee urged Americans to return to their home country as soon as possible. “For the US citizens contemplating whether or not to come home, the time to act is now. Flights will not continue indefinitely, but we want to do all we can to assist you while we are still able to do so,” he said. More than 60,000 people have died from coronavirus since it was first detected late last year in China.With more than three lakh confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and over 8,000 fatalities, the US has emerged as the global epicentre of the deadly coronavirus disease to which there has been no cure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-airlift-22-000-americans-stranded-overseas-many-in-india/story-meOHdTRdIauchDCu2oldHM.html
05-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: Taiwan’s Covid-19 strategy sets an example as total number of cases remain under 400||Coronavirus originated from China’s Wuhan last year. As it began to step away from mainland China, the deadly contagion left behind over 80,000 patients and killed more than 3,000 people in the country. As of today, nearly 1.2 million people are affected by the virus and a whopping 60,000 have been killed. The virus is estimated to account for a record number of patients and deaths in the United States. European nations like Italy, Spain, France and Germany are already reeling. Global bodies like the World Health Organization hailed South Korea for its strategy to contain the virus spread. Another administration which has done laudable work in mitigating the crisis within its territory is Taiwan.Taiwan, although so close to mainland China (just 81 miles off coast), has managed to keep the ugly head of Covid-19 from rising within its territory.  We activated the @Taiwan_CDC’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) back in January, and I visited them today to thank our unsung heroes for their non-stop, #AllHandsOnDeck efforts to contain the #COVID19 outbreak & keep the people of #Taiwan safe. pic.twitter.com/3uGUTxt7LFAccording to a report, as the news of coronavirus’ emergence surfaced in Wuhan last year, officials at Taiwan’s National Health Command Center (NHCC) acted quickly.Stanford expert Jason Wang, who is an associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine, says the outcome is a result of Taiwan using “new technology and a robust pandemic prevention plan put into place at the 2003 SARS outbreak”.Taiwan’s National Health Command Center (NHCC) was set up after the SARS pandemic and became part of its mechanism to tackle large outbreaks. Today I announced three major areas where #Taiwan will contribute to the global fight against #COVID19: 1️⃣: Donating 10 million face masks to countries in need. 2️⃣: Increasing production of quinine. 3️⃣: Sharing our use of technology to trace & investigate outbreaks. pic.twitter.com/F5yxyuF0FcWhile world economies were mulling over what actions to take and when, Taiwan was already responding with a Covid-19 strategy in place. Owing to its proximity to mainland China, it was supposed to be one of the worst-hit regions by coronavirus. Taiwan quickly moved to put travel curbs in place, checking its ports and introducing stringent punishments for violators of quarantine orders. Aggressive testing also helped Taiwan deal with the pandemic efficiently. Taiwanese authorities came into action as soon as the WHO was notified of a pneumonia of unknown cause in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December.In the first week of January itself,  Taiwanese authorities issued a notification for individuals who had travelled to or from Wuhan in the past 14 days and reported fever or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection.Those displaying symptoms were quarantined, tested for over 20 viruses.“Taiwan leveraged its national health insurance database and integrated it with its immigration and customs database to begin the creation of big data for analytics; it generated real-time alerts during a clinical visit based on travel history and clinical symptoms to aid case identification. It also used new technology, including QR code scanning and online reporting of travel history and health symptoms to classify travelers’ infectious risks based on flight origin and travel history in the past 14 days,” Wang says in a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).The administration prepared a list of 124 action items to devise a strategy against coronavirus. After nearly three months into the Covid-19 crisis, Taiwan has reported less than 400 coronavirus cases and witnessed 5 deaths as per the data by Johns Hopkins University. The lessons that world economies can learn from Taiwan’s Covid-19 plan are enormous. Taiwan’s strategy finds its foundation in early recognition of the crisis.With “daily briefings to the public, and simple health messaging, the government was able to reassure the public by delivering timely, accurate, and transparent information regarding the evolving epidemic,” Wang writes in her paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-taiwan-s-covid-19-strategy-sets-an-example-as-total-cases-remain-under-400/story-Ij2IMMhG4aqzXdERg3RAaO.html

The flights cost each adult £681 from Goa, £600 from Mumbai and £581 from Delhi; infants under the age of 2 will travel free.Jan Thompson, acting high commissioner to India, said: “We know how worrying the past few weeks have been for British nationals in India. I hope this announcement will bring relief, especially to those in greatest need”.“Due to the large numbers of British travellers involved, the scale of this operation is huge. The UK Government continues to work hard with our Indian counterparts in New Delhi and London to arrange a safe journey back for as many people as possible”.Officials said the charter flights are for UK travellers who normally reside in the UK and their direct dependants. A number of seats will be reserved for those deemed vulnerable. On Saturday, 113 of the most vulnerable British nationals left Goa on an Irish flight.Foreign Office minister Tariq Ahmad said: “In the absence of commercial flights, these first charter flights from India should provide relief to some of our British travellers who are desperate to return home, especially for the most vulnerable and those in greatest need”.In view of the restrictions on movement in India, Britons travelling to airports from where the charter flights will depart are asked to carry a letter called the ‘British movement letter’ in English (also translated in 9 languages) to show to Indian authorities.It says: “All Indian authorities are hereby requested to provide holders of British passport or resident permits with safe passage, without delay or detention, to their port of departure in India”.“For this purpose all Indian authorities are further requested to exempt holders of British passports or resident permits from any restrictions on public movement or crossing of State or District boundaries currently imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic”.Officials said there are an estimated 35,000 Britons currently in India, of whom over 20,000 are keen to return home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flights-for-over-20-000-britons-stranded-in-india-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-from-april-8/story-YlbM84XemGvvfte4tf3rFP.html

The scientists said Ivermectin is an approved anti-parasitic drug that has also been shown to be effective in vitro against a broad range of viruses including HIV, Dengue, Influenza and Zika virus. However, Wagstaff cautioned that the tests conducted in the study were in vitro and that trials needed to be carried out in people. “Ivermectin is very widely used and seen as a safe drug. We need to figure out now whether the dosage you can use it at in humans will be effective - that’s the next step,” Wagstaff said. “In times when we’re having a global pandemic and there isn’t an approved treatment, if we had a compound that was already available around the world then that might help people sooner,” she said. Although the mechanism by which Ivermectin works on the virus is not known, the scientists said it is likely, based on its action in other viruses, that it works to stop the virus ‘dampening down’ the host cells’ ability to clear it. “As the virologist who was part of the team who were first to isolate and share SARS-COV2 outside of China in January 2020, I am excited about the prospect of Ivermectin being used as a potential drug against COVID-19,” said Leon Caly, study co-author from the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia. The scientists further cautioned that the use of Ivermectin to combat COVID-19 would depend on the results of future pre-clinical testing and ultimately clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anti-parasitic-drug-kills-coronavirus-within-48-hours-in-lab-grown-cells-study/story-GWEikskherACYNEKpGsfCJ.html

The NHS said it would not be giving further information about the five-year-old patient at the request of the family.A 13-year-old boy from London, Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, died last week, days after testing positive for COVID-19. His family said he had no underlying illnesses.Senior minister Michael Gove told a daily briefing that the teenager’s mother and siblings were now showing symptoms.The overall death toll now included seven healthcare professionals, he added.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in self-isolation after developing mild symptoms of the disease, ordered a three-week lockdown of the country on March 23 to try to cut infections.But there has been concern that warmer weather forecast for this weekend could tempt people from their homes to green spaces and public parks.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned against any relaxation in social distancing, saying: “If we do, people will die.”- ‘Things will plateau’ -Imperial College London epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, who is advising the government, told BBC radio on Saturday a peak was expected around the Easter weekend.“We still think things will plateau but we’ll be at quite high levels of infection for weeks and weeks rather than seeing quite a rapid decline as the type seen in China,” he said.But he said that was dependent on people staying at home. If that happened, it could lead to less stringent measures in place “at least by the end of May”, he added.The announcement of another record rise in deaths came after 13 residents at a care home in Glasgow died in one week in a suspected outbreak of coronavirus.The Burlington Court Care Home said those who died had underlying medical conditions and two staff members were being treated for COVID-19.Tests for coronavirus are currently carried out on the most serious cases that require hospital treatment, suggesting the true extent of confirmed cases and deaths is an under-estimate.The government meanwhile announced that up to 4,000 low-risk prisoners near the end of their sentence could be release from jails in England and Wales to try to stop the spread of COVID-19.A total of 88 prisoners and 15 prison staff have tested positive for the virus, and there is concern it could spread rapidly because of shared cells and overcrowding.The justice ministry said those released would be electronically tagged and temporarily released on licence in stages. High-risk offenders will not be considered for early release.The national medical director for NHS England, Stephen Powis, condemned vandals who attacked new 5G mobile phone network masts, after discredited claims it helped spread the virus.Powis called the theory “absolute and utter rubbish” and said he was “absolutely outraged (and) disgusted” that vital infrastructure had been targeted during a national emergency.“The reality is that the mobile phone networks are absolutely critical to all of us, particularly in a time when we’re asking people to stay at home and not to see relatives and friends.“But in particular they are also the phone networks that are used by our emergency services and our health workers,” he added.Later Saturday, news emerged that the British singer and 1960s pop icon Marianne Faithfull had been admitted to hospital suffering from the virus.“She is stable and responding to treatment,” music industry publicists Republic Media tweeted.“We wish her well and a full and speedy recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/child-aged-five-among-new-uk-coronavirus-victims/story-4L2YaadY5kjImpmxrgcvbM.html

These antibodies could help patients in an acute stage of the disease to fight the virus.”The trials will involve 60 patients in Paris hospitals, half of whom will receive the plasma from the persons who have recovered.It said the first results could be known two to three weeks after the trials,The US Food and Drug Administration has alrady authorised physicians to experiment with the strategy to fight the coronavirus.

05-04-2020||World||Queen Elizabeth II to praise coronavirus response in address to Britain||Queen Elizabeth II will urge people to rise to the challenge posed by the coronavirus outbreak, in a rare special address to Britain and Commonwealth nations on Sunday.In extracts released Saturday of what royal officials said was a “deeply personal” speech, the 93-year-old monarch will say she has faith that people will respond, despite the difficulties.The broadcast, scheduled to air at 1900 GMT on Sunday, is only the fourth time in her 68-year reign that she has made a special televised address outside her annual Christmas Day message.It comes as daily deaths in Britain hit a record high of 708, including a five-year-old child on Saturday, taking the overall toll to 4,313 -- and as the country prepared for a third week of lockdown.According to Buckingham Palace, the queen will personally thank frontline healthcare staff and other key workers for their efforts during the crisis.“I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time,” she will say in the speech, which was recorded at Windsor Castle, west of London.“A time of disruption in the life of our country: a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has tested positive for COVID-19, has put his government on a war footing, calling for a collective response to the outbreak.Some 750,000 people responded to his call for volunteers to support the state-run National Health Service (NHS), the elderly and vulnerable currently in self-isolation.The initial appeal was for 250,000, while business and industry have been mobilised in a way unseen since World War II.The queen will say: “I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge.“And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.“That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country.” The queen and her 98-year-old husband Prince Philip moved to Windsor Castle on March 19 as a precaution because of their age, which puts them in a high-risk category.Royal officials have said the couple were in good health and following government guidelines.Her eldest son and heir Prince Charles, 71, has been in self-isolation on her sprawling Balmoral estate in northeast Scotland after developing mild symptoms of COVID-19.As a precaution, he officially opened by videolink a new 4,000-bed field hospital in east London which will treat the most seriously ill patients on Thursday.The royal family has cut its engagements, and Sunday’s speech was recorded by a single camera operator wearing personal protective equipment, royal officials said.Specific advice from royal doctors was sought to mitigate any risk to the queen and others, they added.The queen’s intervention is her first at troubled times since the death of her mother in 2002. Before that, she addressed the nation on the eve of Diana, princess of Wales’ funeral in 1997.She also broadcast a message in 1991 during the first Gulf War.A fourth message in 2012 was to thank the public after celebrations for her Diamond Jubilee, marking the 60th anniversary of her accession to the throne.(AFP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-ii-to-praise-coronavirus-response-in-address-to-britain/story-YXWfvldEM62XvMBKFWR8OI.html
05-04-2020||World||‘There’ll be a lot of death’: Trump tells US as Covid-19 cases surge||President Donald Trump said Saturday that the United States was heading into what could be its “toughest” weeks as coronavirus cases swell nationwide. He warned states not to inflate their needs for critical medical equipment.“There will be a lot of death, unfortunately. There will be death,” Trump said in a somber start to his daily briefing on the pandemic.Trump was joined by Vice President Mike Pence, virus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US government’s foremost infection disease expert. Each stood far apart from one another on the small stage.Trump said the goal was to stay several days ahead of critical medical needs in each state. But he also suggested that states were asking for more medical supplies than they really needed.“The fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests,” Trump said.Louisiana officials have said New Orleans is on track to run out of ventilators by next week. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., whose state is at the epicenter of the national pandemic with over 113,700 confirmed cases as of Saturday morning, has pleaded for ventilators for days and lambasted what he has said is insufficient help from the federal government. New York is poised to get more than 1,100 ventilators from China and Oregon.Trump also revisited a familiar message, saying he wants to get the economy up and running as soon as possible. At one point during the unfolding outbreak, Trump said he had hoped to open up businesses by Easter, April 12. He later acknowledged that was not possible, ceding the month of April after seeing rising death toll projections.“We have to vanquish the virus as quickly as we can. ... We have to get back to work,” he said.The number of people infected in the US has exceeded a quarter-million, with the death toll climbing past 7,000; more than 3,500 of those deaths are in New York.Much of the country is under orders to stay home, including professional sports leagues that were among the first to clamp down in the pandemic.Trump on Saturday spoke with commissioners of the country’s sports leagues. He said he told them that he recognizes “the good work being done by many teams and players” to care for their communities and fan bases dealing with the outbreak.The virus has decimated the sports world with the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League suspending their seasons indefinitely and Major League Baseball postponing the start of its season.The NCAA basketball tournament was also canceled, as were college spring sports such as baseball and softball, lacrosse and track and field.A wide range of sports leaders participated in the call, including Roger Goodell of the National Football League and the NBA’s Adam Silver. Trump called on them to continue efforts to support their fellow Americans.Before the briefing, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized the decision by Trump to nominate “one of his own lawyers,” as an inspector general overseeing federal aid during the coronavirus recovery.She said the watchdog monitoring “this historic relief package for workers and families must be independent from politics.”Trump appointed Brian Miller to the Treasury Department watchdog post. He currently serves as a special assistant to the president and as senior associate counsel in the White House.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is overseeing the government package that aims to shovel $2.2 trillion into theUS economy over the next few weeks to try to cushion the free fall. The assistance includes $349 billion in loans for small businesses and a $500 billion corporate rescue fund.The legislation signed by Trump last week created the special inspector general position as well as a panel appointed by Congress to monitor how the aid is deployed.Pelosi said Trump is disregarding provisions in the act that would hold the administration accountable. She said a new House committee on the virus response would work to ensure “taxpayer dollars are being used wisely and efficiently to help workers and not to be exploited by profiteers and price-gougers.”For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/there-ll-be-a-lot-of-death-trump-tells-us-as-covid-19-cases-surge/story-ZDKuW8OmJkonz8EvtmSHkI.html

Boeing, which is looking at a substantial assistance package, has already opposed it saying it will explore other options. if forced to part with equity.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe administration is actively weighing, acquiring stake in borrowing companies, the big ones, as compensation. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Thursday it was under discussion now in the context of relief for the airlines industry and “I’ll be working very closely with the President, and we’ll make sure that we strike the right balance. This “not a bailout” and taxpayers should “get compensated”, he added.The Trump administration is eager to ensure the terms of the relief package — called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and. Economic Security Act (CARES Act) — were not as lenient as assistance put together by the Obama administration after the 2008 financial crisis, which has been used by some of the borrowing companies to buy back their own stock to boost them on the exchange and to make hefty payments to top executives.“We don’t let them buy back the stock; we don’t let that happen,” President Trump had said, when signing the legislation into law. “(with) tough limits on executive compensation.”The 42.2 trillion package included $300 billion in direct payment to American families; $350 in job retention loans to small business; $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits; $500 billion in loans for industries hit hard by the virus; and $100 billion for healthcare workers.The coronavirus outbreak shut down large parts of the country, forcing many businesses to close to lay off workers to survive. Airlines and related sectors are the worst hit, along with small businesses (those employing 500 workers or less). Unemployment has shot up with a record 6.6 million filing for benefits last week, in addition to the 3.3 million the week before.The amount set aside for industries is a mix of grants and loans and it has been earmarked for airlines, cargo carriers and those deemed essential for national security. Boeing falls in the third category and is looking at $17 billion along with others.The treasury department announced a set of conditions last week for disbursing loans to these industries. Borrowers are prohibited from buying back their stocks, or of their parent companies, until 12 months from the date when the loan is no longer outstanding.Borrowers are also banned from paying “dividends or make other capital distributions with respect to the common stock of the borrower” for after the same waiting period of 12 months.The borrowing company must also “maintain its employment levels as of March 24, 2020, to the extent practicable, and in any case will not reduce its employment levels by more than 10 percent from the levels on such date”.And, of course, the borrower must be an American company with “significant operations in and a majority of its employees based in the United States”.There is no indication in the treasury department announcement of “Procedures and Minimum Requirements” of the government acquiring a stake in the borrowing company. As Mnuchin said at a White House briefing earlier this week, the matter is still being considered, and he did not rule it out.Boeing has opposed it publicly and repeatedly. “I don’t have a need for an equity stake,” Boeing co-CEO Dave Calhoun told Fox Business just days before Trump signed the relief legislation into law. “If they force it, we just look at all the other options and we’ve got plenty of them.” He had then added the company was looking at borrowing from the government and had every intention of repaying the whole amount, with interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-us-companies-wait-for-clarity-on-covid-19-aid-package/story-jkg893kNwqKEdgg0BN9FkI.html
05-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: US beats its own grim record, Covid-19 death toll touches 1,480 in 24 hours||US authorities on Friday announced “voluntary” use of face masks in public as the number of fatalities went up to more than 7,100 with 1,480 in the last 24 hours.The total of confirmed cases rose by 30,000 over the same period of time to go past the quarter million mark. America ended the day, as a result, with 278,000 confirmed cases and 7,141 fatalities, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker Saturday.Washington DC, the national capital, has emerged as an area of “developing concern” along with the states of Colorado and Pennsylvania and the cities of Chicago in Illinois and Detroit in Michigan based on new cases and deaths, according to the White House coronavirus task force. New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, Connecticut continue to report high incidence.New York state remains the worst hit with 103,000 cases, a tenth of the world total of 1 million cases, and 2,935 deaths. New York City, which alone accounted for 1,867 deaths, is faced with an additional crisis of the shortage of medical supplies, and officials have warned of empty racks by this weekend.Washington state, where the first reported coronavirus death in America was announced on February 29, and California have been able to slow the spread belying early fears, and are beginning to be cited on how to beat the deadly pathogen with rigorous and disciplined social distancing.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), whose social-distancing guidelines have served as the template for the shutdown of all but a handful of US states, recommended Friday Americans should wear masks in public, as announced by President Donald Trump at the daily brief of the White House coronavirus task force, citing studies that show the “transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood”.“In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure,” the president said, and added, infusing the new recommendation with his characteristic scepticism about the virus., “So it’s voluntary; you don’t have to do it. They suggested for a period of time. But this is voluntary.” And, he added, severely undermining the credibility of the move, “I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.”President Trump’s reservations about the new recommendation are representative of his overall response to the outbreak from the start when he first sought to dismiss it as a hoax and then, as cases and bodybags piled up, portray it as a transient crisis. It proved to be neither and cost the country precious response time, according to his critics.Pressed for his reasons for his personal aversion to the mask, the president said, “I just don’t want to be doing -- I don’t know, somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk -- the great Resolute Desk -- I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don’t know. Somehow, I don’t see it for myself. I just -- I just don’t.”The president also addressed questions impact of the epidemic on the general election on November 3, when he will up up re-election. Asked if they be held as scheduled, he said, “The general election will happen on November 3.” But he dismissed suggestions of switching to mail-in voting in case social-distancing guidelines were still in place — “lot of people cheat with mail-in voting”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-us-beats-its-own-grim-record-covid-19-death-toll-touches-1-480-in-24-hours/story-KocA3U8Hp6FNjuo6Rwa10L.html
