These claims are fact-distorting and irresponsible.”Ji noted that the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in China’s central Hubei province detected cases of unknown pneumonia in late December 2019, and the Wuhan municipal health commission issued an urgent notification to medical institutions to appropriately treat patients.On January 7, Chinese President Xi Jinping issued instructions on an epidemic response while chairing a meeting of the standing committee of the political bureau of the central committee of the Communist Party of China, and on January 23, China took “unprecedented, decisive and strong measures” to shut down Wuhan’s outbound channels, she said.“During the fight against the epidemic, the Chinese government has always maintained an open and transparent attitude on timely releasing and sharing of epidemic information,” Ji said.Since January 3, China has regularly informed the World Health Organization (WHO) and other countries, including the US, about the outbreak. It has also held daily press conferences since January 27, she said.“Virus knows no national borders, and the epidemic distinguishes no races. Only with solidarity and by cooperation, can the international community prevail over the pandemic…At present, the Indian people are fighting against the epidemic under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. China will stand together with India to jointly overcome the epidemic at an early date,” Ji said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rejects-reports-that-first-covid-19-case-occurred-in-november/story-NLhfyzHKgnyQ38YMGkZceK.html
13-04-2020||World||Trump declares he has power to ‘open up’ states, not governors||President Donald Trump declared Monday that he has the power to “open up” states and relax social-distancing practices adopted to combat the coronavirus outbreak, not governors.He didn’t elaborate on how he reached his conclusion. The Trump administration issued guidance March 16 recommending Americans isolate themselves from one another to curb the spread of the virus, days after many governors, municipal leaders, businesses and families had already adopted the practices themselves.It isn’t clear if the country would comply should Trump demand people return to work and school, particularly if the outbreak hasn’t yet abated.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“It is the decision of the president, for many good reasons,” Trump said in a subsequent tweet. He didn’t list any.Trump said he would make a decision “soon” on re-opening, “in conjunction with the governors and input from others.” He said last week he plans to name a panel of doctors and business people on Tuesday to advise him on restoring the U.S. economy following the outbreak.But the president’s relationship with governors during the outbreak has been complicated and oftentimes prickly. He has insisted that governors, not the federal government, bear primary responsibility for keeping their hospitals supplied and staving off the coronavirus. And he’s declined to criticize governors who have refused to issue “stay-at-home” orders to their citizens to curb the spread of the virus.“We have a thing called the Constitution, which I cherish, number one,” Trump said on April 4, when asked about the holdout governors, who are all Republicans. “Number two, those governors -- I know every one of them -- they’re doing a great job. They’re being very, very successful in what they’re doing. And as you know, I want the governors to be running things.”Governors have complained they’ve been forced to bid against the Federal Emergency Management Agency for supplies, and Democratic governors who have faulted the federal government’s response to the outbreak have suffered Trump’s wrath, enduring personal insults and criticism on Twitter and in his daily news conferences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-declares-he-has-power-to-open-up-states-not-governors/story-HEP5PBCwPPFfVo4CqQuruK.html
13-04-2020||World||After over 11,000 deaths, UK not yet past peak||The death toll in the United Kingdom rose by 717 to 11,329 on Monday, but foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the country is “not yet past the peak” of the coronavirus pandemic, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson tested negative after a week-long hospital stay.The number of cases in hospitals also rose to 88,621. The death figures relate only to those in hospitals and do not include those in retirement villages, care homes and hospices; together, the overall figure is expected to be higher than 11,329.Raab and senior health officials said at the daily Downing Street briefing that the government plan including social distancing “is working”, but they expect the figure to rise for one more week, before the graph flattening and then coming down.Johnson, who is recuperating in the prime minster’s country residence of Chequers in Buckinghamshire, tested negative for coronavirus, officials said, but is not yet engaging with official work, which has been delegated to Raab.Raab said the death figure was ‘grizzly’ but did not expect any changes to be made to current lockdown measures until officials can be confident of improvement reflected in data and conditions. Despite the bright warm weather, he wanted Britons to stay at home.“If we let up now the virus will only take advantage, spread faster and kill more people. Our plan is working. Please stick with it and we will get through this crisis together. We are still going through the peak stage,” Raab said.Ministers continued to face criticism over lack of person protection equipment in various hospitals, as the number of health professionals succumbing to the virus grows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-over-11-000-deaths-uk-not-yet-past-peak/story-km8K0aYARqBECaoqZ7lD8L.html
13-04-2020||World||Donald Trump’s oil deal: The inside story of how the price war ended||After a week-long marathon of calls between world leaders and video conferences featuring dozens of energy ministers, it was the moment the 2020 oil price war finally ended.From Villahermosa, a city near Mexico’s largest crude terminal, Energy Minister Rocio Nahle raised her voice. “Your Royal Highness, Mexico has already agreed. And now I would like to ask you: ‘Do you agree with these terms?’”In Riyadh, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman nearly chuckled as he looked at a wall of video feeds showing his counterparts around the world. “I go with the consensus. I agree,” he replied.At that moment, the OPEC+ alliance sealed the largest ever coordinated production cut, removing about a 10th of global supply. The historic deal had almost been derailed by a fight between Saudi Arabia and Mexico’s populist government, forcing President Donald Trump to step in and broker a face-saving solution.Prince Abdulaziz declared himself sleepless and exhausted, but triumphant nonetheless.“We have demonstrated that OPEC+ is up, running, and alive,” he told Bloomberg News in an interview minutes after he clinched the agreement. “I’m more than happy.”For the past month, Saudi Arabia had pumped every possible barrel for sale at rock-bottom prices, punishing Russia for refusing to support deeper OPEC+ output cuts in early March. Now, Moscow and Riyadh will both reduce daily production by millions of barrels, spearheading a global agreement between almost all the world’s major oil producers to rein in output.But the deal will only dull the pain, not end the crisis.The market is likely to remain overwhelmed for months to come by the catastrophic collapse in demand caused by the lockdowns designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus through some of the world’s biggest economies.“The OPEC+ agreement will not prevent sharp inventory builds in coming months, and near-term oil prices in the physical market will likely remain under pressure,” said Martijn Rats, oil analyst at Morgan Stanley.Negative ReactionThe deal between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will remove nearly 10 million barrels a day from the market through deliberate cuts. In addition, the group is counting involuntary declines in the production of the U.S., Canada, Brazil and several other countries, as companies reduce drilling activity due to low prices and weak demand.OPEC+ officials, using some creative accounting that also includes output drops in Venezuela, Iran and Libya, which are exempt from making cuts, said that as much as 20 million barrels a day will over time leave the market -- 20% of global productionFor the time being, the world will need to be content with the 10 million barrels a day from OPEC+. Yet demand is down by about twice that amount, meaning the world’s oil tanks will keep filling day after day as long as planes stay grounded, businesses shuttered and billions of people remain at home.Oil traders don’t seem optimistic. By 9 a.m. in London, prices had slipped into negative territory, falling as much as 2.7% to $30.63 a barrel.Deal MakerThe biggest winner appears to be Trump, who refused to deliberately cut American oil production, but was still able to broker the final deal. His phone call with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, followed by a three-way conference call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, came up with the proposal that resolved the Latin American nation’s objections to the agreement.Trump has taken time away from grappling with the world’s largest coronavirus outbreak and waded into oil politics with a surprising goal. He’s gone from welcoming the crude price collapse to worrying about losing the American energy industry. Fearing that job losses in Texas and other oil-rich states could hurt his re-election prospects, he convinced Putin and the Saudi monarch to end hostilities and make a compromise.“Trump views himself as a deal maker,” said Joe McMonigle, an energy consultant and former U.S. government oil official. So “Trump went to the oil market’s red phone.”The president sealed the historic deal by offering the Saudis something that exists only on paper. When Mexico refused a big output reduction, putting the whole agreement in danger, Trump assured OPEC+ that the U.S. would cut its own production on its neighbor’s behalf.Mexico would remove 100,000 barrels a day, and the U.S. would contribute an additional 300,000 barrels a day, Trump said at the White House. OPEC+ officials and others involved in the talks said those extra barrels simply didn’t exist. The decline in American production would be driven by prices, demand, and capacity in pipelines or tanks, not presidential press conferences.But ultimately his offer was enough.Price WarSunday’s agreement ended a period in which the OPEC+ alliance appeared to be dead, with former partners engaged in oil-trade warfare.It all started on March 6, when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak walked out of OPEC’s headquarters in Vienna and told reporters that his country was ready to increase oil production in April. He had just rebuffed Saudi Arabia’s push for his country to cut output by a few hundred thousand barrels a day, to help counter what most saw as a modest demand slowdown due to the coronavirus. In return, the kingdom had rejected his proposal to continue the group’s existing curbs at their current level.Angered by Russia’s refusal to cut and Novak’s talk of higher production, Saudi Arabia embarked on a shock-and-awe price war. Riyadh offered oil refiners unprecedented discounts for its crude, cutting its official selling prices by the most in more than 30 years. The kingdom also announced it was boosting production to an all-time high above 12 million barrels a day for April, up 25% from February.When the market opened a few hours later, even the most bearish traders were shocked. The Sunday evening session is typically a sedate affair, mostly covered by traders in Asia, where it’s already Monday morning. But that night, every trader from Geneva to London and Houston was glued to their screens.When the selling started, benchmark Brent crude plunged more than 30% in seconds -- the biggest one-day drop since the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War.Month of ChaosWhat followed was the most chaotic month in the oil market’s history, threatening the stability of the petroleum-dependent nations from Nigeria to Iraq and upending the business plans of industry giants like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Without fully realizing it, the Saudis had started a price war at the worst possible time. By early March, the coronavirus outbreak had spread well beyond Wuhan, infecting thousands of people from Iran to the U.S. Around the world, governments copied the lockdowns that China had already tried and tested. Country after country put their economies into deep freeze.With demand for jet fuel, gasoline and diesel sharply down, refineries cut production and reduced their crude purchases. The physical oil market started to resemble a closing-down sale. In one obscure corner of the U.S., oil even traded at negative prices, with producers paying consumers to take away their barrels.Brent crude, the North Sea blend used as a global benchmark, had briefly traded above $70 a barrel at the start of the year. On March 30, it plunged to $21.65, the lowest in nearly two decades.The most prominent victim was the U.S. shale industry. Drillers in Texas and other states had turned America into the world’s largest oil producer, creating millions of jobs. But fracking is an expensive way to pump crude and the industry had piled up tens of billions of dollars in debt.As prices tumbled, roughnecks, truck divers and engineers quickly lost their jobs. Whiting Petroleum Corp., once North Dakota’s biggest producer, filed for bankruptcy on April 1.Saudi SurgeAs Whiting was going bust, thousands of miles in Saudi Arabia engineers at Aramco were busy pushing their oil wells to the limit.At at exactly 11.29 a.m. on March 31, the giant video wall at the company’s operational nerve center flashed total production surpassing 12 million barrels a day for the first time in history. Employees celebrated by snapping pictures, arms raised in triumph, according to photographs seen by Bloomberg News.The next day Saudi output crept higher, reaching 12.111 million, then 12.171 million, according to other photographs of the control room. Finally, it hit a record of 12.323 million barrels a day -- enough to meet the combined pre-pandemic consumption of Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Spain and Italy and still have some barrels to spare.The oil was being loaded onto an armada of tankers in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, heading for markets that were already drowning in crude.‘Wiped Out’It was an untenable situation, threatening to fill the world’s oil tanks within a few months and send prices crashing to levels not seen since the 1990s. Trump was already putting pressure on Russia and Saudi Arabia to rebuild their alliance.“I never thought I’d be saying that maybe we have to have an oil increase, because we do. The price is so low,” Trump said in a Fox News interview. The president, who had made a political career bashing OPEC and advocating for low gasoline prices, was worried the U.S. industry would be “wiped out”.Saudi Arabia and Russian blamed each other for the crash. Putin accused Saudi Arabia of trying to destroy shale; the Saudis said Moscow had kicked the whole thing off. None of it cut any ice in Washington.“You are waging economic warfare on Texas,” Senator Ted Cruz told the Saudi ambassador in Washington in a private conference call.Recalling the conversation in a media interview afterward, Cruz said: “Their response is, ‘But Russia. But Russia.’ And I said, ‘But Russia garbage. Russia is our enemy, we know it. They behave like it and we treat them like it. You’re supposed to be our friend. And so don’t screw with us.”By then, both Saudi Arabia and Russia had little choice but to start talking. With consumption in free fall, it was only a question of time before they were forced to cut output, simply because there would be nowhere to put the oil.“We see a huge oversupply in the oil market,” said Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency.Trump TweetTrump spoke to both Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, commonly known as MBS, proposing a global deal to cut production. He couldn’t help boasting about the talks before the deal was in place, announcing in a tweet on April 2 that he hoped Riyadh and Moscow would cut output by 10 million barrels a day, if not more.Brent crude jumped more than 45% in just a few seconds, crushing many bearish investors. Even when the market closed hours later, the benchmark was still up 21% -- the largest one-day increase ever.Unsurprisingly for a deal that includes dozens of countries in the OPEC+ coalition and the G-20, the final deal is a fudge. Saudi Arabia’s production will only be 1.2 million barrels a day lower than its average level before the price war. Mexico won special treatment and America’s cuts are just an estimate based on forecasts for drilling.The trajectory of oil prices will be more dependent on how fast the world leaves lockdown and the pace of the economic rebound. Yet the deal’s significance goes beyond numbers.There has been a tectonic shift in global oil politics. Putin, MBS and Trump, the leaders of the the world’s three largest producers, are dictating global petroleum supply. And America now accepts that low prices aren’t in its interest.“Trump, who has been a critic of OPEC for years, is the one who put it together,” said Daniel Yergin, the oil historian. “Of all the deals he’s done in his life, this has to be the biggest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-oil-deal-the-inside-story-of-how-the-price-war-ended/story-gPNQw4GUUnGvUTcKgSS6lN.html
13-04-2020||World||Pakistan ‘sleep walking’ into virus disaster, says opposition leader||Pakistan risks “sleep walking” into a coronavirus catastrophe where death tolls reach levels seen in the West and perilously under-resourced hospitals are pushed to the brink, an opposition leader told AFP on Monday.Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of Pakistan’s first female leader Benazir Bhutto, said the country’s response to the pandemic so far had been characterised by federal foot-dragging over a comprehensive lockdown and an unwillingness to divert cash to the buckling health care system.Pakistan so far has recorded 93 deaths from a total of 5,230 cases, but experts worry the impoverished country of 215 million people -- many of whom live in cramped, multi-generational households -- is only at the start of the coronavirus curve.“There is definitely a false sense of security that we’ve seen from the start of this crisis,” Bhutto said in a video call from his Karachi office.“We have seen a desire to ignore science and facts and the examples of what has been happening around us internationally, which has hampered us taking the timely and necessary action.”Prime Minister Imran Khan has faced particular criticism after saying Pakistan could not afford a country-wide lockdown, citing the economic damage that would be unleashed.Pakistan now has a de facto lockdown after provinces acted independently to shutter schools and companies, but officials are under pressure to loosen restrictions as the economy suffers. Pakistan’s first COVID-19 cases were reported in the southern province of Sindh, governed by Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), with officials there ordering a lockdown last month.Bhutto said provincial health advisors, academics and experts had recommended tougher measures across Pakistan.“We can bring the economy back to life, but we cannot bring people back to life,” he said.“If we just hope for the best and don’t prepare for the worst... then Pakistan is sleep walking into a disastrous situation and I genuinely fear for the consequences.” Bhutto said the situation in Pakistan could be worse than the US or western Europe given the country’s shortage of protective gear for medical staff, a lack of critical care beds and other problems with the underfunded health care system.The PPP was founded by Bhutto’s grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. His mother Benazir became prime minister twice and was running a third time when she was killed in a gun and bomb attack on December 27, 2007.For years Bhutto, 31, faced harsh criticism for his spotty grasp of the Urdu language and was lambasted for benefiting from dynastic politics. But he has become one of the opposition’s most recognisable faces -- known for his cool demeanour and lack of vitriol in what is traditionally a bare-knuckle political scene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-sleep-walking-into-virus-disaster-says-opposition-leader/story-HwLuqCyffLHfsghkbb6NtM.html
13-04-2020||World||US coronavirus outbreak could peak this week, CDC director says||The coronavirus outbreak could reach its peak in the United States this week, a top US health official said on Monday, pointing to signs of stabilization across the country.The United States, with the world’s third-largest population, has recorded more fatalities from COVID-19 than any other country, more than 22,000 as of Monday morning according to a Reuters tally.About 2,000 deaths were reported for each of the last four days in a row, the largest number of them in and around New York City. Experts say official statistics have understated the actual number of people who have succumbed to the respiratory disease, having excluded coronavirus-related deaths at home. “We are nearing the peak right now,” Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told NBC’s “Today” show. “You’ll know when you’re at the peak when the next day is actually less than the day before.”Sweeping stay-at-home restrictions to curb the spread of the disease, in place for weeks in many areas of the country, have taken a painful toll on the economy, raising questions over how the country can sustain business closures and travel curbs.On Sunday, a Trump administration official indicated May 1 as a potential date for easing the restrictions while cautioning that it was still too early to say whether that goal would be met.Redfield refused to give a time frame for the re-opening of the US economy and praised social-distancing measures that he said helped curb the mortality rate.“There’s no doubt we have to reopen correctly,” Redfield said. “It’s going to be a step-by-step gradual process. It’s got to be data-driven.”Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives, cautioned that the country was not prepared to end the shutdown.“We all desire an end to the shutdown orders so we can get Americans back to work and back to normal,” Pelosi said in a statement. “However, there is still not enough testing available to realistically allow that to happen.”This week Congress will work on further measures to soften the blow of the pandemic. Democrats want to add money for other anti-coronavirus efforts to a measure targeted at small businesses, including funding for rapid national testing and personal protective equipment.“It cannot wait,” Pelosi said.President Donald Trump retweeted a call to fire Dr. Anthony Fauci after the country’s top expert on infectious diseases said lives could have been saved if the country had shut down sooner during the novel coronavirus outbreak.The retweet fueled speculation Trump was running out of patience with the popular scientist and could fire him. The White House on Monday did not comment on Trump’s retweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/u-s-coronavirus-outbreak-could-peak-this-week-cdc-director-says/story-xvmtsgN4AQXG6aSioYbrhK.html

The YWCA of Northern New Jersey said domestic violence calls have risen by up to 24%.In Spain, calls to a helpline for victims of violence increased by 12.4% in the first two weeks of the lockdown compared to the same fortnight last year. Online consultations of the helpline’s website grew by 270%, the Equality Ministry said.Gun control advocates in the United States, where gun stores have been allowed to remain open, have said they feared increased ownership of firearms during the pandemic could lead to more domestic violence.In Italy, support groups said they were concerned that a sharp fall in official reports of domestic violence was a signal that women risked being even more exposed to control and aggression by a partner because victims have more difficulty communicating during a lockdown.Because of restrictions against gatherings, all of Francis’ Holy Week services that culminated on Easter Sunday were held without public participation in either St. Peter’s Basilica or St. Peter’s Square.Nearly 19,500 people have died of the coronavirus as of Sunday in Italy, the second-highest toll behind the United States.Francis said he was praying for all countries affected by the pandemic but particularly for those with many victims, mentioning the United States, Italy, Spain and France before stopping himself, saying “the list is long”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protect-women-from-domestic-violence-during-coronavirus-lockdowns-pope/story-R9nQf7DbahTSKzcMF0i7NP.html

Mirza is Pakistan’s focal person in the country’s national efforts to fight the Convid-19 pandemic.While hearing a suo motu case related to the situation arising out of the coronavirus crisis, the court expressed anger over the performance of Mirza in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and ordered the federal government to remove him.A five-member bench of the apex court — headed by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed — was hearing the case.During the hearing, the chief justice, while expressing anger, said the top court is not satisfied with the performance of Zafar Mirza as health advisor.In the meantime, the centre and provinces in Pakistan continue to bicker over how best to tackle the pandemic. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Monday said that he will request Prime Minister Imran Khan to extend the lockdown to limit the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The chief minister reiterated while speaking to the media, that the only way to defeat the virus is through the combined efforts of the provincial and federal governments. Murad, however, expressed disappointment in the federal government’s earlier remarks of, “provinces can do whatever they want”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-supreme-court-orders-removal-of-health-advisor-to-pm-over-covid-19/story-YJedMvX9RzvypWNcauKJ1K.html
13-04-2020||World||Covid-19 vs UK: £7 billion at risk if Indian, other students stay away||Less than two months ago in February end, British education and other officials were hailing the spike in the number of UK student visas issued to Indians, but now despair that many will not arrive, come September, putting billions of pounds in income at risk.Unions and university officials have sought a rescue package from the Boris Johnson government to ensure the survival of centres of higher education; some were facing major financial challenges before the coronavirus hit the sector.According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, nearly 270,000 international students were expected to start courses in UK universities this autumn, but recent reports from China – the largest non-EU group among international students – say many will stay away. There are similar indications from India,The fee income from international students was nearly £7 billion last year.The number of student visas granted to Indians in the year ending 2019 had almost doubled from the previous year (up 93 per cent to 37,540), the Home Office announced on February 27, spreading cheer among stake-holders.As the Home Office analysis said, “This was the largest number of grants to Indian students since the year ending September 2011”. There was a major drop of Indian students since 2012, when the post-study work visa was scrapped (it has now been revived).Indian and other international students typically pay at least three times the fees applicable to home and EU students, besides contributing to the British economy in accommodation, maintenance and travel costs.Universities UK, the umbrella organisation representing UK universities, says that in the current financial year (2019-20) the sector is facing losses of £790 million from accommodation, catering and conference income as well as additional spend to support students learning online.“In the next financial year (2020-21) the potential impact is extreme, with universities projecting a significant fall in international students and a potential rise in undergraduate home student deferrals”, it said in a paper sent to the Johnson government.Some universities have begun terminating short-term contracts of lecturers and researchers. The loss of income from international students is crucial to the sustenance of departments and academic jobs, particularly at the postgraduate level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vs-uk-7-billion-at-risk-if-indian-other-students-stay-away/story-dBCUSnFrSFoPOWVAtUJIPJ.html
13-04-2020||World||‘God is with us’: Many in Pakistan flout the coronavirus ban in mosques||Sabir Durrani says he offers prayers almost every day at a mosque in the central Pakistani city of Multan. He says that often a dozen or more men are in attendance - none of them wearing protective face masks.Durrani, 52, is among thousands of devout Muslims flouting Pakistan government orders issued late last month banning religious congregations of five or more people to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The disease has so far infected more than 5,300 people and killed 93 in the world’s second-most populous Muslim country.“Our prayer leader told us that the virus can’t infect us the way it does Western people,” Durrani told Reuters. “He said we wash our hands and we wash our face five times a day before we say our prayers, and the infidels don’t, so we need not worry. God is with us.”The Islamic lobby holds immense clout in Pakistan, a country of over 200 million people. Religious parties have not been successful in electoral politics but they are able to whip up large, often violent, crowds on matters pertaining to religion, such as in support of the country’s harsh blasphemy law.“Religion and prayers are an emotional issue for many people in Pakistan, and the government has to be sensitive to that,” Mirza Shahzad Akbar, a special assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan, told Reuters.More than 60% of the coronavirus cases in Pakistan have so far been linked to Muslims returning from pilgrimages in the Middle East and followers of the Tablighi Jamaat, an orthodox proselytizing group.But the worry is of a big spike coming from the congregational prayers held in mosques, especially on Fridays, the Islamic sabbath. The numbers in attendance at prayers are likely to increase with the onset of the holy month of Ramadan within two weeks, and authorities are struggling to cope.While the Council of Islamic Ideology, a body that advises the government on religious issues, has called on clerics and the public to cooperate with government measures, several priests and local leaders have opposed the ban.A prominent leader of a religious party told a crowd of hundreds of people gathered for a funeral last week that government orders to limit congregations were unacceptable.“If you do this, we will be forced to think that mosques are being deserted on America’s instructions,” Mufti Kafayatullah told the crowd. “We’re ready to give our lives, but not ready to desert our mosques.”BLIND EYEIn Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, police were attacked for a second straight week as they attempted to halt prayers at a mosque last Friday. A policewoman was injured in the clashes, and in the previous week, police fired shots in the air to quell an angry mob.In other cities, police seem to be turning a blind eye to some mosque gatherings.Last Friday, one of the top Twitter trends in Pakistan was “Muslims, the mosque is calling you”.In the capital, Islamabad, hundreds gathered on Friday without any hindrance at one of the city’s largest mosques, located just two miles (three km) from the seat of Pakistan’s government, including parliament and the prime minister’s secretariat.On March 27, authorities filed 88 cases against mosque administrations in Karachi and arrested 38 people for defying restrictions on Friday congregations, but charges were dropped a day later, and the people were released.“I think it’s partly appeasement and partly the fact that Pakistan’s governments and politics are locked permanently in an electoral framework in which they don’t want to lose support of the religious elite and religious proletariat,” Pakistani author and defence analyst Ayesha Siddiqa told Reuters.Akbar, the special assistant to the prime minister, said most mosques were cooperating with the government.He added however: “This is a sensitive matter, we don’t want to impose it using a stick. And even if we wanted to, there aren’t enough sticks to implement it across Pakistan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/god-is-with-us-many-in-pakistan-flout-the-coronavirus-ban-in-mosques/story-m8Wk1eWQjIPclLzIHvmysM.html
13-04-2020||World||Japan defends PM Shinzo Abe following his coronavirus video backlash||Japan’s government defended Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after his attempt to use social media to get more people to stay home during the pandemic drew accusations that he’s out of touch with the struggles citizens are facing.Abe uploaded a video on his Twitter Sunday taking part in a trend where users overlay their videos on those of singer Gen Hoshino, as he performs a song supporting social distancing that can be translated as “Dance at Home.” Pop stars have shared the screen to harmonize and families have uploaded clips of themselves bopping in the cramped spaces of their homes in postings aimed at boosting spirits.Abe’s minute-long version depicts a somewhat saturnine-looking prime minister at his residence holding his dog, drinking tea and channel surfing. The hashtag “Who do you think you are?” trended after the video was released, with users attacking Abe for being tone-deaf for seeming to be relaxing at home during a virus emergency he declared.The government’s chief spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters Monday that Abe sympathized with the feelings in Hoshino’s video, which is why he posted. “Social media is very effective to communicate to young people that they should stay at home. As far as can we confirm on Twitter, this post got a large reaction and received a record 350,000 likes,” Suga said.Even though Japan has had the fewest confirmed coronavirus infections among Group of Seven leading democracies, Abe has seen his support rate slipping in polls this month with many criticizing his government for being slow in its response. A Kyodo News poll on Monday showed the support rate dropping 5.1 percentage points from late March to hit 40.4%.The slip doesn’t bode well for Abe as he looks to set a date for elections that must be held by the autumn of 2021. Global leaders will likely be measured by how they responded to the crisis. In neighboring South Korea, President Moon Jae-in has seen his support surge to 56% due to an aggressive response that has won international praise, giving his beleaguered progressive party a boost as the country holds parliamentary elections on Wednesday.Abe’s message seemed intended to support those who can’t meet with friends or go out for food and drinks, something he referenced at his news conference last week announcing the state of emergency. For many, it seemed out of touch.“That’s the only hardship caused by coronavirus that he can think of,” a person with the Twitter handle of @mcym163 wrote. Japan’s biggest cities including Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka have been under a state of emergency since last week where people are urged to stay home and many businesses to cut hours.“Is the leader of this country an aristocrat?” fumed another user, @fujitatakanori, in a tweet that was picked up on the front page of Nikkan Sports, a leading tabloid.Hoshino for his part moved quickly to distance himself from the prime minister. “Regarding the video uploaded by Shinzo Abe, just like the other videos uploaded by you all, there was no contact with myself or my office regarding it, including afterwards,” he said on Instagram.The video is the latest misstep in Abe’s start-stop campaign against the virus. Abrupt plans to distribute millions of cloth face masks to households met with derision on Twitter after it was announced before details of the stimulus package to stem the economic hit from the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-defends-pm-shinzo-abe-following-his-coronavirus-video-backlash/story-Cw5APSXydMPAgVO6vxKH8M.html
13-04-2020||World||South Korea reports more recovered covid-19 patients testing positive again||South Korea reported on Monday that at least 116 people initially cleared of the new coronavirus had tested positive again, although officials suggested they would soon look at easing strict recommendations aimed at preventing new outbreaks.South Korea reported only 25 new cases overall on Monday, but the rise in “reactivated” patients has raised concerns as the country seeks to stamp out infections.Officials are still investigating the cause of the apparent relapses. But Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), has said the virus may have been reactivated rather than the patients being re-infected.Other experts said faulty tests may be playing a role, or remnants of the virus may still be in patients’ systems but not be infectious or of danger to the host or others.The 116 cases is more than double the 51 such cases South Korea reported a week earlier.South Korea plans to send 600,000 coronavirus testing kits to the United States on Tuesday in the first such shipment following a request from U.S. President Donald Trump, a Seoul official told Reuters on Monday.Government leaders, meanwhile, called on South Koreans to continue to follow guidelines and restrictions on social gatherings, but hinted that such measures could soon be eased.South Korea has called on residents to follow strict social distancing until at least April 19, but as cases have dropped and the weather has improved, a growing number of people have been flouting the guidelines.At a meeting on disaster management on Monday, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said the government would soon be looking to loosen the guidelines, which call for people to stay at home, avoid social gatherings of any type, and only go out for essential reasons.“Later this week, we plan to review our intensive social distancing campaign that we have carried out so far and discuss whether we will switch to routine safety measures” he said.Some local governments have imposed stricter measures, including closing bars and nightclubs, banning large demonstrations, and limiting church services.Chung cautioned that even when the restrictions are eased, the country will not return to life as before the outbreak.“We need a very cautious approach because any premature easing of social distancing could bring irreversible consequences, and have to ponder deeply about when and how we switch to the new system,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-reports-more-recovered-covid-19-patients-testing-positive-again/story-eSvKXFVyvEBFUIwS9aMIaO.html
13-04-2020||World||WHO says 70 coronavirus vaccines in the works, with 3 leading candidates||There are 70 coronavirus vaccines in development globally, with three candidates already being tested in human trials, according to the World Health Organization, as drugmakers race to find a cure for the deadly pathogen.The furthest along in the clinical process is an experimental vaccine developed by Hong Kong-listed CanSino Biologics Inc. and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, which is in phase 2. The other two being tested in humans are treatments developed separately by U.S. drugmakers Moderna Inc. and Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., according to a WHO document.Progress is occurring at unprecedented speed in developing vaccines as the infectious pathogen looks unlikely to be stamped out through containment measures alone. The drug industry is hoping to compress the time it takes to get a vaccine to market -- usually about 10 to 15 years -- to within the next year.Drugmakers big and small have jumped in to try to develop a vaccine, which would be the most effective way to contain the virus. Pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer Inc. and Sanofi have vaccine candidates in the preclinical stages, according to the WHO document.CanSino said last month it received Chinese regulatory approval to start human trials of its vaccine. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna -- which has never put out a product -- received regulatory approval to move quickly to human trials in March, skipping the years of animal trials that are the norm in developing vaccines. Inovio began its human trials last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-70-coronavirus-vaccines-in-the-works-with-3-leading-candidates/story-OM2B5FXLw692E8zMYBdrbP.html
13-04-2020||World||US sees 1,514 Covid-19 deaths in 24 hrs; expert says country could reopen in May||The US recorded 1,514 Covid-19 related deaths, lower than the previous day’s toll of 1,920, over the past 24 hours, Johns Hopkins University tally showed as of 8:30pm Sunday (0030 GMT Monday).The outbreak has now claimed the lives of at least 22,020 people in the US, the most of any country.The United States also leads the world by far in the number of confirmed infections, with 555,313 by the Baltimore-based university’s count.The country has been recording nearly 2,000 deaths a day from the coronavirus, disproportionately older people with weakened immune systems and ethnic minorities with less access to health care and teleworking.The US, which has 4.25% of the world’s population, accounts for almost a fifth of the world’s nearly 114,180 deaths from Covid-19 since the disease first emerged in China in December last year.‘Start reopening in May’Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious diseases expert, said on Sunday that the country may be ready to start gradually reopening next month, as signs grew that the coronavirus pandemic was peaking.Fauci, the veteran pandemic expert, said in an interview to CNN that parts of the country could begin easing restrictions in May. But Fauci was cautious as well.“I think it could probably start at least in some ways maybe next month,” Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN.“We are hoping by the end of the month we can look around and say, OK, is there any element here that we can safely and cautiously start pulling back on? If so, do it. If not, then just continue to hunker down,” Fauci said.Also read: What you need to know todayUS President Donald Trump had earlier wanted the world’s largest economy to be “raring to go” by Easter Sunday, but most of the country remained at a standstill and churches took celebrations online to halt the spread of the virus that has killed more than 22,000 people in the US.Trump has cast the decision on when to ease the lockdown as the biggest of his presidency as he faces competing pressures from public health experts and businesses along with some conservative allies who want a swift return to normality.Fauci said that regions would be ready at different times rather than the US turning back on like a “light switch.”Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, told ABC he was “hopeful” about reopening on May 1. “I think it’s too early to be able to tell that,” he added.‘Need to be smart’Lockdown decisions, unlike in many western countries, are primarily up to local governments, not the president, and leaders of a number of hard-hit, densely populated states have vowed to act as long as necessary.“We want to reopen as soon as possible. The caveat is we need to be smart in the way we reopen,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters.Also read: 3 Indian Americans showing signs of recovery after transfused with plasma from recovered Covid-19 patientsNeighbouring New Jersey’s governor, fellow Democrat Phil Murphy, said that an economic recovery depended on a “full health-care recovery.”If “we start to get back on our feet too soon, I fear, based on the data we’re looking at, we could be throwing gasoline on the fire,” Murphy told CBS.Trump, for his part, wrote on Twitter Sunday: “We are winning, and will win, the war on the Invisible Enemy!”Also read: Virus airborne up to 4 metres, health staff at high riskWorst-hit New York recorded another 758 coronavirus deaths, Cuomo said.“You’re not seeing a great decline in the numbers, but you’re seeing a flattening,” he said.Fauci similarly said he was “cautiously optimistic” as admissions into hospitals and intensive care had begun to decline.‘Fake News’The New York Times, in an extensive article published Sunday, described Trump as failing to act quickly in part due to confidence in his gut instincts and his distrust of civil servants he brands as a conspiratorial “deep state.”Trump slammed the paper’s story Sunday evening with his favourite insult: “Fake News!”“The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the ‘paper’ itself,” he tweeted.“I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so,” he wrote, referring to the ban travel ban on the Asian power.Fauci, who has advised six successive presidents, acknowledged when asked about the article that the US could have saved lives by shutting down public spaces when the disease’s seriousness became clear early in the year.“But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then,” Fauci told CNN, without naming Trump.Trump soon afterwards posted an interview in which Fauci said that the US “early on did not get correct information.”Trump last week zeroed in on the World Health Organization (WHO) to explain early difficulties, saying the UN body was overly reliant on China when cases first emerged in Wuhan.Trump had been hoping to campaign on a strong economy as he seeks re-election in November.Instead, some 17 million people have lost their jobs in a matter of weeks and his presumptive Democratic rival, Joe Biden, has been hammering him over his virus response.There are 1,846,963 confirmed cases across the world and 114,185 people have been killed, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker on Monday morning.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-1-514-covid-19-deaths-in-24-hours-expert-says-country-could-reopen-in-may/story-eRZVQUOYTswssI75JaFTJK.html
13-04-2020||World||Covid-19: 3 big reasons why so many have died in New York||The United States is hit hard by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. About 5,45,000 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the US as of Sunday, and roughly 21,600 have died of the highly contagious illness.New York has one of the world’s highest death tolls; the city has seen 6,898 virus-related deaths so far.So why is New York so badly hit? Here’s exploring some of the reasons:Density: America’s financial capital has 8.6 million inhabitants. There are 10,000 people per square kilometre, making it the densest city in the US. Millions of commuters brush up against each other on its packed subway system every day, while keeping distance on its sometimes narrow sidewalks can be difficult.Tourism: New York gets more than 60 million tourists a year and is entry point to America for many travellers, meaning anyone carrying the virus is likely to start infecting others there first. American geneticists estimate that it started spreading there from Europe in February, before New York’s first confirmed case on March 1.Poverty: The Big Apple is also characterised by massive socio-economic inequality. Overcrowded, deprived areas - particularly in the Bronx and Queens where many people already suffer health problems and lack medical care - have experienced the highest rate of infections. The United States has been recording nearly 2,000 deaths a day from the coronavirus. Worst-hit New York recorded another 758 coronavirus deaths in the last 24 hours, governor Andrew Cuomo said.The United States, which has 4.25 percent of the world’s population, accounts for almost a fifth of the world’s nearly 110,000 deaths from Covid-19 since the disease first emerged in China late last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-3-big-reasons-why-so-many-have-died-in-new-york/story-AIWaKzj7qXrp9APBDCNPWL.html

13-04-2020||World||Nearly 29% Americans believe Covid-19 was grown in a lab: Study||Coronavirus cases across the globe are inching toward the 2 million-mark while more than one lakh people have lost their lives to the deadly contagion worldwide.What started in the Chinese city of Wuhan has now spread across the globe, infecting hundreds and thousands across various continents, bringing some of the biggest economies to a halt.There’s very little known about the virus or its origin. There are no proven vaccines or medication against the same. A study conducted by the Pew Research Centre suggests that most Americans believe that Covid-19 was lab-grown.Nearly three in ten Americans or a quarter of the American population, as many as 29% of those surveyed, believe that novel coronavirus was grown in a lab, the survey indicated.43% of Americans believe that the virus came about naturally.The findings were obtained after conducting a survey between March 10 to 16.According to Johns Hopkins University, the United States recorded 1,514 coronavirus fatalities over the past 24 hours. However, the number of fatalities was lower than the previous day’s toll of 1,920.The outbreak has now claimed at least 22,020 lives in the US, the most of any country.US President Donald Trump has lashed out at leading American newspaper The New York Times (NYT), accusing it of carrying fake report on his administration’s Covid-19 response.“The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the “paper” itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later, and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements).

13-04-2020||World||‘Fake news’: Trump’s counter to NYT report on his response to Covid-19||US President Donald Trump has lashed out at leading American newspaper The New York Times (NYT), accusing it of carrying fake report on his administration’s Covid-19 response.The NYT report said that President Trump was warned about the potential for a pandemic but he repeatedly played down the seriousness of the virus and focused instead on controlling the message.“The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the “paper” itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later, and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements).

Fake News!“I am working hard to expose the corruption and dishonesty in the Lamestream Media. That part is easy, the hard part is WHY?” Trump said in his other tweet.The lengthy investigative report said that there were warnings from the intelligence community, national security aides and government health officials about an impending pandemic and its consequences but Trump played down the crisis.“An examination reveals the president was warned about the potential for a pandemic but that internal divisions, lack of planning and his faith in his own instincts led to a halting response,” the NYT report said.Trump’s views were “coloured” by long-running disputes inside the administration over how to deal with China and his own suspicion of the motivations of officials inside what he viewed as the “Deep State”, the report claimed. It further said that recommendations from public health officials often competed with economic and political considerations in internal debates, slowing the path toward belated decisions.The US government’s top infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci acknowledged when asked about the article that the US could have saved lives by shutting down public spaces when the disease’s seriousness became clear early in the year.“But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then,” Fauci told CNN, without naming Trump.Trump soon afterward posted an interview in which Fauci said that the United States “early on did not get correct information.”The United States, which has 4.25 per cent of the world’s population, accounts for almost a fifth of the world’s nearly 1,10,000 deaths from Covid-19 since the disease first emerged in China late last year.

13-04-2020||World||Top oil producers agree on record output cuts amid coronavirus crisis||Top oil-producing countries agreed Sunday to record output cuts in order to boost plummeting oil prices due to the new coronavirus crisis and a Russia-Saudi price war.OPEC producers, dominated by Saudi Arabia, and allies led by Russia met via videoconference for an hour Sunday in a last-ditch effort to cement an accord struck early Friday that hinged on Mexico’s agreement.Click here for Covid-19 full coverageIn a compromise, Mexico came onboard Sunday to an agreement to cut 9.7 million barrels per day from May, according to its Energy Minister Rocio Nahle, down slightly from 10 million barrels per day envisioned earlier.Kuwait Oil Minister Khaled al-Fadhel tweeted that, following extensive efforts “we announce completing the historical agreement”.Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who chaired the meeting together with his Russian and Algerian counterparts, also confirmed that the discussions “ended with consensus”.‘Great deal for all’US President Donald Trump welcomed a “great deal for all”, saying on Twitter it would “save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States”.He added he “would like to thank and congratulate” Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince and de facto leader Mohammed bin Salman, both of whom he had spoken to.Initial reticence from Mexico to introduce output cuts had led to a standoff that cast doubt on efforts to bolster oil prices, pushed to near two-decade lows.Oil prices have slumped since the beginning of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic that has sapped demand as countries around the world have put their populations under lockdown.Compounding the problem, key players Russia and Saudi Arabia had engaged in a price war, ramping up output in a bid to hold on to market share and undercut US shale producers.‘Temporary relief’ Rystad Energy analyst Per Magnus Nysveen said Sunday’s agreement provided “at least a temporary relief” as fuel consumption was expected to fall globally by 27 million barrels per day in April and 20 million barrels per day in May.His colleague Bjornar Tonhaugen said, however, that even though the deal made “the single largest output cut in history”, prices were still expected to see “renewed downwards pressure”.“The oil market will see enormous stock builds in April as the deal is only in effect from 1 May, while gradual shut ins and production declines will already happen during the current month,” he said.Top oil producers struggled to finalise production cuts during a virtual summit held by G20 energy ministers on Friday, despite Trump’s mediation efforts to end the standoff with Mexico.The OPEC-led agreement foresees deep output cuts in May and June followed by a gradual reduction in cuts until April 2022.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak was quoted by Russian news agency TASS as saying he expected oil markets not to recover before “end of the year, in the best case”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-oil-producers-agree-on-record-output-cuts/story-9lUwQE5IvebSlv3kIRbFtM.html

The figure reported on Sunday represented a second straight daily decline in the number of reported deaths.Earlier, Johnson was moved from St Thomas’ Hospital in London to the country house of Chequers in Buckinghamshire to rest and recuperate from Covid-19 even as a senior government adviser admitted Britain could have the worst death rate in Europe.Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the BBC, “The numbers in the UK have continued to go up. I do hope we’re coming close to the number of new infections reducing… and the number of deaths plateauing and starting to come down. And yes, the UK is likely to be certainly one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe.”In his first statement after emerging from ICU, Johnson thanked doctors, saying, “I can’t thank them enough. I owe them my life.”A Downing Street spokesman later said, “The PM has been discharged from hospital to continue his recovery, at Chequers. On the advice of his medical team, the PM will not be immediately returning to work.”The UK parliament is due to reopen virtually on April 21. In an optimistic Easter message to the country, Queen Elizabeth said, “Coronavirus will not overcome us…We need Easter as much as ever…As dark as death can be - particularly for those suffering with grief - light and life are greater.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-fatalities-in-britain-cross-10-000/story-OBDwMvvLmgXyo3MRDe82xK.html

The nation-wide breakdown of the patients showed that Punjab has 2,464 cases, Sindh 1,411, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 744, Balochistan 228, Gilgit-Baltistan 224 Islamabad 119 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 40. The ministry also said that 14 more people have died due to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 86.It said that 1,026 patients have recovered so far while 37 were reported to be in critical condition. The data showed that so far 61,801 tested were conducted, including 2,805 during the last one day.Prime Minister’s Advisor on Health Dr Zafar Mirza said that coronavirus was a “preventable problem” and could be curbed if proper measures were taken, as he urged people to observe social distancing and ensure hand hygiene.He also said that half of the total coronavirus patients were infected due to local transmission. The other half were those who came from abroad.Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Social Protection and Poverty Alleviation Dr Sania Nishtar told the media that cash distribution was going on and so far over 1.774 million families benefitted from Ehsaas programme to give cash to the poor.The steady rise in the new cases has been registered despite more than three-week of lockdown in the country which is going to end on Tuesday, but officials said that a decision will be made on Monday whether to increase it or not.There is high possibility that it would be extended as Mirza said that the low number of cases could spike if lockdown was completely lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-urges-world-community-to-grant-debt-relief-as-pak-s-coronavirus-cases-reach-5-230/story-byNpGwlc1DsiYtHWOhxqNI.html

I was hoping for a party and that we would visit the imam,” said Ruqaya Rahim, the new bride, referring to the religious official who leads prayers in the mosque. “But we were prevented from doing that.” Najaf has been among the Iraqi cities hardest hit by the pandemic, accounting for a little more than 20% of Iraq’s total cases.

The government’s medical advisors believe that if the eventual figure is below 20,000, “it will have done well”.In his first statement after emerging from ICU, Johnson thanked doctors in the St Thomas’ Hospital: “I can’t thank them enough. I owe them my life.” The UK parliament is due to reopen virtually on April 21.Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies said on Sunday that the UK is likely to see the worst death rate in Europe.He told BBC: “The numbers in the UK have continued to go up. I do hope we’re coming close to the number of new infections reducing … and the number of deaths plateauing and starting to come down”.“And yes, the UK is likely to be certainly one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe”.Farrar added that a second or third wave of the virus “was probably inevitable” and treatment and a vaccine was “our only true exit strategy”. A vaccine could be available by autumn but it would take longer to ramp up manufacturing to the scale required to vaccinate many millions.“I would hope we would get (that) done in 12 months but that is in itself an unprecedented ambition,” he said.As medical professionals continued to complain of lack of personal protection equipment while treating patients, new details of those contracting and dying from the virus include pharmacist Pooja Sharma, who worked at the Eastbourne General Hospital in east Sussex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-may-have-worst-death-rate-in-europe-as-toll-mounts/story-YNNBX00QCHWtcnQ2Ed2QDL.html
