19-04-2020||World||US President Trump’s lockdown exit plan ‘delusional’ say opponents||President Donald Trump’s administration clashed with state governors Sunday over lifting coronavirus lockdowns, in a standoff embittered by his support for protests against the restrictions.Vice President Mike Pence said that every US state has the ability to do enough testing to allow preliminary re-opening of the economy and a partial restart of normal life in America.But some state governors said testing capacity was far behind levels needed to avoid sparking new outbreaks of the virus.The United States has so far recorded 735,000 coronavirus cases -- the highest number of any country -- and registered 39,000 deaths.“We believe the testing that we have today... once we activate all of the labs that can do coronavirus testing, is sufficient for any state in America to move into phase one,” Pence told FOX News Sunday.“Phase one” ends stay-at-home restrictions for healthy people, and allows restaurants, cinemas, sporting venues, places of worships and gyms to re-open with physical distancing.“We have every confidence that we can have a sufficient amount of testing to be able to re-open America,” Pence said, vowing to double the numbers of tests.But Virginia Governor Ralph Northam pushed back at the Republican administration’s claims that there was enough testing, saying “that’s just delusional.”Gretchen Whitmer, Democratic governor of Michigan, said “we could double or even triple the number of tests that we’re executing daily if we had the swabs and reagents” and called for more federal government help.As the US struggles to quell the mounting death toll, political battle lines are also being drawn ahead of the November election as Trump seeks to reduce damage to his chances of holding onto office.Anti-lockdown protests have sprung up in several US cities in recent days, with support from Trump who in tweets has called to “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia -- all states with Democratic governors -- from stay-at-home orders.“Our president, obviously, has been unable to deliver on tests. Now he has chosen to focus on protests,” Northam told CNN’s “State of the Union.”Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state, also a Democrat, went further still: “To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law... it is dangerous.But even the Republican governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, said Trump’s encouragement of protesters who picketed the colonial-era statehouse in Annapolis a day earlier was “not helpful.”“To encourage people to go protest the plan that you just made recommendations on, on Thursday, it just doesn’t make any sense,” Hogan told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-trump-s-lockdown-exit-plan-delusional-say-opponents/story-1DXlWyieh27fLITh4i3uQL.html
19-04-2020||World||‘Cartels are scrambling’: Covid-19 snarls global drug trade||Coronavirus is dealing a gut punch to the illegal drug trade, paralyzing economies, closing borders and severing supply chains in China that traffickers rely on for the chemicals to make such profitable drugs as methamphetamine and fentanyl.One of the main suppliers that shut down is in Wuhan, the epicenter of the global outbreak.Associated Press interviews with nearly two dozen law enforcement officials and trafficking experts found Mexican and Colombian cartels are still plying their trade as evidenced by recent drug seizures but the lockdowns that have turned cities into ghost towns are disrupting everything from production to transport to sales.Along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border through which the vast majority of illegal drugs cross, the normally bustling vehicle traffic that smugglers use for cover has slowed to a trickle. Bars, nightclubs and motels across the country that are ordinarily fertile marketplaces for drug dealers have shuttered. And prices for drugs in short supply have soared to gouging levels.“They are facing a supply problem and a demand problem,” said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst and former official with CISEN, the Mexican intelligence agency. “Once you get them to the market, who are you going to sell to?”Virtually every illicit drug has been impacted, with supply chain disruptions at both the wholesale and retail level. Traffickers are stockpiling narcotics and cash along the border, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration even reports a decrease in money laundering and online drug sales on the so-called dark web.“The godfathers of the cartels are scrambling,” said Phil Jordan, a former director of the DEA’s El Paso Intelligence Center.Cocaine prices are up 20 percent or more in some cities. Heroin has become harder to find in Denver and Chicago, while supplies of fentanyl are falling in Houston and Philadelphia. In Los Angeles, the price of methamphetamine has more than doubled in recent weeks to $1,800 per pound.“You have shortages but also some greedy bastards who see an opportunity to make more money,” said Jack Riley, the former deputy administrator of the DEA. “The bad guys frequently use situations that affect the national conscience to raise prices.”Synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and fentanyl have been among the most affected, in large part because they rely on precursor chemicals that Mexican cartels import from China, cook into drugs on an industrial scale and then ship to the U.S.“This is something we would use as a lesson learned for us,” the head of the DEA, Uttam Dhillon, told AP. “If the disruption is that significant, we need to continue to work with our global partners to ensure that, once we come out of the pandemic, those precursor chemicals are not available to these drug-trafficking organizations.”Cartels are increasingly shifting away from drugs that require planting and growing seasons, like heroin and marijuana, in favor of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, which can be cooked 24/7 throughout the year, are up to 50 times more powerful than heroin and produce a greater profit margin.Though some clandestine labs that make fentanyl from scratch have popped up sporadically in Mexico, cartels are still very much reliant upon Chinese companies to get the precursor drugs.Huge amounts of these mail-order components can be traced to a single, state-subsidized company in Wuhan that shut down after the outbreak earlier this year, said Louise Shelley, director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, which monitors Chinese websites selling fentanyl.“The quarantine of Wuhan and all the chaos there definitely affected the fentanyl trade, particularly between China and Mexico,” said Ben Westhoff, author of “Fentanyl, Inc.”“The main reason China has been the main supplier is the main reason China is the supplier of everything — it does it so cheaply,” Westhoff said. “There was really no cost incentive for the cartels to develop this themselves.”But costs have been rising and, as in many legitimate industries, the coronavirus is bringing about changes.Advertised prices across China for precursors of fentanyl, methamphetamine and cutting agents have risen between 25% and 400% since late February, said Logan Pauley, an analyst at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a Washington-based security research nonprofit. So even as drug precursor plants in China are slowly reopening after the worst of the coronavirus crisis there, some cartels have been taking steps to decrease their reliance on overseas suppliers by enlisting scientists to make their own precursor chemicals.“Because of the coronavirus they’re starting to do it in house,” added Westhoff.Some Chinese companies that once pushed precursors are now advertising drugs like hydroxychloroquine, which President Donald Trump has promoted as potential treatment for COVID-19, as well as personal protective gear such as face masks and hand sanitizers.Meanwhile, the gummed up situation on the U.S.-Mexico border resembles a stalled chess match where nobody, especially the traffickers, wants to make a wrong move, said Kyle Williamson, special agent in charge of the DEA’s El Paso field division.“They’re in a pause right now,” Williamson said. “They don’t want to get sloppy and take a lot of risks.”Some Mexican drug cartels are even holding back existing methamphetamine supplies to manipulate the market, recognizing that “no good crisis should be wasted,” said Joseph Brown, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Texas.“Some cartels have given direct orders to members of their organization that anyone caught selling methamphetamine during this time will be killed,” said Brown, whose sprawling jurisdiction stretches from the suburbs of Dallas to Beaumont.To be sure, narcotics are still making their way into the U.S., as evidenced by a bust last month in which nearly $30 million worth of street drugs were seized in a new smuggling tunnel connecting a warehouse in Tijuana to southern San Diego. Shelley said that bust was notable in that only about 2 pounds of fentanyl was recovered, “much lower than usual shipments.”Trump announced earlier this month that Navy ships were being moved toward Venezuela as part of a bid to beef up counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean following a U.S. drug indictment against Nicolás Maduro.But the pandemic also has limited law enforcement’s effectiveness, as departments cope with drug investigators working remotely, falling ill and navigating a new landscape in which their own activities have become more conspicuous. In Los Angeles County, half of the narcotics detectives have been put on patrol duty, potentially imperiling long-term investigations.Nonetheless, Capt. Chris Sandoval, who oversees special investigations for the Houston-based Harris County Sheriff’s Office, said there’s a new saying among his detectives: “Not even the dope dealers can hide from the coronavirus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cartels-are-scrambling-covid-19-snarls-global-drug-trade/story-Py4zxqwPlNPBbLcPhHulVK.html

19-04-2020||World||Coronavirus deaths down in New York, but officials urge vigilance||The coronavirus death toll in New York dropped again, a sign that Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday means the state is “on the other side of the plateau” and that ongoing social distancing practices are working to stem the spread of the virus.Cuomo said 507 people died on Saturday, down 43 from the previous day. Hospitalizations and other medical indicators are trending downward.But Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio maintained their warnings that people in New York City and the rest of the state need to stay vigilant to curb the spread of the virus.“We showed that we can control the beast and when you close down, you can actually slow that infection rate, but this is only halftime,” Cuomo said Sunday at a briefing. We still have to make sure that we keep that beast under control, we keep that infection rate down, we keep that hospitalization rate down as we all get very eager to get on with life and move on.”Here are the latest coronavirus developments in New York:DECLINING DEATH TOLLThe drop in the death toll in New York reported Sunday prompted Cuomo to say, “We are on the other side of the plateau.”But both Cuomo and de Blasio said the crisis is far from over, cautioning that the temptation for cooped-up New Yorkers to take advantage of the spring weather presents new challenges to keep the outbreak in check.Police and park officers will be out in force to break up outdoor gatherings that pose a risk, with violators facing potential fines of up to $1,000, the mayor said. The city is encouraging people to text authorities photos when they spot the gatherings.“We do not want to see this disease boomerang,” he said. “We do not want to see it come back with a vengeance.”For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with underlying health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.DE BLASIO BLASTS TRUMPPresident Donald Trump is betraying his fellow New Yorkers by failing to push for billions of dollars in additional federal aid needed to help the city deal with the coronavirus economic crisis, de Blasio said Sunday.The mayor had harsh words for the Queens-born president, claiming both he and Vice President Mike Pence have ignored his overtures on the stimulus funds.“Right now you are failing to protect the very people you grew up around,” de Blasio said of Trump. “When New York City is in need, where are you?”De Blasio even referenced an infamous tabloid headline - “FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD” - from 1975 when then-President Gerald Ford denied assistance to spare New York from bankruptcy.“Are you going to save New York City,” the mayor said, “or are you saying to New York City ’drop dead?”FEWER POLICE OUT SICKThe number of New York Police Department officers calling out sick is declining.The nation’s largest police department reported that 5,324 uniformed members — about 15% of the force — were out sick on Saturday. That’s down from a high of 7,155 officers — nearly 20% of the force — on April 9.So far, more than 2,000 members of the NYPD have returned to work full duty after recovering from a positive test for the coronavirus, police officials said.OTHER DEVELOPMENTSTony Award-nominated actor Nick Cordero had his right leg amputated after having complications from the coronavirus, his wife said.

19-04-2020||World||Turkey blocks Saudi and UAE news websites||Turkish authorities blocked Saudi and United Arab Emirates news websites on Sunday, days after the sites of Turkey’s state broadcaster and news agency were blocked in Saudi Arabia.The apparently reciprocal moves come four weeks after Turkish prosecutors indicted 20 Saudis over the killing of journalist Jamal Kashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, a killing that soured relations between Ankara and Riyadh.Internet users in Turkey trying to access the sites of Saudi news agency SPA, the UAE’s WAM news agency and more than a dozen other sites saw a message saying that they were blocked under a law governing internet publications in Turkey.A spokesman at Turkey’s Justice Ministry declined to comment on the actions and Saudi Arabia’s government media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The Turkish website of the UK-based Independent newspaper, which is operated by a Saudi company, was one of the sites to blocked on Sunday, in a move that its editor said reflected political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Turkey.“We believe the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Turkey reflected on us,” editor Nevzat Cicek told Reuters. Sunday’s decision appeared to be “retaliation against Saudi Arabia”, he said.Saudi Arabia had blocked access to several Turkish media websites a week earlier, including state broadcaster TRT and the state-owned Anadolu agency. Residents in the United Arab Emirates, a close ally of Saudi Arabia, said the Turkish websites were accessible on Sunday.Tensions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia escalated sharply after Saudi agents killed Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.Last month Istanbul prosecutors indicted one of the prince’s close aides and a former deputy head of Saudi general intelligence on charges of instigating Khashoggi’s killing, as well as 18 men it said carried out the operation.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the killing was ordered at the “highest levels” of the Saudi government. Prince Mohammed has denied ordering the killing but said he bore ultimate responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto leader.(Reporting Irem Koca Writing by Dominic Evans Editing by David Goodman)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-blocks-saudi-and-uae-news-websites/story-LSP6xFWwixoE7ojklAdrxO.html
19-04-2020||World||Pak PM Imran Khan, OIC criticise India over treatment of Muslims||Pakistan’s top leadership and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Sunday criticised what they described as the deliberate targeting of Muslims by the Indian government against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic.Prime Minister Imran Khan followed up on tweets by the Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission of the OIC on the issue and compared the Indian government’s treatment of Muslims to what the Nazis did to the Jews in Germany.The deliberate & violent targeting of Muslims in India by Modi Govt to divert the backlash over its COVID19 policy, which has left thousands stranded & hungry, is akin to what Nazis did to Jews in Gerrmany. Yet more proof of the racist Hindutva Supremacist ideology of Modi Govt.In a tweet, President Arif Alvi, a close aide of Khan, accused the Indian government of suppressing the Kashmiri people through “extreme violence, torture and oppression”. He posted a graphic with figures that purported to show that the ratio of soldiers to civilians in Kashmir was higher than the ratios for the number of ventilators and doctors.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the remarks by the Pakistani leadership.In recent months, Khan has repeatedly criticised the Indian government’s attitude towards the country’s Muslim minority and the external affairs ministry has pushed back against his remarks, describing them as interference in India’s internal affairs. The Indian side has also targeted Khan for failing to counter cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistani soil.Khan tweeted: “The deliberate & violent targeting of Muslims in India by Modi Govt to divert the backlash over its COVID19 policy, which has left thousands stranded & hungry, is akin to what Nazis did to Jews in Germany.”1/2 #OIC-IPHRC condemns the unrelenting vicious #Islamophobic campaign in #India maligning Muslims for spread of #COVID-19 as well as their negative profiling in media subjecting them to discrimination & violence with impunity.Hours earlier, the OIC’s Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission had, in a string of tweets, condemned what it described as the “unrelenting vicious Islamophobic campaign in India maligning Muslims for spread of #Covid-19 as well as their negative profiling in media subjecting them to discrimination & violence with impunity”.2/2 #OIC-IPHRC urges the #Indian Govt to take urgent steps to stop the growing tide of #Islamophobia in India and protect the rights of its persecuted #Muslim minority as per its obligations under int"l HR law.It urged the “Indian government to take urgent steps to stop the growing tide of #Islamophobia in the country and protect the rights of its persecuted Muslim minority as per its obligations under [international human rights] law”.The commission is an expert body of the OIC with advisory capacity.India’s foreign minister was invited as a special guest at a meeting of foreign ministers of OIC states in the UAE last year, marking a high point in New Delhi’s often testy relations with the Islamic grouping.However, in recent months, the OIC has repeatedly criticised the Indian government’s handling of the situation in Kashmir and attacks on Muslims. The external affairs ministry has rejected this criticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-oic-criticise-india-over-treatment-of-muslims/story-nuoD7kNRvqtAmGK4RusRtJ.html
19-04-2020||World||Right wing-led protests spread against Covid-19 curbs in US||More than 1,890 people died of the coronavirus in the past 24 hours as right wing-led protests against restrictions in force to combat the spread of the coronavirus spread to more US states Saturday, after President Donald Trump came out in their support and encouraged them with “LIBERATE” tweets.Hundred of protestors congregated in states capitals in Texas, Maryland, Utah, California, Arizona, Washington and Colorado, with signs and chants protesting the restrictions as a violation of their rights. Some carried signs saying the virus was a hoax, and some in Texas called for firing a top epidemiologist Anthony Fauci, who is a member of Trump’s coronavirus task-force but has come to be seen by some on the far right as someone who is undermining the president; he was recently given a security detial after receiving threats.People chanted “Let us work” and “Make America Free Again”, at a protest staged in Austin, Texas, called by Infowars, a right-wing outfit that has been banned by social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter for advocating conspiracy theories. Its founder Alex Jones, who is also banned by these outlets, made a brief appearance, according to local news media outlets.Protestors at these gatherings, which took place in Michigan, New York, Kentucky and some other states earlier, have defied social-distancing norms in force in these and other states, as per the guidelines issued by the Trump administration. They remain in force also in line with the “reopening guidelines” unveiled by the president last week recommending steps states could take to lift the restrictions in a “science-based” phased manner.But Trump has supported them, unwilling, critics have said, to take on his own base and supporters. He went further with a series of tweets Friday saying, “LIBERATE Michigan”, LIBERATE Virginia” and “LIBERATE Minnesota”; all three states with Democratic governors.Most governors are moving towards reopening their states, but want to rush into it. They have sought to ramp up testing as a key step to link reopening to verifiably sustainable declining numbers of new cases. They have sought federal support for it, which has put some of them at odds with the president.There is all-around agreements among public health officials and experts that the United States is past the peak now, and that the worst is over, in new infections. Fatalities will take a while reflecting it as they follow a two-week lag, according to experts.The US toll went up 1,891 over the past 24 hours to 39,025 Sunday morning and infections rose by 32,491 to 735,366. New York state, the epicenter of the US outbreak accounted for 17,627 of the fatalities; 13,157 in New York city alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/right-wing-led-protests-spread-against-covid-19-curbs-in-us/story-HMNo2eBWizIBjt0hstSESI.html
19-04-2020||World||White House, Democrats ‘very close’ to deal to aid Covid-19-hit businesses||The White House and congressional Democrats said Sunday they could reach agreement soon on expanding funds to small businesses devastated by the coronavirus, with Democrats hoping to add money for hospitals, testing and state governments.“We’re very close,” Vice President Mike Pence told talkshow Fox News Sunday about negotiations on replenishing the Paycheck Protection Program whose entire $349 billion funding was exhausted by last Thursday.“We’re going to work to expand that so that no one working in a small business in America would have to worry about missing a paycheck.”President Donald Trump has insisted his administration will do right by millions of American families and businesses ravaged by a pandemic that has infected 735,000 people in the United States, 39,000 of whom have died.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed hope a deal could be reached and passed by Congress in the coming days.“I think we’re very close to a deal today,” Mnuchin told CNN’s State of the Union, as he put forward a new target number of $300 billion, beyond the $250 billion under discussion last week.Mnuchin said the White House has also agreed to add $75 billion to hospitals and first responders, and $25 billion to ramp up virus testing -- clear wins for Democrats.Critics have savaged the administration for lagging on testing efforts and say testing should be massively expanded.Mnuchin, however, said Trump wants additional funding for state and local governments -- stretched to the limit as they battle the pandemic -- included in a broader bill to come later, not in the interim package.Democrats joined the optimism about the pace of negotiations.“We’re on a very good path” and a deal could be reached “soon,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Fox.That marked a notable quickening of her timeline from last week, when she suggested the interim bill could clear Congress “before the end of the month.”Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer was more direct, saying “I’m very hopeful we could come to an agreement tonight or early tomorrow morning.”US officials said Friday that the massive business loan program has aided 1.6 million enterprises to date.Democrats are stressing that some money in the interim package be set aside for businesses in rural and minority areas where there is often less access to banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-democrats-very-close-to-deal-to-aid-covid-19-hit-businesses/story-xBP9oKLaSJYtLYyk45JbtK.html
19-04-2020||World||US citizens across several states protest against Covid-19 lockdown rules||Hundreds protested Saturday in cities across America against coronavirus-related lockdowns -- with encouragement from President Donald Trump -- as resentment grows against the crippling economic cost of confinement.An estimated 400 people gathered under a cold rain in Concord, New Hampshire -- many on foot while others remained in their cars -- to send a message that extended quarantines were not necessary in a state with relatively few confirmed cases of COVID-19.The crowd included several armed men wearing military-style uniforms, with their faces covered.In Texas, more than 250 people rallied outside the State Capitol in Austin, including far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, founder of the Infowars site, who rolled up in a tank-like truck.“It’s time to reopen Texas, it’s time to let people work, it’s time for them to let voluntary interaction and good sense rule the day, not government force,” said Justin Greiss, an activist with Young Americans for Liberty.Stay-at-home mother Amira Abuzeid added: “I’m not a doctor but I’m an intelligent person who can do math and it looks like at the end of the day, these numbers are not that worrisome.”Few if any observed social distancing recommendations.Demonstrators outside Maryland’s colonial-era statehouse in Annapolis stayed in their cars but waved signs with messages like “Poverty kills too.”Dolores, a hairdresser, told AFP she is not eligible for unemployment because she is a business owner, not an employee.“I need to save my business. I need to work to live. Otherwise I will die,” she said.Other demonstrations took place across the country in cities such as Columbus, Ohio and San Diego, California, as well as the states of Indiana, Nevada and Wisconsin.Few practiced social distancing but many of the protesters waved American flags.‘Live Free or Die’Protesters have drawn encouragement in certain Democratic-led states from tweets by Trump, who has said he favors a quick return to normal, though protests have also taken place in Republican-led states like New Hampshire and Texas. The US has seen more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country in the world -- with more than 734,000 confirmed infections and 38,800 fatalities as of Saturday evening.The vast majority of Americans are under lockdown orders restricting public movement and keeping all but essential businesses closed.In Concord, demonstrators carried signs with slogans like “The numbers lie” and “Reopen New Hampshire.” Their common demand was that the stay-at-home order for the state of 1.3 million people be called off before its scheduled May 4 end date.Others, amid a sea of American flags, chanted the state’s Revolutionary War-era slogan, “Live Free or Die.”“People are very happy on a voluntary basis to do what’s necessary,” one demonstrator, 63-year-old Skip Murphy, told AFP by phone.He added, however, that “the data does not support the egregious lockdown we are having in New Hampshire.”As of early Friday, New Hampshire had reported 1,287 confirmed coronavirus cases and 37 deaths.‘Free country’“All over the country, a lot of people are saying, ‘We will do our part, but at the same time, this is supposed to be a free country,’“ Murphy said.“When that gets transgressed, people start to say, ‘Wait a minute, this is wrong.’“Most Americans -- by a two-to-one margin -- actually worry about virus restrictions being lifted too soon, not too late, a recent Pew survey found. But demonstrators found encouragement Friday from the president, who in a series of tweets called to “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia -- all states with Democratic governors -- from stay-at-home orders.Trump has repeatedly called for the earliest possible return to normality as virus-related closings have had a crushing impact on American workers and businesses. “I really think some of the governors have gotten carried away,” Trump said at a White House news conference on Saturday.He welcomed the reopening of some businesses in Texas and Vermont on Monday “while still requiring appropriate social distancing precautions.”The largest protest against stay-at-home rules so far took place Wednesday in the Michigan capital of Lansing, which drew some 3,000 people.Murphy said he had voted for Trump, but insisted his motives were not partisan. New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu is a Republican, he noted.“This has nothing to do with Trump or the Democratic and Republican governors,” Murphy said.“It is a case of one size not fitting all -- the lockdown should cease where it does not make sense.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-citizens-across-several-states-protest-against-us-covid-19-lockdown-rules/story-h3MGVQSvIn38NXTK6B1OzN.html

19-04-2020||World||UK not to ease lockdown as Covid-19 death toll crosses 16,000||The Boris Johnson government on Sunday insisted it is not yet safe to ease the lockdown, amidst intense criticism for allegedly not responding quickly enough in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, which may have led to thousands of deaths.The UK-wide death toll in hospitals mounted to 16,060 (day rise of 596), and 120,067 cases (day rise of 5,850). Reports from care homes and charity organisations say thousands have died outside hospitals that are not reflected in the daily hospital figures.Michael Gove, senior cabinet minister, rejected several reports in the Sunday press alleging that Johnson did not attend five emergency meetings related to the pandemic, and that ministers were slow in responding adequately despite scientific evidence of its seriousness.There have been demands that as in other countries, the UK should ease some restrictions as part of an ‘exit plan’, but Gove said the government was taking “a deliberately cautious and measured approach guided by the science”.He said: “When we have the information, when we have the data that allows us confidently to relax those restrictions we will do so, but that data, that information, is not yet in place,” adding that there is no certainty when a vaccine for the virus would be available.Sarah Gilbert, who is leading a team developing a vaccine at Oxford University, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that they hoped to start clinical trials towards the end of next week but nobody could be sure it was possible “to find a workable vaccine”.She said they would need government support to accelerate manufacturing because the UK currently does not have the facilities to make the vaccine on a large scale.Jeremy Farrar, who is a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told Sunday television that the UK may be past the peak of the ‘first wave’ of the virus, but cautioned against easing the lockdown.“If we were to release those lockdowns too soon whilst the infection rates are still high … then the epidemic would come back again, it would come back very quickly. It would rebound within a few weeks or a couple of months.”On vaccine development, he said: “It’s not a given that we will make a vaccine. If we did have a vaccine, let’s say late in 2020 or into 2021, we would then need to manufacture it in billions of doses and make those billions of doses available to the world”.“So just having a vaccine that is safe and effective, proven, is not enough. If there is any country vulnerable, if there is any country where there is still transmission of this virus, then in fact every country is vulnerable.“I hope we would have a vaccine towards the end of this year – but that’s a vaccine in a vial, it’s a vaccine that we believe to be safe, a vaccine we think might be effective. That’s not having a vaccine for the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-not-to-ease-lockdown-as-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-16-000/story-t9IGI1azUzXUbYquRsXUFL.html

Some have moved to re-house them in shuttered schools or dedicated centres, and are trying to arrange flights to repatriate them.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe UAE last week said it would review labour relations with states refusing to evacuate citizens, including those who have lost jobs or been put on leave, after the ambassadors of India and Pakistan said their countries were not yet ready to do so.PIA said on its website that it would not be able to provide services for inbound flights beyond Islamabad International Airport due to suspension of domestic flights and a lockdown in the country.Millions of foreign workers, many from Asia, form the backbone of Gulf economies and work in sectors that have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak.The pandemic is also likely to disrupt the significant remittances those workers send back to their home countries.The total infection count in the six Gulf states has risen steadily to more than 25,000, with 161 deaths, despite containment measures such as halting passenger flights, curfews and in several cases locking down districts with large populations of low-income expatriate workers.On Sunday the UAE announced another 479 new cases and four more deaths, bringing its total to 6,781 cases and 41 deaths so far. Kuwait’s 90-year-old ruler, Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, on Sunday addressed the nation to welcome back the first group of Kuwaitis returned home under a new repatriation programme. He urged them to comply with all isolation and quarantine guidelines given by authorities in the Gulf state, which has recorded seven deaths, including one on Sunday, and almost 2,000 cases of the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-starts-repatriating-uae-based-nationals-stranded-by-coronavirus/story-PsBZnBSwDKuJaMAus40HPI.html

The coronavirus outbreak, that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, has spread across continents to become a pandemic that has locked down more than half of the planet. Here are the latest Covid-19 developments from all across the world: 1. The UK government is not considering lifting the coronavirus lockdown. The lockdown was imposed almost four weeks ago.2. Wuhan virology lab chief denied that coronavirus originated from the institute, said the virus cannot be man-made. The institute rejected as “impossible” US theories that suggest it is the cradle of the pandemic.3. Spain’s death toll appears to be slowing. On Sunday, the number of fatalities rose by 410, down from 565 on Saturday. This was the lowest daily increase in coronavirus fatalities for Spain in about a month.4. The British government has said that the increase in Covid-19 deaths is “deeply worrying”. More than 15,000 people have died in Britain so far due to coronavirus.5. The United States still accounts for the maximum number of coronavirus deaths in the world with 39,090 fatalities, followed by Italy (23,227), Spain (20,453), France (19,323) and Britain (15,464).6. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is “on top of things” following his battle with coronavirus, a senior government minister said on Sunday. The UK PM has been facing criticism for being “missing in action” at the beginning of the outbreak.7. South Korea reported just eight new coronavirus infections, the lowest in two months. The country extended its social distancing policy on Sunday with some relaxation. 8. After the UAE threatened to review labour ties with countries refusing to take back their nationals amid the coronavirus pandemic, Pakistan has started repatriating some of its citizens from the Arab nation.9. Iran on Sunday announced that its Covid-19 death toll rose to 5,118, up by 87.10. In a bid to salvage its hammered currency amid coronavirus lockdown, Sri Lanka has put a three-month ban on a wide range of imports. The country will lift its month-long coronavirus curfew on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-deaths-appear-to-slow-down-in-spain-uk-not-ready-to-lift-lockdown-10-points/story-u7SZeL6qSigkGbDe5o6rLL.html

19-04-2020||World||Buy a newspaper, Britons told, as Covid-19 enfeebles UK media||Add buying a newspaper in your to-do list during lockdown, the Boris Johnson government has urged Britons, as the United Kingdom grapples with steep decline in advertising and circulation in national as well as local news media.Oliver Dowden, Culture secretary, made the plea in an article in The Times, reminding readers that the ‘news industry’ is providing a vital service by giving important information to people as the pandemic takes an increasing toll of lives in the UK: over 15,000 deaths.The news media’s dwindling revenue is accentuated by so-called ‘blacklists’ of words that leads to adverts not appearing online beside stories that include words such as coronavirus, Covid-19 or deaths. Estimates of loss due to such blocking are in the hundreds of millions of pounds.Dowden notes that according to the News Media Association, ad revenues have plummeted by up to 90 per cent: “National, regional and local newspapers are under huge financial pressure, largely because of plummeting commercial advertising on their printed pages and websites”.“Falling demand for advertising has also been exacerbated by something called keyword blocking, where advertising linked to specific keywords is prevented from being served on papers’ web pages. Some major UK brands and parts of the advertising industry are blocking adverts appearing next to coronavirus-related news stories”.His plea to support the news media by buying newspapers is backed across the political spectrum. Under UK lockdown curbs, people are allowed to go out of homes while maintaining distance to buy food in shops and supermarkets, where newspapers are on sale.Sajid Javid, senior Conservative MP and former chancellor, backed Dowden: “Newspapers are indeed our ‘fourth emergency service’. Our democracy depends on a vibrant, free press. Big brands, please stop ad-blocking Covid-19 stories”.Dowden adds: “We increasingly live in an age of online echo chambers and self-reinforcing algorithms which can compound the spread of misinformation. The single best way to tackle it is through fact-checked news, and I’m pleased to see newspapers playing their part against false stories”.“I have written to the 100 biggest brands in the UK to urge them to review their advertising policies and check they are not inappropriately blocking adverts from appearing next to news providing a vital public service”.“Newspapers are at heart of the British media and essential to its vibrant mix. People across the country are rising to the coronavirus challenge and I suggest we all add one small thing to our to do list: buy a paper”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/buy-a-newspaper-britons-told-as-covid-19-enfeebles-uk-media/story-1XdxPfif7TJE7R2fCiTxrN.html
19-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Japan government faces complaints after giving out dirty masks||Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s unpopular handouts of old-fashioned cloth masks as part of his coronavirus measures faced complaints, as thousands of those sent to pregnant women were dirty..The health ministry said over the weekend that it has received at least 1,900 cases of the problems reported by 80 municipalities that the masks came with stains, dust and other contamination. The dirty masks were among a half million masks that the government started sending to pregnant women in Japan as a priority last week. Abe announced a plan on April 1 to mail two cloth masks each to all 50 million households in Japan amid dire shortage of masks.The faulty masks were the latest embarrassment for Abe’s government already criticised for its coronavirus measures inadequate, off-target, too little and too late.The cloth masks also seem to have a size problem. When the masks also arrived at elderly care centres, television talk shows showed some caregivers struggling to fit the mask, saying the it was too small to cover both nose and mouth at the same time.The ministry said it has urged mask makers to resolve the contamination problem, while asking municipal officials to visually inspect the masks before mailing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-japan-government-faces-complaints-after-giving-out-dirty-masks/story-wWtMQptAvsPot7mZs1uzvI.html
19-04-2020||World||What it looks like when the world stands still | Opinion||Easter weekend? What Easter weekend? I spent the entire time following the twists and turns of the extraordinary attempt by oil producers to cobble together the biggest output cut in history, only to see the price fall when commodity markets opened on Monday. Lockdown? I was glued to my computer all weekend and wouldn’t have noticed if all restrictions had been removed. Of course, they weren’t, and that got me thinking about just how our lives have come to a screeching halt.Enjoy the stillness. I live under a flight path into one of London’s major airports, so the grounding of planes does have its upside. As do the quieter roads when I take my bike out for my morning “commute” — halfway to the office and back each morning.Cities have become noticeably quieter with far fewer cars out on the roads. Restrictions came later to London than many other European towns, and traffic flows only started to wane in the second half of March. The impact on congestion shows, but it’s been significantly less than in Milan in northern Italy, for instance. Last year drivers in London, like their counterparts in Italy, could expect a peak-time journey to take about 75% longer than the same trip on empty roads — an additional 45 minutes on a one-hour trip. Now that same “one-hour drive” in London takes around one hour and 10 minutes.In northern Italy, where restrictions were introduced during the second half of February, peak-hour delays have been reduced to around 5 minutes from as much as 45 minutes on a one-hour journey.To examine how driving has slumped and how, in a few places, it’s picking up again, I used figures from the TomTom Traffic Index to make these charts. The data show how much longer journeys in selected cities take during each hour of the week than they would on uncongested roads. The original numbers are in the form of a percentage increase over all journeys. I have standardized them to show how many more minutes drivers could expect to spend in their cars for a journey that would take an hour on empty streets.Congestion patterns in the Middle East show a similar picture to those in Europe. It’s a region that has received much less coverage of the virus’s impact, except for Iran where the outbreak appears particularly severe. But here, too, streets have gone quiet. Kuwait City has seen traffic congestion fall to almost zero, with stringent restrictions in place for nearly two months and showing no sign of being lifted.In the U.S., urban traffic congestion also tumbled during the first half of March, as Americans joined the Great Silence. Here, the additional time spent in the car during peak hours has fallen by around 90% compared with the same day of the week last year. As the West stays home, Chinese cities are coming out of lockdown. But a careful look at traffic congestion data shows that things are far from back to normal, even in cities where restrictions were eased weeks ago. The experiences there are illustrative of what the rest of us may face when our own governments start to ease the strictest confinement measures.Beijing and other Chinese cities provide the clearest data on how a place recovers from lockdown imposed to fight the Covid-19 virus. The chart below shows that journey times have risen slowly over recent weeks, as more and more traffic returns to the city’s roads. By last week, it looks as though gridlock had returned to Beijing, with journeys taking just as long as they did on average last year.But that picture is deceptive and we need to look a little closer to see why.Pulling out the data for the most recent week, it becomes clear that normalcy isn’t fully back to every corner of life in Beijing. While congestion has indeed returned during the morning and evening rush hours, the volume of traffic on the roads at other times of the weekday and weekends remains at extremely low levels. People may be traveling as normal to get to and from work, but driving for social purposes — to get to the mall, or cinema complex, or museum, or to visit family or nearby parks — remains at a very low level. Journeys outside of rush hour are still taken on almost empty roads.Of course, I couldn’t finish without saying a few words about oil. The impact of the enforced stay-at-home policies on U.S. gasoline use has been dramatic, to put it mildly. The Energy Information Administration reported four-week average demand in the period to April 10 at just 6.4 million barrels a day — its lowest level in data going back to 1991. The figure is down by nearly a third, or 3 million barrels a day, in the past month.Judging by the picture emerging from Beijing, even if some U.S. cities and states begin to ease shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions, demand may not rebound quickly if citizens remain wary of travelling too far and gathering in crowded public spaces. Commuters will be the first to feel the tedium of increasing traffic as restrictions are eased. Those driving for pleasure — at least, those who venture forth — may experience empty roads for a while longer.(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-it-looks-like-when-the-world-stands-still-opinion/story-sFlQ02YCaifFNR1F6YnXLP.html

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the additional figures took the country’s total to 10,661 with 234 deaths. It said 8,042 people have recovered and been released from quarantine and 12,243 others were undergoing tests to determine whether they contracted the virus. “We must not loosen our guard until the last confirmed patient is recovered,” President Moon Jae-in said. South Korea’s caseload has been waning in recent weeks since it recorded hundreds of new cases every day between late February and early March, mostly in the southeastern city of Daegu and nearby areas. Despite the recent downward trend, South Korean officials have warned about the possibility of a broader “quiet spread” with people easing up on social distancing. Moon urged South Koreans to support his government in saving jobs and revitalizing the economy. “Government efforts alone aren’t enough amid a grave world economic crisis. Public solidarity and cooperation is also needed to revive our economy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-fewer-sick-in-south-korea-infections-rise-in-japan/story-a9OSzyyugh1SE5O4pu4z3O.html
19-04-2020||World||Chinese administration protecting Xi from global criticism over Covid-19, say analysts||The coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan city of central China last December, continues to wreak havoc across the world affecting millions of people. However, experts believe that since the very beginning, the mainland has been hiding facts regarding pandemic outbreak and now shielding its premier Xi Jinping from global criticism.Dr Suvrokamal Dutta, a political and foreign policy expert, who is also an external advisor with PV Savani University, Surat, told ANI, “Had China warned the world beforehand, perhaps the situation today would have been different across the world.”Over 2.3 million people in some 210 countries are corona positive, while over 1 lakh others have succumbed to the deadly infection. “Several suspicions have been raised against China in relation to this dreaded virus across the globe which are not just assumptions but have substance behind it. Now that China is getting cornered due to the outrage, it is quite obvious that the Chinese administration is trying to save its president and make small leaders at local level scapegoats in the process which it has already started,” the analyst said.He added, “This is being done with a two-pronged strategy; one by shielding the Chinese president from global criticisms and, 2; by deflecting the blame game on China at the global level. In this mission, the mainland has been using the western press as a soft toy.”Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of BILD, a German Newspaper, responding to the Jinping’s response over the contagion spread, said, “You (Xi Jinping), your government and your scientists had known that the virus is highly infectious. But you still left the world in absolute darkness about it.”Raising questions, Reichelt wrote, “You have created an inscrutable and non-transparent China. China was known as a surveillance state and is now using it to infect the world with the deadly disease. That is your political legacy.”Earlier, western experts had warned that the administration in the mainland is trying to absolve Jinping by using a section of the western media to influence public opinion globally.“There are clear indications that China is conducting activities in a persistent and systematic manner to influence public opinion-making, academia, think tanks and political decision-making among the member states of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in general and western capital cities in particular,” Siegfried O Wolf, Director of Research at Brussels-based think tank South Asia Democratic Front, told ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-administration-protecting-xi-from-global-criticism-over-covid-19-say-analysts/story-aBaVmeBwTE7EqTifEjevfK.html
19-04-2020||World||Covid-19: ‘It made a world of difference’, says UK doctor treated by ex-students||At his darkest moment with the coronavirus, Dr. Poorna Gunasekera glimpsed three rays of light.Following a severe deterioration in his Covid-19 symptoms, Gunasekera was rushed to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, southwest England, in the early hours of March 30, and three former students came to treat him.Upon entering the “red zone,” which is one step below the intensive care unit, the 57-year-old associate professor of biomedical sciences at the city’s university was put into isolation.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “It was wonderful that during that time, two of my former students, who are doctors, and another, who is a nurse, actually came and they identified themselves,” he told The Associated Press following his discharge from the hospital on April 9.His voice choked with emotion as he remembered the encounters.“It made a world of a difference to me,” he said. “I couldn’t have seen their faces, they were all in their protective things, but they came, and they not only treated me, they did some really difficult procedures ... it gave me so much strength to know that these wonderful people were actually there.” The feeling of respect was mutual.Gertrude Magama, a 45-year-old nurse from Zimbabwe who has known Gunasekera since she volunteered for one of his projects, said it was an “honor” to look after him.“I was touched when he reassured me that I was doing well when he was going through pain and discomfort,” she said. “In my eyes, he will forever be a valuable part of my future success in my nursing profession.” Gunasekera, better known to friends and colleagues as PG, grew up in Kandy, Sri Lanka, and led the Guard of Honour accorded to Queen Elizabeth II during her visit in October 1981.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage He came to the UK in 1999 on a Commonwealth scholarship to study for a Master’s at University College London and has been in the academic field ever since, and at Plymouth since 2012.Medical knowledge doesn’t necessarily bestow wisdom. He readily admits he underestimated his deterioration, even when his temperature soared above 39 C (102 F) and he lost 6.5 kilograms (around 14 pounds) with diarrhea. While people infected with the coronavirus often experience mild or moderate symptoms, possible complications like pneumonia can put their lives at risk.“As he is a doctor and trains doctors on a daily basis, I trusted him and gave him the benefit of doubt when he told me he was slowly starting to feel better,” said his 26-year-old daughter Saki. “In hindsight, I think he was just trying to channel crazy levels of positive thinking so as to calm both his and my own worries.” Eventually, Saki, who had mild symptoms along with her boyfriend George, “decided to overrule” her father and had him rushed to hospital. It was a decision he acknowledges ultimately saved his life.Gunasekera spent about a week hooked up to oxygen supplies as his lungs had taken a “battering.” Something curious occurred to Gunasekera on the “crucial” third or fourth day. He entered a pain-free phase “where the body stopped kind of talking to me” and his sense of proprioception — the awareness of one’s body in space — switched off too.“I wouldn’t call it levitation, but I lost senses,” he said. “It was the most peaceful state in life I’ve ever been in. It was almost as if some authority up there said ‘stop worrying’ and it was so convincing I actually stopped worrying.” He thinks it was a taste of nirvana, the ultimate goal of Buddhism when individuals enjoy indescribable peace.“It was a state of absolute bliss,” he said.Yet the worrying resurfaced as his health improved and a few days later, Gunasekera was moved to a ward with three other recovering patients: “I was the baby of the bunch.” On their first day, none could speak, since they were all hooked up to oxygen. But on the second day, an 80-year-old ex-Royal Navy officer, known only as Robert, single-handedly raised their spirits.“He was a piece of pure magic,” Gunasekera said.All four shared the same guilt of becoming new sources of outbreaks.“All of us were ready for a kind of stigmatization that could come and we understood it,” he said. “If the roles were reversed, I’d be careful of meeting someone who has been diagnosed as COVID-positive even if it was a long time ago.” Now he can’t wait to see his new partner, Hayley, and her family again after his 14-day self-isolation is over. He’s recuperating with Saki and George and his dog Barney in the tiny village of Filham in south Devon, and reflecting on how fortunate he is to get a second chance, unlike so many thousands of others. Britain has already had more than 15,000 people die in the pandemic and expects eventually to have the worst death toll in Europe.Gunasekera is especially admiring of the current generation of medical practitioners, of whom he has taught many, for being so much more “humble” than his.“Having gone through medical school myself, I remember we came out with this feeling that we are God’s gift to humanity, we were the supreme beings,” he said.The new generation, he said, are “taught to acknowledge that there is a limit to our knowledge, and that there is so much uncertainty out there.” Gunasekera hopes a more “cohesive society” will emerge that relates betterto the struggles of Britain’s National Health Service and that bridges the gap between generations.“Social distancing, though it’s physical distancing, the beauty is it’s brought emotional connections,” he said.“This is almost a reset button that society needed and perhaps we’ll come out of this a far better society, far better group of people than ever.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-it-made-a-world-of-difference-says-uk-doctor-treated-by-ex-students/story-mgOZstOqQCi3q7LlZxypeP.html

It includes photos of ballistic missile launchers, nuclear sites and vessels recommended for blacklisting.The panel made 39 recommendations to the Security Council, including on the blacklisting of 14 vessels.It said one vessel is registered in Sierra Leone and six were previously registered in the West African nation. Two are North Korean, one is Chinese, one Vietnamese, one was formerly registered in Togo, one was formerly registered in St. Kitts and Nevis, and the flag of one is unknown.China has been neighboring North Korea’s largest trading partner and has been considered critical to enforcing UN sanctions.The panel said the Chinese-flagged Yun Hong 8 — which it recommended for sanctions — made at least 10 port calls between February and October 2019 at the North Korean port of Nampo and delivered refined petroleum. It was also observed during that period receiving refined petroleum from other foreign-flagged vessels, which an unidentified UN member state said was likely for delivery to the DPRK, the experts said.China responded to the panel’s inquiry about the vessel by questioning “the serious lack of accuracy of the relevant information,” the report said.China’s Foreign Ministry and UN ambassador have said the country is implementing the sanctions.A photo in the report provided by an unnamed UN member state shows multiple coal-laden DPRK-flagged vessels at anchor near Lianyungang, China, which the panel said is being used to conduct ship-to-ship coal transfers. The panel said it is investigating a Vietnam-flagged vessel, the Phuong Linh 269, suspected of delivering coal originating in North Korea to the Chinese port of Qisha on multiple occasions.Despite a UN ban, the panel said North Korea’s coal exports increased in 2019. It cited an unnamed member state saying the DPRK exported 3.7 million tons of coal between January and August 2019, with an estimated value of $370 million.The Security Council also banned the export of earth and stone, which includes sand.The panel said an unidentified member state reported that a substantial sand-export operation from the DPRK to China has been carried out since May 2019 with over 100 illicit shipments involving at least 1 million tons of sand worth at least USD 22 million.“China responded that it attached great importance to the clues provided by the panel in relation to the smuggling of sand originating in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” but was unable to confirm that the sand had been transported to Chinese ports, the report said.As for the import of refined petroleum products, which is limited 500,000 barrels annually, the panel said the addition of larger foreign-flagged tankers delivering to the DPRK has expanded its illicit imports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-want-to-blacklist-14-ships-over-north-korea-sanctions/story-2Ymfn9QxXRrol7CUGjxsfP.html

Lauderdale to St. Louis (both in the US) on Thursday.Bob Pitts was surprised to find himself as the only passenger on the flight, and documented the entire experience in a series of video which he later gave to NBC News.He called it a “very, very, very unique experience” and recorded the conversation with the crew “as there was nobody to talk to”, according to NBC News.Pitts was headed to St Louis for his mother’s wake. He travelled in the flight wearing a bandanna as a face covering.The crew thanked Pitts “for coming along with us”, and even presented the safety instructions, but in a humourous way. Pitts was asked to wear his seatbelt, and ensure that the tray table is in its most “uncomfortable” position, according to the NBC report based on his videos.He was personally greeted by the flight attendant and pilot.The coronavirus pandemic has hit the aviation sector very hard. International seat capacity has dropped by almost 80 per cent from a year ago and half the world’s airplanes are in storage, suggesting the aviation industry may take years to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.Carriers including United Airlines Holdings Inc and Air New Zealand Ltd have warned they are likely to emerge from the crisis smaller, and there are fears others may not survive.Planemakers are looking at drastic cuts in wide-body production amid a slump in demand for the industry’s largest jetliners, manufacturing and supplier sources said.Deliveries of long-range jets, such as the Boeing Co 777 or 787 and Airbus SE A350 or A330, have been particularly badly hit as airlines seek deferrals and many withhold progress payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-he-was-the-lone-passenger-on-a-us-flight-got-vip-treatment/story-if167vGGdTxU4h9xbvhucM.html
19-04-2020||World||Australia demands coronavirus enquiry, adding to pressure on China||Australia on Sunday added to growing pressure on China over its handling of the novel coronavirus, questioning its transparency and demanding an international investigation into the origins of the virus and how it spread.The coronavirus is believed to have emerged in a market selling wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. It has spread around the world infecting some 2.3 million people and killing nearly 160,000 of them, according to Reuters calculations. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, said her concern about China’s transparency was at a “a very high point”.“The issues around the coronavirus are issues for independent review, and I think that it is important that we do that,” Payne told ABC television. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“In fact, Australia will absolutely insist on that.”Australia has managed to get its epidemic under control before it strained its public health system, reporting 53 new cases on Sunday. They took its total to 6,586, according to the health ministry data. There have been 71 deaths in Australia. The rate of increase in new cases has been below 1% for seven consecutive days - much lower than in many other countries.Payne’s call for an enquiry into the outbreak comes at time of tense ties between her country and its most important trading partner.Relations have deteriorated amid Australian accusations of Chinese meddling in domestic affairs and concern about what Australia sees as China’s growing, and undue, influence in the Pacific region.“My trust in China is predicated in the long-term,” Payne said. “My concern is around transparency and ensuring that we are able to engage openly.”Australia’s call for an investigation comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has been stepping up his criticism of China.Trump and his senior aides have also accused China of a lack of transparency after the coronavirus broke out. On Saturday, Trump said China should face consequences if it was “knowingly responsible” for the pandemic.China dismisses such criticism saying it has been open about the outbreak and in warning the world about it.‘Didn’t help’Last week, Trump suspended aid to the World Health Organization accusing it of being “China-centric”.The Geneva-based agency rejected that but Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt also criticised it, saying some of its response to the coronavirus was not helpful.“What we saw from some officials in Geneva, we think was a response which didn’t help the world,” Hunt told a briefing.“We have done well because we made our own decisions as a country.” Australia went against the advice of the WHO on Feb. 1 and banned people arriving from China. It later closed its borders and imposed strict curbs on public movements.Hunt said Australia was winning in its campaign against the coronavirus but had not yet won.“We have to focus on containment and capacity,” he said.Neighbouring New Zealand, which adopted one the world’s harshest lockdowns even before reporting a first death, has been even more successful in suppressing coronavirus. There were four new confirmed cases in New Zealand on Sunday, bringing the total of infections to 1,098. Eleven people have died, health ministry data showed.“I know it hasn’t been easy, but it has been working,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a televised briefing. She said her government will meet on Monday to decide whether to ease social distancing restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-demands-coronavirus-enquiry-adding-to-pressure-on-china/story-gIkLFtufvhlRqhpKzORWYJ.html
19-04-2020||World||‘Covid-19 virus cannot be man-made’, Wuhan virology lab chief denies it originated from institute||A premier Chinese virology laboratory in Wuhan, which is in the eye of the storm for allegedly being the source of the novel coronavirus, has for the first time refuted the charge, including those of US President Donald Trump, that the deadly virus originated from his lab before it spread across the world and wreaked havoc.China has come under increasing global pressure over lack of transparency in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far infected over 2,333,160 people and claimed more than 160,790 lives across the world.President Trump on Saturday said his administration was looking into reports that the novel coronavirus “escaped” from a Wuhan laboratory before it spread to the world. “We’re looking at it, a lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense,” Trump told the media when asked if there was an investigation into whether the coronavirus disease escaped from a lab in China’s Covid-19 ground-zero city of Wuhan. Ever since the virus came to light in Wuhan in December last year, speculation has been rife on whether the viral strain originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) or from its nearby Huanan Seafood Market. The WIV, specifically its P4 laboratory, is equipped to handle dangerous viruses.Though the laboratory denied the rumours in a statement in February, its director Yuan Zhiming, in a first media interview, rejected the rumours that his institute is the original source of Covid-19. “We know what kind of research is going at the institute and how the institute manages viruses and samples. There is no way that virus came from us,” he told the state-run CGTN TV channel. “We have a strict regulatory regimen. We have code of conduct for research so we are confident of that,” the director said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHe said since the Institute of Virology and the P4 lab is in Wuhan, “people can’t help but make associations”. Referring to US allegations, Yuan said it is unfortunate that some people are “deliberately misleading” people without having any “evidence or knowledge”. “This is entirely based on speculation. Part of the purpose is to confuse people and interfere with our anti-epidemic and scientific activities. They may have achieved their goal in some way but as a scientist and science and technology manager, I know it is impossible,” he said.The virus “cannot be man-made”, Yuan said, noting that there is no evidence to prove that Covid-19 is artificial. “Besides some scientists believe that to synthesise a virus requires extraordinary intelligence and workload. So never believed that we humans have the capability at this time to create such a virus,” he said.Yuan said after the virus broke out, his institute shared the genome sequence of Covid-19 and the latest research on the animal model Research and Development (R&D) with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the UN. “As for the institute of virology and the institute of laboratory animal science, we are first in the world to build animal models. After all conspiracy theories are not widespread,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cannot-be-man-made-wuhan-virology-lab-chief-deniescovid-19-virus-originated-from-institute/story-2ZvvnGJjTXAc3Loegq9e3K.html
19-04-2020||World||Epidemiologist Anthony Fauci, America’s new hero amid Covid-19 pandemic||Move over, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. There is a new feisty super senior in Washington who is captivating American hearts. Anthony Fauci is everywhere these days -- not just as the straight-talking coronavirus point man at President Donald Trump’s daily pandemic briefings but on T-shirts, coffee mugs and, yes, even donuts. Indeed, for many, the diminutive 79-year-old epidemiologist with a heavy Brooklyn accent is the country’s new hero -- a no-nonsense scientist speaking truth to a terrified nation led by a president who sometimes has a loose grasp of the facts. Nick Semeraro, owner of Donuts Delite in Rochester, New York, is just one of the business owners paying tribute to the doctor -- and simultaneously cashing in on Fauci-mania. Semeraro is churning out donuts that feature a picture of Fauci on edible paper where the hole should be -- his way of honoring the government’s top infectious disease expert. “I’ve never met a guy so admired by so many people. I have never heard one negative comment about him,” Semeraro told AFP. “In my opinion, he was like a cool calm voice in chaos,” he said of Fauci’s behavior at Trump’s daily coronavirus briefings, which can morph from a recounting of scientific facts into something more like a campaign rally. Semeraro said demand for his treats is so high that he has had to open up extra telephone lines, and is now shipping the Fauci donuts across the country.‘In Fauci We Trust’ Fauci’s craggy, bespectacled face is showing up elsewhere, too: on T-shirts with the slogan “In Fauci We Trust” and on coffee mugs with the line “Keep calm and wash your hands.” Americans can even buy Fauci socks and candles.  Online marketplace Etsy now offers more than 3,000 items dedicated to the doctor, who has been in the public eye for decades. On Facebook, the “Dr Anthony Fauci Fan Club” has more than 79,000 members. A video game called “Fauci’s Revenge” has lasers shooting out of his eyes to help defeat the virus. And in the US capital, one restaurant is selling the “Fauci Pouchy” -- cocktails in a pouch with a straw, for pickup and delivery, of course, in these days of the Great Lockdown. The original is made with vodka, lemonade, elderflower and grapefruit juice. “They’re selling out like crazy,” said Rohit Malhotra, beverage director at Capo Italian Deli in Washington, which has a backroom speakeasy. “Our highest was around 300 in a day.” ‘Sense and Science’Probably no one expected this soft-spoken man who first rose to prominence during the AIDS crisis in the 1980s to become a pop culture icon. With his frequent White House appearances, Fauci has been “propelled into everyone’s consciousness,” said Robert Thompson, an expert on television and popular culture at Syracuse University in New York. Fauci is all over social media, giving live interviews in his raspy voice on Snapchat, answering questions from basketball star Stephen Curry on Instagram and talking to late night funnyman Trevor Noah on YouTube. Many Americans like Fauci because of his direct way of explaining a world that has been transformed by the pandemic. He is often in the excruciating position of having to gently correct things Trump says as the president stands next to him, glowering. “In a moment of crisis like this, Americans are desperate for heroes,” said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. “Even in a difficult political environment, Fauci has insisted on speaking the truth -- even with an angry president standing besides him,” said Zelizer. For Thompson, “he seems to be talking sense and science.” ‘God bless his soul’ Tony Mastrangelo, who drove three hours to buy Fauci donuts in Rochester, said the doctor “is very honest and doesn’t spin anything a certain way. He doesn’t have an agenda which I think is awesome.” “He reminds me of my grandpa. God bless his soul. He was a little Italian guy who was just honest. And that’s how I think Fauci is,” said Mastrangelo. But Fauci has also earned himself enemies among US conservatives for correcting Trump. He has been the target of insults on social media, which led the government to boost the security around him. Trump himself retweeted a tweet with a #FireFauci hashtag, but said later he has confidence in him and called him a “fantastic guy.” Amid all the love and hate, Fauci remains stoic. When asked about a petition drive to have him declared People magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive for 2020, he replied: “When they show this to me at my age, I say, ‘Where were you when I was 30?’“ So far, more than 18,000 people have signed the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/epidemiologist-anthony-fauci-america-s-new-hero-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-ywjhKO7kndz5VLNDJChUgN.html
19-04-2020||World||Schools, shops re-open across Europe as Covid-19 cases plateau, but experts warn caution||People reading in downtown Rome, children going to elementary schools in Demark, Italians returning to bookstores and Austria allowing gardening stores to sell flowers again - life seems to return to normalcy as an initial sign of hope and optimism that the first wave of Europe’s devastating pandemic is coming to an end.After originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last December, the novel coronavirus infection that spread to at least 185 countries and regions across the world, killing over one lakh people and infecting more than 2 million others, has almost brought the daily lives to a standstill.However, a group of authors, including William Booth, Chico Harlan, James McAuley, Loveday Morris, and Michael Birnbaum say in their The Washington Post article that from Ireland to Greece, officials are seeing hopeful signs that the contagious infections have begun to plateau or recede after reaching a peak, further pointing to intensive care beds that are now started registering daily reduction in the number of new hospitalisations.In Paris, Milan, and Madrid, hospitals and staff that were stressed to their limits just a few weeks ago, as thousands of coughing, fevered, breathless patients surged through their doors, are now reporting empty beds in their ICUs, the article read.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Severo Ochoa Hospital in Madrid made international news with images last month of sick patients sleeping on the floor, waiting to be seen by a doctor. Now there are a few spare beds in Spain, the authors said the Post.But it’s not yet time to completely let up, officials caution.Hans Kluge, World Health Organization director for Europe, said “the storm cloud” of the pandemic “still hangs heavily over the European region.”Members of the European Union and Britain account for almost two-thirds of the 150,000 deaths recorded worldwide.At the same time, infectious disease experts also opine that Europe’s effort to slow the pandemic -- instituting quarantines across the continent more widespread and draconian than those seen during the plague in the Middle Ages -- has worked.“There is light at the end of the tunnel. But we are now at both a delicate and a dangerous stage in this pandemic,” Britain’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, told the country when he announced that its lockdown would continue for another three weeks at least.In Italy, there is a broad consensus that the emergency phase is starting to relent after a two-month period wherein more than 20,000 people died. Health authorities further reported that the number of patients in intensive care has fallen 25 per cent from the peak two weeks ago.Martin Hirsch, the director of the Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, the largest public hospital system in Europe, told the Post that in the Paris region, the hardest hit by the coronavirus, the total number of cases had stabilized for the first time since the start of the pandemic. “We are now in what we’ve called the ‘high plateau,’ “ Hirsch said, “which is to say a stabilization at a very high level, and always with an increase in the number of cases in our geriatric units, which face difficult situations. But we can share several encouraging signs.”As Spain finished its first month of confinement this week, Fernando Simon, who heads the Emergency Health Response for the Health Ministry, said quickly adopting social distancing and personal hygiene measures following the WHO’s declaration of the pandemic brought down the spread of COVID-19.However, Angela Hernandez Puente, vice-secretary general of Madrid’s Doctors Union, noted that the end to the contagious outbreak, according to her, may not be necessarily so close or what is considered to be a continual, linear decline. “It may be more like a zigzag, up and down.” “We’ve always seen light at the end of the tunnel, but the question is: At what cost?” she said, adding, “How much suffering in terms of the number of lives and the efforts on the part of health professionals?”Reiterating her words, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also stressed, “But it is thin ice.”“It is really a situation where caution is the order of the day and not overconfidence,” she opined over the first tentative steps taken by her people toward normalcy.

19-04-2020||World||Hungry, jobless Americans turning to food banks to survive Covid-19 pandemic||American families slammed by the coronavirus pandemic are turning more and more to food banks to get by, waiting hours for donations in lines of cars stretching as far as the eye can see.And with 22 million people out of work seemingly overnight as business after business closes under the Great Lockdown, these charities feeding hungry and scared people fear the day will come when they cannot cope with the tsunami of demand.On Tuesday, for instance, some 1,000 cars lined up at a distribution center set up in Pennsylvania by the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Demand for its bags of food soared nearly 40 percent in March.At eight centers like that one, some 227 tonnes of food were placed in the trunks of cars of families suddenly unable to put meals on the table, said the organization’s vice president Brian Gulish.“A lot of people are utilizing our service for the first time. They’ve never turned to a food bank before,” said Gulish. So they do not know there is a network of 350 distribution points in southwest Pennsylvania.“That’s why those lines are so long. Because they don’t know that network that we have,” Gulish added.All over America, from New Orleans to Detroit, people abruptly stripped of a paycheck are flocking to food banks -- sad scenes of desperation among people waiting for their small share of stimulus money included in the $2.2 trillion emergency relief package approved by Congress last month. Perhaps the most dramatic picture of some Americans’ new food insecurity unfolded April 9 in San Antonio, Texas, where a staggering 10,000 cars showed up at one food bank, with some families arriving the night before to just sit and wait.“We have gone for months without work,” a woman who gave her name only as Alana said at a food distribution center in Chelsea in suburban Boston.“I find a lady yesterday with a 15-day-old baby, a newborn. The husband is not working, she has two more kids. She was having no food in her house,” said Alana.Everywhere, food bank officials say their needs in the pandemic era have skyrocketed all of a sudden -- by 30 percent, for example, at a network in Akron, Ohio.“We built a supply chain over the years that would serve a certain anticipated need for food. Ramping that up 30 percent overnight is nearly impossible,” said Dan Flowers, CEO of the Akron-Canton Regional Foodbank.In part this is because the food banks are caught up in the maelstrom that has hit the US food industry.With restaurants closed because of the lockdown, Americans are stocking up on everything in grocery stores, which no longer can make as many product donations as they usually do. Ditto for restaurants that often donate surplus food to homeless shelters. Fortunately, the US food industry is in fact making donations.Food banks including 200 local branches of an organization called Feeding America are even getting special kinds of loads to hand out.US food giant JM Smucker, maker of many well-known products such as Folgers coffee, is a regular donor and has sent extra pallets of food to banks in Ohio. And a distillery called Ugly Dog in Michigan dispatched a truckload of hand sanitizing gel made from residual alcohol and packed in pint bottles that normally hold booze, said Flowers. Worn out ‘ Cash donations are also coming in, ranging from anonymous people to the likes of Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, who donated $100 million to Feeding America.“If it wasn’t for that, these food banks would not be able to meet this demand,” said Flowers.The Food Bank For New York City, a major one in the Big Apple, is ordering higher volume than it normally does, said Zanita Tisdale, its director of member engagement.“We know if we’re going to go back in a week the cost may have increased significantly or the turnaround time for getting that product to our warehouse may have extended exponentially,” she said.As supply chains get more complex and the legions of desperate families grow, there is the issue of those manning the food banks, who are simply exhausted after weeks of toil.“Our staff is worn out. They’ve been working so hard. We’re all ready for this to end,” said Flowers.After a month of all this frenetic work, the food banks are holding up, at least for now. But the future -- like for so much of the new world created by the pandemic -- is uncertain.“The supply is still good, but a month from now we don’t know,” said Gulish.The relief plan passed by Congress includes $850 million for food banks and Flowers says he expects that cash to start flowing in June.“I think we’ll get back on track then. I’m mostly concerned about the next six to eight weeks,” said Flowers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungry-jobless-americans-turning-to-food-banks-to-survive-covid-19-pandemic/story-2OLy6bktMqr6hxdnIgYtjP.html
19-04-2020||World||China declares Wuhan low-risk area despite new Covid-19 cases being reported in country||China has classified the coronavirus epicentre Wuhan as a low-risk area, days after it revised the city’s death toll by 50 per cent, even as 16 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the country, health officials said on Sunday. According to the risk criteria defined in a guideline issued by China’s State Council, cities, counties and districts with no newly confirmed cases in the last 14 days are categorised as low-risk areas.Those with fewer than 50 cases or those with over 50 but without a concentrated outbreak are classified as mid-risk areas, and those with over 50 cases as well as a concentrated outbreak are classified as high-risk areas. China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Sunday that 16 new confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported in the country on Saturday, with nine imported cases and seven local transmissions. The death toll remained at 4,632 as no new fatalities were reported on Saturday, it said. The overall confirmed cases in China had reached 82,735 by Saturday, including 1,041 patients who were still being treated, 77,062 people who were discharged after recovery, and 4,632 people who died of the disease. The NHC said the total number of imported cases climbed to 1,575. Another 44 new asymptomatic cases were reported on Saturday, the NHC said, adding that 999 asymptomatic cases, including 186 from abroad, were still under medical observation. Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged in December last year and spread to the world like wildfire, has been classified as low-risk area, 12 days after lifting the lockdown over the city of 11 million people, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The Wuhan municipal authorities on Friday revised the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases and casualties abruptly amid criticism from the US and several other countries for its alleged cover-up and under-reporting of the cases. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman on Friday denied any cover up and accused the US of attempting to divert public attention.“I want to emphasise that the revision of the data regarding infectious disease is an internationally accepted practice,” Zhao Lijian told a media briefing, defending the sharply upward revision of figures. He said in the early stage of the outbreak there were some late reports, omissions, and inaccurate information. “But there has never been any concealment, and we’ll never allow any concealment,” Zhao said. As of April 16, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Wuhan was increased by 325 to 50,333 and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869 and national death toll to 4,632 people. The low risk classification also followed as the virus cases and deaths abated in the city as per official notifications. While declaring Wuhan as a low-risk area China has strengthened nucleic acid testing to detect coronavirus for people leaving Wuhan. The test is required before people resume work, production or study elsewhere, it said. Those who are set to work as teachers, medical workers or service providers at public places after leaving Wuhan should all undergo nucleic acid testing before leaving, which is free of charge, noted the circular issued by a State Council inter-agency task force. Others leaving Wuhan are encouraged to take nucleic acid testing on a voluntary basis and pay testing fees, the report said. By the end of Friday, the central province of Hubei, which administers Wuhan, had 76 low-risk cities and counties and none with high risk or medium risk, Xinhua report said. Hubei with over 56 million population remained under lockdown along with Wuhan from January 23. On Friday, Hubei reported 33 asymptomatic cases but newly confirmed Covid-19 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-china-declares-wuhan-low-risk-area/story-mqViu6l9BBoxlLE7QDp5BK.html
19-04-2020||World||IT services giant Cognizant attacked by ‘Maze’ ransomware||Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., one of the world’s largest providers of IT services, said it became a victim of a ransomware attack that has caused disruptions to its clients.The company, which has about 300,000 employees, said it was hit by the “Maze” ransomware group and is engaging law enforcement authorities.The anonymous hackers behind Maze have made headlines in recent months for publicly holding its victims hostage by threatening to leak company information if the target doesn’t pay its ransom.“Cognizant can confirm that a security incident involving our internal systems, and causing service disruptions for some of our clients, is the result of a Maze ransomware attack,” the company said in a statement. “Our internal security teams, supplemented by leading cyber defense firms, are actively taking steps to contain this incident.”Hackers linked to Maze have denied involvement in the attack on Cognizant, according to computer security blog BleepingComputer. That does not mean, however, that Maze isn’t responsible for the attack, according to Brett Callow, a threat analyst at Emisoft.“The group could simply be A/B testing alternative negotiating strategies to see whether permitting companies to control the release of information, at least during the early stages, results in better outcomes,” Callow said in an email. “At this point in time, groups are likely not finding it so easy to extort money from companies as many are financially distressed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.”The alleged targets of Maze have included the city of Pensacola in Florida, cybersecurity insurance provider Chubb Ltd. and Canadian construction company Bird Construction Inc., according to various media reports. The Maze group has claimed to post files from all three companies on its website.In January, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an alert warning to U.S. companies about the Maze tactic of threatening to release company information, CyberScoop reported, citing an advisory it obtained.Cognizant shares have declined 13% this year, compared with the 11% drop in the S&P 500 Index.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-services-giant-cognizant-attacked-by-maze-ransomware/story-yXNMwl29vX30tUl8PA0MiN.html
19-04-2020||World||Japan Covid-19 domestic cases cross 10,000||Japanese health ministry said Sunday that 568 new cases of the coronavirus were reported the day before, bringing a domestic total to 10,361. A combined total including 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo earlier this year came to 11,073, with 174 deaths.The number of cases is still relatively small compared to the U.S. and Europe, but that’s only as many as Japan’s limited testing has detected and actual infections are believed to be far more widespread.Japan has finally started setting up additional testing centers in Tokyo and elsewhere, allowing primary care doctors to send suspected patients directly to testing stations rather than having them go through public health centers to screen eligibility, an earlier requirement that had prevented and delayed testing and treatment of many people.Experts have noted that their strategy of going after clusters to trace infections is no longer effective to keep up with the surging cases and more tests are needed.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday expanded a state of emergency, which was limited to Tokyo and six other urban areas, to all of Japan, in a bid to prevent further spread of the virus nationwide amid concerns that hospitals are already overburdened with influx of patients.It took two months for the cases to reach 1,000 since the first case was detected in mid-January, but the spread of the infections has accelerated in recent weeks and the number doubled from around 5,000 in just 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-covid-19-domestic-cases-cross-10-000/story-uMy3N6xYrxkzLHTMDQldNI.html
19-04-2020||World||China tests thousands to calculate true spread of coronavirus||When Tiger Ye caught the coronavirus in January, his mother and grandmother nursed him back to health. Later that month, both women developed fevers, but with Wuhan’s hospitals overflowing they chose instead to bear it out at home.Months later, with China’s epidemic appearing under control, the pair took a blood test that confirmed they had in fact contracted and fought off the virus. But they were never counted in the country’s official tally of more than 82,000 infected and nearly 5,000 dead.“They are lucky to have recovered all by themselves,” said Ye.Now, amid accusations that China has under-reported its virus data, the nation is embarking upon a program that could capture the true scale of their outbreak. If undertaken globally, it could find millions more infections than the 2.1 million currently detected.The effort, called a serological survey, involves researchers taking blood samples from a representative group of people to see if they have generated antibodies to fight the virus, a sign they’ve been infected. Scientists then extrapolate from there the magnitude of the pathogen’s spread in the broader population. Such studies could also shed light on how the virus transmitted among people, including what role seemingly less-affected groups, like children, have played in its dispersion.China Boosts Virus Death Tally, Rejects Accusations of Cover UpMore DeathsChina has refuted charges from U.S. intelligence officials that it concealed the extent of its outbreak, although multiple revisions to its epidemic data have fueled mistrust both domestically and from other countries. This week, the country added more than 1,200 deaths to its official count, including people who died at home without being tested and late reporting from overwhelmed hospitals.While China has a long history of questionable economic statistics, under-reporting when it comes to the coronavirus is an issue across the world. New York City recently added more than 3,700 previously unreported deaths to its count, and the World Health Organization says many countries will likely have to review their numbers. The lack of widespread testing is one of the main reasons. Besides people like Ye’s mother and grandmother -- who choose not to or aren’t able to go to hospital -- many countries simply don’t have enough testing kits to detect all their cases.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAnother significant factor behind under-counting is the existence of a puzzling group that show no outward signs of illness, known as asymptomatic infections. Such patients are unlikely to be tested because they have no idea they’re even sick. Early indications are that asymptomatic carriers have played a key role in the pandemic spreading as wide and fast as it has.China’s Data on Symptom-Free Cases Shows Most Never Get SickNo SymptomsEven after bringing its official count of new infections to zero, China is still detecting hundreds of asymptomatic cases by testing people who’ve come into contact with infected patients, showing that the virus hasn’t been eradicated even as the country’s biggest cities -- including Wuhan, where the pathogen first emerged -- start resuming normal activity.“In all systems, cases are under-reported,” said Antoine Flahault, a public health professor at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. “Some infections are asymptomatic and cannot be detected by the health care system, some test results come back negative when the person is actually infected, and some can be mis-classified as cases of pneumonia or influenza without any proper testing procedures.”As China’s Virus Cases Reach Zero, Experts Warn of Second WaveAs countries that have quelled their first outbreaks worry that the highly-contagious virus will return in subsequent waves, the survey’s findings could help policymakers plan a better defense for its resurgence, including ways to normalize economic activity while controlling infection. China is undertaking serological surveys in a number of regions, Feng Luzhao, a researcher with the country’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in Beijing on April 2.Group ImmunityWhile whole populations are unlikely to have mass immunity, some groups -- children, or older people -- could be found to have group immunity, allowing economically-costly social distancing measures to be tailored to minimize disruption.Other countries are making similar efforts on a smaller scale: New York is testing medical and other essential workers for antibodies, while Italy has tested everyone in Vò, a small town of 3,300 near Venice. Their aim is to create a full “epidemiological picture” of the outbreak, and findings indicate that many were infected but had no symptoms.As the outbreak’s original epicenter and the only major country at a mature enough stage of its epidemic to start concertedly looking back, China’s serological effort will be closely tracked by the global scientific community.In Wuhan, investigators are blood testing a random group of 11,000 people who lived in the city for no less than two weeks between January and March.Those participating in the survey, which includes all members of chosen households and people like police officers, community workers and taxi drivers, take tests for the virus and for antibodies generated to fight it, according to local newspaper Hubei Daily.The survey’s findings will be used to “inform adjustment in response strategies,” state media CCTV reported.China has done this before. In 2003, researchers embarked on a serological survey after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, outbreak, which sickened 8,000 people and killed almost 800, mostly in Asia.The study conducted in southern Guangdong province, where SARS emerged, involved 130 patients diagnosed with the disease along with 119 close contacts and 100 healthy people. It revealed that most of those who have been infected with the SARS virus developed long-lasting antibodies that protected them and likely those around them against future infection.How Herd Immunity Works, Offering Key to Pandemic’s End: GraphicIn 2006, China’s health authorities also launched a nationwide survey of 79,000 people for hepatitis B. It found that the total number of children infected fell by 80 million since 1992 thanks to mass vaccination efforts, and there were still 93 million carriers concentrated in the country’s western hinterland.In an interview with state news agency Xinhua in mid-January, Wang Chen, the dean of Peking Union Medical College, described a serological survey as “the most pressing task” for the country, because it will help policymakers figure out if the coronavirus will disappear like SARS did 17 years ago, or is here to stay like the flu.It could also determine if the virus can linger in people for a long time the way hepatitis B does in those without sufficient immunity. This tendency to “linger” could be why Korean doctors have found what they termed a “re-activation” of the coronavirus in 51 recovered patients.Many ChallengesDespite its urgency, serological surveys are challenging to conduct right, especially in populations as vast as China’s.A key determinant of the survey’s accuracy is whether the sample of people chosen best represents the population at large, said Jeffery Gilbert, an epidemiologist on the Covid-19 incident management team at the World Health Organization.“China is a mix of European country-sized provinces with very different population densities,” Gilbert said. “Without enormous amounts of testing throughout the country, a full picture of China is exceedingly challenging to get.”China has disclosed that it is testing 11,000 in Wuhan but not how many people are involved in other provinces and cities. China’s CDC didn’t respond to questions from Bloomberg on the survey.Another challenge lies in the antibody test employed. Western biotech companies have launched tests that have been found to be inaccurate after countries had ordered millions.Biotechs Are Battling to Make First Good Blood Test For Covid-19“It must be highly specific and sensitive – that is, it must identify only SARS-CoV-2 and not cross-react with antibodies from other coronavirus infections,” said David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, referring to the scientific name of the new coronavirus.An average person’s blood could also have antibodies for common viruses like influenza, which is from the same coronavirus family as SARS-CoV-2.This difficulty in differentiating antibodies is what’s stopping South Korea, which has also shown success in curbing its outbreak, from kicking off its serological survey. The country’s CDC told Bloomberg it is testing whether certain antibodies are reacting only to the new virus, and not others.The agency won’t initiate a serological survey until researchers have verified the antibody test’s specificity, it said.“If the Chinese test is validated and meets sensitivity and specificity standards, then the results will be a valid reflection of previous infection in the community,” Heymann said.Beyond the true number of infections, a serological survey will be able to ascertain the exposure of various groups to the virus. It could also yield insight into the susceptibility of those with previous medical conditions.‘Help Us’“One of the burning questions has been about younger people and how much of a part they played in the virus’s spread,” the WHO’s Gilbert said. While official infection tallies skew toward older people, the survey could find that children were just as infected but their immune systems acted more quickly to fight the virus, preventing serious symptoms from developing, he said.Should Schools Close to Fight Virus? These Places Say NoHotly-debated questions, such as whether school closures are necessary to stem the virus’s spread, could be answered definitively with these sorts of findings.“A lot of people are waiting with anticipation to learn more,” Gilbert said, “It will help us develop or change guidance for other countries where they haven’t been hit so hard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tests-thousands-to-calculate-true-spread-of-coronavirus/story-0YbLqoZaAE2LXhsOr0dIaJ.html
19-04-2020||World||‘China is number one’: Trump claims China’s Covid-19 fatalities way ahead of US||President Donald Trump has expressed his doubts over the official Chinese figures on the number of deaths in their country due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, claiming that the fatalities were way ahead of the US. Trump’s comments come two days after another 1,300 fatalities were added to the official count in the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak started. The revision puts China’s overall death toll to more than 4,600. “We are not number one; China is number one just so you understand,” Trump told reporters at a White House news conference on Saturday. “They are way ahead of us in terms of death. It’s not even close.” According to Trump, when highly-developed healthcare systems of the UK, France, Belgium, Italy and Spain had high fatality rates, it was O.33 in China. The president asserted that the actual number was much more than the official Chinese death toll figures, which he said were “unrealistic”. “You know it, I know it and they know it, but you don’t want to report it. Why?” he asked. “You will have to explain that. Someday I will explain it.” He also highlighted that on a per-capita basis, the mortality rate in the US was far lower than other nations of Western Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-covid-19-death-toll-way-ahead-of-us-says-prez-trump/story-8lTrH5OS2q6SwSUlpxGv4L.html
19-04-2020||World||UK health service counts the cost of funding cuts amid Covid-19 crisis||Britain’s state-run National Health Service, described by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as the country’s “beating heart” after saving his life, is creaking under the strain of coronavirus after a decade of underinvestment. While millions across the country take to the streets each week to applaud cherished health workers, doctors and nurses are warning that they are being left to fight the virus without proper protective equipment.That, along with insufficient Covid-19 testing across Britain, is blamed by experts on a decade of underinvestment following the global financial crisis.“The UK National Health Service is acknowledged to have suffered from a funding crisis since 2010,” Elias Mossialos, professor of health policy at the London School of Economics, told AFP.“NHS expenditure is 7.6 percent of (Britain’s) GDP, which is approximately the same as it was in 2012.”Mossialos said a slowdown in annual NHS budget increases “has hindered the preparedness and response to coronavirus”.£34 billion more Ahead of their general election victory in December, Johnson’s Conservatives pledged to boost NHS funding by £34 billion ($41.9 billion, 38.4 billion euros). But because the figure covers a four-year period until 2024, inflation could take a large bite out of the sum.The new government has also promised 50,000 more nurses through better retention and new recruits, as well as an additional 6,000 doctors. New hospitals have also been pledged, but people did not count on one being built so soon.Earlier this month, Britain opened a temporary 4,000-bed hospital to treat the most seriously ill coronavirus patients -- the Nightingale in London.While Johnson’s recent experience might prompt him to pump more money than promised into the NHS, experts say a big problem lies in Britain’s largest employer struggling to recruit staff.That could even worsen following the country’s exit from the European Union.The NHS, which claims to be Europe’s biggest employer with a staff of more than 1.3 million, currently has around 100,000 vacancies.Britain’s government has responded to the pandemic by asking doctors and nurses to come out of retirement, even if many fall into the category of being highly at risk of catching the virus.“In terms of nurses, the UK is one of very few OECD countries where the number of nurses has been going down,” said Franco Sassi, professor of international health policy at Imperial College London.The NHS suffers also from a severe shortage of beds, according to Mossialos. OECD data reveals that the UK has only 2.5 beds per 1,000 people, compared with six per 1,000 in France and eight per 1,000 in Germany, he said. The UK meanwhile has around 6.6 critical care beds per 100,000 -- around half France’s total and around fives times fewer than in Germany.NHS appreciation News bulletins show NHS nurses in good spirits, applauding and making guards of honour for patients who have beaten the virus that has so far claimed more than 15,400 lives in Britain. But the fact is that most have been left exhausted.“We will see the effect at the other side of the epidemic,” said Fiona Johnson, spokeswoman for the health think tank Nuffield Trust.“You have an exhausted workforce,” she said, noting also that many operations had been postponed to allow hospitals to deal with coronavirus patients.Britons are making a point of paying tribute to the NHS, which was set up in 1948 and has long been a cherished institution.At 1900 GMT each Thursday, people come out of their homes to show their appreciation for its staff and Britain’s other key workers, by applauding for a couple of minutes. Children are seen banging frying pans.Meanwhile, a 99-year-old British World War II veteran, Tom Moore, on Thursday completed 100 laps of his garden in a fundraising challenge for healthcare staff, raising around £20 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-service-counts-the-cost-of-funding-cuts-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-AZkzVr0o5UFzyOObdWf2dI.html
19-04-2020||World||‘Mistake is a mistake’: Trump warns China of ‘consequences’ for Covid-19 outbreak||President Donald Trump on Saturday said China should face “consequences” if it was found to have been “knowingly responsible” for the novel coronavirus outbreak.“It could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn’t, and the whole world is suffering because of it,” Trump said at the daily briefing by the White House task force on coronavirus.“If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake,” he added. “But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, I mean, then sure there should be consequences.”The American president offered no evidence, but conservative media and his allies have for some time now contended, again with no proof, that the virus escaped a virology lab in Wuhan, the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak that last week revised its death toll by adding 50% previously unreported fatalities.There have been news reports of this lab receiving US funding and US diplomats expressing serious concerns about safety at the facility. There have also been reports in conservative media that US intelligence agencies have launched an investigation into the lab and they expect to submit a report shortly.Asked about the role of the lab, Trump told reporters Friday, “We’re looking at that. A lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense. They talk about a certain kind of bat, but that bat wasn’t in that area. If you can believe this, that’s what they’re down to now, is bats. But that bat is not in that area. That bat wasn’t sold at that wet zone. It wasn’t sold there. That bat is 40 miles away.” The origin of the pandemic is traced, by some, to a wet market (a fresh produce market) in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have been transmitted to humans.President Trump began pointing to China as the origin of the pandemic first by identifying the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus”, which fueled anti-Asian sentiments already coursing through the country. Other US officials chose to call it the “Wuhan virus”, after the city where the epidemic is believed to have started. Some US officials and Republican lawmakers attacked China alleging it was concealing the true magnitude of it outbreak; they cited intelligence reports .As the American president came under mounting criticism for his administration’s delayed and botched response to the epidemic, he went after the World Health Organization, accusing it of helping China conceal the magnitude or its outbreak and mismanaging its own response to the crisis.China has since revised its numbers upwards, by 50% in Wuhan.But US officials have sought more transparency. Trump, who had previously said China numbers are “larger” than America’s and that it has the “most” in the world, said Saturday, “China is number one, just so you understand. China is number one by a lot. It’s not even close.”“Does anybody really believe this number?” Trump said later, referring to China’s reported mortality rate of 0.33 per 100,000 people, on a chart presented at the briefing by Deborah birx, coordinator of the task force.Birx said that she had included China on the chart to show how “unrealistic”those numbers are. The US mortality rate is 11.24 per 100,000, in comparison, which is much higher in comparison to China’s reported numbers, but much lower than some of the other countries such as Belgium, which led the world with 45.2 fatalities per 100,000, followed by Spain with 42.81, and Italy with 37.64.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mistake-is-a-mistake-donald-trump-warns-china-of-consequences-for-covid-19-outbreak/story-XgTmxWy8bZwIFRT32AUwrO.html

Because I’ve seen a great disparity in this country.”“They go after Christian churches but they don’t tend to go after mosques,” he said.Ramadan, which begins at sunset on Thursday, falls a week and a half after Easter, when some Christians bucked public health regulations to attend illicit services.Asked whether he thought imams would refuse to follow social distancing orders, Trump responded: “No, I don’t think that at all.” “I am somebody that believes in faith. And it matters not what your faith is. But our politicians seem to treat different faiths very differently.”Trump has been accused of anti-Muslim rhetoric in the past and one of his first acts upon entering office was to ban travelers from several Muslim-majority countries.More than 700,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the United States, forcing religious communities across the country to shutter their doors. The Islamic Society of North America, alongside Muslim medical experts, has urged the suspension of group prayers, among other gatherings.Jewish Americans were likewise forced to turn traditional Passover seders into virtual affairs when the eight-day holiday began at sundown on April 8.Despite similar measures taken across much of the Christian community, a Virginia pastor who continued to preach in defiance of stay-at-home rules died a week ago of coronavirus. And pastors at two megachurches in Florida and Louisiana have been arrested on misdemeanor charges for flouting stay-at-home orders. “The Christian faith is treated much differently than it was,” Trump added on Saturday, “and I think it’s treated very unfairly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-distancing-rules-should-be-same-for-ramadan-easter-says-donald-trump/story-sHGG95ykFJPWWG8fEIjcoJ.html

Mahamat Nour Ahmed Ibedou, secretary general of the Chadian Convention for the Protection of Human Rights (CTDDH), made similar accusations. Prison officials had “locked the prisoners in a small cell and refusing them food and water for three days because they were accused of belonging to Boko Haram”, Ibedou told AFP. “It’s horrible what has happened.” The government denied the allegations. “There was no ill-treatment,” Chad Justice Minister, Djimet Arabi, told AFP by telephone. “Toxic substances were found in their stomachs. Was it collective suicide or something else? We’re still looking for answers,” he said, adding that the investigation was still ongoing. One of the prisoners was transferred to hospital on Thursday, but he was “faring much better” and had rejoined “the other 13 prisoners still alive and who are doing very well,” the minister said. Major operation against Boko Haram Earlier this week, the minister told AFP the captured men had been transferred to Ndjamena on Tuesday evening and handed over to the court system for trial.The military operation against Boko Haram killed more than a thousand of the group’s militants and cost the lives of 52 soldiers, a Chadian army spokesman said. The operation ran from March 31 to April 8.It was launched in response to a devastating attack on Chadian troops on March 23 on a base at Bohoma, in the Lake Chad marshlands, that killed 98 soldiers. It was the largest one-day loss the army has ever suffered.Since then, Idriss has warned his allies in the region that Chad’s army will no longer take part in operations outside the country.The force, considered one of the best in the region, has fought Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region as part of the Joint Multinational Force with Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger.But on Friday, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said Chad remained committed to the G5 Sahel anti-jihadist force operating in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/44-suspected-members-of-boko-haram-found-dead-in-chad-prison-report/story-2OtDAMtWliuNb16B35VZ5M.html
19-04-2020||World||Europe’s Covid-19 death toll tops 100,000, protests against curbs spread in US||Coronavirus deaths surged past 100,000 in hardest-hit Europe on Saturday as hundreds of Americans frustrated by lockdown orders and egged on by President Donald Trump staged protests in several US cities.As the latest grim data emerged, performers from around the world kicked off an hours-long live-streamed concert aimed at supporting health care workers, and cultivating a sense of community in a time of crisis. The six-hour event, which includes A-listers ranging from cellist Yo-Yo Ma to award-winning teen singer Billie Eilish to the Rolling Stones, was brought together by the advocacy group Global Citizen with the World Health Organization.Worldwide, more than 2,289,500 people have tested positive for the highly contagious virus.Europe accounts for a total of 100,510 deaths -- nearly two-thirds of the 157,539 fatalities worldwide, according to an AFP tally, while nearly a quarter of deaths have come in the United States.The United States has the highest caseload of any country and by Saturday had lost some 38,000 people to the virus, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. Progress was marked in some places, with New York state reporting the lowest number of deaths in weeks, which Governor Andrew Cuomo attributed largely to social distancing. But as Americans and others around the world chafe after weeks under shelter-at-home orders, rising resentment erupted this week.Demonstrations Saturday at the capitols of states including Texas, Maryland, New Hampshire and Ohio drew hundreds of people, many waving American flags and some carrying arms, demanding a quick end to state-ordered confinement. ‘Carried away’ The spreading anti-lockdown movement drew encouragement Friday from Trump, who tweeted that three states should be “liberated” from the stay-home orders.Trump has called for a rapid return to normality to limit the devastating damage to the US economy -- while largely leaving the final decision on easing lockdowns to state officials.The US leader told reporters on Saturday that some state governors had gotten “carried away” and imposed “unreasonable” restrictions.But Americans, by two-to-one, disagree with the protesters. A new Pew survey found that most were more concerned about ending home confinement too soon rather than too late.At a White House briefing, Trump also warned that China could face consequences if it was “knowingly responsible” for the coronavirus outbreak which began in the city of Wuhan in December.“It could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn’t,” Trump said. “And now the whole world is suffering.”“If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake,” he said. “But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, then there should be consequences.”Trump also cast doubt on official Chinese figures showing the country has suffered just 0.33 deaths per 100,000 people.“The number’s impossible,” he said.The United States, according to a chart displayed at the briefing, has had 11.24 deaths per 100,000 people while France has had 27.92 and Spain 42.81.China’s death toll jumped to 4,632 on Friday after it raised by 50 percent the number of fatalities for Wuhan. ‘Under control’ Mounting evidence suggests that social distancing slowed the pandemic after more than half of humanity -- 4.5 billion people -- were confined to their homes.Many countries are testing only the most serious cases and the number of confirmed infections is likely to be a fraction of the true total. Stay at home orders have been enforced in Italy and Spain, still the hardest-hit countries in Europe, with 23,227 and 20,043 fatalities respectively, followed by France with 19,323 deaths. Britain’s overall death toll is officially 15,464.As governments around the world grapple with when and how to ease lockdowns that have crippled the global economy, Spain on Saturday extended its nationwide lockdown to May 9.Japan, Britain and Mexico have all expanded their movement restrictions.Yet elsewhere, signs that the outbreak could be easing prompted Switzerland, Denmark and Finland to begin reopening shops and schools this week.Germany has declared the virus “under control” after 3,400 deaths, and is beginning the delicate task of lifting some restrictions without triggering a secondary outbreak -- with some shops allowed to reopen Monday, and some children returning to school within weeks.Parts of Italy began emerging from lockdown too, with Venice residents strolling around quiet canals.Iran also allowed some Tehran businesses to reopen Saturday despite the Middle East’s deadliest outbreak.“How can I keep staying home? My family is hungry,” said Hamdollah Mahmoudi, 45, a shopworker in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar.1,000 deaths in Africa Virtually no corner of the world has been left untouched, with deaths in Africa passing 1,000.Nigeria announced the death of a top aide to President Muhammadu Buhari.Meanwhile, many of the world’s 260 million Orthodox Christians are preparing to mark Easter without attending church services. In Zimbabwe, mass rallies and military parades to mark the country’s 40th anniversary of independence from British colonial rule were cancelled.And Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Elizabeth II will not mark her birthday on Tuesday with a traditional gun salute.Signs of the global economic carnage wrought by the pandemic are accumulating, with China reporting its first GDP contraction since at least the early 1990s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-s-covid-19-death-toll-tops-100-000-protests-against-curbs-spread-in-us/story-OePjOlRw74ySJoqW4OdsdJ.html

Trump, who as expressed his disappointment over handling of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) by China, alleged non-transparency and initial non-cooperation with the US on this issue.“If they were knowingly responsible, yeah, then there should be consequences,” he told reporters at a White House news conference on Saturday. “You’re talking about, you know, potentially lives like nobody’s seen since 1917.” Trump said his relationship with China was very good till the time the deadly Covid-19 swept the world. “The relationship was good when we were signing that, but then, all of a sudden, you hear about this. So, it’s a big difference. “You know, the question was asked would you be angry at China. Well, the answer very well might be a very resounding yes, but it depends,” Trump said. The president underlined that there was a big difference between a mistake that got out of control or something done deliberately. “In either event, they should have let us go in. You know, we asked to go in very early and they didn’t want us in. I think they knew it was something bad and I think they were embarrassed,” Trump said. He claimed that China was pitching for former vice president Joe Biden, who is the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party for the presidential election. “If sleepy Joe Biden wins, China will own the United States,” Trump said, adding that his administration had gained billions of dollars from China due to his assertive trade policies. The president said the coronavirus crisis had hurt everybody. “We had the greatest economy in the world by far. China isn’t even close. Go back two months. And we’re going to keep it that way,” he said. Trump asserted that Iran was now a much different country than it was before. “When I first came in, Iran was going to take over the entire Middle East,” he said. “Right now, they just want to survive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-warns-china-of-consequences-if-found-responsible-for-covid-19/story-Abx3e6ngecVM5vp5rV5vFL.html

19-04-2020||World||After China, others may revise death tolls: WHO||The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday that many countries would likely follow China in revising up their death tolls once they start getting the coronavirus crisis under control. Wuhan admitted missteps in tallying its death toll, abruptly raising the city’s count by 50%.The WHO said Wuhan had been overwhelmed by the virus, which emerged in the city in December, and the authorities had been too swamped to ensure every death and infection was properly recorded.Maria van Kerkhove, the WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead, said, “I would anticipate that many countries are going to be in a similar situation where they will have to go back and review records.” Wuhan added 1,290 deaths to its toll, raising the total to 3,869, and added a further 325 cases, bringing the cases to 50,333.Michael Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies director, said, “All countries will face this.”Tests mandatory for those leaving Wuhan The Chinese government ordered on Saturday that anyone in Wuhan working in certain service-related jobs must take a coronavirus test if they want to leave the city. The order comes after the central city recently lifted a 70-day lockdown that all but ended the epidemic there. China runs out of drug test candidates Several clinical trials of drugs including one of the first to be identified as a potential anti-Covid-19 medicine, remdesivir, have been cancelled in China because of the lack of testing candidates.As of Thursday, 598 coronavirus-related clinical trials had been registered in China, but some 40 had been cancelled. UN body not sure if antibodies will workThe WHO is not sure whether the presence of antibodies in blood gives full protection against reinfection with the new coronavirus, a top official said on Friday.Top emergencies expert of WHO Mike Ryan said that even if antibodies were effective there was little sign that large numbers of people had developed them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-china-others-may-revise-death-tolls-who/story-yszcTK7logKhGHVaQFHj5O.html
19-04-2020||World||Covid-19 outbreak: In vaccine race, all eyes on Oxford trial’s deadline||United Kingdom’s top experts believe a trial at University of Oxford could give a crucial indication as early as next month on whether the world is on track for an early vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which,in a best-case scenario, could be developed as soon as this year.The vaccine being developed at Oxford is one of four that has progressed to clinical trials – the first stage of a vaccine being tested on humans – but it accounts for the largest sample size, making it one of the most watched among all efforts. “The crucial thing is you have to do a proper trial because safety is really important for these things. But if we can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on. And they may well get across the finish line by mid-August,” Oxford University professor of medicine, John Bell, told BBC.Bell is part of a task force UK’s business secretary Alok Sharma announced on Friday while earmarking millions of pounds for vaccine development.Till now, the consensus among researchers is that a vaccine is likely to take 12-18 months before it is approved for public.Bell added that the UK currently does not have the capacity to produce the amount of vaccine it needs to tackle coronavirus, but “is in a really good place” for vaccine development.“One of the reasons that we were rushing is to try and catch this wave of the disease. Because when the disease goes away there will be very, very few incident cases until we get a second wave,” Bell said in his comments to BBC.According to the World Health Organization’s April 11 compilation of vaccine development efforts, there are 70 projects that researchers are working on across the world. In addition to the Oxford University vaccine trial, the others include Moderna, Inovio and CanSino that have begun recruiting members for clinical trials. The Oxford trial will include up to 550 subjects split into several groups, far larger than any of the others. Most of these are in the first phase of trials with healthy volunteers, and the goal is to determine the drug’s most frequent and serious side effects and, often, how the drug is broken down and excreted by the body. This is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-outbreak-in-vaccine-race-all-eyes-on-oxford-trial-s-deadline/story-tXlkN8zVyOshDiD3o2qgcM.html
19-04-2020||World||Hong Kong Police arrests at least 14 opposition activists for holding unlawful protests last year: Report||Hong Kong police arrested at least 14 opposition activists on Saturday for allegedly holding unlawful protests last year, the South China Morning Post reported.Former lawmakers Martin Lee, Albert Ho and Leung Kwok-hung were among those arrested, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified legal sources. Police also visited the home of Hong Kong media tycoon and prominent democracy advocate Jimmy Lai but he wasn’t there, the Morning Post said. Lai was charged for unlawful assembly in February.The group was arrested for allegedly organizing unlawful assemblies on Aug. 18, Oct. 1 and 20 last year, according to the Morning Post.The city is experiencing a lull in protest activity as it battles the coronavirus outbreak. Chief Executive Carrie Lam and other pro-establishment figures have recently accused the opposition of endangering Hong Kong’s autonomy and livelihoods, echoing criticism from China.The mainland’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, the top agency overseeing the financial hub, accused lawmakers of potentially violating their oaths by blocking action by the local legislature. Opposition lawmakers have prevented the body’s agenda-setting House Committee from electing a chairman since October, barring the panel from conducting business, it said.“Some opposition lawmakers have resorted to sleazy tactics to paralyze the legislature for political gain at the expense of the public, which is tantamount to ‘political mutual destruction,’” the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said. “They could have violated their oath, which could mean misconduct in public office.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-arrests-at-least-14-opposition-activists-for-holding-unlawful-protests-last-year-report/story-Y2dXzdQHmeM2dc46GDS7lI.html
