And some that were affected early in the pandemic are now starting to see a resurgence in cases.“Make no mistake: we have a long way to go. This virus will be with us for a long time.”The global death toll has passed 175,000, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP, while more than 2.5 million declared cases have been registered since the epidemic first emerged in China in December.Tedros was pressed on whether the WHO had acted swiftly enough.“Looking back, I think we declared the emergency at the right time” on January 30, he said, adding that the world “had enough time to respond”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/make-no-mistake-coronavirus-will-be-with-us-for-a-long-time-who-chief/story-qyXNtZiIVQfWUXr5wbFdbK.html
22-04-2020||World||Donald Trump says US will destroy Iranian gunboats harassing US ships||US President Donald Trump said Wednesday he has ordered the US military to attack and destroy any Iranian vessel that harasses US Navy ships.“I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,” Trump said on Twitter.The order came one week after 11 small armed Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps speedboats swarmed around six US Navy and Coast Guard ships in international waters in the northern Gulf.US Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist called Trump’s tweet “an important warning to the Iranians,” while not saying whether the US has altered its formal rules of engagement in the Gulf.“What he was emphasizing is all of our ships retain the right of self-defense,” Norquist told reporters in a briefing.“What the president says sends a great message to Iran,” said General John Hyten, vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.“We know how to translate that into our rules of engagement ... They are based on the inherent right of self-defense, they are based on hostile intent and hostile act. That’s all we need in order to take the right action.”“Nobody should doubt that the commanders have the authority right now to respond to any hostile act or hostile intent,” Hyten said.Trump was referring to an incident that took place on April 15 while US Navy vessels were engaged in exercises as part of their patrols in the region.No shots were fired, but the Pentagon said the Iranians engaged in “dangerous and provocative actions” that risked collision or worse.The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps boats “repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of the US vessels at extremely close range and high speeds,” coming at one point within 10 yards (nine meters) of the bow of one ship.The much smaller IRGC Navy vessels ignored warnings from the US ships for about an hour before finally responding to radio communications and then leaving, the US side said.On Sunday, the Revolutionary Guards accused the US Navy of “unprofessional and provocative behavior” that had interfered with their own exercises, according to Mehr News Agency.Asked if Trump’s order specifically would mean that US ships could fire on Iranian fast boats doing exactly what they did on April 15, Hyten said it is up to the captain of the US vessel.“It depends on the situation, what the captain sees,” he said.“You can’t let a fast boat get in a position where they can threaten your ship.“If you come across and you’re in a safe distance and you’re waving, that’s one thing,” he said.“If you have a gun and you point it at me, that’s another thing ... So if you cross that line, we know what the line is and we will respond.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-us-will-destroy-iranian-gunboats-harassing-us-ships/story-ee6mn7VsOVFB9wMLWu0QsI.html
22-04-2020||World||Bangladesh virus hospitals accused of rejecting slum dwellers||Two Bangladesh hospitals dedicated to fighting the coronavirus are refusing to treat patients from one of the country’s worst slums, an activist said Wednesday.Members of the Bihari community -- descendants of refugees who fled to Bangladesh after the partition of India in 1947 -- say the pandemic has highlighted the discrimination they have endured for decades.Some 32,000 Bihari live in Geneva Camp -- one of the most desperate slums in the country -- where rights lawyer Khalid Hussain and police say two residents tested positive for coronavirus.Hussain said a state-run hospital meant specifically for COVID-19 patients had refused to admit the two, declaring their condition “not critical”.Now Geneva Camp residents were being rejected by another local hospital no matter what their health issue is, Hussain said, as staff fear they may catch the virus.The Biharis have faced discrimination for years, as the community is accused of backing Pakistan during Bangladesh’s 1971 war of independence.About 500,000 live in 116 settlements across the country of 168 million.Bihari community leader Sadakat Khan Fakku said a man infected with coronavirus from another camp had also been turned away by a local hospital, and he was now self-quarantined in a one-room home with his family. None of the hospitals approached by AFP would comment on the allegations, but Nasima Sultana, deputy head of Bangladesh’s health department, denied discrimination.“There are 10 million slum people in Dhaka,” she told AFP.“We don’t have enough beds,” she added, saying people with mild symptoms should treat themselves at home.Advocate Hussain said the two infected men from Geneva camp had been isolated with 20 families, but that social distancing was almost impossible in so crowded a place.He said at least six people in the slum have died in recent weeks with coronavirus-type symptoms such as viral fever and respiratory problems.“None of them were tested, so we don’t know whether they had coronavirus,” he said.Bangladesh has officially said 120 people have died and 3,800 others been infected with coronavirus, but experts say more testing would reveal far higher figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-virus-hospitals-accused-of-rejecting-slum-dwellers/story-03LxQiANx3gnomOltJKKKK.html

Trump and Khan had a bilateral meeting in Davos in January on the sidelines of the Davos Economic Summit. “The leaders discussed developments in the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and agreed to continue working together on a coordinated response to defeat the virus and minimize its economic impact,” the White House said in a readout of the call.“The two leaders also discussed regional security and other bilateral issues,” it said.

Doctors also note the health benefits of outdoor physical exercise in boosting people’s immune systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-crisis-berlin-gets-pop-up-bike-lanes-to-boost-cycling-in-pandemic/story-4JXniei8HhyuSynE9rpJpL.html

The 100,000 figure was actually at the low end of a range topping out at 240,000 put forth by the White House coronavirus task force at the end of March. Earlier this month, the administration revised its estimates for deaths from the coronavirus to around 60,000.With 4% of world’s population but 21% of its prisoners, “the U.S. faces a unique challenge in mitigating the spread of Covid-19 and is likely facing a much higher death count than models based on data from other countries predict,” the ACLU said.The civil rights organization, which has filed dozens of lawsuits to get non-violent inmates released from jails, said it used data from more than 1,200 facilities around the U.S. and found that keeping more people out of jails would ultimately save lives, including in the surrounding communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prisoners-could-add-100-000-deaths-to-us-covid-19-toll-aclu-says/story-2wBOEAHyeNbmm0UF5iuWCI.html

In other words, those receiving green cards -- a big factor -- it will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis.”Short-term visas include H-1B, though he did not say, and tourism. They are exempted are some other categories, which he indicated, will be detailed in a subsequent order, which could include exemptions for humanitarian grounds in regards to the suspension of Green Cards.The president also indicated he could consider “what additional immigration-related measures should be put in place to protect US workers” but did not expand.People from India are the largest recipients of the these Green Cards. More than 1 million new immigrants are admitted to the United states every year, and India accounted for most with 126,000 in 2017, the latest such count available from a Pew research center study. It was followed by Mexico (124,000), China (121,000) and Cuba (41,000). Overall, people from Mexico comprise the largest group of foreign-born US national in 2018 at 25%, followed by India and China, with 6% each, according to the same reportThe president said he will review economic conditions at the end of the 60-day period to determine if he wants to extend the suspension or terminate it.Nearly 22 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits over the last four weeks and many more layoffs are feared as the economy teeters on the edge of the worst slowdown in US history, a situation compared by many economists to the Great Depression of 1929.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-sign-order-pausing-green-cards-today-indians-likely-to-be-hit-hardest/story-qiRYOpHy6iYuPhWYZQhtiO.html
22-04-2020||World||US Covid-19 fatalities started much earlier than previously known||The first US fatalities from the novel coronavirus took place weeks before previously known, according to autopsy results released Tuesday of two individuals in Santa Clara, California who had died on February 6 and February 17, way ahead of the February 29 death in Washington state considered the first .“Each one of those deaths is probably the tip of an iceberg of unknown size,” Sara Cody, the chief medical officer of Santa Clara county, told the New York Times. “It feels quite significant.”These new fatalities change the US timeline by a quite a bit, specially as President Donald Trump has come under mounting for not doing enough in the month of February after restricting the entry of travelers from China, which he has tended to portray as the high-point of his administration’s response.The deadly pathogen would tear through the United States shortly and catapult it to the top of the casualty list for infections and fatalities. The toll went up by 2,751 in the last 24 hours to 45,075 and by 39,460 is to 825,306 confirmed cases. Deaths in New York state, the American epicenter of the epidemic, were up to 19,118 and 14,887 in New York city.These number may not reflect it, but the country is past the peak in terms of new cases, and some states have begun spooling back the restrictions alarming critics, but not the White House which has looked on indulgently, in line with the president’s backing of lockdown protestors.The president has also stoked anger against China with increasing attack on its role, alleging it may have misled the world on the origins of the epidemic, which Americans are saying could have started from a virology lab in Wuhan, the city that became the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak; and the then the exact magnitude of its crisis.Missouri state on Tuesday filed a lawsuit in a federal court alleged gross mismanagement of the crisis by China and sought damages. “Chinese authorities deceived the public, suppressed crucial information, arrested whistleblowers, denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence, destroyed critical medical research, permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus, and even hoarded personal protective equipment—thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable,” said the first of its kind lawsuit filed by the state’s Republican attorney general Eric Schmitt.Beijing dismissed the lawsuit as “malicious”. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters., “These so-called lawsuits are purely malicious abuses.”“Such abuses are not conducive to epidemic prevention and control in the United States, and also run counter to the current international anti-epidemic cooperation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-fatalities-started-much-earlier-than-previously-known/story-C6t8Lg6aMcdqoS09LFr2VO.html
22-04-2020||World||Donald Trump tells Navy to destroy any Iranian Gunboats harassing US||President Donald Trump said he’s ordered the U.S. Navy to destroy any Iranian gun boats that harass American ships at sea.Trump issued the warning “to shoot down and destroy” the ships in a tweet sent from his iPhone Wednesday morning. It comes after 11 gunboats from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps crossed the bows and sterns of American ships at close range last week.U.S. Central Command called the Iranian maneuvers “dangerous and provocative actions” in a statement, and said at the time that that American commanders on the scene “retain the inherent right to act in self-defense.”The U.S. military vessels were conducting joint integration operations in the international waters of the Persian Gulf when the Iranian ships harassed them, Central Command said in the statement.The Iranian ships came within a 50-yard point of approach with the USS Lewis B. Puller and within 10 yards of the bow of the Coast Guard cutter Maui, according to the statement. Iran has disrupted shipping routes in the Gulf and used asymmetrical warfare to undermine American interests across the Middle East, though rarely does it target U.S. ships directly.Trump’s comments could mark another flare up of tensions between the U.S. and Tehran.Going back to the Obama administration, Revolutionary Guard members in small but agile speedboats have harassed U.S. ships, but the encounters usually have ended with warnings from the Americans to back off. In 2017, a U.S. Navy guided-missile naval destroyer fired warning shots at four Iranian rapid-attack craft in the Strait of Hormuz.An Iranian surface-to-air missile system shot down a U.S. Navy surveillance drone last June while it was operating in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran said the drone was over its territory. The attack escalated regional tensions.Early this year, the U.S. killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. An Iranian counter attack on a U.S. base in Iraq didn’t kill anyone, but left American soldiers with head injuries, which Trump downplayed the severity of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-tells-navy-to-destroy-any-iranian-gunboats-harassing-us/story-vq6UbT6hQ8i7mwk76DJTWP.html

Ramazan begins on the next day of the sighting of the new moon or the crescent. This year, Ramazan is likely to begin on Friday (April 24) depending on the moon-sighting on Thursday, April 23.The UAE’s moon-sighting committee will meet on Thursday and look for the crescent to formally announce the beginning of Ramazan from April 24. The first roza or fast will be kept on April 24 if the new moon on April 23.This year, the holy month is sure to begin on Friday, April 24, as April 23 is the last day of the month before Ramazan. The month before Ramazan is known as Sha’ban and consists of not more than 30 days.Since April 23 will be the 30th of the month of Sha’ban, Ramazan will most likely begin from Friday, April 24. The UAE moon-sighting committee will formally make the announcement after the maghrib (evening) prayer on April 23.The month-long fasting or Sawm (fasting from dawn till dusk) is one of the five pillars of Islam and is observed by Muslims across the world during Ramazan to inculcate a sense of self-restraint and patience. It is a period of devotion, forgiveness, repentance and self-reflection.The day starts with partaking a meal at the crack of dawn and ends by breaking the fast after sunset and saying the evening prayer. The month-long phase of fasting culminates into the day of feasting after the moon is sighted and Eid is celebrated to round off the holy month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/muslims-to-look-for-ramazan-moon-on-thursday-details-here/story-aKfWguOeo2gBTizR2RtusL.html

Harbin, the city of around 10 million is the capital of Heilongjiang province, which is close to the Russian border and has become the hardest coronavirus-hit region in China.“The gates of all communities and villages (of Harbin) will be guarded, residents who enter and exit must hold a health code, wear masks and show normal body temperatures, while no other people and vehicles will be allowed to enter,” new measures adopted by the Harbin government on Wednesday said. “Visits and gatherings between families and friends have also been prohibited. Weddings and funerals are also banned under the new anti-epidemic policy, and all public events including performances, forums and exhibitions have been suspended,” a state media report said.The city had reported 52 active confirmed cases and 23 asymptomatic infections as of Tuesday midnight.According to the tabloid Global Times, the chain of infection started from a Chinese student surnamed Han who had returned from New York.Han then passed the virus on to her neighbor, triggering a chain infections involving two hospitals after one among the infected – Chen, mentioned earlier -- was admitted to one hospital for a separate ailment.The national health commission (NHC) said it received reports of 30 new Covid-19 cases on the mainland on Tuesday, 23 of which were imported. The remaining seven were domestically transmitted, the NHC said, adding that all were reported in Heilongjiang.The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 82,788 by Tuesday, including 1,005 patients who were still being treated and 77,151 people who had been discharged after recovery, the NHC said.Altogether 4,632 people had died of the disease in China, it said.Heilongjiang has been on the frontline of China’s latest efforts to identify infected citizens arriving from Russia, with which it shares a border, so as to halt the virus. Earlier this month, Harbin authorities made 28 days of quarantine for all arrivals from abroad mandatory, with two nucleic acid tests and an antibody test for each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/near-lockdown-in-chinese-city-after-2-trigger-dozens-of-chain-infections/story-orw6Hri4NxlSau2wTPDMJO.html

A British charity believes so, and has begun training canines to sniff out the coronavirus following previous screening success with various illnesses.Medical Detection Dogs, set up in 2008 to harness dogs’ sharp sense of smell to detect human diseases, started working on the project late last month.In its training room in Milton Keynes, in central England, the dogs are being intensively trained to sniff out samples of the virus, and indicate when they have found it to receive a treat.The approach is based on a belief that each disease triggers a distinct odour, which canines are uniquely well-placed to smell.The charity has previously worked with its dogs to detect cancers, Parkinson’s disease and bacterial infections using samples taken from patients.“We believe dogs can detect COVID-19 and will be able to screen hundreds of people very, very rapidly so we know who needs to be tested and isolated,” Claire Guest, founder and chief executive of Medical Detection Dogs, told AFP.“We have evidence that dogs can detect bacterias and other diseases, so we believe that taking this project forward will make a huge difference to the ability to control COVID-19 spread.” Guest is working with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and Durham University in northeast England -- the same team that recently collaborated to show dogs can be trained to detect malaria.James Logan, head of the LSHTM’s disease control department, said that project demonstrated dogs can smell odours from humans with “extremely high accuracy”.He added there was “a very high chance” that they would be able to detect COVID-19 in a similar way and potentially “revolutionise our response” to the disease.The team is aiming to train the dogs over a six-week period to help provide the “rapid, non-invasive diagnosis” tool.Canines can also detect subtle changes in skin temperature, potentially making them useful in determining if a person has a fever.If successful, the four-legged detection devices could be deployed at airports to identify people carrying the virus, according to Steve Lindsay from Durham University.The number of coronavirus cases around the world has now soared to 1,246,840, according to the latest figures Wednesday compiled by AFP from official sources.The number of actual infections is believed to be higher since many countries are only testing severe cases or patients requiring hospitalisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-dogs-detect-covid-19-canines-in-training-to-sniff-out-virus/story-kzBXuaOVdI0yzn9xqU6SaI.html

As a ventilated patient, Royal Papworth was incredibly important to my father and helped him through some very difficult times”.“We realised that it would be at the forefront of the Covid-19 epidemic and got in touch with some of our old friends there to ask if we could help,” she added.The 330 Chinese graduates of UK universities made personal donations of £38,000 to buy two ventilators for the National Health Service. The vital equipment was transported on a flight from Shanghai to London.The former students were part of the government’s Chevening programme which enables future global leaders to study in the UK. Minister of state for Asia Nigel Adams thanked them for the gesture.In an open letter, the alumni said from China: “We wish to show our support and care by standing with British people in fighting with the pandemic. We have good faith and wish a full and swift success in our joint effort”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stephen-hawking-s-family-chinese-alumni-donate-ventilators-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-kxi3eN274Ms81oXCCc7zXJ.html
22-04-2020||World||‘Nothing short of absurdity’: China on US lawsuit against it on Covid-19||China on Wednesday dismissed as “nothing short of absurdity” and violation of sovereignty the lawsuit filed by the US state of Missouri which alleges that Beijing suppressed COVID-19 information, arrested whistle-blowers and denied its contagious nature, leading to the loss of life and causing “irreparable damage” to the world.Filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, the lawsuit was submitted by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt against the Chinese government, the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), and other Chinese officials and institutions.It alleges that during the critical weeks of the initial outbreak, the Chinese authorities deceived the public, suppressed crucial information, arrested whistle-blowers, denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence, destroyed critical medical research, permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus, and even hoarded Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable.The lawsuit seeks relief on one count of public nuisance, one count of abnormally dangerous activities, and two counts of breach of duty.Remedies could include civil penalties and restitution, abatement of the public nuisance, cessation of abnormally dangerous activities, punitive damages and more, it said.Reacting to the lawsuit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: “this so-called accusation has no factual and legal basis. It is nothing short of absurdity”.He reiterated that since the outbreak, the Chinese government has been acting in open, transparent and responsible manner to report the information to the US and other countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) besides issuing general sequence of the virus.Geng said China is in communication with the US on this issue since January 3, ensuring updates.“This is part of China’s important contribution and recognised by the international community. This so-called litigation is a malicious abuse of litigation. It violates the basic law and principle of equal sovereignty in international law.“The Chinese government’s response in the pandemic is not under the jurisdiction of US courts,” he said.Geng said that such abuse of ligation is not conducive to epidemic response at home in the US and also runs counter to international cooperation.“What the US should do is to refute and reject such abuse of litigation,” he said.Besides the lawsuit, China faced stringent criticism from US President Donald Trump and its top politicians and officials including allegations of cover-up and underreporting of coronavirus casualties.While China has reported 82,788 novel coronavirus cases, including 4,632 fatalities, the US registered over 824,600 cases and more than 45,290 deaths -- the highest in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nothing-short-of-absurdity-china-on-us-lawsuit-against-it-on-covid-19/story-aGxrV1hrlNAB5VfLg5qRYM.html

While including some exemptions, the ban could be renewed for another 60 days or longer, he said, and a second order was also being considered.Some questions remained over the details of the order, the latest in a series of steps the Republican president has taken to clamp down on immigration, a signature election campaign issue that helped propel him to the White House in 2016.The move could face obstacles, with some legal experts saying a broad, worldwide order curbing legal immigration would likely be challenged in court.Critics have also said they view Trump’s new policy as an effort to distract from his response to the coronavirus pandemic as he seeks re-election in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-will-sign-order-prohibiting-immigration-wednesday/story-W4BgibUwQt5eOENAPyIlfJ.html
22-04-2020||World||Sans sound and fury, UK’s virtual parliament session begins||There was none of the repartee, jousting and more that marks Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, as home-based MPs questioned foreign secretary Dominic Raab through video-link, while some sat at distance on the green benches inside the chamber.PMQs have long been the time when the prime minister and leader of the opposition engage in feisty encounters across the dispatch box, landing punches and counter-punches on issues of the day. But the coronavirus pandemic has forced parliament to move ‘hybrid’ sessions.Under the new arrangement, of the 650 MPs, a maximum of 50 are allowed to be physically present in the chamber, with 120 others joining from their homes via video-link. House authorities release a ‘call list’ of members chosen to ask questions during the day.David Mundell, secretary for Scotland, was listed on Wednesday, but could not connect through the video-link. The home-based MPs appear on several screens installed inside the chamber.Raab, who is deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fielded probing questions from the newly-elected Labour leader, Keir Starmer, in person, while Ian Blackford, leader of the third-largest party, the Scottish National Party, used his time from home.Starmer thanks speaker Lindsay Hoyle to allow the House to resume under the new arrangement so that the government could be held to account, particularly given the growing concerns over gaps in testing and personal protection equipment.Raab revealed that 69 medical staff died after being infected by the virus, including Manjeet Singh Riyat, 52, who was an accident and emergency consultant in Derbyshire. He faced repeated questions over the promise to test 100,000 people every day by the end of April.Raab said Johnson is making a “good recovery” while recuperating in the prime minister’s country residence of Chequers in Buckinghamshire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sans-sound-and-fury-uk-s-virtual-parliament-session-begins/story-qGvJypoKfv1BH6ZCly9cwN.html

22-04-2020||World||Donald Trump’s ‘game changer’ Hydroxychloroquine not effective against Covid-19: Study||Hydrochloroquine, the anti-malaria drug which US President Donald Trump called a “game changer” against COVID-19, is not effective against the disease, according to a study which raises concerns about the drug’s widespread usage by many governments across the world in fighting the pandemic. The yet to be peer-reviewed study, published in the preprint server medRxiv, made a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in all the Veterans Health Administration medical centers across the US. The scientists, including those from the University of South Carolina in the US, analysed the associations between the use of drugs hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and corresponding clinical outcomes. According to the researchers, hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is being widely used in COVID-19 therapy based on anecdotal evidence. In the study, the scientists assessed data on patients hospitalised with confirmed infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in all United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers until April 11. They categorised 368 patients based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone, or with azithromycin, in addition to standard supportive management for COVID-19. The two primary outcomes noted in the study were death, and the need for mechanical ventilation. Based on the findings, the scientists said there is no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The scientists said they took into account the variation in the baseline characteristics of the patients across the three groups. “Hydroxychloroquine use with or without co-administration of azithromycin did not improve mortality or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients,” the scientists wrote in the study. On the contrary, they said, hydroxychloroquine use alone was associated with an increased risk of death compared to standard care alone. “Although ongoing randomized, controlled studies are expected to provide more informative evidence about hydroxychloroquine in the coming months, the outcomes observed in our study represent the best available data,” the researchers wrote in the study. Some limitations of the research, mentioned by the scientists, include the possibility of selection bias of study participants. They said the study comprised only men whose median age was over 65 years, adding that the results may not necessarily reflect outcomes in women or in younger hospitalized populations. “The findings from this retrospective study suggest caution in using hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized Covid-19 patients, particularly when not combined with azithromycin,” the researchers concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-game-changer-hydrochloroquine-not-effective-against-covid-19-study/story-4V1DoPbS1SGy8xF5avO8WP.html
22-04-2020||World||ISKP commander who was its bridge with Pak’s ISI, Lashkar arrested||A top commander of the so-called Khorasan wing of the Islamic State in Afghanistan who acted as the ISKP’s bridge with Pakistani intelligence agency and terror groups such as the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba has been arrested, Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security said on Wednesday.Counter-terror operatives in Delhi and Kabul told Hindustan Times that Munib Mohammad had, in his interrogation that has continued for more than a fortnight, has extensively spoken of the close links between Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence and the Islamic State of Khorasan Province.Munib Mohammad aka Abu Bilal is a Pakistani national. He had first joined Al Qaeda before moving to Daesh (the Arabic acronym for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in Afghanistan as a fighter. Then, he moved up the ladder.By the time he was arrested by the National Directorate of Security along with his boss ISKP chief Aslam Farooqui on April 4, Munib Mohammad had become a member of the Central Council of Khurasan branch of Daesh.When the ISKP set up its coordination centre, Munib Mohammed was put as the man in charge of “coordinating with terrorist groups and intelligence agencies of the region”, a NDS statement said.The pointed reference to “intelligence agencies of the region” in the official statement is an euphemistic reference to Pakistan’s ISI.Besides, the statement said Munib’s job description at the ISKP also involved coordinating with other terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taib, Haqqani network, Sipah-e-Sahaba, Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam related to Maulvi Fazal-ul-Rehman and Taliban Peshawar Shura.This is the first time that the NDS, after its spectacular operation on April 4 that netted the ISKP chief Aslam Farooqui aka Mawlawi Abudullah, has spoken about Munib Mohammad’s arrest.The massive security operation, backed with pin-pointed intelligence, is believed to have decimated the top leadership of the Pakistan-sponsored module of the ISKP.Also Read: Pakistan proxies in fight to the finish in Afghanistan, but India too needs to prepThe arrests came days after Farooqi’s ISKP claimed responsibility for the March 25 attack on a Sikh place of worship in Kabul that killed 27 people, including an Indian national. Among those arrested was also a Kashmiri, Aijaz Ahmad Ahangar, who had disappeared 25 years ago and was the chief recruiter for the IS in Jammu and Kashmir.Aslam Farooqui on the instructions of Haqqani Network and LeT used Kerala resident Muhsin Tikaripur along with three other Urdu-Punjabi speaking attackers to massacre 27 innocent Sikh men and women in Shor Bazaar, Kabul, a counter-terror operative in Delhi said.Aslam Farooqui, a Pakistani national with long-standing ties to the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, had also detailed some aspects of his group’s collusion with the ISI.It was a development that had been anticipated in Islamabad, which promptly called in Afghan ambassador Atif Mashal to seek custody of Aslam Farooqui. An official statement by Pakistan’s Foreign Office later insisted that Farooqui “was involved in anti-Pakistan activities in Afghanistan”.The request was firmly rejected by Afghanistan in less than 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iskp-commander-who-was-its-bridge-with-pak-s-isi-lashkar-arrested/story-WMZW0v2NkXMm1fk18C110L.html

So that is for exercise in the water,” she told reporters in Sydney.“The sand is closed: which means no running, no walking, no gathering, no bringing your kids down to play in the sand and have a paddle in the water.”Bondi and nearby beaches were closed in late March after photos circulated online showing mostly young beachgoers packed together on the sands in defiance of a ban on large outdoor gatherings.The area was also designated a COVID-19 “hotspot” after more than 180 cases were detected among backpackers and residents, prompting health authorities to establish a pop-up testing clinic.Masselos urged non-residents not to visit Bondi, saying the beach corridors would close if demand was too high.“We want to make sure it operates within the social distancing and public health order rules,” she said.“And if people are not going to respect that and if the numbers are too great, regrettably we will have to close those.”Other Sydney beaches, including Coogee and Maroubra, reopened Monday to the sound of loudspeaker announcements warning swimmers to abide by social distancing rules.Australia has recorded more than 6,600 cases of COVID-19, and 74 deaths from the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-bondi-beach-to-reopen-for-surfing-as-virus-cases-slow/story-AT884esYdBSt3U4dju1P3N.html
22-04-2020||World||Turkish mosque turned into temporary ‘supermarket’ amid coronavirus pandemic||At the entrance of an Istanbul mosque, the racks usually reserved for the shoes of the faithful are loaded with pasta packages, oil bottles, biscuits -- like a supermarket.But they aren’t for sale. Instead they are destined for the needy, hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The sign on the mosque’s window asks anyone who can to leave something, and says those in need can take something.Abdulsamet Cakir, 33, imam of the Dedeman mosque in the Sariyer district, came up with this idea of reaching out to the poor via the place of worship after Turkey suspended mass prayers in mosques until the risk of outbreak passes.Turkey’s official death toll from the virus now stands at 2,259 after 119 more deaths were reported on Tuesday, and major cities including Istanbul will be under lockdown for four days from Thursday.“After the suspension of mass prayers, I had an idea to revive our mosque by bringing together well-off people with the people in need,” Cakir told AFP inside the mosque, where bags of food and cleaning products were piled up on the floor.The young imam, who takes the products from the floor and places them on the shelves at the entrance, said he was inspired by a donation culture in the Ottoman period called “charity stone” -- a small pillar stone erected at certain locations of the city to connect rich people with the poor.‘Tough situation’In this Ottoman system aimed at giving charity in a dignified manner without offending the needy, people with means would leave whatever amount they wanted in a cavity on the top of the charity stone.Those who were in need would then take the amount they needed and leave the rest for others.“After the coronavirus pandemic, we have thought about what we can do to help our brothers in need,” said Cakir, who would already help the poor in his neighbourhood before the outbreak.“With the inspiration from our ancestors’ ‘charity stone’ culture, we decided to fill the racks in our mosque with the help from our brothers with means,” he added.Cakir hangs a list on the wall of the mosque where citizens who need help write their names and telephone numbers.The imam later sends the list to local authorities who check whether the names are really in need and his team then sends a message that they can visit the mosque and receive whatever they need: eight items at maximum.“I am really in dire need. My husband doesn’t work. I used to clean houses but since the virus, they no longer call,” Guleser Ocak, 50, told AFP.“I wrote my name on the list before. I received a message today to pick up aid,” she said. “We are in a tough situation.”‘No cash’The mosque has been providing services for two weeks and reaches out to 120 people in need per day. And the list includes over 900 people.A maximum of two people wearing masks and gloves enter the mosque and take what they need, while others wait outside, standing a few paces from each other.“We spread the services through the day. We call 15 people for each half an hour, so that we respect social distancing and do not cause big queues,” the imam said.“We are doing our best to help our sisters and brothers in the best possible way without offending them,” he added.The mosque does not accept cash donations and instead receives aid packages.“Producers also donate. A miller brings in flour, a baker brings in bread, a water distributor brings in water,” Cakir said.The mosque’s shelves are full of products sent from all over Turkey and even abroad.“Everyone does whatever they can to help people in need. For example, a brother who lives in France did online shopping and directed the aid to our mosque,” he said.“What the mosque is doing is really, really good for us. Ramadan is coming,” said Duygu Kesimoglu, 29, referring to the Muslim fasting month beginning this week.“I am unfortunately jobless, they don’t employ us because of the coronavirus. No job, no money. This help is very, very good,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-mosque-turned-into-temporary-supermarket-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/story-QfEBt4cS1GFBF60f3TAwQO.html

A maximum of 50 MPs will be able to be present in the Chamber at any one time to comply with social distancing guidelines.A maximum of 120 MPs will be able to take part remotely over the course of any ‘hybrid proceedings’, which will constitute the first two hours of each sitting. Under the terms of the motion, the House will continue to meet at its usual sitting times, but only on Mondays (from 2.30pm), Tuesdays and Wednesdays (both from 11.30am).Foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson recuperating from cornavirus infection, will face Keir Starmer, the newly-elected Labour leader, during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday.Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said: “By initiating a hybrid solution, with steps towards an entirely virtual Parliament, we are enabling Members to stay close to their communities, while continuing their important work scrutinising the Government.”“I do not want Members and House staff putting themselves at risk. By working virtually, this is our contribution to the guidance of stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-s-house-of-commons-goes-virtual-from-wednesday-120-mps-to-join-remotely/story-ofIRnB2SVqxfggNkoxMwAO.html

Both Edhi and the prime minister as well as the two other people seen in the picture were not wearing protective masks.Edhi later told a TV news channel that he and two industrialists had spent around six to seven minutes with the premier.In the last five days, Khan has presided over many meetings and met important individuals including President Arif Alvi and ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed.Sultan further said the tally of Covid-19 cases in the country was expected to reach between 12,000 and 15,000 by the end of current month according to the government estimates.He added that though the coronavirus situation in the country was better than that in other countries and it was necessary to keep it under control.Edhi has placed himself in self-quarantine at Islamabad’s Edhi Home.Mohammad Bilal, spokesperson for the Edhi Foundation said the test was conducted two days ago at Al-Shifa hospital in the federal capital.“We feel he contracted the virus in Islamabad, as he has been there for a week,” he added.Edhi has been on the forefront in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic with his charity organisation. He is also a member of the Sindh’s coronavirus emergency fund.His son, Saad Edhi, said his father had started developing symptoms including mild fever and headache soon after meeting the prime minister. He added that the symptoms lasted for four days after which he had himself tested and was diagnosed positive for the disease.In a video message, Faisal Edhi said he was not suffering from any symptoms at the moment but his results had come back positive.He urged his foundation to continue working hard to provide relief to people.The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Pakistan rose to 9,749 on Wednesday after new infections were confirmed in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-undergoes-covid-19-test-after-he-met-charity-head-who-tested-positive-for-infection/story-QPWJxSyMMJqu0WW6lwRdRJ.html
22-04-2020||World||Missouri lawsuit alleges China caused coronavirus pandemic||The state of Missouri filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Chinese government over the coronavirus, alleging that nation’s officials are to blame for the global pandemic.The lawsuit, filed in federal court by the state’s top lawyer, alleges Chinese officials are “responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians.”Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt in a written statement said the Chinese government lied about the dangers of the virus and didn’t do enough to slow its spread.“The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease,” he said. “They must be held accountable for their actions.”It’s unclear whether the lawsuit will have much, if any, impact. U.S. law generally prohibits lawsuits against other countries with few exceptions, said Chimène Keitner, an international law professor at University of California, Hastings College of the Law.“The legal problem is, it’s just not possible,” said Keitner, who recently wrote a blog titled “Don’t Bother Suing China for Coronavirus.”Missouri Democratic Party Executive Director Lauren Gepford called the lawsuit a “stunt” by a Republican attorney general who is up for re-election this year.The number of Missouri deaths statewide rose by 16 Tuesday to 215, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The number of cases rose by 156 to 5,963.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missouri-lawsuit-alleges-china-caused-coronavirus-pandemic/story-qUaB9HbMeFuuEh6KXHwNpJ.html
22-04-2020||World||Hong Kong reshuffles government as debate rages over Beijing’s role||Hong Kong unveiled a government shake-up on Wednesday that it said was aimed at reviving the financial hub’s beleaguered economy and had nothing to do with a recent controversy over Beijing’s role in the city’s affairs. Director of Immigration, Erick Tsang, will replace Patrick Nip as head of the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said, shortly after China’s state council said it had approved the appointments. The move comes two days after Nip apologised for conflicting statements over the role of two Beijing institutions overseeing the global financial centre’s affairs. Nip has been reassigned as the head of the city’s civil service, replacing Joshua Law. “Hong Kong is in a very difficult position now, apart from the pandemic, we are going through a major economic recession with high unemployment and so we really need to start planning for Hong Kong’s economic recovery,” Lam said at a briefing. The government also announced new secretaries for technology, financial services and home affairs. Some lawmakers said the moves reflected Beijing’s tightening grip over the city. “This is not an ordinary reshuffle. This is a show of power,” Civic Party lawmaker Alvin Yeung told Reuters. Political tensions have escalated in Hong Kong over the past week after Beijing’s top representative office in the city said it was not bound by a law that restricts interference by other mainland Chinese agencies in the former British colony.The remarks prompted conflicting statements from the Hong Kong government regarding the legal status of Beijing’s Liaison Office, and Nip apologised for the confusion.Hong Kong returned to Beijing in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees it broad freedoms not seen in mainland China, and its high degree of autonomy is widely seen as key to its prosperity as an international financial hub.Many in Hong Kong fear Beijing is increasingly meddling in the city’s affairs, which the central government denies. A war of words intensified last week when Beijing’s top official in Hong Kong urged the local government to work to enact national security legislation “as soon as possible”, fuelling worries over what many see as encroachment on the territory’s freedoms. Fear that Beijing is flexing its muscle over Hong Kong risks a revival of anti-government protests after months of relative calm amid social distancing rules to curb the spread of the coronavirus.The government shake-up is the biggest under embattled leader Lam, who has rejected repeated calls to step down even after admitting she had caused “unforgivable havoc” by igniting political turmoil last year. Protests that escalated in June evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement, which is expected to rebuild momentum once social distancing rules to curb coronavirus are lifted. Hong Kong’s Security Secretary John Lee said on Wednesday the Chinese-ruled city was facing the risk of “home-grown terrorism” after several police reports of finding explosive materials.Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office also ratcheted up tensions last week when it slammed opposition lawmakers who use “malicious filibustering” to paralyse the legislature, where a backlog of bills has angered the central government. Days later, authorities arrested 15 pro-democracy activists in the city’s biggest crackdown on the movement, drawing a swift rebuke from Washington and London. Beijing said on Tuesday it supported the arrests, adding certain “radicals” in the city were blind to the interference of outside forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-reshuffles-government-as-debate-rages-over-beijing-s-role/story-2i6zBGG3qCaxnTQFl0bD7K.html
22-04-2020||World||Taiwan Navy ship outbreak may threaten success against Covid-19||A coronavirus outbreak on one of Taiwan’s navy ships has raised concerns that a re-infection could threaten one of the world’s success stories in the fight against the pandemic.Twenty-eight sailors on a navy supply ship were confirmed to have the virus shortly after it returned from a visit to Palau earlier this month. Taiwan’s defense minister apologized Tuesday night and said he was willing to resign if requested to do so by the island’s president Tsai Ing-wen.Tsai apologized at a briefing Wednesday, saying Taiwan is investigating the outbreak on the navy ship, and that the president should take responsibility. She said the navy ship was on an annual routine drill and “special” mission, which she didn’t specify, and only visited Palau.The apologies come amid growing concern the military mishandled the outbreak after 744 personnel from three ships that visited the Pacific island nation were allowed to disembark after arriving back in Taiwan on April 9. Health officials first reported infections from the ship last week.The incident could blemish what has otherwise been a success story in containing the virus, which has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide. Taiwan has managed to keep its outbreak largely under control, with businesses and schools remaining open and the number of confirmed infections totaling just 426.The democratically run island had reported no new infections for three days last week, raising hopes it was close to overcoming the worst of the virus.Biggest Cluster“This is the biggest cluster infection in Taiwan so far,” Chan Chang-chuan, dean of the College of Public Health at National Taiwan University, said Wednesday. “It’s regrettable that Taiwan paid little attention to this part while it has done extraordinarily well in other areas.”Chan said Taiwan’s prowess at locating suspected cases quickly using mobile phones and other technology pointed to it being able to limit the spread in the broader community.Still, “it’s concerning that it could trigger a second wave on infections in Taiwan,” he said. “So we urge the government to test as many suspected cases as possible.”Health officials confirmed a 28th infection from the naval vessel Wednesday, a student who had previously tested negative for the virus.The Taiwan navy cluster comes as the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which operates in the region, has been under intense scrutiny over its handling of the coronavirus. Brett Crozier, captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, was dismissed for writing a memo warning the service about the potentially dire situation aboard the carrier.As it battled the pandemic, Taiwan was also forced to scramble its navy to monitor the movements of China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier group, which conducted exercises around the island earlier this month. Beijing considers the island part of its territory, a claim Taiwan’s government rejects.Taiwan Hopes Nimbler Weapons Can Stave Off an Invasion by ChinaGrant Newsham, a retired U.S. marine officer and senior research fellow at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies, warned that Taiwan’s leadership shouldn’t overreact to the outbreak.“When you’ve got the People’s Liberation Army intimidating you -- and threatening even more than normal, it’s important to show you’re ready and able to fight. Perceptions matter,” he said. “Given the problems facing the U.S. Navy in the region -- arguably as a result of overreacting to the virus -- it’s especially important that the People’s Republic of China doesn’t think the timing is right to ‘make a move’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-navy-ship-outbreak-may-threaten-success-against-covid-19/story-cBqiop7qbmFxBQIDA4j0fL.html
22-04-2020||World||Early Covid-19 patients, recovered fully, test positive again after 70 days||China has successfully slowed the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19, and in outbreak epicentre Wuhan, life also returned to normal.But a new mystery is now baffling the doctors in China: A growing number of patients who had recovered from the Sars-CoV-2 virus continue to test positive without showing symptoms.Those patients all tested negative for the virus at some point after recovering, but then tested positive again, some up to 70 days later, the doctors said. Many have done so over 50-60 days.A man told news agency Reuters that he had stayed at three hospitals in Wuhan before being moved to a flat in the centre. He had taken over 10 tests since the third week of February, he said, on occasions testing negative but mostly positive. “I feel fine and have no symptoms, but they check and it’s positive, check and it’s positive,” he said. “What is with this virus?”The prospect of people remaining positive for the virus, and therefore potentially infectious, is of international concern, as many countries seek to end lockdowns and resume economic activity as the spread of the virus slows. Currently, the globally recommended isolation period after exposure is 14 days.China has not published precise figures for how many patients fall into this category. But according to Reuters, there are at least dozens of such cases.In South Korea, about 1,000 people have been testing positive for four weeks or more. In Italy, the first European country ravaged by the pandemic, health officials noticed that coronavirus patients could test positive for the virus for about a month.“We did not see anything like this during SARS,” said Yuan Yufeng, a vice president at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, referring to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak that infected 8,098 people globally, mostly in China.Meanwhile, Wang Guiqiang, director of the infectious disease department of Peking University First Hospital, said at a briefing on Tuesday that the majority of such patients were not showing symptoms and very few had seen their conditions worsen.“The new coronavirus is a new type of virus,” said Guo Yanhong, a National Health Commission official. “For this disease, the unknowns are still greater than the knowns.”Experts and doctors struggle to explain why the virus behaves so differently in these people.Some suggest that patients retesting as positive after previously testing negative were somehow reinfected with the virus. This would undermine hopes that people catching Covid-19 would produce antibodies that would prevent them from getting sick again from the virus.Other South Korean and Chinese experts have said that remnants of the virus could have stayed in patients’ systems but not be infectious or dangerous to the host or others.Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 patients jumped by 1,383 in India on Wednesday, pushing the country’s tally to 19,984, according to the health ministry. Fifty people died due to the disease in the last 24 hours, the health ministry data further said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-concern-for-world-recovered-covid-19-patients-test-positive-even-after-70-days/story-CouvKuRui8UsqQxj8mg1nN.html
22-04-2020||World||‘All the measures are a joke’: Putin faces ire of Russia’s entrepreneurs||Moscow entrepreneur Anastasia Mesheryakova is scathing about the assistance from President Vladimir Putin’s government as she fights to prevent the collapse of her family-owned chain of cafes.“All the measures they’ve announced are just a joke,” said the 43-year-old. “I’ve only got myself to rely on.”The crisis, which could wipe more than 5% off the Russian economy this year thanks to the twin blow of coronavirus and the plunge in oil prices, may prove even more devastating for hundreds of thousands of small businesses. Long squeezed by high levels of corruption and bureaucratic harassment, the sector could shrink by as much as half, potentially costing millions of jobs, according to one forecast.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe authorities’ failure to stop the meltdown of businesses that account for a fifth of economic output could pose a political problem for the Kremlin as Putin moves to extend his 20-year rule. While the entrepreneurial class is tiny compared to the Russian leader’s core support base of state workers and pensioners, businesspeople are often more politically active, especially in Moscow.“Putin is losing the entrepreneurial class,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, an analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center. “The gradual erosion of the economy and the political system’s legitimacy will cause huge problems for him.”Putin’s New $14 Billion Stimulus Plan Seen Falling ShortWhile wealthier European countries like Germany are paying up to 80% of workers’ salaries in firms hit by the economic turmoil triggered by the virus, Russia is covering only a fraction of wage costs while offering only delays in paying tax and rent bills. Putin promised a big increase in government economic support last week, but business groups say the measures still fall short of what’s needed. Most aid is going to big companies, many state controlled.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakKremlin officials concede their assistance efforts aren’t enough. They say the programs will pick up in the coming weeks as the authorities have substantially increased the money available after taking a cautious approach in the early days of the epidemic. But the plunge in prices for oil, Russia’s main export, has the Kremlin leery about spending too much of its reserves now in case things get worse.“We’re not members of the European Union and we don’t issue our own reserve currency, so there are limits to our economic policy,” Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said on state television last week. The government’s latest steps will help about half a million businesses, with more than 3 million workers, he said, and there’s more to come. The authorities also say they’re suspending audits and other checks that bureaucrats often used to pressure businesses.“The latest measures are a step forward, but not a big one,” said Alexander Khurudzhi, head of a business-support group that works closely with the government. The new monthly grants to help pay salaries, though modest at only 12,130 rubles ($164) per worker, “are the first efforts that could be more or less effective,” he said.Those payments, which start only next month, could come too late for many companies. More than one in seven small businesses say they’re already at risk of imminent bankruptcy, according to a survey by the Center for Strategic Research in Moscow. The group forecasts the share of small businesses could drop to 18% this year from 20% last.Oleg Vyugin, a former senior official at the central bank and Finance Ministry, says that share could drop as low as 10%. The government is willing to let small businesses go bust because it takes the “cynical view” that others will eventually take their place, he said.The deferrals on tax and rental payments offered by authorities are useless for Vyacheslav Mukhin, who runs cosmetics stores in 14 shopping centers -- all currently closed.“You’ll still end up having to pay this sooner or later,” Mukhin said. “Officials live on a different planet.”This crisis is far worse than the two previous downturns, in 2008-2009 and in 2014-2015, according to Putin’s business ombudsman, Boris Titov. The government’s latest aid is “better than no support at all but these measures aren’t enough to allow companies to survive,” he said.Nonexistent thirty years ago when the Soviet Union collapsed, the sector was once as much as a quarter of the economy but has shrunk in recent years as behemoths in commodities and other industries have grown.Mesheryakova started her Coffee Piu chain of seven cafes with her husband, opening the first outlet seven years ago, and reached an annual revenue of 200 million rubles. If things don’t start to get back to normal by end of May, she says she’ll have to lay off her 100 staff and liquidate the business.“They don’t want us,” she said. “We’re a nuisance, there are too many of us and we all have our own opinion. Big companies are easier to control.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-the-measures-are-a-joke-putin-faces-ire-of-russia-s-entrepreneurs/story-YFzZYU3KtsdpLoxG3cvPQP.html
22-04-2020||World||China’s early patients test positive for Covid-19 two months after recovering||Dressed in a hazmat suit, two masks and a face shield, Du Mingjun knocked on the mahogany door of a flat in a suburban district of Wuhan on a recent morning.A man wearing a single mask opened the door a crack and, after Du introduced herself as a psychological counsellor, burst into tears.“I really can’t take it anymore,” he said. Diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in early February, the man, who appeared to be in his 50s, had been treated at two hospitals before being transferred to a quarantine centre set up in a cluster of apartment blocks in an industrial part of Wuhan. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWhy, he asked, did tests say he still had the virus more than two months after he first contracted it?The answer to that question is a mystery baffling doctors on the frontline of China’s battle against COVID-19, even as it has successfully slowed the spread of the coronavirus across the country.Chinese doctors in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, say a growing number of cases in which people recover from the virus, but continue to test positive without showing symptoms, is one of their biggest challenges as the country moves into a new phase of its containment battle.Those patients all tested negative for the virus at some point after recovering, but then tested positive again, some up to 70 days later, the doctors said. Many have done so over 50-60 days.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe prospect of people remaining positive for the virus, and therefore potentially infectious, is of international concern, as many countries seek to end lockdowns and resume economic activity as the spread of the virus slows. Currently, the globally recommended isolation period after exposure is 14 days.So far, there have been no confirmations of newly positive patients infecting others, according to Chinese health officials.China has not published precise figures for how many patients fall into this category. But disclosures by Chinese hospitals to Reuters, as well as in other media reports, indicate there are at least dozens of such cases.In South Korea, about 1,000 people have been testing positive for four weeks or more. In Italy, the first European country ravaged by the pandemic, health officials noticed that coronavirus patients could test positive for the virus for about a month.As there is limited knowledge available on how infectious these patients are, doctors in Wuhan are keeping them isolated for longer. Zhang Dingyu, president of Jinyintan Hospital, where the most serious coronavirus cases were treated, said health officials recognised the isolations may be excessive, especially if patients proved not to be infectious. But, for now, it was better to do so to protect the public, he said.     He described the issue as one of the most pressing facing the hospital and said counsellors like Du are being brought in to help ease the emotional strain.     “When patients have this pressure, it also weighs on society,” he said.DOZENS OF CASES The plight of Wuhan’s long-term patients underlines how much remains unknown about COVID-19 and why it appears to affect different people in numerous ways, Chinese doctors say. So far global infections have hit 2.5 million with over 171,000 deaths.As of April 21, 93% of 82,788 people with the virus in China had recovered and been discharged, official figures show.Yuan Yufeng, a vice president at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, told Reuters he was aware of a case in which the patient had positive retests after first being diagnosed with the virus about 70 days earlier.     “We did not see anything like this during SARS,” he said, referring to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak that infected 8,098 people globally, mostly in China.     Patients in China are discharged after two negative nucleic acid tests, taken at least 24 hours apart, and if they no longer show symptoms. Some doctors want this requirement to be raised to three tests or more. China’s National Health Commission directed Reuters to comments made at a briefing Tuesday when asked for comment about how this category of patients was being handled. Wang Guiqiang, director of the infectious disease department of Peking University First Hospital, said at the briefing that the majority of such patients were not showing symptoms and very few had seen their conditions worsen.“The new coronavirus is a new type of virus,” said Guo Yanhong, a National Health Commission official. “For this disease, the unknowns are still greater than the knowns.”    REMNANTS AND REACTIVATION    Experts and doctors struggle to explain why the virus behaves so differently in these people.    Some suggest that patients retesting as positive after previously testing negative were somehow reinfected with the virus. This would undermine hopes that people catching COVID-19 would produce antibodies that would prevent them from getting sick again from the virus.Zhao Yan, a doctor of emergency medicine at Wuhan’s Zhongnan Hospital, said he was sceptical about the possibility of reinfection based on cases at his facility, although he did not have hard evidence.     “They’re closely monitored in the hospital and are aware of the risks, so they stay in quarantine. So I’m sure they were not reinfected.”    Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said the virus may have been “reactivated” in 91 South Korean patients who tested positive after having been thought to be cleared of it.   Other South Korean and Chinese experts have said that remnants of the virus could have stayed in patients’ systems but not be infectious or dangerous to the host or others.Few details have been disclosed about these patients, such as if they have underlying health conditions.Paul Hunter, a professor at the University of East Anglia’s Norwich School of Medicine, said an unusually slow shedding of other viruses such as norovirus or influenza had been previously seen in patients with weakened immune systems.     In 2015, South Korean authorities disclosed that they had a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome patient stricken with lymphoma who showed signs of the virus for 116 days. They said his impaired immune system kept his body from ridding itself of the virus. The lymphoma eventually caused his death.Yuan said that even if patients develop antibodies, it did not guarantee they would become virus-free. He said that some patients had high levels of antibodies, and still tested positive to nucleic acid tests. “It means that the two sides are still fighting,” he said.    MENTAL TOLLAs could be seen in Wuhan, the virus can also inflict a heavy mental toll on those caught in a seemingly endless cycle of positive tests.Du, who set up a therapy hotline when Wuhan’s outbreak first began, allowed Reuters in early April to join her on a visit to the suburban quarantine centre on the condition that none of the patients be identified.One man rattled off the names of three Wuhan hospitals he had stayed at before being moved to a flat in the centre.  He had taken over 10 tests since the third week of February, he said, on occasions testing negative but mostly positive.     “I feel fine and have no symptoms, but they check and it’s positive, check and it’s positive,” he said. “What is with this virus?”Patients need to stay at the centre for at least 28 days and obtain two negative results before being allowed to leave. Patients are isolated in individual rooms they said were paid for by the government.The most concerning case facing Du during the visit was the man behind the mahogany door; he had told medical workers the night before that he wanted to kill himself. “I wasn’t thinking clearly,” he told Du, explaining how he had already taken numerous CT scans and nucleic acid tests, some of which tested negative, at different hospitals. He worried that he had been reinfected as he cycled through various hospitals.His grandson missed him after being gone for so long, he said, and he worried his condition meant he would never be able to see him again. He broke into another round of sobs. “Why is this happening to me?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-early-patients-test-positive-for-covid-19-2-months-after-recovering/story-iqTtqU7yNvGtVy1FjOOj8M.html
22-04-2020||World||North Korean media silent on Kim Jong Un’s whereabouts||North Korean state media on Wednesday made no mention of leader Kim Jong Un’s health or whereabouts, a day after intense international speculation over his health was sparked by media reports he was gravely ill after a cardiovascular procedure.North Korean media presented a business as usual image, carrying routine reporting of Kim’s achievements, publishing his older or undated quotes on issues like the economy.South Korean and Chinese officials and sources familiar with U.S. intelligence have cast doubt on the South Korean and US media reports, while the White House said it was closely monitoring the matter.US President Donald Trump, who held unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 in an attempt to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons, said the reports had not been confirmed and he did not put much credence in them.“I just hope he’s doing fine,” Trump told a White House news conference on Tuesday. “I’ve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un. And I’d like to see him do well. We’ll see how he does. We don’t know if the reports are true.” Asked whether he would try to reach out to Kim to check on his condition, Trump said: “Well I may, but I just hope he’s doing fine.”Speculation about Kim’s health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea’s founding father and Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15.On Wednesday, the main headlines from KCNA included pieces on sports equipment, mulberry picking, and a meeting in Bangladesh to study North Korea’s “juche” or self-reliance ideology. The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried older or undated remarks attributed to Kim in articles about the economy, the textile industry, city development, and other topics.As usual Kim’s name was plastered all over the newspaper, but there were no reports on his whereabouts.Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported late on Monday that Kim, who is believed to be about 36, was hospitalised on April 12, hours before the cardiovascular procedure.The story’s English version carried a correction on Tuesday to say the report was based on a single unnamed source in North Korea, not multiple as it earlier stated.It said his health had deteriorated since August due to heavy smoking, obesity and overwork, and he was now receiving treatment at a villa in the Mount Myohyang resort north of the capital Pyongyang. ‘EXTENDED SILENCE IS UNUSUAL’ On Tuesday, CNN reported an unnamed US official saying that the United States was “monitoring intelligence” that Kim was in grave danger after surgery.However, two South Korean government officials rejected the CNN report and South Korea’s presidential Blue House said there were no unusual signs from North Korea. China, North Korea’s only major ally, also dismissed the reports.Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, told Fox News the White House was monitoring the reports “very closely”.“There’s lots of conjecture going around,” a senior Trump administration official said on condition of anonymity late on Tuesday when asked if there was confirmation of the reports.North Korea experts have cautioned that hard facts about Kim’s condition are elusive, but said his unprecedented absence from major celebrations for his grandfather’s birthday last week signals that something may have gone awry.Thae Yong Ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to London who defected to South Korea in 2016, said state media’s extended silence is unusual because it had been quick to previously dispel questions about the status of its leadership. “Every time there is controversy about (Kim), North Korea would take action within days to show he is alive and well,” he said in a statement. His absence from the April 15 anniversary worship, in particular, is “unprecedented,” Thae said.Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who rules North Korea with an iron fist, coming to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack. Reporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult, especially on matters concerning its leadership, given tight controls on information. There have been past false reports regarding its leaders, but the fact Kim has no clear successor means any instability could present a major international risk.Trump said he had asked Kim about succession in the past but declined to elaborate.“The basic assumption would be maybe it would be someone in the family,” said O’Brien. “But, again, it’s too early to talk about that because we just don’t know what condition Chairman Kim is in and we’ll have to see how it plays out.”With no details known about Kim’s young children, analysts said Kim’s sister and loyalists could form a regency until a successor is old enough to take over.In recent years, Kim has launched a diplomatic offensive to promote himself as a world leader, holding three meetings with Trump, four with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and five with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Kim has sought to have international sanctions against his country eased, but has refused to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, a steadfast demand by the United States.

22-04-2020||World||Harvard University says it didn’t get small business aid after Trump threat||Harvard University denied Tuesday that it applied for or received funding through the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses grappling with the coronavirus crisis, after President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House he planned to force the school to pay back federal assistance.“President Trump is right that it would not have been appropriate for our institution to receive funds that were designated for struggling small businesses,” the university said in a statement Tuesday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the program wasn’t intended for publicly traded companies that had other ways to access funding, and that his department would be issuing guidelines soon in an effort to get those corporations to give back the forgivable loans to the federal government.The Shake Shack Inc. burger chain said earlier this week it planned to return a $10 million loan it received through the program amid public outrage that the package benefited chain restaurants and hotels rather than local businesses.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakAs Mnuchin was discussing the effort, Trump interjected to say Harvard will also “pay back the money.”“They shouldn’t be taking it,” Trump said. “When I saw Harvard -- one of the largest endowments anywhere in the country, maybe the world, and they are going to pay back that money.”The university -- which had an endowment valued at $40.9 billion as of June -- said it had received funding under a separate $14 billion program targeted at higher education institutions in the $2.2 trillion relief package passed by Congress late last month. That program grants universities assistance based on a formula that looks at overall enrollment and the number of students receiving federal financial aid, and at least half the funding must be provided directly to students affected by the coronavirus.“Like most colleges and universities, Harvard has been allocated funds as part of the CARES Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund,” Harvard said in a statement. “Harvard has committed that 100% of these emergency higher education funds will be used to provide direct assistance to students facing urgent financial needs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.”Harvard says it would give the all the $8.6 million it received directly to students, despite being eligible to spend half that on its institutional costs related to the virus. Other top-tier and highly-endowed universities also received funding under the program. Yale University was allocated $6.8 million, the University of Chicago got $6.2 million, and Stanford University took nearly $7.4 million in federal assistance.Late Tuesday evening, Trump posted on Twitter that Harvard should “give back the money now.” He did not say if he meant the $8.6 million.“Their whole ‘endowment’ system should be looked at,” the president added.The White House earlier Tuesday declined to comment on whether the administration would still seek to claw back Harvard’s grant under the legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harvard-university-says-it-didn-t-get-small-business-aid-after-trump-threat/story-2ApJCjZTxb0iYjjC0YRjCL.html
22-04-2020||World||US agency gives thumbs-down to Donald Trump’s ‘game-changer’ hydroxychloroquine Covid-19 drug combo||A panel of experts called by US government’s top infections diseases agency on Tuesday recommended against the use of a combination of an antimalarial drug and an antibiotic that President Donald Trump has touted as a potential “game-changer” in treating Covid-19.The experts’ panel said in guidelines for Covid-19 treatment that except for the purposes of clinical trials it “recommends against” the use of the antimalarial drug Hydroxychloroquine plus Azithromycin, the antibiotic, “because of the potential for toxicities”.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here But it left open the use of Hydroxychloroquine or another version of it, Chloroquine, by itself, saying there is insufficient data to recommend for or against its use, but warned clinicians that if they did administer it, they should “monitor the patient for adverse effect”.Also, an analysis published Tuesday on the use of Hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus patients in US Veteran Affairs hospitals showed no benefits and caused more deaths. Researchers and experts have said the study was not rigorous enough, and more data is required.The panel of experts that issued the guidelines was convened by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a federal agency headed by Anthony Fauci, a member of President Trump’s White House task force on the coronavirus outbreak.Also read: Trump’s 60-day immigration suspension to impact those seeking green cardsFauci had previously, and repeatedly, cautioned against overestimating the benefits of the drug, or the combination, arguing there was no tested evidence it works against Covid-19. And he had been blunt about it, making his case from the podium of the White House daily briefing by the task force with the president looking on.Fauci did not attend the Tuesday briefing. When asked, Trump said he had not seen the guidelines.The president has been an outspoken advocate of the antimalarial drug by itself and in combination with the antibiotic. “HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” he wrote in a tweet on March 21.Also read: Lockdowns may have only arrested first waveThe president pressed in tweets and remarks to reporters despite public pushback from his experts. A key part of his argument wast: “What do you have to lose”. The drug, Hydroxychloroquine, had been proven to be safe for for decades of being prescribed to malaria patients and even if ti did not work on a Covid-19 patient it will do them no harm.The panel experts has concluded it can be harmful in combination with the antibiotic. On its own, the drug has been allowed for clinical trials, which are currently underway on Covid-19 patients in New York, the epicenter of the American outbreak that infected 824,438 people all over the country and killed 45,052 by Tuesday night.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageIndia lifted restrictions on the export of a bunch of drugs this month to allow a consignment of Hydroxychloroquine to ordered by the United States at the urgent request by President Trump to Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month. India is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of the medicine and has deployed it for large-scale use as a prophylactic for healthcare workers.Hydroxychloroquine’s efficacy against the coronavirus has faced worldwide scrutiny and it has not fared very well. Hospitals in Sweden stopped using Chloroquine earlier this month after reports of severe side effects and researchers in Brazil aborted a trial after the death of patients administered the drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agency-gives-thumbs-down-to-donald-trump-s-game-changer-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-drug-combo/story-UHBUuHFEaZvwwJrvoDFhII.html
22-04-2020||World||New Zealand could pull off bold goal of eliminating Covid-19||While most countries are working on ways to contain the coronavirus, New Zealand has set itself a much more ambitious goal: eliminating it altogether.And experts believe the country could pull it off.The virus “doesn’t have superpowers,” said Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Auckland. “Once transmission is stopped, it’s gone.”Geography has helped. If any place could be described as socially distant it would be New Zealand, surrounded by stormy seas, with Antarctica to the south. With 5 million people spread across an area the size of Britain, even the cities aren’t overly crowded.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAnd Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has taken bold steps, putting the country under a strict lockdown in late March, when only about 100 people had tested positive for the new virus. Her motto: “Go hard and go early.”New Zealand has so far avoided a widespread outbreak, and new cases have dwindled from a peak of about 90 per day in early April to just five on Tuesday, leaving the goal tantalizingly close. Only 13 people have died so far, and Ardern has been personally briefed on each death.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“We have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved: elimination of the virus,” Ardern told reporters last week. “But it will continue to need a team of 5 million behind it.”Petousis-Harris said the country had managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that have hampered the response in many other places.“New Zealand got everything right,” she said. “Decisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody.”Ardern on Monday announced the country would stay in lockdown for another week before slightly easing some work restrictions to help restart the economy. Most of the social restrictions will remain in place.She also tried to temper expectations of her goal, saying elimination didn’t mean that new cases wouldn’t arise in the future but they would be stamped out immediately.New cases are likely when New Zealand eventually reopens its borders, but questions remain about how well prepared the health system is to implement effective contact tracing should a widespread outbreak occur. Petousis-Harris pointed to problems last year when the country failed to contain a measles outbreak.Even if New Zealand does purge itself of the virus, the effects will linger. Before the outbreak, tourism was booming. About 4 million people visited each year, drawn by stunning scenery and the lure of adventure sports. The industry employed more than 300,000 people and accounted for about 10% of New Zealand’s entire economy.“It’s been devastating. No question at all,” said Stephen England-Hall, the chief executive of Tourism New Zealand, a promotional agency. “No one can really plan to go from 100% to zero in three days.”A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that because of its reliance on tourism, New Zealand’s economy could initially be one of the hardest-hit by the coronavirus among developed nations.The government, which came into the crisis with its books in relatively good shape, has been handing out billions of dollars in temporary wage subsidies to try and prevent mass unemployment. More than half the nation’s workforce has suddenly become reliant on government handouts.Still, most people appear to support Ardern’s strict lockdown, under which schools are closed and people working nonessential jobs can leave home only for groceries or exercise. Google mobility data indicates there has been high compliance.Many have found creative ways to cope, like 28-year-old personal trainer Jessee James. Instead of meeting her clients in gyms or at their homes, she’s been leading virtual sessions over Zoom and FaceTime.Some of her clients are using cans of beans instead of dumbbells, or laundry baskets instead of sandbags. Many want to talk more about their feelings, like the business owner who needed to lay off employees or the client with emotional issues who needs encouragement.“Normally they would just talk to the people around them,” James said. “It’s been quite different.”One of the most symbolic casualties of the outbreak has been Air New Zealand. The airline had been a source of pride for many as it expanded internationally and won industry awards. In a series of frank updates, Chief Executive Greg Foran described how the carrier had reduced flights by 95% and would need to cut its workforce by at least 3,750.One person who doesn’t yet know if he will retain his job with the airline is 27-year-old pilot Scott Beatson. He and partner Bella Ashworth, who just finished law school, bought a house earlier this year, and they’re both now worried about their futures.“It’s quite sad,” Beatson said. “Just before the lockdown, I was talking with a baggage loader and a check-in person, and everyone took such pride in the company.”An eager fisherman and hiker, Beatson has taken to camping in his backyard while stuck at home. Like many around the country, he’s been tuning into some of the daily briefings given by Ardern and Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health.An unassuming official who spent a year working at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Bloomfield’s calm and reassuring presence has turned him into an unlikely heartthrob.Singer Maxwell Apse wrote a song about Bloomfield that has been viewed more than 75,000 times on YouTube. “If I had one wish, I would make it this: I’d be in your bubble,” go the lyrics.When New Zealand does come out of its bubble, the path forward remains unclear. It will need to continue relying on its traditional strength in farming to sell things abroad like dairy products, kiwifruit and wine.Some have suggested the country could first reopen its borders to Australia, which has also been successful in flattening its virus curve.England-Hall, the tourism executive, said New Zealand will look to first rebuild the domestic tourism market. He said being virus-free could eventually become a selling point abroad for the country.The conundrum is that to stay virus-free, New Zealand may need to continue its current requirement that new arrivals spend two weeks in quarantine. Given that the average tourist in the past has stayed for about 11 days, it seems an insurmountable obstacle.Ever the optimist, England-Hall foresees a new type of tourism product in which wealthy people could be pampered during a quarantine period — a kind of isolation spa.But with travel curtailed, some worry that New Zealand could revert to a more insular version of itself, before cheap flights allowed its citizens to roam the world, and foreigners to visit. A place where isolation can be both a blessing and a curse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-could-pull-off-bold-goal-of-eliminating-covid-19/story-OwbdoTl9KJTsGUnAg9HfGN.html
22-04-2020||World||Plan to use hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 treatment receives setback||The plan to use much touted anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine for treating Covid-19 patients has received a setback with more deaths being reported among those who were given the drug, according to a report.While another report suggested that there was insufficient clinical data to either recommend or oppose the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating those infected with the deadly virus. President Donald Trump, who has been aggressively promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19 patients, said that he would look into the reports.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  His administration has stockpiled more than 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, a large chunk of which has been imported from India. “I don’t know of the report. Obviously, there have been some very good reports and perhaps this one’s not a good report. But we’ll be looking at it. We’ll have a comment on it at some point,” Trump told reporters during his daily White House news conference on coronavirus.Also read: Trump-backed drug to be tested on thousands in Mumbai slumsTrump was responding to a question on a study released by a group of scientists on use of hydroxychloroquine with or without antibiotic azithromycin for 368 Covid-19 patients. The unreviewed study submitted to New England Journal of Medicine for publication and posted online found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalised with Covid-19. “An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone,” said the study that was funded by the National Institute of Health or NIH. NIH in its report ‘Therapeutic Options for COVID-19 Currently Under Investigation’ said that there are insufficient clinical data to either recommend or oppose using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19.If chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is used, clinicians should monitor the patient for adverse effects, especially prolonged QTc interval, it said.Also read: ICMR study shows side effects of HCQ in health care staff The panel of NIH experts recommended against the use of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin because of the potential for toxicities. US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen M Hahn said that no final decision has been taken as yet.“I’ve mentioned from this podium and in other venues before, what FDA is going to require is data from clinical trials, randomised clinical trials, hydroxychloroquine/placebo, to actually make a definitive decision around safety and efficacy,” he told reporters.The first one is a small retrospective study at the VA. “And similar to the data we talked about before with the French study, this is something that a doctorate would need to consider as part of a decision in writing a prescription for hydroxychloroquine,” he said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “But the preliminary data are helpful to providers. I want to ask them (doctors) to incorporate the data as we have it come forward. It’s not definitive data. It doesn’t help us make a decision from a regulatory review.” “But doctors should incorporate that in the decision-making they make on a one-on-one basis,” Hahn said in response to a question. Congressman Bill Pascrell said the report analysing hydroxychloroquine as a potential COVID-19 treatment at veterans hospitals is a bombshell indictment of the damage Trump and his administration does to Americans by putting politics before science. “The world class medicine and doctors we enjoy today are the fruit of generations of painstaking work by our ancestors. Evidence-based science is the only way out of this crisis, not unproven miracle therapies personally favored by Donald Trump,” he said.“Trump’s frequent touting of this treatment was deeply irresponsible, and may have heaped unnecessary pain and suffering, not to mention false hope, upon Americans struck by this terrible illness.” “I have repeatedly warned the FDA about the danger of prizing Trump’s political pressure over scientific process. Unless we are guided by science and science alone, we will have more unnecessary deaths on our hands,” Pascrell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/plan-to-use-hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-19-treatment-receives-setback/story-iWZ8TY7XXbxYigGXTQymdI.html
22-04-2020||World||Political wrangling, controversy mark re-opening of US states||Governors of about half a dozen US states pushed ahead on Tuesday with plans to partially reopen for business despite warnings by some health officials that doing so could trigger a new surge in coronavirus cases.The easing of sweeping restrictions in Georgia, South Carolina and other mostly Southern US states follows protests against rules imposed during the pandemic that shut down businesses and largely confined residents to their homes.A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed a majority of Americans believed stay-at-home orders should remain in place until public health officials determine lifting them is safe, despite the damage to the US economy.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“It’s a matter of concern, this whole idea of opening up. It’s based on non-science generated parameters,” Dr. Boris Lushniak, dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Health, told Reuters in an interview. Deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus, topped 45,150 nationwide as cases climbed to over 810,000, according to a Reuters tally. New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan each reported their highest single-day coronavirus-related death tolls - over 800 between the three states. New York state, the epicenter of the US outbreak, reported 481 new deaths.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak Governors are under pressure from businesses and some constituents to relax stay-at-home orders that have thrown over 20 million people out of work in the past month alone.In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers who filed a lawsuit against Democratic Governor Tony Evers, challenging his stay-at-home order that runs until May 26.CDC WARNS OF FALL OUTBREAKTensions between US President Donald Trump, a Republican, and local officials have risen over the US government’s role in ramping up testing, which infectious disease experts say is key to enable a safe reopening. Those experts say the United States, with a population of nearly 330 million people, should test 3 million per week to get an accurate sense of the virus’s reach. States have tested only a third of that number in the past seven days, according to the Covid Tracking Project.Even as states move ahead with plans to reopen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned a second wave of the coronavirus could be worse if it coincides with the start of seasonal flu season.“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” CDC Director Robert Redfield said in an interview with The Washington Post.Georgia is among a half dozen states that will allow more business activity this week or next.Brian Kemp, Georgia’s Republican governor, will allow gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys, tattoo and massage parlors to reopen on Friday, followed by movie houses and restaurants next week. Kemp said his plan balances public health with the need to reignite the state’s economy, saying social distancing rules would remain in place.Georgia has reported 174,000 positive cases and six deaths per 100,000 people, both below the national average, according to a Reuters analysis of data collected by the Covid Tracking Project.But the state also has one of the lowest testing rates, giving health officials less data on the reach of the illness to base decisions on reopening, the data showed.“Don’t go out,” Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, a Democrat, told residents of the eastern Georgia city during a news conference. “People will not come here if they think our businesses are not safe.”CUOMO MEETS TRUMPNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo emerged from a meeting with Trump at the White House and said the president had agreed to help his state procure chemical reagents and other supplies needed to double testing capacity. Cuomo said it was up to his state to help labs boost their testing capacity and to organize the workers needed to take more samples.“That is an intelligent division of labor,” Cuomo said at a press briefing. “Let each level of government do what it does best.”The governor said New York would try to double the number of people it tests each day - including diagnostic and antibody tests - to 40,000, characterizing the task as an “enormous undertaking” that would take weeks.Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom of California, the most populous US state, said despite evidence the outbreak was slowing there, cases and deaths were still rising. Over the seven-day period ending on Sunday night, the number of deaths in California nearly doubled, and the number of new cases increased by nearly 50%, state data showed.Newsom promised to release a detailed plan for testing and reopening on Wednesday, but cautioned it was too soon to loosen public health restrictions.In Washington, D.C., the US Senate unanimously approved $484 billion in additional coronavirus relief for the US economy and hospitals treating patients sickened by the pandemic, sending the measure to the House of Representatives for final passage later this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/political-wrangling-controversy-mark-re-opening-of-us-states/story-Yrws1N0bDqsjH8x6gquSjJ.html
22-04-2020||World||Trump agrees to help New York double coronavirus testing: Governor||US President Donald Trump agreed to have the federal government help procure chemical reagents and other supplies needed for New York to double its testing capacity for the novel coronavirus, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday.Cuomo, speaking at a briefing after meeting with Trump in Washington earlier in the day, also said the president indicated he would work to get federal funding to states in the next financial aid legislation to be passed by Congress.With coronavirus-related hospitalizations trending lower in New York, Cuomo has in the past few days turned his attention to the challenge of widespread testing, which he has said would be critical to getting New Yorkers back to work.Cuomo said Trump had agreed in their White House meeting to have the federal government take charge of securing materials that the manufacturers who supply New York’s state labs have struggled to procure from overseas.The governor added that it was up to his state to help the labs boost their testing capacity and to organize the workforce needed to take more samples from the population.“That is an intelligent division of labor,” Cuomo told the briefing. “Let each level of government do what it does best.”Cuomo said New York would aim to double the number of people it tests each day - including diagnostic and antibody tests - to 40,000. He characterized it as “an enormous undertaking” that would take several weeks, without being specific on timing.New York, which is the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, has reported 257,000 cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, and nearly 20,000 deaths, accounting for nearly half of the country’s fatalities.Along with other governors, Cuomo has called on the federal government to provide direct cash assistance to the states, a request that has so far gone unanswered in the stimulus packages passed by Congress.The National Governors Association has called on Congress to grant a total of $500 billion to all states to help shore up battered finances.New York, which is facing a $10 billion to $15 billion budget shortfall, needs the infusion of cash to pay the salaries of teachers, police officers, healthcare workers, Cuomo said.“You know the state governments are broke,” Cuomo said, adding that Trump had indicated he understood the situation and had said he would “work hard” to get funding for the states in the next round of legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-agrees-to-help-new-york-double-coronavirus-testing-governor/story-q2XpAc1iB86372uwWDfeUM.html
22-04-2020||World||‘Would like to see him be well’: Trump on Kim Jong Un’s health||US President Donald Trump said he doesn’t know about Kim Jong Un’s health after American and South Korean officials gave differing accounts on the North Korean leader’s condition after he was conspicuously absent from a major celebration.“I wish him well, we’ve had a good relationship,” Trump said Tuesday in response to a question about Kim at a White House. The U.S. president said “we don’t know” if the reports about Kim’s health deteriorating are true, adding that he might reach out to check on him.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicUS officials said Monday they were told Kim was in critical condition after undergoing cardiovascular surgery last week and they were unsure of his current health. Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s office said that Kim was conducting “normal activities” in a rural part of the country assisted by close aides and no special movements were detected.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakKim continued to be absent from North Korean state media as of Wednesday morning. Neither the state broadcaster nor the official Korean Central News Agency mentioned new public appearances by the leader, although they continued to publicize his messages to dignitaries around the world.“I just hope he is doing fine,” Trump said. “I had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un and that is to the benefit of the country. That is not a bad thing, that’s a good thing, and i would like to see him be well. We will see how he does. again, I don’t know that the reports are true.”Trump and Kim have gone from trading insults in 2017, when North Korea was testing nuclear weapons and missiles that could deliver them to the US, to striking up what Pyongyang officials describe as “mysteriously wonderful chemistry” after meeting three times since a summit in June 2018. Despite the unprecedented talks and the bonhomie between the two, there have been non indications that Kim has slowed down his production of weapons of mass destruction.The health of Kim, overweight and a heavy smoker, is one of North Korea’s most closely guarded secrets, known by a handful of people in the inner circle of leadership. While North Korea had scaled down major events as it battles the coronavirus pandemic, speculation about Kim had been growing since his unprecedented absence from April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung, one of the biggest days on the country’s calendar.Even the most well-informed North Korea experts find it hard to tell what’s happening in the secretive state. The Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that gathers information from informants inside the isolated nation, separately reported that Kim underwent a “cardiovascular surgical procedure” and was now mostly recovered.“I do not trust such reports. If he has a serious health problem, only a handful of confidantes will know,” said Chun Yungwoo, a former South Korean envoy to international nuclear talks with North Korea. “Usually such a state secret cannot be leaked.”North Korea’s state media reported on April 11 that Kim attended a Politburo meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party. The next day it said he inspected a military unit, but didn’t reveal the date of that visit. There have been no state media reports since them on him at any event.Kim has made 17 public appearances this year that were mentioned in state media -- at a pace of a little more than one a week -- South Korea’s Unification ministry said. That’s slightly down from 84 public appearances last year.The BloodlineHe has been shown in state media in recent months appearing at military drills and riding a white horse on the country’s revered Mt. Paektu, where state propaganda says his grandfather used as a guerrilla base to fight Japanese colonial occupiers and his father was born.Any leadership crisis in North Korea could have ramifications for regional stability, as well as for talks with the US over the country’s nuclear arsenal. Kim, who took power in 2011 following his father’s 17-year reign, developed the capability to deliver a nuclear warhead to any part of the US before engaging in direct talks with Trump over his arsenal and sanctions imposed on the state.While there’s been little time for him to groom a successor, Kim raised the status of his younger sister Kim Yo Jong as a key player in the secretive state. She was thrust into the global spotlight when she served as envoy to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and became the first member of the immediate ruling family to visit Seoul.“We can’t completely rule out his sister yet, although it would be unprecedented for their system causing much confusion because she’s a woman, but on the other hand, she’s part of the Mt. Paektu bloodline,” said Duyeon Kim, a senior adviser for Northeast Asia and Nuclear Policy at the International Crisis Group, referring to the mountain seen as the symbol of Kim family rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/would-like-to-see-him-be-well-trump-on-kim-jong-un-s-health/story-klABKRa2oYgcH52QJO4AtK.html

22-04-2020||World||CDC chief warns 2nd Covid-19 wave may be worse, arriving with flu season||A second wave of the coronavirus is expected to hit the United States next winter and could strike much harder than the first because it would likely arrive at the start of influenza season, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday.“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” CDC Director Robert Redfield told the Washington Post in an interview.As the current outbreak continues to taper off, as shown by a recent decline in hospitalization rates and other indicators, authorities need to prepare for a probable resurgence in the months ahead.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We’re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time,” he said, and the combination would put even greater strain on the nation’s healthcare system than the first outbreak.The virus, which causes a highly contagious and potentially fatal respiratory illness dubbed COVID-19, emerged late last year in central China. The first known U.S. infection, a travel-related case, was diagnosed on Jan. 20 in Washington state near Seattle.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakSince then, nearly 810,000 people have tested positive in the United States, and more than 45,000 have died from the disease.Redfield and other public health authorities credit drastic stay-at-home orders and widespread business and school closings across the country for slowing the spread of infections. But the restrictions have also stifled American commerce while throwing at least 22 million people out of work over the past four weeks.Even as the lockdown is gradually eased, Redfield stressed the importance of individuals continuing to practice social distancing among one another.At the same time, he said, public health authorities must vastly ramp up a testing system to identify those who are infected and to locate their close personal interactions through contact tracing.Asked about the recent flurry of street protests of stay-at-home orders and calls for states to be “liberated” from such restrictions - as President Donald Trump has advocated on Twitter - Redfield told the Post: “It’s not helpful.”Building a nationwide contact tracing network, key to preventing newly diagnosed cases from growing into large outbreaks, poses a major challenge because it is so labor intensive, requiring a workforce that by some estimates would require as many as 300,000 personnel.Redfield said the CDC is discussing with state officials the possibility of enlisting and training workers from the U.S. Census Bureau, and volunteers from Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, to create a new contact tracing workforce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-chief-warns-2nd-covid-19-wave-may-be-worse-arriving-with-flu-season/story-EJosAHOydnoIAYZPd8cV3L.html
22-04-2020||World||US Senate approves new $480 bn coronavirus pandemic relief package||The US Senate approved a bipartisan, nearly half-trillion-dollar coronavirus relief package Tuesday, with funding earmarked for devastated small businesses, overwhelmed hospitals, and a ramp-up of testing nationwide during the pandemic.The essential job-saving measure, which passed by unanimous consent after more than a week of negotiations between Democrats, Republicans and the White House, now heads to the House of Representatives where a vote could occur as early as Thursday.The effort is the government’s latest massive cash infusion to prop up a collapsing economy amid struggles to contain a pandemic that has killed 43,000 Americans and left some 22 million people jobless.“This is a significant package,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, one which was cobbled together “on a crash timeline in these most unusual circumstances.”The measure builds on the $2.2 trillion rescue legislation -- the largest-ever federal intervention in the US economy -- signed into law last month. President Donald Trump called on Congress to swiftly send him the bill, which would re-fund a program that has already helped more than 1.6 million businesses, so he can sign it into law.“I urge the House to pass the bill, and they’ll be voting on it, I imagine, very soon,” he said.Late last month, with many shops and restaurants nationwide forced to shutter due to the pandemic, the government launched the PPP to provide $350 billion in what were essentially grants as long as businesses use the funds to pay their workers.Banks were flooded with requests, and the money quickly ran out.The new tranche would include $320 billion in small business funding, plus $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion to expand coronavirus testing, McConnell said.It also provides $60 billion in disaster recovery loans and grants, he added.“We have taken a giant step forward” towards providing more relief for small businesses and for first responders in hospitals, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said.Schumer claimed Democratic victory for obtaining funding for testing, and he praised Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief of staff Mark Meadows for agreeing to include it.“We will not get America moving again until we have a national, well thought out, well executed testing program -- and this administration doesn’t have one,” Schumer said.State funding later Republicans wanted to pass a measure to fund just the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, but ultimately testing and hospital funding was included.Schumer said considerable PPP money will be reserved for minority-run small businesses and those without access to large financial institutions.The deal leaves out a key Democratic demand: extra funding for state and local governments battling the pandemic.Trump said he wants such funding included in the next coronavirus rescue package, and congressional leaders said the forthcoming bill was already in the works.The next measure will be “bigger, bolder, better” than the interim deal, Schumer said.With the 100-member Senate having postponed its full sessions until May 4 due to coronavirus, Tuesday’s vote occurred during a pro forma session, which usually features few lawmakers but can pass legislation if there is unanimous consent.The measure passed, but McConnell made clear any subsequent aid package, including funding for state and local governments, would only be considered “when the Senate is back in session, with full participation” in Washington.A vote in the House, also on recess, this week could be complicated. The House is unlikely to pass the job-saving package by unanimous consent as the Senate did.Number two Democrat Steny Hoyer said it likely will have to convene a House session where more than half the members return to Washington to attend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-approves-new-480-bn-coronavirus-pandemic-relief-package/story-0VOk7AqPJMsWljFBFu83HP.html
22-04-2020||World||Boris Johnson’s government faces first political test of lockdown||Boris Johnson’s coronavirus strategy faces its first major political test since the U.K. was put on lockdown a month ago when members of Parliament question ministers in a sitting conducted via video-conference.The prime minister remains out of action recovering from his own severe case of Covid-19, and will not be in the House of Commons to answer questions when Parliament resumes its scrutiny of the government’s plans Wednesday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn his place will be Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, facing opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer. While both Raab and Starmer will be in the chamber, in a historic first, most of the members of Parliament taking part will be doing so via Zoom videoconferencing technology.That session, and the statement after it from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, will give ministers a sense of how much pressure they’re under from MPs to start easing the lockdown that Johnson imposed March 23. For nearly a month, most shops and all restaurants and bars have been closed, in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. That’s due to continue for another three weeks.The “virtual Parliament” will lack the drama of normal sessions, with only 50 MPs allowed in the chamber, meaning it’s likely to be a more subdued affair. The limits of videoconferencing will also restrict the ability of members to interrupt or challenge ministers, at a time when the government has placed restrictions of people’s liberties unprecedented in peacetime.‘The Long Run’The government faces criticism over shortages of protective medical equipment, and on Tuesday the Office for National Statistics released data showing the dramatic toll of the virus. It said that in the week ending April 10, 18,516 deaths had been registered, the highest weekly number in more than two decades and 76% more than the average for that week.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakHancock tried to get onto the front foot that evening, announcing that Britain will begin human trials of a vaccine this week.“In the long run, the best way to defeat coronavirus is through a vaccine,” Hancock told the government’s daily news conference. “The U.K. is at the front of the global effort. We have put more money than any other country into a global search for a vaccine and, for all the efforts around the world, two of the leading vaccine developments are taking place here at home.”The trials will be of a drug developed at Oxford University. Hancock said the government would give 20 million pounds ($25 million) to support the research. “In normal times, reaching this stage would take years,” he said. Another 20.5 million pounds will go to a separate project at London’s Imperial College.Complaints from health workers about the availability of personal protective equipment continue, but Hancock was keen to emphasize the government’s achievements. He said that with the number of people hospitalized with the virus declining, the ministers had achieved their goal of protecting the National Health Service from being overwhelmed.“At no point in this crisis has anyone who could benefit from critical care been denied that care because there weren’t enough staff, or beds, or ventilators to treat them,” Hancock said.His announcement came as:The health secretary said the process for finding a vaccine would take “trial and error,” but he has told U.K. scientists leading the search he would “back them to the hilt and give them every resource they need” in order to succeed. “After all, the upside of being the first country in the world to develop a successful vaccine is so huge that I am throwing everything at it,” he said.Van-Tam said the number of new cases being diagnosed in the U.K. remained high. “It isn’t clear there is an enormous downturn at this point,” he said. “The numbers are varying day to day, but they remain high and we remain in a situation of danger that we must take very seriously indeed.”He also set out the difficulty facing governments in deciding how to ease restrictions on public activities. “We do at some point hope that we turn this curve down,” he said. The difficulty then, he said, was “easing some of the restrictions we are under without letting this virus just chase off again. That’s a really difficult balancing act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-government-faces-first-political-test-of-lockdown/story-MLZ9qSs5U4OEgmrOFSBT1K.html

This is the time for solidarity, collaboration, cooperation and mutual support.”But after weeks of elaborate praise of president Xi’s performance in the pandemic, Trump has turned to blaming China and halting US contributions to the World Health Organization, accusing it of parroting misinformation from Beijing.China’s UN Ambassador Zhang Jun stressed the importance of multilateralism, saying “we live in one world” and Covid-19 “knows no borders.”“We need to support the United Nations and the WHO in playing a leading and coordinating role in defeating Covid-19, the common enemy of all mankind,” he said. “We should stand firm against the politicization of the pandemic and remove all obstacles which hinder our cooperation.”’Huang said the American people helped China “without hesitation” when it was in great difficulty, and its consulate and UN mission have donated 25,000 N95 masks, 2,000 protective suits, and 75,000 pairs of medical gloves, which reached New York last weekend.According to incomplete estimates, Huang said, China has also donated a total of 1,000 ventilators, 6,550,000 masks, 310,000 pairs of surgical gloves, 150,000 goggles and 32,000 protective suits to the United States, much of it to New York.Penny Abeywardena, New York City’s commissioner for international affairs, thanked China for its “extremely generous donation,” saying “it is what our health care workers need and we are absolutely grateful that you are in this fight with us.” She said the latest donation is already going to health care personel.She also referred to attacks on Chinese-Americans as a result of Covid-19 originating in China, saying New York City “will not tolerate any harassment or discrimination against your community.”Both the consul-general and UN ambassador expressed hope that the supplies will help New York win the fight against the pandemic.Zhang said he wanted to stress that living in New York “we share its joy, we share its pain,” and every evening at 7 pm EDT he and his wife go out on their balcony and join their neighbours in clapping to support the city’s essential workers.“I sincerely hope that, with the unity of all New Yorkers, we will defeat the pandemic and bring New York back to a dynamic and colorful life,” the UN ambassador said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-knows-no-borders-china-calls-for-solidarity-not-finger-pointing/story-uMh6CkkKRhidvLVf0hYckI.html
22-04-2020||World||Donald Trump’s 60-day immigration suspension to impact those seeking green cards||President Donald Trump has said he expects to sign an executive order Wednesday that will suspend immigration — mostly impacting Green Cards — for the next 60 days to ensure Americans hits by record layoffs caused by the coronavirus outbreak get a first shot at all available jobs.Exemptions will be over cases on humanitarian ground and short-term work, which could include, though he did not specify, H-1B visas, more than 70% of which have tended to go to Indians hired from US universities or from India by US companies and US subsidiaries of Indian companies.The president said he will review economic conditions at the end of the 60-day period to determine if he wants to extend the suspension or terminate it.Nearly 22 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits over the last four weeks and many more layoffs are feared as the economy teeters on the edge of the worst slowdown in US history, a situation compared by many economists to the Great Depression of 1929.As Hindustan Times reported earlier on Trump’s tweet about the upcoming executive order, more than 1 million new immigrants are admitted to the United States every year. India sent the most in 2017 with 126,000 people, according to a Pew study. It was followed by Mexico (124,000), China (121,000) and Cuba (41,000).

22-04-2020||World||WHO stands by China in coronavirus origin row||The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that all available evidence suggests the coronavirus originated in animals in China late last year and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory.US President Donald Trump said last week that his government was trying to determine whether the virus emanated from a lab in Wuhan, where the coronavirus emerged in December.“All available evidence suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not manipulated or constructed in a lab or somewhere else,” WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a Geneva news briefing. “It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin.”It was not clear, Chaib added, how the virus had jumped the species barrier to humans but there had “certainly” been an intermediate animal host. “It most likely has its ecological reservoir in bats but how the virus came from bats to humans is still to be seen and discovered.”She did not respond to a request to elaborate on whether it was possible the virus may have inadvertently escaped from a lab. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has dismissed rumours both that it synthesised the virus or allowed it to escape.Also on Tuesday, as global cases crossed 2.5 million, the WHO warned that lifting of lockdowns must be gradual, and if restrictions were to be relaxed too soon, there would be a resurgence of infections. Takeshi Kasai, WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, said, “At least until a vaccine, or a very effective treatment, is found, this process will need to become our new normal.”In Myanmar, a car used by the WHO to transport swab samples to be tested for the virus was attacked, killing the driver and wounding a passenger.In Germany, Bavaria cancelled the Oktoberfest for the first time since WWII. The event takes place from September to October.Spain unveiled a series of measures aimed at helping prostitutes and victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation survive the country’s lockdown.In the UK, as PM Boris Johnson said he would speak with US President Donald Trump and hold an audience with the queen this week, scientists at the University of Cambridge found a link between living in an area of England with high levels of air pollution and the severity of Covid-19. Researchers at the university’s MRC Toxicology Unit analysed data on Covid-19 cases and deaths against the levels of three major air pollutants, collected between the years 2018 and 2019.Meanwhile, watchdog Reporters Without Borders claimed China has “extensively” censored information on the outbreak, saying the impact of it has been experienced globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-stands-by-china-in-coronavirus-origin-row/story-hVD2ygHtJ4IO3EkUoipCfP.html
