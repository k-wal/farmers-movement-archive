While Prime Minister Khan has not spoken his mind yet, his cabinet colleagues are divided on the issue.While de-facto health minister Dr Zafar Mirza has pushed for the ongoing restrictions on congregation prayers to continue, senior minister Shaikh Rasheed told the media on Saturday that he was not in favour of such a ban. Science minister Fawad Chaudhry, in a tweet, singled out the Tablighi Jamaat for the spread of the virus in Pakistan.It is this confusion, say observers, that will push up the numbers of those infected by Sars-CoV-2 virus in the days to come. With over 7,600 confirmed cases and deaths nearing 150 count, experts have warned that numbers could balloon in days to come.An important role in the spread is being played by the members of the Tablighi-Jamaat.Police officials say that about 100,000 people attended the Raiwind Ijtema, which is an annual event, at a time when the coronavirus crisis was brewing. The Jamaat estimates over 200,000 attended the congregation.This included the 3,000-odd people from abroad including China, Indonesia, Nigeria and Afghanistan, the organisers said. About half of them are now quarantined in Pakistan, the others left the country without being tested.Gaza’s health ministry confirmed last month its first two cases of coronavirus were Palestinians who had attended the gathering.On the whole, about 7,000 followers have been quarantined in Lahore, while all over Punjab 10,263 quarantined of which 539 have tested positive for the virus so far. Almost 600 members have been quarantined in Raiwind itself. In Sindh province up to 8,000 Tablighis have been quarantined.Local media quoted health officials in Punjab as saying that that the coronavirus cases are rising in Punjab because of the ‘carelessness’ of the Tableeghi Jamaat members who keep on meeting the public as a part of their preaching after their return to the areas they belonged to.Looking back, many have questioned why the government allowed the gathering to take place in the first place. One reason for this could be the cozy relationship enjoyed by the Tablighi Jamaat and the Pakistani establishment.The Jamaat has a big following within the Pakistan armed forces. A number of Generals have been members of the Jamaat. Many serving and retired officers attend the gathering each year. In the early 90’s, the head of the ISI - General Javed Nasir, was also a Jamaat member. Given such influence, it is hard, say observers, to challenge the Jamaat’s decisions.Some insist that the change would have to come from within the Jamaat. One of the leading figures of the Jamaat, Maulana Tariq Jamil, is considered a mentor by prime minister Imran Khan. The prime minister has repeatedly turned to the cleric for guidance on religious issues. It is believed that Imran Khan’s stance on the coronavirus is tempered by the statements made by Maulana Jamil.After the Lahore event, Tariq Jamil gave a speech in which he said: “God chooses who is infected and who is not, and God will save us.”By 1 April, Jamil had changed his views somewhat when for the first time he described the virus as life-threatening.But Jamil and others continue to resist calls for restrictions on congregational prayers. In fact, some fear that Jamaat supporters would resort to violence if forced to stay away from mosques. In the Punjab city of Layyah, a member stabbed a police officer while trying to escape from a Tablighi Jamaat centre as quarantining measures were being enforced.Negotiations have brought some results as well. Last week, Tablighi Jamaat elders sent out a letter to the movement’s followers instructing them to stop their door-to-door visits and not to congregate.And yet the Pakistan government is shy of a complete lockdown on prayers and other activities that the religious organizations are calling for. Possibly if the situation deteriorates, the army leadership will once again have to step in to let sanity prevail, say some.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-scrambles-to-track-tablighi-jamaat-followers-after-covid-19-cases-rise/story-UWGZq1lipoWVpiyXZs8hMN.html
18-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: Donald Trump scales down US toll projection to 65K; backs, instigates protestors||President Donald Trump on Friday said he expects US fatalities from the coronavirus to be much lower than projected earlier because of a “lot of work” done by his administration and came out in support of protestors seeking removal of social-distancing restrictions in Democratic-ruled states.“Right now, we’re heading at probably around 60-, maybe 65,000,” the president told reporters at the daily White House briefing about his assessment of the state of the epidemic in the United States, where 37,079 people had died till Saturday morning, with 706,779 confirmed cases of infections.The president’s assessment is much in line with revised projections by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which has been routinely cited by White House experts and others. It has lowered its projection of COVID-19 deaths in the United States from 80,000 at the start of the crisis to 60,308 Covid-19 deaths in the United States based on the current social-distancing measures in force.Experts of the president’s White House task force had a more dire projection of up to $2.2 million if no mitigation efforts were undertaken and to 240,000 even if mitigation efforts such as social-distancing were enforced “perfectly”.There is much more optimism now based on an assessment that the United States has past its peak, a vast number of counties have not reported new cases in the last seven days, hospitalization numbers have dropped in New York state, the epicentre of the US epidemic, and there has been a flattening of the curve on other metrics.President Trump unveiled a set of federal guidelines Thursday for states to follow, at the discretion of the governors, to begin reopening the country based on the growing optimism among his experts and, equally, frustration among businesses, employers and employees ruined by the lockdown.Protestors have taken to the streets in varying numbers across the country demanding an end to the restrictions. Most of them have been identified as supporters of the president, who has backed them and acknowledged being in agreement with them.On Friday however, the president fired off a series of tweets supporting protests only in states ruled by Democratic governors. The language used in the posts was both supportive and incendiary. “Liberate Virginia”, “Liberate Michigan” and “Liberate Minnesota”, he wrote in separate posts.Michigan is among the worst hit states with more than 30,000 cases and 2,200 fatalities. Virginia has fared far better with a little more than 7,400 cases and 230 deaths. But neither state has reported declining numbers, a key “gatekeeping” criteria laid down by his administration’s reopening guidelines.The president justified his tweets when asked about them at the briefing and said the restrictions in these states were “very powerful” and “you can get the same result out of doing a little bit less”.The president has been eager to reopen the country and put it back to work as the epidemic has devastated the economy, shut down small and medium businesses such as restaurants, theaters and all other non-essential services, crippled large corporations specially in the aviation sector, and left 22 million people jobless.Disbursement of loans, grants and direct cash payments are underway to businesses and families from a $2.2 trillion relief package announced last month to mitigate the hardship. On Friday, the American president announced $18 billion in relief for farmers and ranchers, which include direct cash payments and farm purchases to be delivered to food banks.Grocery stores have limped back to normalcy from the early days of the epidemic when people cleaned up shelves fearing shortages. Food products are available in plenty now (not toilet rolls or sanitizers), but shopping is now subject to social-distancing guidelines, in varying degrees of severity.The use of face coverings such as masks are mandatory in public settings where social-distancing is not possible in some states, such as Florida. A man was arrested last week there for posting online a threat to open fire at a grocery store because not enough customers ere using face coverings there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-donald-trump-scales-down-us-toll-projection-to-65k-backs-instigates-protestors/story-A3fLCBQPIy1DMvZgYT1R3K.html
18-04-2020||World||A sombre birthday for Queen Elizabeth as Covid-19 death toll crosses 15,000||There will be no gun salutes and other ceremonial events for Queen Elizabeth’s 94th birthday on Tuesday, Buckingham Palace announced on Saturday, as the death toll from coronavirus pandemic in the UK climbed to 15,464 (a day-rise of 888).Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that the commitment to pick up 80 per cent of the salary of employees furloughed by companies for three months would be extended by another month, since the economic conditions are unlikely to recover soon enough.A Buckingham Palace official said the monarch had decided that the gun salutes usually held in Hyde Park and the Tower of London would not be appropriate at this time. As of Saturday, the UK-wide number of cases tested positive for the virus was 114,217 (day-rise of 5,526).The queen, who moved to the Windsor Castle after the Boris Johnson government announced lockdown and other measures in March, earlier delivered a rare message to the Commonwealth, striking an optimistic note: “We will meet again”.Krishan Arora, a doctor practicising for 27 years in Croydon, London, passed away after being infected by the virus, health officials announced. He is one of over 50 Indian and other non-white medical professionals who passed away in recent days.Unions warned on Saturday that the continuing shortage of personal protection equipment could lead to medical staff refusing to work in hospitals dealing with thousands of patients. Some hospitals reportedly asked the staff to use aprons instead of standard gowns.Sara Gorton of Unison union said: “If gowns run out, staff in high-risk areas may well decide that it’s no longer safe for them to work. No part of the NHS should use this move as an excuse to ration supplies of gowns when they still have stocks. That would cause a damaging breakdown of trust at a time when staff are working under intense pressure.”Health secretary Matt Hancock admitted during a hearing of the House of Commons health and social care select committee on Friday that the NHS was “tight on gowns”, describing it as a “pressure point”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-sombre-birthday-for-queen-elizabeth-as-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-15-000/story-uexGtBBws6wV6njuWsQA7H.html
18-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: China cancelling clinical trials for lack of test subjects as case numbers fall||Several clinical trials of drugs including one of the first to be identified as a potential anti-Covid-19 medicine, remdesivir, have been cancelled in China because of the lack of testing candidates.As of Thursday, 598 novel coronavirus-related clinical trials had been registered in China but some 40 had been cancelled. According to a state news agency, Xinhua report earlier this week, in all three have been allowed to go ahead with clinical trials including one, which is now in the second stage.The application for these trials were withdrawn ahead of the deadline to register them earlier this week, Zhong Nanshan, who is leading the team of experts advising the Chinese government on Covid-19 outbreak was quoted by the China Science Daily.Zhong said the lack of available testing subjects was because the outbreak had passed its peak in China and the government had been able to contain the spread.The Chinese mainland reported a total of 26 new cases including 17 new imported cases of the novel coronavirus disease Friday, bringing the total number of imported cases to 1,566, the national health commission (NHC) said Saturday.Overall China has reported 4632 deaths and nearly 82800 cases of Covid-19.Since the third week of March, China’s daily increase in Covid-19 cases has been in the dozens with imported cases accounting for most new ones.The sharp drop in patients has hampered trials, Zhong said.According to Zhong many studies had to be cancelled because no one expected that China would control the epidemic so quickly.“Now there is no opportunity for large-scale clinical drug or treatment research in China,” he said.The clinical trial of remdesivir for treatment of Covid-19 involving mild or moderate cases has been suspended in China for the reason that the waning outbreak made it impossible to enroll enough eligible patients, according to clinicaltrials.gov, a website maintained by the US government. A separate trial of the experimental drug for patients with severe symptoms in China was terminated Friday for similar reasons, said Daniel O’Day, CEO of the American drugmaker, in an open letter.“The publication of data from the China remdesivir trials rests with the Chinese investigators, but we have been informed that the study in patients with severe symptoms was stopped due to stalled enrollment,” O’Day said.Seven clinical trials on the drug were initiated, the CEO said.An US health news website said the initial results from the drug’s trial have been positive.“A Chicago hospital treating severe Covid-19 patients with Gilead Sciences’ antiviral medicine remdesivir in a closely watched clinical trial is seeing rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms, with nearly all patients discharged in less than a week,” STAT news reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-china-cancelling-clinical-trials-for-lack-of-test-subjects-as-case-numbers-fall/story-QBEj3ymu0UqzZFJWdeoWiO.html
18-04-2020||World||‘Game on if...’: Experts put stake on Oxford’s coronavirus vaccine trial results by May end||It will be ‘game on’ if ongoing human trials for a coronavirus vaccine in the University of Oxford show strong immune response by the middle or end of May, a senior academic on the UK government’s newly-formed taskforce on vaccines said on Saturday.Several vaccine-related projects are in progress in the UK and elsewhere. Sarah Gilbert of Oxford believes that a vaccine could be available by September. Business secretary Alok Sharma announced the taskforce and multi-million pound funding for projects on Friday.Academic John Bell, who is a member of the taskforce, said the UK currently does not have the capacity to produce the amount of vaccine it needs to tackle coronavirus, but “is in a really good place” for vaccine development.On the ongoing trial in Oxford and whether the vaccine could be produced in the near future, he said the real question was whether it would be effective: “We won’t get a signal for that until May. The crucial thing is you have to do a proper trial because safety is really important for these things.”“But if we can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on. And they may well get across the finish line by mid-August,” he told BBC.Bell and other experts such as Gilbert believe that the next challenge is to set in motion production processes so that it can be made widely soon.Bell added: “One of the reasons that we were rushing is to try and catch this wave of the disease. Because when the disease goes away there will be very, very few incident cases until we get a second wave”.“The team developing the vaccine are very keen to get it out in its trial now so that we can catch the remainder of this wave”.Announcing the taskforce at the Downing Street briefing, Sharma said: “UK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people’s lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts”.“The Vaccine Taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible”.One new project led by the University of Oxford will trial an anti-malarial drug believed to have anti-inflammatory properties to determine whether it could diminish the effects of Covid-19 on people in high risk groups.Other projects include Imperial College London testing a vaccine against coronavirus that aims for the body to produce more protective antibodies; and Public Health England developing a new antibody that could offer protection against infection and disease progression of coronavirus.As of Friday, the UK had 14,576 deaths and 108,692 cases, as concerns mounted over lack of personal protection equipment for medical staff. Officials believe social distancing and other curbs are leading to a ‘gradual decline’ in the number of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/game-on-experts-put-stake-on-oxford-s-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-results-by-may-end/story-AbH6Ihht4TwKXL04kEkFcI.html
18-04-2020||World||Covid-19: US, China, Britain and South Korea debate easing virus restrictions as economies falter||Governments around the world are wrestling with when and how to lift economically painful virus-control measures as unemployment rises and rent payments come due. Many places have mandated strict restrictions on movement to try to stop the spread of a new coronavirus that has infected more than 2.2 million people and for which there is no vaccine. The debate in the U.S. has taken on political tones. Republican President Donald Trump urged supporters to “LIBERATE” three states led by Democratic governors, tweeting the kind of rhetoric some have used to demand an end to stay-at-home orders that have thrown millions out of work. Most governments remain cautious, even as the economic toll rises. Public health experts warn that easing shutdowns must be accompanied by wider testing and tracing of infected people to keep the virus from coming back. South Korea’s Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said Saturday that new guidelines could be issued soon that officials have said would allow people to engage in “certain levels of economic and social activity.” America’s largest state, California, lost nearly 100,000 jobs in March. “We are now in a pandemic-induced recession,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said. Texas and Florida, which both have Republican governors, took first steps toward easing restrictions. Top leaders of China’s ruling Communist Party called for deficit spending and a more flexible monetary policy after the economy shrunk 6.8 percent in the first three months of the year. The outbreak has killed more than 150,000 people worldwide, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally based on figures supplied by government health authorities around the globe. The number all but certainly underestimates the actual toll. Authorities said that almost everywhere, thousands have died with COVID-19 symptoms — many in nursing homes — without being tested for the virus, and have thus gone uncounted. In Britain, with an official count of about 14,600 dead, the country’s statistics agency said the actual number could be around 15% higher. An Associated Press tally from news media reports and state health departments indicates 6,912 U.S. deaths have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. The U.S. government has not been releasing a count. China reported Saturday a nearly 40% increase in its death toll to 4,632 victims, reflecting a major upwards revision made the previous day by authorities in Wuhan, the nation’s hardest-hit city. The official death toll in the U.S. has topped 35,000, with more than 700,000 confirmed infections. Protesters fed up with the economy-strangling restrictions have taken to the streets in several U.S. states. In Idaho, where the governor is a Republican, scores of protesters not wearing masks stood shoulder-to-shoulder Friday. Some carried signs claiming the coronavirus is a hoax. “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, “ Trump said in a tweet-storm in which he also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, for criticizing the federal response. Cuomo “should spend more time ‘doing’ and less time ‘complaining,’” the president said. Governors of both parties suggested they would move carefully, with some warning that they can’t do it without help from the federal government to expand testing for the virus. “The president is fomenting domestic rebellion and spreading lies even while his own administration says the virus is real and is deadly,” Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington state, said. Responding to pleas from governors for help in ramping up testing, Trump put the burden back on them: “The States have to step up their TESTING!” The American president, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to see businesses reopen quickly, had his health team lead an extensive briefing outlining that adequate testing capacity exists to get states through the first phase of White House guidelines on how they should reopen. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said stores could begin selling curbside, nonessential surgery could resume and state parks could reopen. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis said municipalities could reopen beaches and parks if they could do so safely. But in Iowa, more than a dozen elected officials implored Tyson Fresh Meats to close a pork processing plant, saying the virus is spreading among workers and endangering employees and the surrounding community. Company spokeswoman Liz Croston said worker temperatures are taken before entering the plant, masks are required and cleaning has been increased as has distancing between workers. She said the company is focused on protecting workers and “continuing to fulfill our critical role of feeding families in this community and around the nation, while providing market continuity for hundreds of area hog farmers.” In Hawaii, Gov. David Ige ordered a moratorium on evictions of people from their homes for failure to pay rent in a state where more than one-third of the labor force has applied for unemployment benefits. Schools will remain closed through the summer, officials said, with plans undecided for the next school year.

The navy was carrying out a deep clean of the three ships to disinfect them.Taiwan has only reported 398 coronavirus cases and six deaths, a far lower number than many of its neighbours due to strict measures taken in the early stages of the outbreak to contain its spread.The president of Palau, Tommy Remengesau, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that his country of 20,000 people had not had a single case of the coronavirus and he was going to shut it off from the outside world to keep the virus out.(Reporting by Ben Blanchard Editing by Robert Birsel)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-to-quarantine-700-navy-sailors-after-coronavirus-outbreak/story-qWQbVyCRhvTJsaQFHZ0WJK.html

Another 1,832 have recovered.The largest province of Punjab registered 3,391 patients, followed by Sindh with 2,217, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 1,077, Balochistan 335, Gilgit-Baltistan 250, Islamabad 163 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir with 48 patients.The ministry showed that so far 92,548 tests have been conducted, including 6,416 in the last 24 hours.The steady rise continued despite hectic efforts to contain the spread.One of the biggest hurdles being faced by the authorities has been to convince clerics to stop congregational prayers in mosques.President Arif Alvi on Friday held talks with Jamaat-i-Islami chief Senator Sirajul Haq, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith chief Senator Sajid Mir and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Rana Tanveer Hussain over prayer congregations.He was poised to continue consultations on Saturday to convince the clerics from different sectors to avoid big gatherings in the upcoming month of Ramzan.Prime Minister Imran Khan is also expected to meet religious leaders to take them into confidence over the vital issue.So far Tablighi Jamaat has promised to cooperate and its chief Maulana Nazarur Rehman appealed to his followers to follow official direction in Ramzan.But a group of hardline clerics led by Mufti Muneebur Rehman and Mufti Taqi Usmani wanted to let the clerics decide the opening of mosques without any interference by the government.Meanwhile, Minister for Religious Affairs Pir Noorul Haq Qadri, who is also a religious leader, on Friday asked the fellow clerics to abide by the guidelines of the government in order to defeat coronavirus.On Friday, several incidents of violation of official directives were reported. But the situation was better than the previous Friday when scuffled took place between police and worshippers outside a mosque in Karachi.In stark violation of the government orders, a recalcitrant cleric of Red Mosque had been holding regular Friday congregation in the heart of capital Islamabad.Maulana Abdul Aziz refused to cooperate and the government was unable to remove him from the pulpit of a mosque which is owned by government’s religious affairs ministry.The government has said that only five worshippers including those who are associated with the affairs of the mosques are allowed to offer congregational prayers.Meanwhile, it was reported that two women who returned to Pakistan from India via the Wagah border tested positive for the novel coronavirus. They were part of 41 people that returned to the country, according to The Express Tribune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-struggles-to-rein-in-defiant-clerics-as-covid-19-cases-near-7-500/story-mGHEYdUje5O6my6XRqkfoO.html

As many as 1,058 patients are still being treated and 77,029 have been discharged from hospitals.On Friday, Wuhan’s officials announced that as of April 16, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases was raised by 325 to 50,333 and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869.No deaths due to Covid-19 were reported on Friday.The latest revision of figures came amidst sharp criticism of China by the US, the UK and other countries for its alleged under-reporting of the coronavirus cases, lack of transparency and cover-up of the origin of the viral strain, which emerged in Wuhan in December last year, reportedly from the local Huanan sea food market.The way Covid-19 cases were counted in China was changed in January and February, leading to widespread confusion over the extent of the health crisis in the world’s most populous country.But China denied that it had covered up the extent of its Covid-19 outbreak.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that the virus’s rapid spread had contributed to under-counting that resulted in China raising its death toll earlier in the day. However, he emphasised that “there has never been any concealment, and we’ll never allow any concealment.” On Saturday. the NHC said 27 new confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported of which 17 were imported.The other 10 new cases were domestically transmitted.This included seven new cases in Heilongjiang province, bordering Russia where cases went up following return of large number of Chinese nationals from various Russian cities and two in Guangdong province and one in Sichuan province.No death was reported on the mainland, the NHC said.As of Friday, the mainland has reported a total of 1,566 imported cases, it said.Also 54 new asymptomatic cases, including three from abroad, were reported, taking their total to 1,017.Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.By Friday, 1,021 confirmed cases including four deaths had been reported in Hong Kong, 45 confirmed cases in Macao and 395 in Taiwan including six deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-imported-covid-19-cases-rise-to-1-566-revised-death-toll-4-632-report/story-HqSve3ZP21kHREv04MzCKM.html

The initial transmission of the virus was bat-to-human, the news channel said, adding that the “patient zero” worked at the laboratory. The lab employee was accidentally infected before spreading the disease among the common people outside the lab in Wuhan city.The Wuhan wet market initially identified as the place of origin, Fox News said, never sold bats. However, China blamed the wet market to deflect blame from the laboratory, the report said.Also Watch l ‘I’m not happy’: Donald Trump slams China over handling of COVID-19 crisisThe virus was being studied in the lab as an attempt by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to “demonstrate that its efforts to identify and combat viruses are equal to or greater than the capabilities of the United States,” Fox News said quoting multiple sources.At the daily White House briefing of the US President on Wednesday, Fox News reporter John Roberts while asking Trump about the claims said, “Multiple sources are telling Fox News today that the United States now has high confidence that, while the coronavirus is a naturally occurring virus, it emanated from a virology lab in Wuhan, that, because of lax safety protocols, an intern was infected, who later infected her boyfriend, and then went to the wet market in Wuhan, where it then began to spread.”President Trump neither confirmed nor denied the report, but noted that “more and more we’re hearing the story a” and we’ll see.” “We are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened,” the President added.When pressed by Roberts about whether he had raised Chinese lab security in his recent call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Trump said, “I don’t want to discuss what I talked to him about the laboratory. It’s inappropriate right now.”The news channel said that China initially made efforts to cover up the outbreak. Quoting a source, the report said that this could be the “costliest government cover-up of all time.” Sources also characterized the World Health Organization (WHO) as being part of a cover-up from the very beginning, the report said.As per a recent Washington Post, two years ago, the US embassy officials in China raised concerns about the insufficient biosafety at the Chinese government’s Wuhan Institute of Virology where deadly viruses and infectious diseases are studied.Though the institute, located quite close to the Wuhan wet market, is China’s first biosafety level IV lab, the US state department had warned in 2018 about “serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory”.

(https://bit.ly/2RJHbCS)Skyrocketing demand for food, hand sanitizer, toilet paper and other household products has also prompted retailers Kroger, Target and Amazon.com Inc to hire by the thousands. Separately, Walmart said it will now require its U.S. staff to wear masks or other face coverings at work, making its face-covering policy mandatory from optional in line with public health guidance.“This includes our stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers as well as in our corporate offices”, Walmart U.S. President John Furner said in a memo.The company is also extending its emergency leave policy through the end of May, according to the memo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/walmart-to-hire-50-000-more-workers-in-coronavirus-driven-hiring-spree/story-xpJAap6jnMqFU2IVSBiDXO.html
18-04-2020||World||Japan expands testing as Covid-19 infections mount||Japan, alarmed by rising coronavirus deaths and the spectre of the collapse of the medical system, is scrambling to expand testing with drive-through facilities and general practitioners helping to collect samples.For weeks Japan has limited its testing for the coronavirus, which emerged in neighbouring China late last year, despite calls from many health experts who see testing as vital to detecting and isolating cases and slowing the spread.Japan conducted about 52,000 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in March, or just 16% of the number carried out in South Korea, according to data from Oxford University.Experts say Japan’s strategy of keeping the number of PCR tests low has made it difficult to trace the disease as it spread in Tokyo and other big cities and led to a wave of in-hospital infections, crippling some facilities.The decision to expand testing came as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this week expanded a state of emergency, originally issued for Tokyo and six other areas, to the entire country, and warned of the growing burden on health facilities.“With help from regional medical associations, we will set up testing centres. If home doctors have decided testing is necessary, test samples are taken at these centres and sent to private inspection firms,” Abe told a news conference on Friday.“Thus, the burden on public health centres will be lessened.”While the measures marked a shift in policy, it remains to be seen how effective they will be, experts say, as Japan struggles with red tape, staff shortages and the absence of centralized decision-making with no single agency coordinating the response to the disease.There has been widespread criticism that phone lines for public health centres, set up by local governments and tasked to conduct screening for PCR test candidates, are always busy as people become more worried about infection.Tokyo remains the hardest-hit place in Japan, with a record 201 additional cases reported by its governor on Friday, for a total of 2,796.Japan’s total infections stand at more than 9,800, with 207 deaths, according to a tally by public broadcaster NHK.HELPING HANDAs part of effort to boost testing capacity, several general practitioners’ groups in Tokyo have stepped up to shoulder the task of examining potential patients and taking test samples from them, which is now conducted mainly by doctors working at large hospitals, who are already overstretched.“This is to prevent the medical system from crumbling. Everyone needs to extend a helping hand. Otherwise, hospitals would break down,” said Konoshin Tamura, deputy head of an association of general practitioners in Tokyo’s Suginami ward.“Also, in order for PCR tests to be conducted more widely, we need to get used to the whole process and see what the coronavirus really does,” said Tamura, who runs a clinic specializing in internal medicine and paediatrics.On the grounds of one of the four Suginami hospitals where general practitioners are taking turns to see suspected coronavirus patients, two white tents were put up this week in anticipation of more virus-related visits.In another bid to make PCR tests more available, the health ministry on Wednesday suggested to local governments that drive-through tests can bolster their capabilities.Kenji Shibuya, head of the Institute for Population Health at King’s College, London, and other scientists, have repeatedly said since early in the outbreak that Japan should introduce the type of drive-through testing that South Korea has.A day after the health ministry’s advice, the city of Chiba, east of Tokyo, launched drive-through testing, and several others are looking to follow suit.“It’s quite clear we will be seeing more and more patients who need testing. This is one of our ways to expand,” a Chiba official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-expands-testing-as-covid-19-infections-mount/story-3e2W2wDAI4d8JCpLWG776L.html
18-04-2020||World||Other countries will revise coronavirus death numbers like China, says WHO||The World Health Organization said Friday that many countries would likely follow China in revising up their death tolls once they start getting the coronavirus crisis under control.Wuhan, the COVID-19 epicentre, admitted missteps in tallying its death toll, abruptly raising the city’s count by 50 percent -- following growing world doubts about Chinese transparency over the outbreak.The WHO said Wuhan had been overwhelmed by the virus, which emerged in the city in December, and the authorities had been too swamped to ensure every death and infection was properly recorded.Authorities in Wuhan initially tried to cover up the outbreak, punishing doctors who had raised the alarm online, and there have been questions about the government’s recording of infections as it repeatedly changed its counting criteria at the peak of the crisis.“This is something that is a challenge in an ongoing outbreak: to identify all of your cases and all of your deaths,” Maria van Kerkhove, the WHO’s COVID-19 technical lead, told a virtual press conference in Geneva.“I would anticipate that many countries are going to be in a similar situation where they will have to go back and review records and look to see: did we capture all of them?”She said the Wuhan authorities had now reviewed their databases and cross-checked for discrepancies.Wuhan added 1,290 deaths to its toll, raising the total to 3,869, and added a further 325 cases, bringing the number of infections to 50,333.Van Kerkhove said that because Wuhan’s healthcare system was swamped, some patients died at home; others were in makeshift facilities; and that medics, focused on treating patients, therefore did not do the paperwork on time.Michael Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies director, added: “All countries will face this”.But he urged nations to produce precise data as early as possible, “because that keeps us on top of what the impact is, and allows us to project forward in a much more accurate way.”Also Read: Looking into reports that coronavirus ‘escaped’ from Wuhan lab, says Donald TrumpAfrica hope More than two million people have been infected with COVID-19, while, according to an AFP tally, more than 145,000 have lost their lives.Most of the cases and deaths reported so far have been in Europe and the United States.But WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned of a “worrying trend” emerging in Africa.At the WHO’s last daily count, there had been 11,843 confirmed cases and 550 deaths on the continent.“In the past week there has been a 51 percent increase in the number of reported cases in my own continent, Africa, and a 60 percent increase in the number of reported deaths,” the former Ethiopian health minister said.But his colleagues said the situation was not beyond control on the continent, given Africa’s long experience of having to battle fatal disease outbreaks.“We don’t believe, at this point, the disease has passed the capacity to be contained,” said Ryan. Wet markets So-called wet markets in China have been in the spotlight since the virus emerged, with some blaming them as the source of COVID-19.Wet markets are popular venues to buy fresh meat, vegetables and fish across Asia -- most selling common, everyday produce to locals at affordable prices, with some selling live animals, and sometimes wildlife.Tedros said they were an important source of food and work for millions, but they were too often poorly regulated and maintained.“WHO’s position is that when these markets are allowed to reopen, it should only be on the condition that they conform to stringent food safety and hygiene standards,” he said.“Governments must rigorously enforce bans on the sale and trade of wildlife for food.”An estimated 70 percent of all new viruses in humans come from other species, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/other-countries-will-revise-coronavirus-death-tolls-like-china-says-who/story-ur8M1wobaWuez1kiUn1eeI.html

An economic shock on the scale expected presents a real and present danger.The Food and Agriculture Organization, the African Union and international partners have issued a joint declaration in which they support access to food and nutrition for the most vulnerable in Africa during the pandemic.They described the food and agriculture system as an essential service that must continue to operate during periods of lockdown, curfew and other containment measures.“We have launched a Preparedness and Response Plan which required 38 million U.S. dollars for humanitarian, as well as social and economic recovery needs,” UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.“This Plan has been presented to national and international partners and will be updated shortly to include the government’s needs,” he noted.The number of deaths linked to the novel contagion reached 150,000 on Friday, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.

It is aimed at coordinating efforts to discover a vaccine, funnel resources and support to industry and research institutions and review regulations to remove any blocks in scaling it up, he said.“We cannot put a date on when we will get a vaccine. But we live in a country with a rich history of pioneering science, and with the government backing our scientists, we have the best chance to do this as quickly as possible,” said the Indian-origin Cabinet minister.Sharma also announced 21 new research projects to receive funds from a 14 million pounds government pot for the development of treatments and vaccines.“UK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people’s lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts.“The Vaccine Taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible,” he said.Under details of some of the scientific work ongoing to combat the spread of the deadly virus, one new project is led by the University of Oxford to trial an anti-malarial drug, believed to have anti-inflammatory properties, to determine whether it could diminish the effects of Covid-19 on people in high risk groups. General Practitioner (GP) surgeries across the UK have been invited to take part in the groundbreaking trial, to ascertain whether it could reduce the need for affected patients to go to hospital and speed up their recovery.Other projects receiving vital government funding under the new taskforce include an Imperial College London initiative testing a vaccine against coronavirus that aims for the body to produce more protective antibodies and Public Health England developing a new antibody that could offer protection against infection and disease progression of coronavirus. Public Health England is also studying how Covid-19 can be transmitted from person-to-person by determining how long it can survive in the air and on different materials found in hospitals and households like fabric, plastics, metals and ceramics. The UK has already pledged 250 million pounds to the international effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine under the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The latest announcement aims to make the UK a leader in clinical vaccine testing and manufacturing, building on existing research and development expertise.“We’re doing everything possible to save lives and beat this disease, and that includes working flat out with businesses, researchers and industry to find a vaccine as quickly as possible.“The UK is world-leading in developing vaccines. We are the biggest contributor to the global effort and preparing to ensure we can manufacture vaccines here at home as soon as practically possible,” UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sets-up-new-vaccine-taskforce-as-covid-19-death-toll-hits-14-576/story-ZFhETdYtKf3QSjKkIYi3QN.html
18-04-2020||World||Looking into reports that coronavirus ‘escaped’ from Wuhan lab, says Donald Trump||The US is looking into reports that the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 150,000 people globally, “escaped” from a Wuhan lab in China, President Donald Trump has said. “We’re looking at it, a lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense,” Trump told reporters at a White House news conference on Friday when asked if there was an investigation into whether the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage “They talk about a certain kind of bat, but that bat wasn’t in that area if you can believe this,” he claimed. “That bat wasn’t sold at that wet zone.... That bat is 40 miles away.” Earlier in the day, Fox News reported that the United States was conducting a full-scale investigation into whether the deadly virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. In an exclusive report, it said intelligence operatives were reportedly gathering information about the laboratory and the initial outbreak of the pathogen. Intelligence analysts are piecing together a timeline of what the government knew and “creating an accurate picture of what happened”, the channel quoted sources as saying. “A lot of strange things are happening, but there is a lot of investigation going on and we are going to find out,” Trump said. “All I can say is wherever it came from, came from China in whatever form, 184 countries now are suffering because of it.” Trump added that the US would end its grant to a level-IV lab in Wuhan. “(The) Obama administration gave them a grant of USD 3.7 million,” the president said. “We will end that grant very quickly.” A group of more than half-a-dozen lawmakers sent a letter to House and Senate leadership, requesting them to ensure that no future coronavirus relief funds be appropriated to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Meanwhile, lawmaker James Smith accused China of indulging in covering up the issue of coronavirus. “The communist Chinese government’s cover-up of the coronavirus outbreak allowed this virus to spread unchecked, threatening the health and stability of the free world. They must be held accountable,” Smith said. “When people in Wuhan began to fall ill with a mysterious SARS-like illness, instead of working to contain the virus, the Chinese Communist Party ruthlessly worked to contain the spread of information. This secrecy endangered millions of lives,” the Congressman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/looking-into-reports-that-coronavirus-escaped-from-wuhan-lab-says-donald-trump/story-9tcUFwcTh9xXjyyEC1uzCP.html
18-04-2020||World||Horrors revealed at coronavirus-hit Canada nursing home||Elderly residents left soiled and unfed after their caregivers fled the premises, 31 deaths in the space of a few weeks: a nursing home in Montreal has become the symbol of the terrible toll coronavirus is taking in Canada’s long-term care homes.The bleak situation discovered at the Residence Herron, in the Montreal suburb of Dorval, has triggered an investigation for gross negligence and a national reckoning about the conditions in long-term care homes which account for half the country’s more than 1,250 Covid-19 deaths.“I was sick to my stomach, I was really sick to my stomach,” Moira Davis, whose father Stanley Pinnell died at the Herron facility on April 8, told AFP.“All of a sudden these questions started flying through my head, ‘What could we have done differently? Why did nobody tell us?... Why, why, why?’“Called to the rescue after most of the staff deserted the facility, health authorities found residents dehydrated, unfed for days and lying listless in bed, some covered in excrement. Others had fallen to the floor. Two deaths had gone unnoticed for several days.At least five of the 31 recent deaths at the home have been officially attributed to the virus, with the others still being investigated by a coroner.From her home in Creighton, Saskatchewan, Davis said she became concerned about her 86-year-old father, who is believed to have contracted coronavirus a week before his death, as he sounded weaker and weaker on the phone each time they spoke.Davis says Residence Herron is a “poster child for what is wrong in our senior health care” -- but she is also certain it is not unique. “There are other homes, I am sure, in every country of the world, where families have experienced a similar situation.”“It scares me, it terrifies me to think that I am 60 years of age, and I may someday end up in one of these homes.” ‘Gross negligence’ In announcing the fatalities this week, Quebec Premier Francois Legault said it appeared to be a case of “gross negligence”: just two nurses had been left to care for 130 elderly residents. Further fuelling public outrage, Canadian media also revealed that the home’s owner had once been convicted of drug trafficking, fraud and tax evasion.For families, shock and anger mixed with the frustration of having been powerless to do anything, kept away by a ban on visits to the home to avoid contamination.Local health authorities have now taken control of the facility, and a Can$5 million class action has been launched against the owner alleging “inhumane and degrading maltreatment” for failing to ensure continued and adequate care.“On April 7, my mother was left in her wheelchair with a full, soiled diaper for three hours because no one responded” to the emergency button and her cries for help, Peter Wheeland told AFP, adding that she had diarrhea, one of the symptoms of the new coronavirus. “We weren’t able to communicate with anyone: We called the nurses’ station, we left messages, we did everything we could do to reach them and there was no answer,” he said, recalling being overcome with fear “that my mother could suddenly die.”Connie Wheeland has since been transferred to a hospital where she was diagnosed with Covid-19. She will not return to Herron. Rather than continue to pay the home Can$45,000 each year, once she recovers her son plans to set her up in an apartment and hire a private nurse to care for her.‘We love you grandma’ From the parking lot of the facility, Maxime Jacques, 35, along with his sister, wife and children, wave to his mother Jacqueline -- who from her room on the second floor can just see the sign they have hung on a fence: “We love you grandma.”“We feel a little let down,” says Jacques, who is still trying to find out more from staff about the 86-year-old’s health condition.The dire situation uncovered at the Residence Herron has come as little surprise for experts, who point to decades of insufficient funding for senior care -- where the work is tough, and the pay rarely above minimum wage.“We have neglected elderly care for a very long time,” Rejean Hebert, a former Quebec health minister.Responding to public outrage, Legault has called for health care workers to help feed, wash and tend to elderly residents at long-term care facilities across the province, where the staff shortage is estimated at 2,000 people. He also topped up the pay of care workers.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also Friday dispatched 125 military doctors and medics, requested by Quebec, to help personnel at the homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/horrors-revealed-at-coronavirus-hit-canada-nursing-home/story-7YkH2kAhMekDnF1svNUszI.html
18-04-2020||World||China adds 1,300 deaths to Wuhan toll, citing early lapses||China on Friday revised upwards by nearly 1,300 the Covid-19 fatalities in the first pandemic epicentre, the city of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late last year, admitting that the infection hit China harder than it initially projected. The addition, reported by state news agency Xinhua on Friday, brings the nationwide death toll up by nearly 40% to 4,636, the majority coming from the central Chinese province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located.“The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Wuhan as of the end of April 16 was revised up by 325 to 50,333, and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869,” Xinhua said in a report.The revision of Covid-19 numbers comes amid global doubts about the numbers that China’s national Health Commission (NHC) has been releasing daily since the end of January.“Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China, and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths; does anybody really believe that?” US president Donald Trump had said on Wednesday.And after China released the revised numbers, Trump tweeted on Friday: “China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the US, not even close!”In a notification released on Friday, the Wuhan municipal headquarters for the Covid-19 epidemic prevention and control said the revisions were made in accordance with related laws and regulations as well as the principle of being responsible for history, the people and the deceased.The notification listed four reasons for the discrepancy.It said that a surging number of patients at the early stage of the epidemic “…overwhelmed medical resources and the admission capacity of medical institutions. Some patients died at home without having been treated in hospitals.” It added that overworked doctors were “preoccupied” with saving lives and treating patients, which resulted in late reporting of Covid-19 toll.The notice said that due to a rapid increase of designated hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients, a few medical institutions were not linked to the epidemic information network “and failed to report their data in time”.The registered information of some of the deceased patients was incomplete, and there were repetitions and mistakes in the reporting, the health authorities added.“What lie behind epidemic data are the lives and health of the general public, as well as the credibility of the government,” an official in Wuhan told state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-adds-1300-deaths-to-wuhan-toll-citing-early-lapses/story-jcGYeP2QOzrMFxFaep10kK.html

18-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Trump announces $19 billion bailout for farmers hurt by slowdown||President Donald Trump announced a $19 billion bailout package for farmers hurt financially by the coronavirus crisis.The aid plan includes $16 billion in direct payments to farmers to boost their incomes, along with $3 billion in government purchases of meat, dairy products and other foods, the president said Friday at a White House briefing. The Agriculture Department will receive another $14 billion in July for further assistance.“This will help our farmers and our ranchers, and it’s money well deserved,” Trump said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe combination of direct payments to farmers and bulk government purchases of commodities parallels the approach the Trump administration followed in its $28 billion agriculture trade bailout over the past two years. Farmers and rural communities are a critical part of Trump’s political base as he seeks re-election.The commodities purchased will be distributed through food banks and other nutrition programs serving the poor, school children and the elderly.USDA PaymentsThe USDA will make direct payments of $5.1 billion to cattle producers, $2.9 billion for dairy and $1.6 billion for hogs, according to a statement from Senator John Hoeven, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee.Another $3.9 billion will go to producers of row crops such as soybeans, corn and cotton, while $2.1 billion is earmarked for producers of specialty crops such as fruits and vegetables. And $500 million will go for other crops, Hoeven said.The Agriculture Department will begin the food purchases by buying $100 million of fruits and vegetables per month, and $100 million per month each of dairy and meat, the department said in a statement.The closing of restaurants, school cafeterias and other commercial food service operations has upended the market for agricultural products, particularly dairy, meat and produce. The food-service industry is a disproportionate buyer of cheese, butter, meat, fresh fruits and vegetables. Farmers are dumping as much as 8% of their milk, according to the Dairy Farmers of America cooperative.A shutdown of several slaughterhouses because of virus outbreaks among employees has further disrupted hog and cattle farmers’ ability to sell their livestock. At the same time, an oil price war forced ethanol plants to shut down, further depressing corn prices.Funding for the aid was included in the Coronavirus relief package Congress passed last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-trump-announces-19-billion-bailout-for-farmers-hurt-by-slowdown/story-dh0LFpm9EpPrA4ggzSbPQL.html

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said 429 members of the religious group had attended the annual congregation in Raiwand in Punjab province and all of them have tested positive so far.He said the members who have tested positive for COVID-19 have been kept in isolation to control the spread of the virus.“Out of some 4,692 Tablighi Jamaat members in the province, tests have been carried out on some 4,653 so far,” he said. The tally of the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country climbed on Friday to 7,260 with 137 deaths. In Punjab the number of such cases is 3,300.Tablighi Jamaat members have emerged as the prime suspects among potential coronavirus carriers, not just in Pakistan but in India, Malaysia and Brunei.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/429-tablighi-jamaat-members-in-pakistan-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-UakRFq6Mk7p2uLM45l11zK.html
18-04-2020||World||Donald Trump shares ‘unlockdown’ plan, calls to ‘liberate states’||Covid-19 deaths in the US spiked by a new record of 4,591 on Friday as President Donald Trump unveiled guidelines for reopening the country and appeared to practically lead, from his Twitter handle, the protests against the continuing lockdown in several states.Trump hit out at his political rivals including Democrat state governors, the World Health Organization and asked for ‘liberating’ locked-down states, some of whom had in fact extended the restrictions. He tweeted on Friday: “Today people started losing their jobs because of Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, and the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, who should immediately come back to Washington and approve legislation to help families in America. End your ENDLESS VACATION!”“LIBERATE MINNESOTA!LIBERATE MICHIGAN! LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”Protests have broken out in Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, Kentucky, Utah and Wyoming demanding reopening of the country. On the WHO, Trump appeared to quote Lanhee Chen, a fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institute, and tweeted: “Why did the W.H.O. Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that CoronaVirus could be transmitted between humans? ”The US death toll as of Friday morning was more than 35,300 and confirmed cases topped 680,500. The number of cases increased in New York state, the epicentre of the American epidemic, to nearly 226,200 with more than 16,730 fatalities.“We’re starting our life again,” Trump said on Thursday. “We’re starting rejuvenation of our economy... in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion.”States were expected to announce their own reopening plans but New York extended its shutdown to May 15; Michigan and Missouri had also extended their stay-at-home orders. The guidelines provide that the reopening be spread over three phases and laid down “gatekeeping” criteria for progressing from one phase to another. A state could decide to open up entirely or partially, based on criteria that include infection rates and ability of hospitals to cope.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he needed federal government help to ramp up testing and accused Trump administration of failing to provide funding to states. “That is passing the buck without passing the bucks,” he said. Trump pushed back, tweeting it was up to the states to “step up their testing,” and went on to attack Cuomo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-shares-unlockdown-plan-calls-to-liberate-states/story-tL3wjtEUZttgzv1CzdohoO.html
18-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Trump calls for reopening US economy. What’s next?||President Donald Trump wants to get the hobbled US economy back on its feet, but guidelines he announced for reopening the country are notably cautious and unspecific. So what comes next?No big bang As recently as April 8, Trump was saying “it would be nice to open with a big bang.” Instead, the world’s biggest economy will put a tentative toe in the water.The national lockdown is estimated to have saved hundreds of thousands of lives by quashing the rapid spread of the coronavirus.For Trump, though, the economic chaos that has ensued also poses a massive political risk with only 200 days until the November 3 presidential election. Some 22 million people have lost their jobs in just one month.What’s clear from the White House guidelines announced Thursday, however, is that reopening will be slow, cautious and very different across the huge country.The guidelines suggest three vague phases for relaxing social distancing and opening up travel and public gatherings. No timelines are given.“Light switch on and off is the exact opposite of what you see here,” Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the top government medical advisors, said.Who’s really in charge? Trump this Monday claimed he had “total” authority to set the pace of where and when the coronavirus lockdown ends.With Thursday’s announcement, he gave up on that, saying the 50 state governors will have full control.Some saw this as a retreat. But political analysts also say Trump wanted the benefit of the big White House announcement while shielding himself from what could be a messy process ahead of election day.With Trump standing back, this means the onus will rest with people like Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York, Ron DeSantis in Florida, Gavin Newsom in California, and Greg Abbott in Texas.Trump will be on the sidelines, supporting or in some cases castigating, as he did Friday when he berated Cuomo for “ridiculously” demanding federal help to get tens of thousands of ventilators. Trump: ‘Liberate’ lockdown states Even the decision whether or not to keep up the quarantines is becoming a bitter left-right issue in radically partisan America.A grassroots anti-lockdown movement with strong links to Trump’s right-wing base has mounted protests in several Democrat-run states.On Wednesday, a large protest erupted in the Michigan capital, Lansing. Demonstrators clogged streets with cars, while a group toting rifles and handguns paraded on the steps of the legislature.On Friday, hundreds of protesters were reported to have gathered outside the home of the Minnesota governor. On Thursday, other frustrated Americans protested in Virginia.Trump made political hay out of the tensions, tweeting on Friday a call to “LIBERATE” the three states.Who’s reopening first? Trump said “large sections of the country” can “think about opening,” some of them “literally tomorrow.”He mentioned sparsely populated states with no major coronavirus problems like Montana, Wyoming and North Dakota.That won’t be so easy in states with more economic importance, however.New York and New Jersey, which are at the heart of the northeast corridor, have been hardest hit by the virus. Cuomo on Thursday extended New York’s lockdown for a month.In Washington state, which was hit early but has since controlled the virus, aerospace giant Boeing is set to become the first large corporation to undo its lockdown.Some 27,000 workers are due to resume work in the next few days, albeit with social distancing measures enforced.Texas announced plans Friday to relax restrictions within the next week on hospitals’ ability to perform elective surgeries, encourage shops to let customers order goods then pick up from outside, and open state parks.Florida allowed limited beach openings Friday and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer hopes she can allow “some relaxing” of one of the country’s tightest lockdowns on May 1.Testing times With governors left to make up their own schedules, rather than operate under a nationally coordinated plan, big questions remain over how the reopening can avoid letting the virus bounce back.One of the many issues lacking clarity is the reopening of domestic, let alone international travel. With some states largely virus-free, but others still in the grip of the pandemic, can people be encouraged to return to the nation’s empty airports?And how can states and businesses that have reopened be sure they are not silently becoming new incubators for the disease?On Thursday Fauci said the key was “early alerts and getting in there before they have a problem.”But experts say that kind of monitoring will require vastly increased testing capabilities.“The more testing, the more open the economy, but there’s not enough national capacity,” Cuomo said this week. “We can’t do it yet. That is the unvarnished truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-trump-calls-for-reopening-us-economy-what-s-next/story-ORDUS8PUXkfwo1XJthMycO.html
18-04-2020||World||‘LIBERATE!’: Trump pushes states to lift stay-at-home coronavirus restrictions||President Donald Trump urged supporters to “LIBERATE” three states led by Democratic governors Friday, apparently encouraging protests against stay-at-home restrictions. Some states under Republican leadership edged toward easing up the mandates aimed at stopping the coronavirus.A day after laying out a road map to gradually reopen the crippled economy, Trump tweeted the kind of rhetoric some of his supporters have used to demand the lifting of the orders that have thrown millions of Americans out of work.“LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” “LIBERATE VIRGINIA,” he said in a tweet-storm in which he also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for criticizing the federal response. Cuomo “should spend more time ‘doing’ and less time ‘complaining,’” the president said.Responding to pleas from governors for help from Washington in ramping up testing for the virus, Trump put the burden back on them: “The States have to step up their TESTING!”Trump claimed Friday that “very partisan voices” had spread “false and misleading information” about the nation’s testing capacity. But he said “we’ll help New York and all of the other states get even better on their testing.”At the same time, at least two states took their first steps toward easing the restrictions.In Florida, GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis said municipalities could reopen beaches and parks if they could do so safely. In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said stores could begin selling curbside, non-essential surgery could resume and state parks could reopen.Sensitive about persistent questions about the capacity for testing, Trump had his health team lead an extensive briefing Friday outlining that adequate capacity exists to get states through the first phase of the guidelines for how they should reopen.Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to see businesses reopen quickly and claimed earlier this week that he had total authority over the matter, even though the lockdowns and other social-distancing measures have been imposed by state and local leaders, not Washington.“We may be opening but we’re putting safety first,” Trump said.On Thursday, he outlined a three-step set of guidelines for easing restrictions over a span of several weeks in places that have robust testing and are seeing a decrease in COVID-19 cases, assuring the nation’s governors: “You’re going to call your own shots.”But governors of both parties suggested Friday that they would be cautious in returning to normal, with some warning that they can’t do it without help from Washington to expand testing.“The federal government cannot wipe its hands of this and say, ‘Oh, the states are responsible for testing,’“ said Cuomo, a Democrat. “We cannot do it without federal help.”West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican ally of Trump’s, said he would listen to medical experts in deciding how to move forward.“I am not going to do something that I feel in my heart is the wrong thing that’s going to endanger our people,” he said.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said Trump’s tweets about “liberating” states put millions of Americans at risk of contracting COVID-19.“The president is fomenting domestic rebellion and spreading lies even while his own administration says the virus is real and is deadly,” Inslee said.The clash between Trump and Cuomo was personal, with the president complaining the governor hasn’t said thanks for the help he has received from Washington. Cuomo countered by saying: “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, send a bouquet of flowers? ‘Thank you to the federal government for participating in a federal emergency.’”Even in largely rural states with small populations, such as Wyoming, Maine and South Dakota, governors said they were not anxious to quickly resume business as usual.“Until we’ve got the testing up to speed — which has got to be part of the federal government stepping in and helping — we’re just not going to be there,” said Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican.The University of Washington, whose computer models have frequently been cited by health officials at White House briefings, predicted Friday that Vermont, West Virginia, Montana and Hawaii could open as early as May 4 if they restrict large gatherings, test widely and quarantine the contacts of people who test positive.Iowa, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Utah, Arkansas and Oklahoma, however, are among states that would need to wait until mid-June or early July. About half the states should wait until at least early June to reopen, and all should gauge the capacity of their public health systems to handle outbreaks, the institute said.Worldwide, the outbreak has infected more than 2.2 million people and killed over 150,000, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally based on figures supplied by government health authorities around the globe, though it has becoming increasingly clear that the true numbers are much higher.The official death toll in the U.S. neared 35,000, with about 685,000 confirmed infections.The shutdowns have inflicted heavy damage on economies around the world. In the U.S., the crisis has cost at least 22 millions Americans their jobs, pushing the unemployment rate toward levels not seen since the Great Depression.Many Americans, especially in rural areas and other parts of the country that have not seen major outbreaks, have urged governors to reopen their economies. Protesters have taken to the streets in Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia and Michigan, where more than 3,000 turned out on Wednesday in what looked like one of the president’s rallies, with Make America Great Again hats and Trump flags.Protests continued Friday, including one outside the home of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and another in Idaho, where the governor is a Republican.Public health experts have warned that easing the shutdowns must be accompanied by wider testing and tracing of infected people to keep the virus from coming back with a vengeance.Meanwhile, China, confirming long-held suspicions, acknowledged that the coronavirus death toll in the one-time epicenter city of Wuhan was nearly 50% higher than reported, amounting to more than 4,600.In Italy, Spain, Britain, the United States and elsewhere, similar doubts emerged as governments revised their death tolls or openly questioned the accuracy of them.Authorities said that almost everywhere, thousands have died with COVID-19 symptoms — many in nursing homes — without being tested for the virus, and have thus gone uncounted.In Italy, for example, where the official toll has climbed past 22,000, a government survey released Friday of about one-third of the country’s nursing homes found more than 6,000 residents have died since Feb. 1. It was unclear how many were a result of COVID-19.In Britain, with an official count of about 14,600 dead, the country’s statistics agency said the actual number could be around 15% higher. Others think it will be far more.The official death toll in New York City soared by more than half earlier this week when health authorities began including people who probably had COVID-19 but died without being tested. Nearly 3,800 deaths were added to the city’s count.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/liberate-trump-pushes-states-to-lift-stay-at-home-coronavirus-restrictions/story-kyMDKuB3yousHoy4tJWE8J.html
18-04-2020||World||US states, not federal government, must improve Covid-19 testing: Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump, whose administration has faced criticism over a shortfall in coronavirus testing capacity, said on Friday that individual states were responsible for developing testing capabilities.“It’s going to be up to the states to use that capability,” Trump told reporters at a White House briefing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The states have local points where they can go and the governor can call the mayors and the mayors can call representatives and everything is perfect and that’s the way it should work and always should work,” Trump said.Trump has repeatedly said that states - not the federal government - need to step up testing against the novel coronavirus, as the nation battles an outbreak that has sickened nearly 700,000 people and killed more than 35,000 people in the United States alone.The virus has also paralyzed the US economy, shuttering businesses and leaving 22 million Americans seeking unemployment benefits.As a result, the president, who had touted the strength of the US economy as central to his Nov. 3 re-election bid, has been eager to reopen the country as soon as possible.On Thursday, Trump unveiled federal guidelines for a three-stage process under which states could lift restrictions on commerce and public life as the pandemic retreated.Click here for Covid-19 updatesPublic health experts and some state governors have said businesses could only safely restart with a comprehensive testing program.Trump dismissed the response to his plan as political posturing.“Following the announcement of our reopening guidelines, there have been some very partisan voices in the media and in politics that have spread false and misleading information about our testing capacity,” Trump said.US Vice President Mike Pence said later at the briefing that states could double daily testing by “activating all of the labs” and that states had enough tests to launch phase one of the economic re-opening plan if they chose to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-not-federal-government-must-improve-covid-19-testing-donald-trump/story-lTjrztpMkhfejDGzQFDy3K.html
18-04-2020||World||‘Heartbreaking’ New York report gives details of coronavirus outbreak in nursing homes||New York, by far the nation’s leader in coronavirus nursing home deaths, released details Friday on outbreaks in individual facilities after weeks of refusing, revealing one home in Brooklyn where 55 people died and four others with at least 40 deaths.“Every death is heartbreaking,” said Dr. Roy Goldberg, medical director at Kings Harbor Multicare Center, a 720-bed home in the Bronx which reported 45 fatalities. “These have been surreal times.”The state’s accounting of multiple deaths at 68 nursing homes was based on a survey and is substantially incomplete. It accounted for less than half of the 2,690 nursing home deaths that have been reported in the state. It also didn’t include people who got sick in nursing homes, but then died at hospitals.But it was the first time the state provided any information about homes that, according to an Associated Press tally, account for nearly 40% of the nation’s 6,912 deaths in such facilitiesAt the top of the list with 55 deaths was Cobble Hill Health Center, a 300-bed facility in a 19th-century former hospital in a tony section of Brooklyn.Four ambulances arrived within an hour at the facility Friday, underscoring the ongoing crisis. Police showed up to assist with the removal of bodies, including one that was wheeled out the front door.The Cobble Hill home said in a statement that the deaths it reported were “based on the possibility of COVID-19 being a factor,” adding testing in nursing homes remains “extremely difficult to obtain.”“Although we’ve had an increase in deaths during the past few weeks, we have not been able to confirm that the deaths are specifically related to COVID-19,” the statement said.A total of 19 homes in New York’s report listed 20 deaths or more.The survey’s release came a day after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration reversed course and promised transparency about the worst outbreaks, after previously saying residents at the hardest-hit homes deserved privacy. Few states have released such information.Cuomo did not respond directly when asked at his daily coronavirus briefing why his administration had not alerted the public about the outbreaks sooner.“We’ve been talking about nursing homes every day for the past 30 days,” Cuomo said. “We’ve said 157 times the most vulnerable population are seniors, the most vulnerable places are nursing homes. ... I think we’ve been talking about it all along.”The state’s list omitted homes with fewer than five deaths.Connecticut released a similar list Thursday, reporting that eight nursing homes had at least 10 residents die. In Connecticut, nursing home residents account for 375 of the state’s 971 virus deaths.Officials at several of the nursing homes on the list said they were doing their best, and attributed the high number of deaths to the fragility of their patients and difficulty in keeping the virus out, rather than substandard care.“We have had our share of sadness,” Lina Scacco, an assistant vice president at Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care and Rehabilitation in New Hyde Park, where 38 people have died. “We’re all grieving here.”Scacco said the facility, whose residents include war veterans and Holocaust survivors was ravaged despite having infection control practices that exceed CDC and health department regulations and guidelines.Now, she said, they’re planning virtual memorials for residents who’ve died and grief counseling for staff members.“This has been devastating to our families,” Scacco said.Stephen Hanse, president and CEO of the New York State Health Facilities Association and the New York State Center for Assisted Living, said the figures reflect the fact that those facilities are dealing with extremely vulnerable patients.“Outbreaks are not the result of inattentiveness or a shortcoming in our facilities,” he wrote in a statement. “The very nature of long-term care is a high touch environment where social distancing is not an option. Staff are helping residents with bathing, dressing, eating and other personal daily needs.”He also blamed the state health department for worsening the situation by barring nursing homes from denying admission to patients with COVID-19 if they were medically stable.Nursing homes have been known since the earliest days of the outbreak as a likely trouble spot. A home in Washington state lost 43 residents early in the virus’s spread into the country.Italy, which was hit before the U.S., is also in the midst of a nursing home crisis, with health officials there estimating Friday that thousands of patients there have been killed by the virus.Yet even with that early warning, many nursing homes remained without adequate supplies of personal protective equipment. Testing for residents and staff remains spotty, at best.Federal officials in mid-March banned visitors, halted group activities and ordered mandatory screening of workers for respiratory symptoms, but by then the virus had quietly spread widely.Kings Harbor’s medical director, Goldberg, said staff members there created two dedicated COVID-19 units to treat infected patients and followed “every department of health and CDC recommendation and regulation.”“Obtaining PPE has always been a struggle,” he added, “but we’ve always stayed one step ahead.”New York state’s health commissioner, Howard Zucker, said the state is providing enough personal protective equipment for nursing homes and helping with staffing.“We’re working with each individual nursing home to address that. We contact them and if there’s a need for PPE ... we have stockpiles.”Many nursing home administrators also previously declined to release information, leading Cuomo to say this week that the state would begin requiring homes to inform patients and their families within 24 hours if a resident got the virus or died.Chris Laxton, executive director of the The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, applauded the state for releasing the data. But he said facilities still desperately need the state’s help.“We continue to be in urgent need of PPE, especially gowns, test kits, and surge staff, to limit staff from traveling between buildings and risking additional spread,’ Laxton said.Some nursing homes have disclosed information voluntarily that differed from the numbers put out by the state Friday.The state survey listed 10 deaths at the Montgomery Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, about 50 miles north of New York City, but facility Vice President Vincent Maniscalco said 21 residents have died recently. Eight of those patients, he said, had symptoms consistent with the virus but died prior to being tested.“It’s been a very trying time for the staff, to lose residents they care for day in and day out,” Maniscalco said.Outbreaks killed 46 at a nursing home in suburban Richmond, Virginia, and 22 at a home in central Indiana. County officials in northern New Jersey said Thursday that at least 26 patients had died at a nursing home in Andover.An Associated Press report found infections were continuing to find their way into nursing homes because screening staff for a fever or questioning them about symptoms didn’t catch people who were infected but asymptomatic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heartbreaking-new-york-report-gives-details-of-coronavirus-outbreak-in-nursing-homes/story-mvmpMBg5DO3hdtgrvTYYnO.html

A record increase of 35,715 new cases was reported on April 10.The infections and fatalities are spread unevenly across the country, with more densely populated places such as New York accounting for nearly half the total US deaths.Sweeping stay-at-home orders in 42 states to combat the new coronavirus have shuttered businesses, disrupted lives and decimated the economy, and some protesters have begun taking to the streets to urge governors to rethink the restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-death-toll-passes-35-000-cases-top-700-000/story-px11Lr1AWBIvxl0yLTqvxJ.html
18-04-2020||World||Trump says China’s Covid-19 deaths ‘far higher’ after Wuhan toll revised up||US President Donald Trump said Friday that China’s coronavirus deaths were “far higher” than it has admitted after the toll in the city where the pandemic originated was revised up by 50 percent.Global criticism is mounting against China over its management of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 145,000 people worldwide and hammered the global economy since it first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year. More than half of humanity -- 4.5 billion people -- are confined to their homes as governments scramble to contain the virus’s death march across the globe. World leaders are now looking at when -- and how -- to ease widespread confinement measures to revive an economy battered by what the International Monetary Fund calls the “Great Lockdown”. Trump is eager to restart business in the world’s biggest economy, while some hard-hit European nations are slowly creeping ahead on the path to normalcy, with some shops and schools starting to reopen.  China denies any cover-up The US leader announced this week a phased reopening of the United States -- one of his central preoccupations -- but on Friday turned his attention to China’s death toll after Wuhan’s city government added a further 1,290 deaths to the city’s fatalities. The revision brought the city’s total to 3,869 after many dead were “mistakenly reported” or missed entirely, adding to growing global doubts over China’s transparency.“China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close!” Trump tweeted.The revised death toll out of China on Friday was specific to the city of Wuhan, not the country as a whole. The United States currently has the most reported fatalities of any country in the world, with some 33,000 deaths. Leaders in France and Britain have also questioned China’s management of the crisis, and French President Emmanuel Macron said it would be “naive” to think Beijing had handled the pandemic well. The virus is believed to have emerged in a wet market in Wuhan in December, but two US media outlets reported suspicions the virus accidentally slipped out of a sensitive Wuhan laboratory that studied bats.Beijing, which has come under fire at home and abroad for downplaying the severity and scope of the outbreak, hit back earlier Friday, insisting there had been no cover-up.“There has never been any concealment, and we’ll never allow any concealment,” a foreign ministry spokesman said. Life-and-death balance Governments around the world are grappling with the question of when to reopen society, seeking a life-and-death balance between unfreezing stalled economies and preventing a second deadly coronavirus wave.While Trump declared Thursday that the time had come for the “next front in our war” with a phased reboot of the US economy, others took the opposite path -- Japan, Britain and Mexico all expanded current restrictions.Despite the United States suffering a staggering 4,500 new deaths announced Thursday, Trump proclaimed: “We’re opening up our country.”The president’s approach was a step back from previous hopes for a sudden reopening however, and state governors were given the freedom to set their own plans to resume business.Lightly affected states can open “literally tomorrow”, said Trump, while others would receive White House “freedom and guidance” to achieve that at their own pace.In New York state for example -- where more than 11,500 people have died -- Governor Andrew Cuomo extended a shutdown order until May 15.In some of the world’s most vulnerable economies, lockdown measures are starting to pinch. Tobacco farmers in Zimbabwe fear a delayed start to the normally busy auction season, the lifeblood for thousands of growers in impoverished rural regions. “This year our harvest hasn’t been good at all... just average,” farmer Shaw Mutalepo told AFP, as workers in face masks crunched cured leaves into large bales.“We might have a delay (in selling) just because of the lockdown,” he added.  ‘Lost decade’ Meanwhile, there were more signs the global economy is imploding.China reported Friday its GDP shrank 6.8 percent in the first quarter, the first contraction since quarterly growth data started in the early 1990s.In the US, another 5.2 million workers lost their jobs, bringing the total number of newly unemployed to a staggering 22 million since mid-March.John Williams, a top Federal Reserve official, predicted it would take “a year or two” if not longer for the US to recover.The virus could spark another “lost decade” in Latin America, the IMF warned, while experts cautioned that freezing debt for poor countries will not save many developing world economies. ‘It’s awful’ Some European countries -- such as hard-hit Spain and Italy -- were embarking on a long road back to normality, with Venice residents strolling around quiet canals stripped of their usual throngs of tourists.Switzerland, Denmark and Finland were among those gradually re-opening shops and schools.In Germany, the government declared its outbreak “under control” and said select small shops will be allowed to reopen Monday and some childre would return to school within weeks. Infection rates there “have sunk significantly”, Health Minister Jens Spahn said Friday, announcing the country’s plans to start producing up to 50 million masks a week from August to meet gaping market demand. Germany’s coronavirus deaths and infections have remained significantly below some of its worst-hit European neighbours, a fact which experts say is in part thanks to widespread testing. But Britain, which shut down later than continental Europe, extended its lockdown for at least three more weeks.It announced close to 850 new deaths on Friday, a slight spike from previous days that had seen fatalities start to draw down.And in Russia, recorded infections topped 32,000 as President Vladimir Putin warned that “the risks surrounding the epidemic’s spread are still very high, not just in Moscow but in many other Russian regions”. Around the world, people have come up with creative ways to bring back some social connection to their upended lives.In Rome an 18-year-old guitarist takes to his balcony every evening at sunset to play covers of Italian classics. “We decided to lend a hand to Italians: a message of hope,” Jacopo Mastrangelo told AFP from his patio.“We are accustomed to always seeing Rome full, teeming with people. Now the grass is growing between the cobblestones, everything has been left abandoned, and we decided to help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-china-s-covid-19-deaths-far-higher-after-wuhan-toll-revised-up/story-7iDsIDQjpLpG5dZCjyf8eO.html
18-04-2020||World||Italy declares victory over coronavirus in poorer southern regions||Italian health officials declared a long-sought victory Friday over the coronavirus in poorer southern regions that were less prepared for the pandemic than the richer north.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had warned six weeks ago that Italy’s ability to conquer Covid-19 depended on whether cases can stay largely contained to its northern epicentre around Milan.The disease has now officially claimed 22,745 lives in the Mediterranean country of 60 million people -- a toll second only to the United States.But Italy has still counted itself relatively lucky because the outbreak erupted in provinces with the best equipped medical staff.Conte decided to gamble early by imposing the Western world’s first peacetime national lockdown while the disease was still gathering force.His team argued that the short-term economic pain would pay off by saving the health care system and allowing the country to gradually reopen in the weeks to come.Italy’s top health officials said Friday that Conte’s big bet had paid off.“We have prevented the spread of contagions in southern regions,” public health council chief Franco Locatelli told reporters“This is now a fact supported by figures.”However, business leaders charge that Conte is doing unnecessary damage to the economy by extending the shutdown for too long. Levelling off The latest data from Italy’s civil protection service offered new reasons for Conte not to extend some of the strictest measures when they expire on May 4.They showed the number of people currently being treated for Covid-19 rising by only a few hundred for the first time since the outbreak began.The current number of cases had been going up by at least 1,000 a day for over a month.But they edged up by just 11 outside Milan’s Lombardy region on Friday.“In absolute terms, we have had had the highest number of recoveries since the start of the crisis,” civil protection service chief Angelo Berrelli told reporters. Conte also unveiled plans to roll out a phone app that could potentially help trace coronavirus infections and further stop the spread.The generally improving picture prompted the civil protection service to announce that it was suspending daily briefings and moving to a twice-a-week format.New tolls will still be issued daily. Standoff The leaders of Italy’s northern industrial heartland are pushing Conte to take another gamble and open as many businesses and industries as possible in early May.The shutdown has devastated once-booming factory towns and left millions furloughed or temporarily unemployed.Italy’s central bank said industrial production had declined by 15 percent in March and total economic output was set to contract by five percent in annual terms between January and March.But a standoff is emerging between the northern leaders and those south of Rome.Naples’s Campania governor Vincenzo De Luca warned Friday that he may have to “close our borders” to people from the north should those regions’ stay-at-home orders be lifted.The scale of business reopening will be determined by the number of deaths and recoveries reported over the coming days.Italy is still digging though data from individual regions to determine the true impact of its worst disaster since World War II.Previously undisclosed figures from its public health institute revealed that nearly 17,000 medics have been infected with the virus since Italy’s first Covid-19 death was recorded on February 21.Several Italian doctors have expressed fears that infected health care workers may have been unwittingly spreading the disease to their patients in the early weeks of the outbreak.A study released Thursday by the FNOMCeO medical association said Covid-19 has killed 125 doctors in Italy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-declares-victory-over-coronavirus-in-poorer-south/story-HUX91vA6u42K3UPEXm3CAO.html
18-04-2020||World||China’s economy contracts for first time in decades||China’s economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020, government data showed on Friday, confirming the damage done to the second largest economy in the world by the coronavirus pandemic. China’s gross domestic product stood at 20.65 trillion yuan (about $ 2.91 trillion) in the first quarter of 2020, down 6.8% year on year, data from the national bureau of statistics (NBS) showed Friday.Reports said it was the first time that the Chinese economy had contracted since the Cultural Revolution, which ended in 1976.State media reports said the 6.8% contraction translated to an economic loss of about 1.44 trillion yuan ($203.4 billion), which is equivalent to the GDP of New Zealand. The coronavirus first emerged China late last year, forcing the government to opt for an extensive countrywide shutdown of factories and businesses to contain the spread of the pathogen. The Communist Party of China (CPC)-ruled government has restarted manufacturing across provinces but the raging pandemic has severely disrupted the supply chain in the first three months, impacting demand globally.The impact of the pandemic on China’s foreign trade is expected to show in the second quarter with demand for goods from China – the world’s manufacturing hub – expected to plummet across the world.The pandemic has infected more than 2 million globally and killed more than 130,000; China has reported more than 4000 deaths although new infections have dropped significantly from their peak in February.“A breakdown of the data showed output of the service sector, which accounted for nearly 60% of the total GDP, dropped by 5.2%, while primary industry and the secondary industry saw a decline of 3.2% and 9.6%, respectively,” official news agency, Xinhua, said in a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-economy-contracts-for-first-time-in-decades/story-5jK30LFH0c1okBjZrweFEM.html
