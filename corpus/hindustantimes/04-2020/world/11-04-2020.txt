11-04-2020||World||US set to overtake Italy in toll, Donald Trump to set up body to reopen country||The United States has become the first country to report more than 2,000 fatalities from the coronavirus disease in a single day and President Donald Trump said he will name a task force next week to decide when to reopen the country, and it does not have to be May 1, a date he has been reportedly considering.The president also continued his feud with the World Health Organization (WHO) and said he will have an announcement abut US funding for it. He has accused the world body of getting the pandemic wrong and then being “China-centric” and siding with it to help conceal the true extent of their outbreak.The United States continued to be hammered by the pandemic with the toll, which stood at 18,770 Saturday morning, set to overtake Italy’s 18,849. New York, the epicenter of the American outbreak, accounted for nearly half the country’s fatalities with 7,887; most of them in New York City, 5,820.The number of confirmed cases in the United States went past the half-million mark in the same period to 501,560; the world total of cases was 1.7 million effecting 184 countries, and 103,800 deaths.Despite the rising numbers of cases and fatalities US officials have said there are signs of an improvement in the situations, specially in the hotspots, geographies with high incidence of cases. New York, for instance, has seen a drop in hospitalization; adjoining states of New Jersey and Connecticut have stabilized and cities such as Boston and Chicago that continue to report cases, the rate of increase has stabilized.But the country has not yet reached the peak, health officials have said. “As encouraging as they are,” Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House task force on the coronavirus outbreak, said at the daily briefing Friday, “we have not reached the peak.” April 16 is the projected peak day.The current strategy of social-distancing is working, she and other experts have said as they caution against easing up. “It’s important to remember that this is not the time to feel that since we have made such important advance in the sense of success of the mitigation, that we need to be pulling back at all,” said Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading epidemiologist and a member of the task force Americans have come to trust the most.President Trump has seemed in a hurry to open the the country and put it back to business as the economy is getting pummeled by the virus. Unemployment has shot up into double digits, with more than 16 million filing for unemployment benefits in the last three weeks, and experts are warning of the return of the Great Depression of 1929.Trump is concerned about implications for his re-elections prospects and has reportedly sought a plan from aides to reopen the country by May 1. Asked if he is determined to remove the restriction by that date, he said, “I’m not -- I am -- I would love to open it. I’m not determined anything. The facts are going to determine what I do.”The president then went on to announce he will be naming a task force or a council to decide when the country should be reopened. “This is really -- I call it, ‘The Opening Our Country Task Force’ or ‘Opening Our Country Council’, so we don’t get it confused with Mike’s task force (the White House task on coronavirus headed by Vice-President Mike Pence), which has done so great. And we’re going to have the great business leaders, great doctors. We’re going to have a great group of people.” The president, who expects to name the embers of the body on Tuesday. also assured reporters he will abide by the advice of his experts on this issue. Also next week, the American leader expects to announce his decision on continued funding of the WHO, with whom he has been carrying on a very public spat.”We’re paying them more than 10 times more than China,” he said Friday, referring to the annual contributions of the two countries, which he added, were around $450 million and $42 million respectively.“They are very, very China-centric … China always seems the to get the better of the -- the argument, and I don’t like that.”WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu has hit back and called on Trump to “quarantine politicizing COVID” earlier in the week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-set-to-overtake-italy-in-toll-donald-trump-to-set-up-body-to-reopen-country/story-qGRfXaV8rWJuLRWSboguGM.html
11-04-2020||World||Russia space chief spars with Elon Musk over launch pricing||The head of Russia’s space agency on Saturday accused Elon Musk’s SpaceX of predatory pricing for space launches, which is pushing Russia to cut its own prices.“Instead of honest competition on the market for space launches, they are lobbying for sanctions against us and use price dumping with impunity,” Rogozin wrote on Twitter.Rogozin, who is often outspoken on Twitter and previously engaged in online banter with Elon Musk, on Friday raised the issue during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.He said the Roscosmos space agency “is working to lower prices by more than 30 percent on launch services to increase our share on the international markets.”“This is our answer to dumping by American companies financed by the US budget,” he said.The market price of a SpaceX launch is $60 million, but NASA pays up to four times that amount, he said.Musk responded to the criticism Saturday by saying on Twitter: “SpaceX rockets are 80% reusable, theirs are 0%. This is the actual problem.”SpaceX plans to send astronauts to the International Space Station next month for the first time on board its Falcon 9, a rocket that can be reused, lowering the cost of missions.Musk also announced last month that SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsules will start transporting tourists to the ISS next year.Rogozin has claimed, however, that SpaceX’s low pricing is only possible due to lavish funding from the Pentagon.After NASA retired its space shuttles in 2011, Russia became the sole carrier of humans to space, charging NASA for launching US astronauts to the ISS at reportedly $70 million each.Rogozin last year congratulated Musk on Crew Dragon’s successful launch, and Musk has tweeted jokes in Russian, with the banter a source of delight for Russian media.In 2014, Rogozin mocked the lack of a US manned flight programme, saying it might as well “deliver its astronauts to the ISS by using a trampoline”, after Washington announced new sanctions against Moscow which included some space industries.ma/spmISS A/S||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-space-chief-spars-with-elon-musk-over-launch-pricing/story-2WQIL59yQiG7XeP0nJWhnO.html
11-04-2020||World||Italy plans more coronavirus testing, contact tracing post lockdown||Italy plans to increase testing for the coronavirus and use voluntary contact tracing whenever it exits from a lockdown that’s currently in effect until at least May 3. Italy’s special commissioner for the virus emergency Domenico Arcuri told SKYTG 24 there will be mandatory blood tests to set up a system of ‘‘immunity passports.’‘ The voluntary contact tracing mobile apps will allow people to know if they have come in contact with someone who is positive for the virus. Then they can be tested in an effort to limit further spread of the virus. The blood tests identifying anti-bodies are still being developed. Virologists have cautioned the tests will not prove immunity but will give a snapshot whether a person has been in contact with the virus. If an anti-body test is positive, more testing would be needed to know if the virus is still active. The goal of public health officials is to determine how long immunity to the virus lasts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-plans-more-coronavirus-testing-contact-tracing-post-lockdown/story-MR56zfSuGL0cHKF1mGlH2J.html
11-04-2020||World||Why Africa’s coronavirus outbreak appears slower than anticipated||When Africa’s first case of coronavirus was detected in Egypt in February, the rest of the continent prepared for the brunt of a pandemic that has engulfed Europe and spread to the United States, infecting more than 1.6 million worldwide.Health experts warned of the devastation the deadly virus could cause in Africa, where most hospitals are desperately short of equipment and trained staff. Coronavirus has since spread to 52 African countries, but despite a steady rise in the number of confirmed cases, the continent continues to lag behind the global curve for infections and deaths.Still, the World Health Organization last month warned Africa faced a dramatic evolution of the pandemic even as governments imposed restrictions to help curb the spread. The continent appears poorly equipt to manage a major health crisis and is struggling to test enough to monitor virus cases. Where does Africa stand?To date the novel respiratory disease has infected more than 12,800 people on the continent and killed at least 692, according to a tally compiled by AFP. Only the Comoros archipelago and the tiny kingdom of Lesotho have not yet detected any cases.South Africa is the worst-affected country, with over 2,000 confirmed cases and 24 recorded deaths so far -- well behind the more than 871,000 cases and 71,000 deaths counted in Europe to date. Experts, however, warn that the tide is rising.“During the last four days we can see that the numbers have already doubled,” said Michel Yao, the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa’s emergency response programme manager.“If the trend continues... some countries may face a huge peak very soon,” Yao told AFP.WHO Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti echoed the concern, adding that the spread of COVID-19 outside major cities opened “a new front in our fight against this virus”.Are numbers underestimated?Possibly the greatest question mark in analyses of coronavirus in Africa, compounded by a global lack of testing capacity.Despite a donation of more than one million coronavirus testing kits by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, most African countries lack the equipment needed to detect the disease.South Africa -- which has the most advanced healthcare system in sub-Saharan Africa -- has so far only managed to test around 73,000 of its 57 million inhabitants. “This is way too low for the kind of challenges South Africa is facing,” said the country’s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, who is aiming to scale up to 30,000 tests per day.Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy, has only carried out 5,000 coronavirus tests to date for a country of 190 million people.“The testing system is quite overloaded,” admitted a doctor working at a private clinic in Lagos, who asked not to be identified.“It takes time for... the results,” he added. “And are they accurate? We don’t know.”Inability to test for the virus has forced several countries to work with vague and sometimes misleading estimates. Kenya, for instance, has predicted its number of coronavirus cases to reach 10,000 by the end of April.Ten days into the month, the number of detected infections remained lower than 200.“The reason is we have not gone to do community-based testing,” explained the Director General of Kenya’s health ministry, Patrick Amoth.“So we still stand by our earlier projections. We don’t know what is going to happen.”The head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, admitted that Africa’s coronavirus statistics were far from “perfect”.“We just lack the means,” he told AFP.But Nkengasong also dismissed claims that a high number of infections had slipped under the radar, pointing out that hospitals “would be flooded with people” if that was the case. Have lockdowns, curfews worked? The delayed spread of coronavirus gave African countries some leeway to roll out the same measures implemented in Europe to stem the disease. Governments across the continent reacted ahead of time, closing borders and imposing lockdowns and curfews when just a handful of cases had been detected. Those measures have been tricky to enforce in impoverished and densely populated neighbourhoods, where houses are overcrowded and most survive off informal work -- making it almost impossible to remain home.The WHO’s Moeti cautioned that it was “too early to say” whether anti-coronavirus measures were slowing the epidemic in Africa.Meanwhile, South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa said earlier this week that there was “sufficient evidence” to show that a nation-wide lockdown was “working”.“In the two weeks before the lockdown, the average daily increase in new cases was around 42 percent. Since the start of the lockdown, the average daily increase has been around 4 percent,” Ramaphosa said on Thursday, as he announced an extension of the 21-day shutdown. Has Africa had enough time to prepare?The time gained by African governments could be offset by a lack of means.“There is a severe shortage of treatment facilities for critical cases of Covid-19,” said a WHO statement. There are barely five intensive care unit beds per one million people in Africa, compared to 4,000 in Europe, according to the organisation.Public hospitals only have 2,000 medical ventilators between them to serve the whole continent. Still no one dares make any predictions on the proportions the novel coronavirus could reach in Africa.The WHO noted that 31 countries on the continent had less than 100 confirmed cases and believed “containment was possible”.Yet the threat remains.“Covid-19 has the potential to cause thousands of deaths,” said the WHO’s Moeti. “To also unleash economic and social devastation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-africa-s-coronavirus-outbreak-appears-slower-than-anticipated/story-AX4htJnh418YRefV29MbUP.html

However, thousands more travel in and out of the city. Egypt, Mali, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are the major sources of African expatriates. Most are engaged in trade or study in the city.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday told reporters that China’s most urgent task is to prevent “overseas imports” of the virus but acknowledged that “there might be some misunderstandings in the implementation of measures.”China treats all foreigners equally, Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africans-harassed-in-southern-china-amid-covid-19-and-fear-of-imported-cases/story-4faJmVjIcYUNIuZVRKtAJO.html

Health secretary Matt Hancock believes the peak is yet to come.Downing Street issued a brief update on Johnson: “The Prime Minister continues to make very good progress.”Hancock faced mounting criticism from health professionals and others over “dangerously low” levels of person protection equipment in some hospitals, despite the military and others involved in delivering millions of pieces across the UK.Chaand Nagpaul of the British Medical Association said: “No doctor should ever have to be in harm’s way when they go to work, and in these unprecedented times, this has never been more important”.“This is not the flu. We are dealing with an unknown, highly-infectious, and potentially deadly virus that has already claimed the lives of several healthcare workers. It is absurd that the people trained to treat this disease are the ones who are not being appropriately protected – and without them, we face real disaster”.Hancock revealed that 19 health professionals had died of coronavirus in recent days, most of them from Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Afro-Caribbean communities. They include Indian-origin Jitendra Kumar Rathod.Nagpaul said: “This is absolutely tragic. In terms of doctors who I represent, it’s extremely concerning that 10 of the 11 doctors are from black and Asian minority backgrounds, almost all of them having come from overseas having given their lives to the health service”.Ministers and health officials reiterated the core message to stay at home, to resist visiting local beach or park despite the warm weather, with temperatures expected to reach as high as 26°C (78.80°F) in some areas over the Easter holidays weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-increases-by-917-set-to-cross-10-000/story-gVLlEVuMm6P33qDKsH4GnI.html

A massive effort to move instruction online has met with mixed success in the city, where many low-income students lack Wi-Fi and devices for connecting to their virtual classrooms.De Blasio resisted closing schools even as the city recorded its first deaths from the coronavirus, saying he feared that health care workers would have to stay home to care for children and that hundreds of thousands of poor students would go hungry without their free school meals.Authorities in some other locales, including the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania, have previously announced that schools will be shuttered for the rest of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-schools-closed-for-rest-of-year-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-kjkAC2wx7ikDUwmjOmegGM.html

11-04-2020||World||Iran begins lifting restrictions after brief coronavirus lockdown||Iran began reopening government offices Saturday after a brief nationwide lockdown to help contain the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East, which has killed more than 4,300 people in the country.Authorities had ordered most government agencies and all non-essential businesses to remain closed for a week after the Nowruz holiday ended on April 4.Government offices outside the capital, Tehran, reopened Saturday with two-thirds of employees coming in and the remainder working from home, state media reported. Women who have young children were given priority in deciding who works remotely. Businesses outside the capital were also allowed to reopen Saturday, the first day of the work week.Businesses in Tehran will be allowed to reopen next Saturday, provided they register with authorities and follow guidelines on social distancing set out by the Health Ministry. Government offices in the capital will reopen with two-thirds of employees coming in and the rest working remotely.The ministry meanwhile reported another 125 deaths, bringing the overall toll to 4,357. The country has reported more than 70,000 confirmed cases, and authorities say more than 40,000 have recovered.The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in elderly patients or those with underlying health problems.For weeks, Iran declined to impose the kind of wide-scale lockdowns adopted by other Middle Eastern countries, even as the number of confirmed cases and fatalities steadily climbed. The virus has also infected and killed a number of senior Iranian officials.Authorities have defended their response, saying they have to consider the economic impact of any quarantine measures since the country is under severe U.S. sanctions. President Donald Trump imposed heavy sanctions, including on oil exports, after withdrawing the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.The U.S. has offered humanitarian aid to help Iran combat the outbreak, but Iran’s leaders have rejected it, instead demanding that the sanctions be lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-begins-lifting-restrictions-after-brief-virus-lockdown/story-awSn16ELGpNpfbPNLxmfjK.html

The guidelines are set to stay in place through the end of April. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The president will then have to decide whether to extend them or start encouraging people to go back to work and a more normal way of life.“I’m going to have to make a decision, and I ... hope to God that it’s the right decision,” Trump said. “It’s the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.”Trump said the facts would determine the next move, though he reiterated his desire to re-open the economy. Asked what metrics he would use to make his judgment, he pointed at his forehead: “The metrics right here, that’s my metrics.”Trump suggested the number of new infections was flattening and the death toll would be lower than initial projections of more than 100,000.Also read: A quiet Easter expected as global Covid-19 deaths top 100,000He said he would announce the members of the new advisory council possibly on Tuesday. Some state governors will be appointed.Trump said the aggressive social distancing and stay-at-home measures taken to combat the coronavirus were showing signs of success, and situations in hot spots such as New Orleans, Louisiana, and Detroit, Michigan, were stabilizing.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage US deaths from the virus topped 18,100 on Friday, according to a Reuters tally.But administration officials cautioned it was still too early to ease restrictions, and said the faithful should not gather in churches on the Easter Sunday holiday.“We know it’s difficult in this time of year in particular to avoid gatherings of more than 10, but we’re grateful that so many churches, synagogues and places of worship have done just that,” Vice President Mike Pence said, urging worshipers “to continue to heed the guidelines.”New U.S. government figures show coronavirus infections will spike during the summer if stay-at-home orders are lifted after 30 days as planned, according to projections first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by a Department of Homeland Security official.If shelter-in-place orders are lifted after 30 days, the death toll is estimated to reach 200,000, according to the projections, obtained from DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump said at the briefing that he and his advisers have not seen the new projections.Trump said he was getting fewer calls from governors urgently seeking equipment and help.“We’re in great shape with ventilators, we’re in great shape with protective clothing, we have additional planeloads coming in. But we’re not getting any calls from governors at this moment,” he said.Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House task force on the coronavirus, said the United States was starting to flatten the curve the way Italy did, with a lot of the success coming from progress in New York City.Officials have pointed to declining rates of coronavirus hospitalizations and need for intensive care in hard-hit New York as signs that social distancing measures are paying off.“But as encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak. And so every day we need to continue to do what we did yesterday, and the week before and the week before that because that’s what in the end is going to take us across the peak and down the other side,” Birx said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-donald-trump-faces-dilemma-on-reopening-us-economy-says-biggest-decision-ever/story-68jQcUmV30e7CQROOw9agK.html

He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.The peace deal is aimed at paving the way for the US to extricate itself from the 19-year war, America’s longest.The spokesman confirmed that Gen. Scott Miller met with the Taliban “as part of the military channel established in the agreement” to discuss ways to reduce the violence.Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said the meeting was held late Friday in the Gulf nation of Qatar, where the insurgent group maintains a political office. Shaheen tweeted Saturday that the two sides held “serious” discussions. He said the Taliban called for a halt to attacks against civilians. The US military says it does not target non-combatants.The US -Taliban deal, touted as Afghanistan’s best chance at ending decades of war, is holding, but progress toward a broader political settlement has been slowed by squabbling within the Afghan government. That has frustrated Washington and delayed the start of the next phase of negotiations, among Afghans themselves.The Taliban say they have reduced their attacks on Afghan forces and have not attacked US or NATO troops since the agreement was signed on Feb. 29. Most of the recent Taliban attacks have been against Afghan forces posted in remote areas.The Afghan government meanwhile said its air force struck Taliban positions in the northeastern Badakhshan province, killing up to 27 insurgents.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said civilians were killed and wounded, blaming US and Afghan forces. The US military spokesman declined to respond to the allegation but said that the Taliban often falsely accuse the US of carrying out bombing raids launched by Afghan forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-meet-head-of-us-forces-in-afghanistan-amid-tensions-over-peace-deal/story-iMI2uOt9IsdYp9oKZsBX7M.html

Donald Trump has ramped up the embargo since assuming the US presidency, making it harder for other countries to send supplies there.Cuba complained recently that a shipment of test kits, masks and respirators donated by the Chinese Alibaba group didn’t arrive because the American company tasked with transportation feared breaching US sanction rules.“It’s very difficult to buy equipment, supplies, medicines. We’re forced to buy them in far away markets that double, triple the costs and on many occasions they arrive late,” said Marimon.He said the sanctions caused “$160 million in damages to the health ministry” between April 2019 and March 2020, $60 million more than the year before.He said the total losses since the sanctions began in 1962 was three billion dollars.Recently, the Oxfam charity blasted the US over the sanctions and called for them to be lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cuba-hits-out-at-cruel-us-sanctions-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-QPXOhZMFlbiAowIDF7frLI.html
11-04-2020||World||New York buries unclaimed bodies at fast pace to clear space in morgues for Covid-19 victims||Authorities in New York, the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, are burying unclaimed bodies quickly to clear space in the city’s morgues, where mortal remains of Covid-19 patients are piling up, according to a media report.A report in The New York Times said every Thursday was burial day on Hart Island, the final resting place off the Bronx for New York City’s unclaimed dead.“But as with many things, coronavirus has changed all that,” it said.Burials are now being done five days a week at Hart Island, with roughly 25 bodies lowered into trenches each day, according to a city official. “That is as many burials as would typically be done in a week before the virus hit,” the report said.Drone footage and images of burial crews in freshly dug muddy trenches burying body after body in bare wooden boxes are circulating in social media. New York, which has emerged as the epicenter of Covid-19 deaths, has registered over 1.7 lakh positive cases, which is more than any other country. More than 7,800 people in New York have died due to coronavirus, several times more than the total number of people killed in the devastating 9/11 terror attacks.The NYT report quoted a city official as saying that the only people being buried at the island for now are those for whom the city has been unable to contact next of kin for some time.“We understand extenuating circumstances,” the official said, noting that bodies that have not been claimed because their families are under quarantine or on lockdown or for some other reason will not be buried on Hart Island.The report said the city’s morgues used to have adequate space to hold unclaimed bodies for 30 to 60 days before they were buried on Hart island. But now, with the pace of the coronavirus death toll increasing, the city is moving to bury more of those people to clear space in the morgues.“Because we didn’t have pressure on the system, we didn’t have to move them quickly,” the official said, adding, “We are now burying people who have been sitting with us for quite some time.” The official said it is possible that the burial of the unclaimed bodies of Covid-19 victims has already begun, because people have been dying of the virus for weeks. “We know that if it didn’t happen yesterday, it’s only a matter of days until people are buried because of the time that has passed,” the official said on Friday morning, referring to victims of the disease.Contract workers are now doing the burials, rather than the Rikers Island inmates who normally do them, the official said.The US has become the world’s first country to have registered more than 2,000 Covid-19 deaths in a single day with 2,108 fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, while the number of infections in America has crossed 500,000, the highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-buries-unclaimed-bodies-at-fast-pace-to-clear-space-in-morgues-for-covid-19-victims/story-gpGL8osr8CoVOHulrrt5gP.html

London as you know has the largest number of cases in the UK”, he says despairingly.The bigger picture of nearly 9,000 deaths and tens of thousands of cases in UK hospitals is played out at the micro level in individual stories of frustration, adjustments in everyday life, cancellations, and strategies to dodge others in supermarkets and queues.Also Watch |UK PM Boris Johnson hospitalised; Queen Elizabeth II addresses nation Almost everyone in the Indian community knows someone who has had the virus, is in quarantine at home, or in hospital. Social distancing is relatively easier in western societies, which even before the virus struck were much more formal in their interactions than Indians, which is reflected in the ‘Indian’ areas in London.It is significant that London boroughs with the highest cases are those with large concentrations of people of Indian origin: Ealing Southall, Brent, Barnet and Harrow. “It is frustrating to remain at home, but there is no option”, says Maidenhead-based Ravi Singh.Everyday life in India and the UK is more integrated than ever, with news channels, internet and social media ensuring close connectivity. Singh quips that in India it is no longer a matter of prestige to say that one is ‘London-returned’; some may even hide the fact.Writer Mihir Bose, a long-time London resident, says social distancing is the main problem, but adds that the elderly have discovered the benefits of social media and video-conferencing that enable connectivity in the time of isolation.“Many of my elderly British friends now meet in virtual drinking sessions. We had several of these; the calendar is booked up.”It is said that if you are tired of London, you are tired of life, but Samuel Johnson never faced such a lockdown. London no longer looks and feels like the London everyone knows; it is as if a giant hoover has sucked life out of its throbbing streets.The scene is particularly dystopic in central London buzz-spots such as Oxford Street, Piccadilly, and Trafalgar Square.Traffic lights are on, but there is hardly any traffic, except for police cars, ambulances and vans of electricians, plumbers and road maintenance staff. The price of petrol has come down to nearly a pound, but cars in residential areas have hardly moved an inch.The BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden is closed since March 13, streaming its daily ‘arti’ online to followers across London and the UK. Other places of worship have made similar arrangements to prevent gathering of large number of people.Medical experts of Indian origin such as Kamlesh Khunti of the University Leicester worry that the ethnicity-wise figures when released will show a disproportionate high incidence of the virus in the community. Initial data has already suggested this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-ll-come-now-covid-19-hotspot-london-no-longer-holiday-choice-of-indians/story-q1ADNNEw5yL0fQNz9ab2nL.html
11-04-2020||World||African community in Chinese city allege being targeted in coronavirus crackdown||Africans in southern China’s largest city say they have become targets of suspicion and subjected to forced evictions, arbitrary quarantines and mass coronavirus testing as the country steps up its fight against imported infections.China says it has largely curbed its COVID-19 outbreak but a recent cluster of cases linked to the Nigerian community in Guangzhou sparked the alleged discrimination by locals and virus prevention officials.Local authorities in the industrial centre of 15 million said at least eight people diagnosed with the illness had spent time in the city’s Yuexiu district, known as “Little Africa”.Five were Nigerian nationals who faced widespread anger after reports surfaced that they had broken a mandatory quarantine and been to eight restaurants and other public places instead of staying home.As a result, nearly 2,000 people they came into contact with had to be tested for COVID-19 or undergo quarantine, state media said.Guangzhou had confirmed 114 imported coronavirus cases as of Thursday -- 16 of which were Africans. The rest were returning Chinese nationals. It has led to Africans becoming targets of suspicion, distrust and racism in China.Several Africans told AFP they had been forcibly evicted from their homes and turned away by hotels. “I’ve been sleeping under the bridge for four days with no food to eat... I cannot buy food anywhere, no shops or restaurants will serve me,” said Tony Mathias, an exchange student from Uganda who was forced from his apartment on Monday.“We’re like beggars on the street,” the 24-year-old said.Mathias added that police had given him no information about testing or quarantine but instead told him “to go to another city”.Police in Guangzhou declined to comment when contacted by AFP.A Nigerian businessman said he was evicted from his apartment earlier this week.“Everywhere the police see us, they will come and pursue us and tell us to go home. But where can we go?” he said.Growing tensions Other Africans said the community had been subject to mass COVID-19 testing even though many had not left China recently, and placed under arbitrary quarantine at home or in hotels. China has banned foreign nationals from entering the country and many travellers are being sent into 14-day quarantines either in their own accommodation or at centralised facilities.Thiam, an exchange student from Guinea, said police ordered him to stay home on Tuesday even after he tested negative for COVID-19 and told officers he had not left China in almost four years.He believes the measures are specifically and unfairly targeting Africans. “All the people I’ve seen tested are Africans. Chinese are walking around freely but if you’re black you can’t go out,” he said.Denny, a Nigerian trader evicted from his flat on Tuesday, said police moved him to a hotel for quarantine after he spent several days sleeping on the streets. “Even if we have a negative test result, police don’t let us stay (in our accommodation) and they don’t give a reason why,” he said.  ‘Crazy fear’ The infections in Guangzhou have sparked a torrent of abuse online, with many Chinese internet users posting racist comments and calling for all Africans to be deported.Last week a controversial cartoon depicting foreigners as different types of trash to be sorted through went viral on social media. “There’s just this crazy fear that anybody who’s African might have been in contact with somebody who was sick,” said David, a Canadian living in Guangzhou who did not want to give his full name.China’s foreign ministry acknowledged this week that there had been some “misunderstandings” with the African community.“I want to emphasise that the Chinese government treats all foreigners in China equally,” said spokesman Zhao Lijian on Thursday, urging local officials to “improve their working mechanisms”.The complaints in Guangzhou contrast with a welcome reception to Chinese efforts in battling the coronavirus across the African continent, where Beijing this week donated medical supplies to 18 countries.“When China engages Africa it’s the central government that does that, but when it comes to immigration enforcement that happens at the local level,” said Eric Olander, managing editor of the China Africa Project.“That explains why there’s an inconsistency in the more upbeat messaging we hear about Chinese diplomacy on the continent and the increasingly difficult realities that African traders, students and other expatriates face in their day-to-day lives in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/african-community-in-chinese-city-allege-being-targeted-in-coronavirus-crackdown/story-Sz9lkBdLX3rKUuEEtNuNPM.html
11-04-2020||World||US first country to record over 2,000 Covid-19 deaths in one day: Report||The US has become the world’s first country to have registered more than 2,000 COVID-19 deaths in a single day with 2,108 fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, while the number of infections in America has crossed 500,000, the highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, where the deadly coronavirus disease started in December last year before spreading across Europe and America killing more than 100,000, has so far recorded 81,000 cases of positive infections and 3,339 deaths. In terms of fatalities, the US might soon overtake Italy where 18,848 COVID-19 deaths have happened so far. By Friday night, the US had 1,8679 recorded deaths, closely behind Italy. More than 16,000 people have died in Spain and over 13,000 in Germany, the university data said. By Friday night more than 2,108 Americans had died due to the novel coronavirus and 500,399 people had tested positive with the dreaded disease, it said. The COVID-19 positive cases in the United States are now more than the other top countries taken together: Spain (158,000), Italy (147,000), Germany (122,000) and France (112,000). New York, which has emerged as the epicenter of COVID-19 deaths, has registered over 1.7 lakh positive cases, which is more than any other country. More than 7,800 people in New York have died due to coronavirus. New Jersey has has nearly 2,000 deaths and more than 54,000 confirmed cases. Before the start of the week, members of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus had projected between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths in the US. While President Donald Trump had said that this was going to be a “terrible, terrible” week in terms of death, US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the week was going to be 9/11 and Pearl Harbour moment for the country. On Friday, Trump told reporters that as per the new projections the death toll was expected to be below 60,000. “Hard to believe that if you had 60,000 (deaths), you could never be happy, but that’s a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking. So they said between 100 and 220,000 lives on the minimum side, and then up to 2.2 million lives if we didn’t do anything. But it showed a just tremendous resolve by the people,” he said. Trump has declared a national emergency, has notified major disaster declaration for almost all of the 50 States and more than 95 per cent of the 330 million population are under stay-at-home order. The American economy is headed for a recession, experts say. New York, the epicenter, he said is showing signs of a “downward curve,” Trump said. “A lot of that has to do with the aggressive strategy in saving so many lives. We’re saving so many lives compared to what it could have been,” he said. “In New York, we’re seeing hospital admissions declining very substantially. And nationwide, the number of new cases per day is flattening substantially, suggesting that we are near the peak and our comprehensive strategy is working,” Trump said. Over time, the guidelines to slow the spread are decreasing the rate of new cases very substantially and will result in fewer hospital admissions, he added. According to Dr Deborah Brix, a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, the mortality rate in the United States is significantly less than many other countries. “That is really solely the work of our frontline healthcare providers,” she said, but cautioned that the country has still not reached the peak. “But as encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak. And so, every day, we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before and the week before that, because that’s what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side,” Brix said. Globally, 102,669 people have died due to coronavirus and over 1.6 million people have been infected, according to Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-first-country-to-record-over-2-000-covid-19-deaths-in-one-day-report/story-QmvRoFHyRxQaVJEksH65lO.html
11-04-2020||World||A quiet Easter expected as global Covid-19 deaths top 100,000||The global death toll from the coronavirus topped 100,000 as Christians around the world marked the Good Friday in front of computer screens instead of churches and some countries tiptoed toward reopening s battered economies.Public health officials warned people against violating the social distancing rules over Easter. In Italy, officials used helicopters, drones and stepped-up police checks to make sure people don’t slip out over the holiday.Even such hallowed traditions as the pope’s Easter message are being revamped -- Pope Francis will live-stream from the seclusion of his private library.Some churches held services online, while others arranged prayers at drive-in theatres. Fire-scarred Notre Dame Cathedral came back to life briefly in locked-down Paris. Services were broadcast from the nearly empty, closed-to-the-public cathedral.France on Friday reported 987 more deaths in hospitals and nursing homes in 24 hours, but the number of patients in intensive care fell for the second day in a row.Health secretary Matt Hancock said on Friday that Britain had recorded 980 deaths in 24 hours, the highest daily toll yet, bringing total fatalities to nearly 8,000. Confirmed cases in the UK climbed to more than 65,000.A Downing Street spokesman said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was moved out of intensive care after being hit with the virus, “has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery.” Stanley Johnson, the prime minister’s father, expressed relief that his son is out of the ICU and wanted him to rest.In the US, the death toll surged to more than 17,900 as of Friday morning, with more than 478,000 cases. New York state, the worst-hit, had nearly half of fatalities at 7,800 — with 779 in 24 hours on Thursday, a rate of 33 an hour.New York City reported 5,150 deaths, becoming the city with highest number fatalities anywhere in the world.City officials are now considering mass, temporary burial sites. Such internments would likely be at Hart Island off the Bronx, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.Still, there were signs of hope. Hospitalisation numbers in New York fell to their lowers on Thursday since the state was put “on pause” by the state authorities.Anthony Fauci, the epidemiologist in President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force, cited the improvement in New York to acknowledge a turnaround has started. But, he told CNN on Friday, he would like to see clearer and stronger signs before getting “out there prematurely and winding back in the same situation.” New York governor Andrew Cuomo counselled caution, citing cities and countries hit by a second wave because they rushed to it.US Senate, meantime, failed to pass on Thursday a request of $250 billion more in relief for small businesses sought by the Trump administration in addition to the overall package of $2.2 trillion cleared last month. Democrats wanted a matching amount to be set aside for healthcare workers. US lawmakers appealed to China to shut down all its operating ‘wet markets’, where fresh produce including meat and vegetables are sold.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians should get accustomed to the “new normal” of living with restrictions even after the first wave of the pandemic has peaked. He said social distancing or remaining at home may be necessary over a period longer than the expected peak of the infections in the country.In some of the worst-hit countries, Italy and Spain, new infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been levelling off. But the daily tolls remain shocking.Spain, after a two-week freeze on all non-essential economic activity, decided to allow factories and construction sites to resume work on Monday, while schools, most shops and offices will remain closed.Spanish authorities said they trust that the move won’t cause a significant surge in infections.In Italy, the industrial lobbies in regions representing 45% of the country’s economic output urged the government to ease its two-week lockdown on all non-essential manufacturing, saying the country “risks definitively shutting down its own motor, and every day that passes the risk grows not to be able to restart it.’’A hasty lifting of restrictions imposed to control the Covid-19 pandemic could lead to a fatal resurgence of the new coronavirus, the World Health Organization warned on Friday.Malaysia’s prime minister announced a two-week extension to the country’s lockdown but said selected economic sectors can reopen in phases.China’s Wuhan city, where the pandemic began, is still testing residents regularly despite relaxing its tough two-month lockdown. China has also ordered all hotels in the capital Beijing to ensure all guests provide negative coronavirus report. Beijing will require all arrivals to provide a negative nucleic acid report and green health code before checking in to hotels starting Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-to-livestream-his-easter-message-as-global-covid-19-deaths-top-100-000/story-wG1Qy4kuAapyqJioRXQAjL.html

Shopping malls, hairdressers and larger stores should reopen from May 1, though the plan could change if infections accelerate. Restaurants and hotels could reopen step by step from mid-May, although details have yet to be announced. As the country, governed by right-wing Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, is planning to resume its economic activity amid reports that it likely had at least twice as many new coronavirus infections than officially reported.The SORA institute-led study found that 0.32% of those surveyed in the first week of April tested positive for the new coronavirus, with more than three per 1,000 people thought to have caught the virus.SORA said it was the first such study in the EU to better understand the virus’s prevalence.The result means some 28,500 of Austria’s close to nine million people were likely affected, the institute said, compared to the official statistic of up to 12,200 coronavirus infections for that April week. The total of known infections stood at more than 13,000 on Friday , of which 7,021 were active. A total of 319 people have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-set-to-be-first-in-europe-to-reopen/story-Kq2ocsqFvLscmiIJ98F9jI.html
11-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Trump says when to reopen US economy ‘biggest decision’ of presidency||President Donald Trump on Friday said his decision on when to reopen the US economy, shuttered due to the coronavirus pandemic, will be the toughest he has ever taken.“I’m going to have to make a decision and I only hope to God that it’s the right decision. But I would say without question, it’s the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make,” Trump told a press conference.Trump, who faces a tight reelection in November, is keen to get the US economy back open after weeks of tough measures that shut down businesses and dramatically cut down on transport across the country to slow the virus’s spread.The previously strong economy was the biggest selling point in his campaign platform.However, he also faces warnings that a premature opening would put lives at risk by allowing the virus to take a new hold.“I have to make the biggest decision of my life,” he said.With current federal guidelines on social distancing set to expire at the end of the month, expectations are growing that Trump will tell Americans they can start resuming normal activity from May -- at least in parts of the country.The decision will be partly based on medical data, but also heavily swayed by political considerations and advice from the business community which has been devastated by the shutdown, with an abrupt drop in revenues and mass unemployment claims.In what will mark an important step in the process, Trump says he will be announcing members of a new task force on Tuesday.“I call it the opening our country task force or opening our country council,” he said.The group will include “very great doctors and business people,” as well as probably governors of states.In a sign that Trump will seek broad support for what could be a politically dangerous decision, he said he wanted bipartisan representation from politicians on the council.“I want to put on both parties,” he said.Reassuring critics who say he risks rushing, Trump insisted medical opinion will be key.“We’re looking at a date, we hope we’ll be able to fulfill a certain date, but we’re not doing anything until we know this country is going to be healthy,” he said.“We don’t want to go back and start doing it over again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-trump-says-when-to-reopen-us-economy-biggest-decision-of-presidency/story-uRL0wGA6ELB9I0OXzJXfHK.html
11-04-2020||World||Coronavirus found in air samples up to 13 feet from patients: Study||A new study examining air samples from hospital wards with COVID-19 patients has found the virus can travel up to 13 feet (four meters) -- twice the distance current guidelines say people should leave between themselves in public.The preliminary results of the investigation by Chinese researchers were published Friday in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).They add to a growing debate on how the disease is transmitted, with the scientists themselves cautioning that the small quantities of virus they found at this distance are not necessarily infectious.The researchers, led by a team at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing, tested surface and air samples from an intensive care unit and a general COVID-19 ward at Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan. They housed a total of 24 patients between February 19 and March 2.Follow full Covid-19 coverage hereThey found that the virus was most heavily concentrated on the floors of the wards, “perhaps because of gravity and air flow causing most virus droplets to float to the ground.”High levels were also found on frequently touched surfaces like computer mice, trashcans, bed rails and door knobs.“Furthermore, half of the samples from the soles of the ICU medical staff shoes tested positive,” the team wrote. “Therefore, the soles of medical staff shoes might function as carriers.”Airborne threat?The team also looked at so-called aerosol transmission -- when the droplets of the virus are so fine they become suspended and remain airborne for several hours, unlike cough or sneeze droplets that fall to the ground within seconds.They found that virus-laden aerosols were mainly concentrated near and downstream from patients at up to 13 feet -- though smaller quantities were found upstream, up to eight feet.Encouragingly, no members of the hospital staff were infected, “indicating that appropriate precautions could effectively prevent infection,” the authors wrote.They also offered advice that bucks orthodox guidelines: “Our findings suggest that home isolation of persons with suspected COVID-19 might not be a good control strategy” given the levels of environmental contamination.Aerosolization of the coronavirus is a contentious area for scientists who study it, because it is not clear how infectious the disease is in the tiny quantities found in ultrafine mist.The World Health Organization has so far downplayed the risk.US health authorities have adopted a more cautious line and urged people to cover their faces when out in public in case the virus can be transmitted through normal breathing and speaking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-found-in-air-samples-up-to-13-feet-from-patients/story-GybSvpPVHkY47rSCmr0fGN.html
11-04-2020||World||How false negative results are complicating Covid-19 testing||As COVID-19 tests become more widely available across the US, scientists have warned about a growing concern: Many people with negative results might actually have the virus.That could have devastating implications as a global recession looms and governments wrangle with the question of when to reopen economies shuttered as billions of people were ordered to stay home in an effort to break transmission of the deadly disease.The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.But “there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,” Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.“It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,” she said.The virus has only been spreading among humans for four months and therefore studies about test reliability are still considered preliminary.Early reports from China suggest its sensitivity, meaning how well it is able to return positive results when the virus is present, is somewhere around 60 to 70 percent. Different companies around the world are now producing slightly different tests, so it’s hard to have a precise overall figure. But even if it were possible to increase the sensitivity to 90 percent, the magnitude of risk remains substantial as the number of people tested grows, Sampathkumar argued in a paper published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings.“In California, estimates say the rate of COVID-19 infection may exceed 50 percent by mid-May 2020,” she said. With 40 million people, “even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected.” This makes it critical for clinicians to base their diagnosis on more than just the test: they must also examine a patient’s symptoms, their potential exposure history, imaging and other lab work. Timing is everything Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.The main nasal swab tests examine the nasopharynx, where the back of the nose meets the top of the throat. This requires a trained hand to perform and some portion of the false negatives arises from improper procedure.But even if done correctly, the swab may produce a false negative. That’s because as the disease progresses, the virus passes from the upper to the lower respiratory system.In these cases, the patient may be asked to try to cough up sputum -- mucus from the lower lungs -- or doctors may need to take a sample more invasively, when a patient is under sedation. Daniel Brenner, an emergency physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, described to AFP taking a test after performing a procedure called a bronchoalveolar lavage.This was done on a patient whose nasal swab returned negative three times, but who showed all the signs of COVID-19.Eventually, the patient’s medical team placed a camera down his windpipe to examine the lungs, then sprayed fluid in and sucked out the secretions, which were then tested, resulting in a positive.No perfect test Uncertainty in clinical diagnoses is not new, and clinicians are well aware that no type of test for any condition can be considered perfect.What makes COVID-19 different is its newness, said Sampathkumar.“Most of the time when you have tests, you have test characteristics outlined carefully and warnings about tests interpretation,” she said.“We had no test for so long, and when we got the test, we started using it widely and sort of forgot the basics.”After being slow to start mass testing, the US has ramped up production and has tested almost 2.5 million people, with pharmacists now authorized to carry out the procedure. But “the real fear of that is people who are given a false negative test and then decide that they’re safe to go around their daily life and go out and expose people,” said Brenner.Much hope is placed on newly available serological tests which look for antibodies produced by a person’s body in response to the virus and can tell whether a person was infected, long after they recovered.They could also be used to help diagnose a person who is currently infected but whose PCR test results showed a false negative, by waiting a week or so for the body to produce its immune response.“We are excited about the serologic test, but we don’t know how well it will work and we are starting to study it,” said Sampathkumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-false-negative-results-are-complicating-covid-19-testing/story-OUb9172j8D5izwEQLWj98O.html

11-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: Why have so many died in New York?||New York has more coronavirus cases than any country and accounts for around half of all deaths in the United States. Why was is so badly hit and could its leaders have done anything differently?Was New York more vulnerable? As of Friday, New York state has almost 160,000 confirmed COVID-19 infections, more than Europe’s worst-hit countries of Spain and Italy, and over 7,800 deaths.Governor Andrew Cuomo has said repeatedly that density and number of foreign visitors made New York City, which has almost 93,000 confirmed cases, an ideal breeding ground for infectious disease.America’s financial capital has 8.6 million inhabitants. There are 10,000 people per square kilometer, making it the densest city in the US.Millions of commuters brush up against each other on its packed subway system every day, while keeping distance on its sometimes narrow sidewalks can be difficult.NYC gets more than 60 million tourists a year and is the entry point to America for many travelers, meaning anyone carrying the virus is likely to start infecting others there first. American geneticists estimate that it started spreading there from Europe in February, before New York’s first confirmed case on March 1. The Big Apple is also characterized by massive socioeconomic inequality. Overcrowded, deprived areas -- particularly in the Bronx and Queens, where many people already suffer health problems and lack medical care -- have experienced the highest rate of infections.“New York City had all the preconditions that would support the idea that it was going to be hit very hard,” said Irwin Redlener, public health professor and expert in disaster preparedness at Columbia University.Did officials underestimate risk? On March 2, as the state’s second case was confirmed in New Rochelle, just north of New York City, Cuomo said the health care system was the best “on the planet.”“We don’t even think it’s going to be as bad as it was in other countries,” he added.After much hesitation, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the closure of public schools, bars and restaurants from March 16.The governor ordered all non-essential businesses to close and residents to stay at home a week later on March 22.Experts hesitate to say that they waited too long.“The mayor and the governor were being pushed and pulled by two opposing forces. “One was saying we have to close schools and restaurants as quickly as possible, the other saying there were lots of economic and social consequences of shutting down everything early,” said Redlener.“Everyone was getting mixed messages, including from the federal government, from (President Donald) Trump,” he added. Have other states reacted better? California, America’s most populous state, is often cited as a good example for the speed of its response to the outbreak. Its confirmed cases as of Friday were just 20,200, with 550 deaths.On March 16, six counties in the San Francisco Bay area issued a stay-at-home order followed by the whole state three days later.“One thing that I think is significant is that six neighboring counties got together and issued the same (confinement) order for all six counties, and they did it early,” said Meghan McGinty, associate at school of public health of Johns Hopkins University.“There was consistency, as opposed to NYC taking one measure, and Westchester (county) taking another, and Long Island taking another,” she told AFP.Six days passed between New York’s school closure order and its order confining residents to their homes.“In epidemic terms, six days is light years and can really make a difference in the control and spread of the epidemic, so I think it is possible to say that perhaps, in retrospect, New York waited too long,” said McGinty.Is anyone to blame? When the crisis passes, the blame game may begin.Democrats Cuomo and de Blasio deplored for weeks the Trump administration’s delay in getting tests to states, which to this day are still not arriving in sufficient numbers.The New York officials also targeted the federal government for dragging its heels in implementing emergency powers to manufacture lifesaving ventilators.With the toll far exceeding the numbers killed on 9/11, Phil Murphy, the governor of neighboring New Jersey, which has also been badly affected, has called for a commission similar to the one set up to investigate the September 11, 2001 attacks.“The warning signs were there... what happened? If you don’t know the answer, how are you going to make sure it’s not going to happen again?” Cuomo asked Friday.Given the number of dead and millions of unemployed, “we have a moral obligation to study this pandemic,” concluded McGinty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-why-have-so-many-died-in-new-york/story-UN9mHjwGI46DMEr82cg6FL.html
11-04-2020||World||If China is a developing nation, make US one, too: Trump hits out at Beijing||If China is considered a developing country, make the United States too a developing one, US President Donald Trump said on Friday, alleging that Beijing has taken advantage of his country.“China has been unbelievably taken advantage of us and other countries. You know, for instance, they are considered a developing nation. I said well then make us a developing nation too,” Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on coronavirus.The president was responding to a question on China. “They get big advantages because they are a developing nation. India, a developing nation. The United States is the big developed nation. Well, we have plenty of development to do,” he said.Reiterating that United States was taken advantage of by the World Trade Organization, Trump said the Chinese economy started booming after it joined WTO with the help of the US.“If you look at the history of China, it was only since they went into the WTO that they became a rocket ship with their economy. They were flatlined for years and years,” he said.“Frankly, for many, many decades. And it was only when they came into the WTO that they became a rocket ship because they took advantage of all -- I’m not even blaming them. I’m saying how stupid were the people that stood here and allowed it to happen,” he said.The Trump Administration will now allow that to happen, he said.“If they don’t treat us fairly, will leave. But now we’re starting to win cases,” he said. Alleging that China has taken advantage of the United States for 30 years, he said, China has taken advantage of the US through WTO and using rules that are unfair to the United States. “They should have never been allowed it, this should have never been allowed to happen”, he added.“When China joined and was allowed to join under those circumstances the WTO, that was a very bad day for the United States because they have rules and regulations that were far different and far easier than our rules and regulations,” he said.“Plus. They took advantage of them down to the last. China took advantage of them like few people would even think to take advantage of them and again they are considered right a developing nation,” he added.The United States, he rued, is not considered a developing nation. “The were given advantages (for being a developing nation). For many years China has ripped off the United States. Then I came along and right now, as you know, China is paying 25 percent,” said Trump, adding that the US is now gaining “billions and billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China”. The US is not paying, he asserted. “Not every country is China but China would devalue their currency and they would also pour out money and they essentially were paying most of those tariffs not us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-china-is-a-developing-nation-make-us-one-too-trump-hits-out-at-beijing/story-Kql2EuhVpPvN0Pu0vQ7sKJ.html
11-04-2020||World||US, China trade blame at UNSC’s first Covid-19 meet||The United States on Thursday called for “complete transparency” in the reporting of coronavirus data at the UN Security Council’s first meeting on the pandemic, in an unmistakable reference to China, which it did not name but has previously accused of concealing the true extent of its outbreak.China hit back calling for the need to oppose “stigmatization” of the crisis and “racial discrimination” in a clear reference to US efforts to pin the epidemic on China, calling it the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus”, which is said to have fueled a spate hate crimes against Asian Americans.The Security Council had been largely missing from action as the coronavirus tore through the world. China, which held the body’s rotating presidency for March, did not allow a debate or a meeting arguing the pandemic was outside the mandate of the Security Council; it was backed by Russia and South Africa.The UNSC finally met Thursday, virtually, at the request of nine of the 10 non-permanent members of the body, but failed to even consider two resolutions that it had expected to take up this week. The UN general assembly passed a resolution last week calling for “intensified international cooperation”.  The UN’s top decision-making clearly remains divided on its mandate and role in dealing with the pandemic that had killed more than 97,000 people worldwide and infected more than 1.6 million, with the United States and China, two of the body’s five permanent members, hit the hardest.“The United States reiterates today the need for complete transparency and the timely sharing of public health data and information within the international community,” said Kelly Craft, the US ambassador to the UN.She added that “accurate, science-based data collection and analysis of the origins, characteristics, and spread of the virus” was the most effective way to tackle the epidemic.While the start of the epidemic in Wuhan, China last December is well documented, its spread around the world has been as a consequence of a combination of factors, with the urgency, or the lack of it, of the response of respective nations playing a key role; how soon they initiated mitigation measures, when they close their borders or shut down travel from affected areas.The Trump administration has been criticized at home for responding late and inadequately, despite the president’s claims to the contrary. And it has been seen to be trying to deflect responsibility by pinning it on China and, lately, the WHO, accusing it of aiding Beijing hide the extent of the outbreak. Trump has he re-evaluating US contribution to the WHO, which is the highest of all at more than $450 million.Trump began calling the virus the “Chinese virus” and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo named it the “Wuhan virus”. Trump has since stopped after he was widely criticized for fanning racial backlash against Asian Americans, who have been subjected to verbal abuse and whose businesses have faced boycott calls. Calling for the international community to “act with solidarity” against the pandemic, Chinese ambassador to the UN Chen Xu, focussed on the Trump administration. “All parties should jointly oppose stigmatization and politicization of public health issue,” he said. “The virus is common enemy for all mankind, which respects no borders and hurts all ethnic groups. Instigating racial discrimination and xenophobia, and creating divisions and confrontations deliberately should be abandoned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-trade-blame-at-unsc-s-first-covid-19-meet/story-msuDWe6FHzildlheUjlfjJ.html
