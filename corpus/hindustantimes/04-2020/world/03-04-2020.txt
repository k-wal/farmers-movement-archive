All have been detained for three months under the Maintenance of Public Order ordinance.A press statement issued by the Pakistan government on Friday stated that it was“well aware of the facts of the judgement issued by the Honorable Sindh High Court in Daniel Pearl case, dated 2nd April 2020.”The statement added: “the Federal Government is concerned about the decision however, as per constitutional scheme of things prosecution in criminal matters is a provincial subject, therefore similar concern has been shared with the Government of Sindh.”It added “With reference to this, the Government of Sindh has decided to file an appeal next week against the said judgement in the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan in order to ensure that the ends of justice are met. Government of Pakistan has asked Government of Sindh to dedicate its best resources in the pursuance of appeal before the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan.”The statement said that the Government of Sindh “has been advised to consult the Attorney General for Pakistan in the matter as well. In the meantime, all the accused in the said case have been arrested and detained under Section 3(1) of the West Pakistan Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 for a period of 3 months pending filing of the appeal in the apex court. Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan reiterates its commitment to follow due process under the laws of the country to bring terrorists to task.”The move comes a day after the Sindh High Court on Thursday overturned the murder conviction of Ahmed Omer Saeed Sheikh and instead found Sheikh guilty of the lesser charge of kidnapping and sentenced him to seven years in prison.Saeed has already spent 18 years in prison on death row. The seven-year sentence was expected to be counted as time served, said Khawaja Naveed, his lawyer.A two-judge bench, headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha, announced the verdict on the appeals filed by the convicts 18 years ago after hearing arguments and examining the record and proceedings of the case.The SHC further dismissed an appeal of the state seeking enhancement of life term of three co-accused.While arguing the case, the lawyers for the appellants, Rai Bashir and Khawaja Naveed Ahmed, had submitted that the prosecution had miserably failed to prove its case against their clients beyond any reasonable doubt and prosecution witnesses were mostly policemen, whose testimonies could not be relied upon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-to-challenge-murder-conviction-overturned-in-daniel-pearl-case/story-w8Mtl2iRSiW47EaFk4cVTP.html

03-04-2020||World||Singapore to close schools, most workplaces with rising Covid-19 cases||Singapore will shutter schools and most workplaces as the city-state unveiled a raft of stricter measures intended as a “circuit breaker” to slow the spread of coronavirus.Most workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors, will close starting on Tuesday, while the city-state will move to full home-based learning in its schools from Wednesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an address to the nation Friday afternoon. The government will also unveil additional stimulus measures to boost the economy early next week.The action comes as confirmed cases of local transmission and unlinked infections in the country have risen in recent weeks. “We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now, to preempt escalating infections,” said Lee.Here are other details of the stricter measures:The government also plans on Monday to announce more support aimed at businesses and households. Singapore delivered a second stimulus package worth S$48 billion ($33.5 billion) last week to fight the outbreak, drawing on national reserves for the first time since the global financial crisis to support an economy heading for recession.“Even if more assistance measures are announced on Monday, they are unlikely to offset the economic ramifications of what is akin to an economic immobilization,” Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore, said in an email. Retail sales plunged 8.6% in February from the same time last year, marking the worst decrease since June and the 13th consecutive decline.‘Very Worrying’ TrendsLee said the spirit of these measures is to get people to minimize physical contact. “If we don’t go out, if we avoid contact with others, then the virus won’t be able to spread. It is as simple as that,” he said.Lawrence Wong, minister for national development who co-chairs a task force to fight the virus, said in a press conference the increase in the number of local and unlinked coronavirus cases are “very, very worrying trends.”The latest set of moves will continue for at least a month, Wong said, adding there’s a chance the government can roll back the measures by the end of the month if the guidelines are upheld. He said the key objective is to reduce the spread of the virus, particularly cutting the number of unlinked cases.“If there’s poor compliance, poor implementation, then we have to be prepared for these measures to continue,” Wong said. “Let’s hunker down and beat the virus together.”Singapore announced Friday a fifth person has died due to complications from the coronavirus. Cases have risen more sharply in March compared to earlier months, and now total more than 1,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-close-schools-most-workplaces-with-rising-covid-19-cases/story-8emP7OAfrZO5UBhIIoSy6K.html
03-04-2020||World||US unemployment rises to 4.4% in March amid coronavirus||The US economy shed 701,000 jobs in March amid the damage inflicted by the coronavirus shutdowns, while the unemployment rate surged to 4.4 percent, the Labor Department reported Friday.That was the worst job loss since March 2009 during the depths of the global financial crisis, and the biggest single-month jump in the jobless rate in more than 45 years, the report said.The leisure and hospitality sectors -- among the first to feel the impact of the travel restrictions -- lost 459,000 jobs, the report said.But notable losses also were recorded in healthcare, retail and businesses services.However, the Labor Department acknowledged it “cannot precisely quantify the effects of the pandemic on the job market in March.”The two surveys that make up the closely-watched government jobs report are taken during the week that includes the 12th of the month, which in March was before the worst of the lockdowns were imposed that closed businesses nationwide.“It is important to keep in mind that the March survey reference periods for both surveys predated many coronavirus-related business and school closures in the second half of the month,” the report said.In fact the Labor Department’s own weekly data on workers who file for unemployment benefits for the first time showed 10 million people lost their jobs in the last two weeks of the month.Even if it underestimates the true job losses, the payroll drop was far larger than economists had forecast, likely because government economists, in an effort to capture the virus impact on the labor market, changed how it classified individuals.The report said they counted workers as unemployed if they were “absent from work due to coronavirus-related business closures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unemployment-rises-to-4-4-in-march-amid-coronavirus/story-ESC11S5MnBPcuEb1C6ZacO.html

Worldwide, the number of cases has topped 1 million, with at least 52,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/volunteer-disinfectant-sprayers-help-wuhan-prepare-for-a-return-to-work/story-Zl5VE3xGFQssLxCBZjvQpJ.html
03-04-2020||World||US Navy fires captain who sought help for coronavirus-stricken ship||The captain of a US Navy aircraft carrier facing a growing outbreak of the coronavirus on his ship was fired Thursday by Navy leaders who said he created a panic by sending his memo pleading for help to too many people.Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said the ship’s commander, Capt. Brett Crozier “demonstrated extremely poor judgment” in the middle of a crisis. He said the captain copied too many people on the memo, which was leaked to a California newspaper and quickly spread to many news outlets.Modly’s decision to remove Crozier as ship commander was immediately condemned by members of the House Armed Services Committee, who called it a “destabilizing move” that will “likely put our service members at greater risk and jeopardize our fleet’s readiness.”Modly told Pentagon reporters during an abruptly called press conference Thursday that Crozier should have gone directly to his immediate commanders, who were already moving to help the ship. And he said Crozier created a panic by suggesting 50 sailors could die.The USS Theodore Roosevelt, with a crew of nearly 5,000, is docked in Guam, and the Navy has said as many as 3,000 will be taken off the ship and quarantined by Friday. More than 100 sailors on the ship have tested positive for the virus, but none are hospitalized at this point.“What it does, it undermines our efforts and the chain of command’s efforts to address this problem and creates a panic and creates the perception that the Navy is not on the job, the government is not on the job, and it’s just not true,” Modly said.He complained that Crozier sent the memo to people outside his chain of command and in a non-secure, unclassified email. And, he said he concluded that the captain’s ability to react professionally was overwhelmed by the virus challenge, “when acting professionally was what was needed most. We do, and we should, expect more from the commanding officers of our aircraft carriers.”Earlier this week, Modly told reporters that Crozier would not be relieved of duty for trying to protect his sailors, but left the door open for punishment if the captain leaked the memo to the press. On Thursday, Modly said he has no information to suggest that Crozier leaked the memo to the press.He said that if Crozier had communicated only with his leadership and not widely distributed the memo, he would likely still have a job. He took sole responsibility for the decision to fire Crozier, and said he got no pressure from the White House to do so.Democrats on the House committee issued a joint statement in support of Crozier. They said that while the captain went outside his chain of command, the pandemic presents a new set of challenges.“Captain Crozier was justifiably concerned about the health and safety of his crew, but he did not handle the immense pressure appropriately,” the lawmakers said. “However, relieving him of his command is an overreaction.”Sen. Jack Reed, top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he told Modly that Navy leaders must make it clear that the decision to fire Crozier doesn’t inhibit others from taking steps to protect their sailors and Marines.And he said the incident “raised critical questions” about the Navy’s strategy to combat the virus across the fleet.Crozier, in his memo, raised warnings the ship was facing a growing outbreak of the coronavirus and asked permission to isolate the bulk of his crew members on shore, an extraordinary move to take a carrier out of duty in an effort to save lives.He said that removing all but 10% of the crew would be a “necessary risk” in order to stop the spread of the virus.“We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset, our sailors,” said Crozier.As of Thursday, the Navy said 31% of the USS Theodore Roosevelt crew have been tested for the virus, and 114 tested positive. The 180 Sailors that tested negative so far will move into Guam hotels for quarantine. As testing continues, the ship will keep enough sailors on board to sustain essential services and sanitize the ship in port.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-fires-captain-who-sought-help-for-coronavirus-stricken-ship/story-naCcrTkOTbo9R4ZRpQ88XN.html

The board of the Washington-based development lender announced the first set of fast-track crisis funding, with an initial $1.9 billion going to projects in 25 countries, and operations moving forward in another 40 nations, the bank said in a statement. “We are working to strengthen developing nations’ ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and shorten the time to economic and social recovery,” said World Bank President David Malpass. “The poorest and most vulnerable countries will likely be hit the hardest, and our teams around the world remain focused on country-level and regional solutions to address the ongoing crisis.” The bank also is working to redeploy USD 1.7 billion of existing funding, including the use of “catastrophic drawdowns,” a type of emergency credit line. India will be the largest beneficiary of the first wave of programs with a facility for USD 1 billion, followed by Pakistan with USD 200 million and Afghanistan with a little over USD 100 million, but funding is going to countries on nearly every continent, the bank said. In addition, the World Bank’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, is providing $8 billion in financing “to help private companies affected by the pandemic and preserve jobs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-bank-to-roll-out-usd-160-billion-emergency-aid-to-help-nations-deal-with-covid-19/story-p99DQT81k6APYihfgQaoCP.html

This has led to a volley of criticism even as the country’s most populous province Ontario will release its modelling data, which its leader has warned will make for a “sobering discussion.” Ontario premier Doug Ford’s statement was stark, as he said, “It will be a real wake-up call. I don’t believe in holding back figures in this crisis. We have to be fully transparent with the people of Ontario, no matter how hard it is.”Also read: Canada to organise 6 flights out of India for its citizens stranded due to Covid-19 lockdownTrudeau promised transparency as the country dealt with the crisis but his government has held back on making its projections public. He said, “There is a range out there, and just highlighting that range is not as useful or important as being able to get clearer numbers and clearer analysis of what we are likely to face.”That lack of information has not gone down well in the country. Don Davies, health critic for the opposition New Democratic Party, underscored this point saying, “We can’t fight this virus blindly. Without access to federal data, Canadians are being left in the dark on the potential duration of physical distancing measures and our health care system’s capacity to respond to the outbreak.” Former Health Minister Jane Philpott tweeted, “This is not the time to hide bad news. This includes real-time updates, open-source data, best/worse case projections - in short, we’d like radical transparency.”Provinces like British Columbia, Ontario and Alberta have either already released relevant data or are expected to do so soon.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-rules-out-nationwide-lockdown-says-not-quite-yet-at-that-point/story-g7GVwkhGbfXKEcbVbojjyH.html
03-04-2020||World||UK health minister back at work after COVID-19 recovery, pledges more tests||The UK’s Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who had been self-isolating after his COVID-19 diagnosis last week, returned to the frontline to address the daily Downing Street briefing on Thursday, during which he set out the government’s strategy to boost testing for the deadly virus. Under a new step-by-step plan, the minister said the government’s new goal is to have 100,000 COVID-19 tests a day by the end of April. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who continues to be in self-isolation after he tested positive for coronavirus last Friday, had posted a video message on Twitter pledging the government would “massively ramp up” testing because that would “unlock the coronavirus puzzle”. During the daily briefing, Hancock also revealed another massive leap in the UK’s death toll, which rose by a further 569 to hit a total of 2,921 -- the second day in a row when the country registered a spike in deaths of over 500 in a single day. “The rate of infection is currently believed to be doubling every three-four days,” said the minister, adding that he was back “redoubled” in his determination to fight this virus. “During the last week we have completed a whole new hospital, the NHS Nightingale Hospital in London, built in nine days. This has been an incredible achievement,” he said. He went on to lay out a point-by-point plan to enhance the testing capabilities to ensure National Health Service (NHS) staff are prioritised for the process in order to be able to carry on their work to fight against the disease. Amid criticism of the UK not having taken the decisive testing steps as neighbouring Germany where the death toll from COVID-19 is much lower, Hancock said the UK had not gone into this crisis with a huge diagnostics industry, as Germany had. He admitted a lack of materials such as swabs and reagents, which is a global challenge. “Our ultimate goal is that anyone who needs a test shall have one,” he said. In what he categorised as a “landmark” move, the minister also announced that more than GBP 13-billion of debt accrued by the NHS will be wiped by the government to enable the health service to respond better to the pandemic and ensure it is better prepared in the long-term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-minister-back-at-work-after-covid-19-recovery-pledges-more-tests/story-6j7cPzhRiiltc6GWtchtWN.html
03-04-2020||World||US sees deadliest day so far||The death toll in the US from the coronavirus pandemic has topped 5,300, while the country witnessed a stunning single-day record of 884 people killed in just 24 hours. The US death toll is lower than those of Italy and Spain but above the 3,318 recorded in China, where the pandemic first emerged in December. The US leads the world in the number of cases, with at least 227,000.And in a sign of the devastating economic impact of the epidemic, a record 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as businesses were forced to shut down as part of the mitigation efforts and layoffs in manufacturing, transportation and other sectors, according to numbers released on Thursday. More people had applied for jobless benefits in the last two week - 3.3 million had filed the week before - than in the six months of the Great Recession, The Washington Post reported.Also, in line with White House experts’ earlier warning that 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die in the epidemic even if mitigation efforts were implemented fully, the Pentagon is reported to be preparing to provide 100,000 body bags for civilian use. US President Donald Trump, who earlier had downplayed the pandemic’s impact on the US, said on Wednesday that “we’re going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now, that are going to be horrific”.As the number of coronavirus cases and fatalities continued to climb, health services across America, especially in areas with high incidence of the illness, have complained of crippling shortages of protective gear for health care workers such as masks, gloves, gowns and face shields. There is an additional urgency to the crisis as the health services brace themselves for a peak in cases and deaths, which is feared in two weeks. The number of confirmed cases in the country increased by about 29,000. New York state remained the worst impacted, with at least 84,000 cases and over 2,220 deaths. New York City accounted for a large number of them with 1,374 at one stage, almost a fourth of all deaths in the country.With NYC’s hospitals under severe pressure, Samaritan Purse, a charity from North Carolina, set up a 68-bed field hospital in Central Park, the city’s hub of major concerts, rallies and other public events. It took in its first patient on Wednesday. “We are here to stand with New Yorkers and meet the needs of people stricken with the coronavirus,” the charity said in a statement.A six-week-old baby girl has died from Covid-19 in the state of Connecticut, governor Ned Lamont said on Thursday, stressing that the death is a reminder that “nobody is safe with this virus”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-deadliest-day-so-far/story-Vxiqwao0SP2d2t5erlLcoJ.html

Sean Conley, Trump’s physician, did not provide any context for the second test. The doctor, however, said the president had been tested by a new rapid-point-of-care test that delivered results in 15 minutes. “The President tested negative for Covid-19,” Conley, said on Thursday in a memorandum to the White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. “This morning, the President was tested again for Covid-19, utilising a new, rapid-point-of-care test capability. He is healthy and without symptoms. Sample collection took just one minute and results were reported back in 15 minutes,” Conley said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  President Trump flashed a copy of his physician’s memorandum to his press secretary during his daily White House news conference. “I did take a test. It just came out, this is from the White House physician,” Trump said at the briefing while holding up the memo. “You may have it, just came out. I just took it this morning. And I took it, it took me literally a minute to take it and it took me - I guess it was 14 or 15 minutes (for results). I went to work, I didn’t wait for it, but it said it took 14 minutes or something with a conclusion and it said the President tested negative for Covid-19,” he was quoted as saying by the US media.Also read: US records 1,169 coronavirus fatalities, new global daily high, says report Trump added that he had taken the test “really out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked, how fast it worked.” “It’s a lot easier. I’ve done them both and the second one is much more pleasant,” he said of his second test. The president previously tested negative for the virus in mid-March after coming into contact with two persons who had tested positive. Trump’s second test comes as more than a million coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide and States across the US continue to hand down strict measures to slow down the spread of the Covid-19. America wrestles with the coronavirus pandemic that the White House has warned could kill up to two lakh people during the next fortnight. A total of 1,002,159 Covid-19 cases have been reported across more than 175 countries and territories with51,485 deaths reported so far, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The US has reported 236,339 Covid-19 cases, the highest in the world, and over 5,000 people have died due to the disease. President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the US was headed for a “very tough two weeks”, advising people to be prepared for the “hard days” ahead. Deborah Bix, a member of White House Task Force on coronavirus, based on a model from actual data from the ground, said the death toll in the US could be between 100,000 to 200,000, with the strict implementation of the existing mitigation measures including social distancing till April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-donald-trump-is-healthy-tests-negative-for-coronavirus-for-a-second-time/story-OkX3NbzeDOAlzTUq6LMrhM.html

We are exploring options with the parliamentary authorities in readiness for parliament’s return.”Hoyle insisted in a letter to Rees-Mogg that MPs should be able to take part in Prime Minister’s questions, oral questions to government departments, to ask urgent questions and to hear statements being made – especially if it is ‘not appropriate’ for them to be present.Several select committee meetings have already been held virtually, which encouraged Hoyle and others to push to expanding technology’s use to cover the main chamber.“Once the House returns, if we are still in the grip of the crisis where the physical presence of Members, or too many Members, in the Palace is not appropriate, I am keen that they should be able to participate in key parliamentary proceedings virtually, for example, oral questions, urgent questions, statements,” Hoyle wrote to Rees-Mogg.“The House Service has already trialled some virtual select committee evidence sessions with witnesses – and I have asked officials to investigate how they would apply similar technology to the types of business listed above.”Hoyle also asked if it would be possible for the Government to set up a forum of MPs during this recess, possibly via select committee chairs, who could quiz senior Government representatives at set times on different days.“MPs are being swamped right now with questions and case work from distressed constituents who need answers. Responses cannot wait for the House to sit again”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-to-have-virtual-parliament-to-question-govt-response/story-mnKSkvikKQptUO2GIsMj2O.html

They’re in big trouble.”A total of 1,243 passengers and 1,247 crew members are stranded at sea on the Zaandam and the Rotterdam, which came to its sister ship’s aid last week, loaded with supplies.About 1,200 passengers who are not ill would be sent home on charter planes. They will be “transported in coaches that will be sanitized, with limited person-to-person contact and while wearing masks,” Holland America said Wednesday.Some 45 people with mild symptoms will remain aboard in isolation until they recover and the “estimated less than 10” people requiring critical care will be taken ashore for treatment locally, the company said.The desperate situation aboard the Zaandam attracted worldwide publicity, but it is just one of several cruise liners seeking permission to dock at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale.The Zaandam, which left Buenos Aires on March 7, was originally meant to finish the trip in Chile on March 21, but changed course due to the virus and was originally scheduled to arrive in Fort Lauderdale on April 7.Four people have died on board, for reasons not yet disclosed.Rick De Pinho, a 53-year-old attorney, and his wife were transferred from the Zaandam to the Rotterdam because so far, they are healthy.“You can’t have these ships floating around. People want to go home,” he told AFP from the ship.lm/sst/jm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-hit-cruise-ship-nears-us-port-awaits-final-approval/story-e3MugjDtcuNRKOY1o22g5K.html
