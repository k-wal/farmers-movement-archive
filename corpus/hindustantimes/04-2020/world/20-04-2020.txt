He denies wrongdoing. Gantz will then take over as premier for another 18 months before Israel heads to a new round of elections.Netanyahu, head of the right-wing Likud party, had squared off against Gantz in three inconclusive elections over the past year, but neither had secured enough support to form a viable governing coalition.As the COVID-19 epidemic intensified following the last election on March 2, calls mounted for them to unite and offer the country a rare period of political calm as it battles an unprecedented health crisis.“I promised the State of Israel a national emergency government that will act to save the lives and livelihoods of Israeli citizens,” Netanyahu tweeted shortly after the deal was announced. Gantz stressed that the deal had prevented “a fourth election.”“We’ll fight coronavirus and we will take care of Israeli citizens,” he tweeted. The deal reportedly includes an agreement to move towards annexation of Jewish settlements and other territory in the occupied West Bank, actions that would defy international law. Extending Israeli sovereignty over those areas had been approved in US President Donald Trump’s controversial Middle East peace plan, condemned by the Palestinians and much of the international community. Judicial appointmentsPresident Reuven Rivlin mandated Gantz to form a government following the most recent vote. But for a third time, he was unable to forge a coalition given the deep divisions within the anti-Netanyahu parliamentary bloc. But in a surprise move, the former army chief was elected speaker last month. He pledged to use that position to seek a deal with Netanyahu, saying the coronavirus pandemic and grinding political deadlock demanded tough compromises. His decision led to the break-up of his centrist Blue and White alliance. Many had speculated that Netanyahu would capitalise on Gantz’s weakened position to take Israel to a fourth election in 18 months.But Monday’s deal averted such a poll.The prime minister was indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in January and some experts had argued he would seek to win a parliamentary majority to push through legislation protecting him from prosecution. A major hold-up in the unity talks was over the appointment of senior justice officials, notably those who will oversee Netanyahu’s trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-s-netanyahu-gantz-agree-emergency-unity-govt/story-mcBXTQockuukupenpLahDK.html
20-04-2020||World||Trump says governors play ‘political game’ with virus tests||President Donald Trump accused Democrats on Monday of playing “a very dangerous political game” by insisting there is a shortage of tests for the coronavirus, and Vice President Mike Pence told governors the federal government is working around-the-clock to help them ramp up testing.The vice president sought to soften the Trump administration’s message with governors amid growing clamor from the states for a national testing strategy to help secure in-demand supplies like testing swabs and chemical reagents. Trump said Sunday that he could use the Defense Production Act to compel one company to manufacture swabs.“When it comes to testing, we’re here to help,” Pence told governors during a videoconference from the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Associated Press obtained audio of the call.Pence said the administration sent an email to officials in each state on Monday detailing current testing capacity by state. But Maryland’s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said much of the unused lab machinery listed for his state by the administration was in federal labs that the state does not have access to. Pence agreed to open up federal labs to help states.Meanwhile, Trump took to Twitter with a more combative tone, complaining that the “radical left” and “Do Nothing Democrats” were playing politics with their complaints about a lack of tests.The president in recent days has repeatedly compared governors’ concerns about a lack of screening capacity to earlier complaints that the states did not have enough ventilators to keep up with the federal government’s projections of individuals who would become hospitalized during the virus outbreak.“Now they scream ....’Testing, Testing, Testing,’ again playing a very dangerous political game,” Trump tweeted. “States, not the Federal Government, should be doing the Testing - But we will work with the Governors and get it done. This is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex Ventilators!”Public health experts say the country needs to dramatically increase its testing infrastructure if it is going to safely roll back restrictions and reopen businesses without risking a major spike in infections that would negate weeks of social distancing and economic strife.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, told ABC’s “Good Morning America” Monday that the country is currently running about 1.5 million to 2 million tests per week. But, “we really need to get up to, at least, you know, maybe two times that, three times that.”Administration officials have insisted that the U.S. currently has enough testing capacity to safely implement “Phase One” of a plan they released last week to begin a slow return to normalcy. And they have argued that states could be running twice as many tests as they are now if only they were using all the equipment they already have access to.“So we really gotta help them to get to it. And that’s what’s being done right now, to try to make the connectivity between what’s unused capacity as well as tests within that capacity to help them,” Fauci said. “We gotta keep going.”Separately, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced Monday that the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have agreed to extend restrictions for nonessential travel across their shared borders for an additional 30 days, one sign of a recognition by the federal government that limitations need to continue for some time.Trump on Sunday complained during his daily coronavirus task force briefing that states were unaware of equipment they already have in hand.“They have a lot of machinery in the states that some aren’t that aware of, but they’re there,” he said.But governors of both partieshave been complaining for weeks now that they can’t ramp up testing without federal assistance, especially when it comes to accessing supplies.“We really need help,” Republican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio said Sunday on NBC’s ”Meet the Press.”Hogan told CNN Sunday.that testing was “probably the number one problem in America, and has been from the beginning of this crisis.”“To try to push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing, and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren’t doing our job, is just absolutely false,” he said. “Every governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests, not only from the federal government, but from every private lab in America and from all across the world.”Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, another Republican, on Friday called on the federal government to take a larger role to stop states from competing against once another for supplies.“It’s a perilous set of circumstances trying to figure out how to make this work, and until we’ve got the testing up to speed — which has got to be part of the federal government stepping in and helping — we’re just not going to be there,” he said.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.In recent days, protesters have taken to the streets in some states, flouting their governors’ stay-at-home orders and social distancing regulations as they demand an end to restrictions.Fauci told ABC that “if you jump the gun and go into a situation where you have a big spike, you’re gonna set yourself back. It’s gonna backfire. That’s the problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-governors-play-political-game-with-virus-tests/story-OUtm6r7AB3yIqVwGpyLPqL.html
20-04-2020||World||WHO insists it sounded virus alarm from the start||The World Health Organization insisted Monday that it sounded the alarm on the novel coronavirus right from the very start and had hidden nothing from Washington about the deadly pandemic.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there were no secrets at the UN agency after facing scathing criticism from Washington, which has accused the organisation of initially downplaying the outbreak in China.“We have been warning from day one that this is a devil that everyone should fight,” Tedros told a virtual briefing in Geneva.The virus, which emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has so far infected more than 2.4 million people globally and killed more than 165,000, with nearly two thirds of the victims in Europe, according to an AFP tally.Tedros said the presence of embedded US government secondees working at the WHO headquarters in Geneva meant there was nothing being concealed from Washington.The WHO said that since January 1 there were 15 staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US national health protection agency, detailed specifically to work with the organisation on its COVID-19 response.“Having CDC staff means there is nothing hidden from the US, from day one. Because these are Americans working with us. It just comes naturally and they tell what they are doing,” said Tedros.“WHO is open. We don’t hide anything. Not only for CDC, them sending messages, or others -- we want all countries to get the same message immediately because that helps countries to prepare well and to prepare quickly.Tedros also urged leaders not to exploit the pandemic for their own political capital.“Don’t use this virus as an opportunity to fight against each other or score political points,” he said.“It’s like playing with fire. It’s the political problem that may fuel further this pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-has-been-warning-from-day-one-about-virus/story-wL8mbBjJpvKA99kvspf1AM.html

I think when you look at the totality of what we are doing it is more significant in scope and scale,” he added.Germany and Switzerland have offered 100% state guarantees on some small business lending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-finance-minister-rishi-sunak-rejects-100-guarantee-for-small-business-loans/story-k3nZWuy48OIDEhpm3U5niN.html

20-04-2020||World||Canada’s worst mass shooting leaves at least 18 dead||Canadians on Monday mourned the shocking rampage that left 18 dead in a rural community in Nova Scotia, after a gunman disguised as a police officer opened fire on people hunkered down in their homes, setting many ablaze in the deadliest mass shooting in the country’s history.Officials said the suspect, identified as 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, was also among the dead in the weekend attack. Police did not provide a motive for the killings.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the gunman killed at least 18 people over a large swath of northern Nova Scotia.“The vast majority of Nova Scotians will have a direct link with one more more of victims. The entire province and country is grieving right now as we come to grips with something that is unimaginable,” Trudeau said.“The pandemic will prevent us from mourning together in person, but a vigil will be held virtually to celebrate the lives of the victims,” Trudeau said, adding it would take place Friday night through a Facebook group.Trudeau asked the media to avoid mentioning the name of the assailant or showing his picture.“Do not give this person the gift of infamy,” he said.Police began advising residents overnight Saturday in the rural town of Portapique, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of Halifax, to lock their doors and stay in their basements. The town, like all of Canada, had been adhering to government advice to remain at home because of the coronavirus pandemic and most of the victims were inside their homes when the attack began.Several bodies were later found inside and outside one home on Portapique Beach Road, the street where the suspect lived, authorities said.Bodies were also found at several other locations within about a 50-kilometer (30-mile) area from the neighborhood where the shootings began late Saturday, and authorities believe the shooter may have targeted his first victims but then began attacking randomly. Several homes in the area were set on fire.At least four white forensic vans were seen Monday morning entering the neighborhood where the shootings began.Authorities said the suspected gunman wore a police uniform at one point and made his car look like a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser.“That fact that this individual had a uniform and a police car at his disposal certainly speaks to it not being a random act,” Mounted Police Chief Superintendent Chris Leather said. He said many of the victims did not know the shooter and authorities believe he acted alone.According to his high school yearbook, Wortman long had a fascination with the Mounties.“Gabe’s future may including being an RCMP officer,” the yearbook profile said.The dead officer was identified as Constable Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two and a 23-year veteran of the force. Another officer was wounded.Also among the dead was school teacher Lisa McCully, who worked at a local elementary school. Nova Scotia Teachers Union President President Paul Wozney said. “Our hearts are broken along with those of her colleagues and students at Debert Elementary,” he said.Two health care workers at local nursing homes were also among those killed, according to Von Canada, a long term health care company, which identified them as Heather O’Brien, a licensed practical nurse, and Kristen Beaton, a continuing care assistant.Wortman, who owned a denture practice in in the city of Dartmouth, near Halifax, lived part time in Portapique, according to residents of the town.Police initially said Wortman had been arrested Sunday at a gas station in Enfield, outside Halifax, but later said he had died. It was not clear how, and they did not provide further details, although one police official said that there was an exchange of gunfire between the suspect and police at one point.Cpl. Lisa Croteau, a spokeswoman with the provincial force, said police received a call about “a person with firearms” late Saturday night, and the investigation “evolved into an active shooting investigation.”Christine Mills, a resident of the area, said it had been a frightening night for the small town, with armed officers patrolling the streets. In the morning, helicopters flew overhead searching for the suspect. “It’s nerve-wracking because you don’t know if somebody has lost their mind and is going to beat in your front door,” she said.Tom Taggart, a lawmaker who represents the Portapique area in the Municipality of Colchester, said the quiet community has been shaken.“This is just an absolutely wonderful, peaceful quiet community and the idea that this could happen in our community is unbelievable,” Taggart said. He said he didn’t know Wortman well, but spoke to him a few times when he phoned about municipal issues and described knowing Wortman’s “lovely big home” on Portapique Beach Road.Wortman is listed as a denturist — a person who makes dentures — in the city of Dartmouth, near Halifax, according to the Denturist Society of Nova Scotia website. Atlantic Denture Clinic, the practice Wortman owned, was closed for the past month because of the coronavirus pandemic.Leather, the police superintendent, said authorities were investigating whether the attack had anything to do with the coronavirus pandemic but no link has been found thus far.Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada. The country overhauled its gun-control laws after gunman Marc Lepine killed 14 women and himself at Montreal’s Ecole Polytechnique college in 1989. Before this weekend’s rampage, that had been the country’s worst mass killing.It is illegal to possess an unregistered handgun or any kind of rapid-fire weapon in Canada. The country also requires training, a personal risk assessment, two references, spousal notification and criminal record checks to purchase a weapon.A van attack two years ago in Toronto left 10 people dead and 16 wounded. The suspect, who drove his van on a busy Toronto sidewalk, said he carried out the attack in retribution for years of sexual rejection and ridicule by women, is awaiting trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-worst-mass-shooting-leaves-at-least-18-dead/story-6cOMTpA7wZ4dAUJQQbfUhL.html
20-04-2020||World||Merkel issues stark warning as Germany begins opening up||Chancellor Angela Merkel urged discipline in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, warning that Germany is not “out of the woods” even as the country took small steps in easing curbs imposed to slow contagion.With small shops opening on Monday for the first time in a month, Merkel said the authorities can only allow such small cautious steps each time to avoid a devastating relapse.“We must not lose sight of the fact that we stand at the beginning of the pandemic and are still a long way from being out of the woods,” she told journalists after chairing a cabinet session on the coronavirus battle.It would be a “crying shame if we were to stumble into a relapse with our eyes wide open,” she added.Merkel and regional state premiers announced the decision to reopen last week -- but were careful to cast it as a cautious first step.From florists to fashion stores, the majority of shops smaller than 800 square metres (8,600 square feet) were allowed to welcome customers again in much of Germany, in a first wave of scaling back lockdown measures introduced last month.But the government is facing increasing pressure from other sectors still facing curbs to move faster and let them get business back on track.Merkel said loosening restrictions too hastily could be counterproductive as the effects of the first steps would only be seen in two weeks.“We must remain vigilant and disciplined,” she stressed.Germany has been largely spared the worst of the coronavirus pandemic that has devastated some of its European neighbours, with deaths well below hard-hit Italy, Spain and France.It currently has 141,672 confirmed coronavirus cases and 4,404 deaths, among the lowest fatality rate in Europe due in part to widespread testing and intensive care capacity.Widespread lockdown measures were rolled out last month in line with many of its neighbours, restricting non-essential outings and closing most shops except for supermarkets and pharmacies.As its closely watched person-to-person infection rate fell below one last week -- meaning each infected person was contaminating less than one person, down from five previously -- Merkel and state leaders decided to ease the lockdown.But each of Germany’s 16 states is taking action at a slightly different pace.In eastern Saxony state, pupils taking final examinations began streaming back to classrooms, two weeks ahead of their peers in other states, where school gates will reopen only from May 4.Masks have however been required on public transport and in shops in the eastern state.In the Saxon city of Leipzig, people waiting to get on trams and buses had their faces covered.Though not yet obligatory, the government “strongly advises” wearing a mask in public.Bavaria on Monday said that it was joining Saxony in requiring face coverings.Manuela Fischer, opening up her clothing store in Leipzig, said she was “incredibly happy” to be welcoming shoppers again.In some states such as the capital Berlin, meanwhile, it will be a few more days before shops reopen.Germany’s Health Minister Jens Spahn declared the virus “under control” last week after the infection rate stabilised.Yet Merkel, who was herself quarantined for two weeks this month before testing negative for the virus, has repeatedly warned that Germany’s success remains “fragile”.Some of her conservative party colleagues echoed her caution.In an interview with Der Spiegel weekly, state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Laschet warned that some coronavirus restrictions could last until 2021.Cultural venues, bars, leisure centres and beauty salons will remain closed for the time being, and large-scale public events such as concerts and football matches have been banned until August 31.With larger shops unable to open, the German Trade Association warned Friday of a possible “distortion of competition”.Germany hopes to combine the lifting of restrictions with even more efficient tracing of the COVID-19 outbreak and the rollout of protective gear.The country of 82 million plans to ramp up testing -- it has already tested around two million people -- and aims to produce around 50 million protective masks per week from August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-issues-stark-warning-as-germany-begins-opening-up/story-msxR4VYpawIg2qLZNtCgkN.html

20-04-2020||World||Donald Trump eyes probe on Covid-19 outbreak origin in China, wants to send a team||President Donald Trump on Sunday said he has wanted to send a team to China to investigate the start of the coronavirus outbreak that had killed more that 40,000 Americans till Monday and shut down the country with increasingly unpopular stay-at-home orders, but without any success yet.“We’re talking to China. We spoke to them a long time ago about going in. We want to go in; we want to see what’s going on,” President Trump told reporters at the daily briefing by the White House task force on the coronavirus outbreak. “And we weren’t exactly invited, I can tell you that.”Trump has escalated calls in recent days for increased scrutiny of China’s version of the start of the outbreak — from a wet market in Wuhan, as China has claimed and maintained — to the true magnitude of its outbreak, which is suspected to be grossly under-reported.There are news reports in US media that the outbreak may have started at a virology lab in Wuhan. There has been no official confirmation of it, or denial. Fox News has reported that US intelligence is investigating this version of the origin of the outbreak and is to give the president a report shortly.US toll of coronavirus fatalities went up by 1,997 to 40,683 Monday morning and the number of confirmed infections by 26,889 to 759,786. New York state accounted for nearly half the deaths as the continuing epicenter of the American outbreak with 18,298; 14,451 in New York city alone.But hospitalization numbers have dropped in the state and other hotspots like New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana and Illinois have shown signs of improvements which has given authorities the confidence to start reopening the country, and lifting stay-at-home orders, that are being protested across the country.Stay-at-home protests took place Sunday in Florida, Colorado, Illinois, Tennessee and Washington, following up similar protest in Maryland, New York, Michigan, California, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah and Virginia. They are demanding the removal of restrictions.Trump has backed them and there is a growing consensus around reopening the country. Most states agree, but insist they must be careful otherwise there could be a resurgence of cases.State governors have sought more testing kits for an enhanced surveillance system before they begin easing restrictions and have sought federal government’s help, triggering a clash with the president, who have maintained it’s for states to ensure they have enough testing kits, and has called for governors to do their bit.“To say that the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren’t doing our job, is just absolutely false,” Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland and chair of the governor’s association, said to CNN Sunday. Trump has not backed out of the ongoing confrontation, but has said he will help them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-eyes-probe-on-covid-19-outbreak-origin-in-china-wants-to-send-a-team/story-bYKuj3OZjiBfYQNizGfdlL.html
20-04-2020||World||UK PM Johnson resists easing lockdown on second wave fears||Boris Johnson is resisting pressure to ease the UK’s coronavirus lockdown too soon, fearing a second wave of the pandemic could hit the country, a person familiar with the matter said.The prime minister, who is yet to return to work after being struck by the virus himself, spoke with colleagues including his deputy, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, late on Friday to express caution, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private.The government is facing calls to lift restrictions on movement that have brought the UK economy to a near halt and triggered a surge in furloughs and welfare applications. On April 16 Raab extended the lockdown for three weeks amid signs the outbreak is near or at its peak, but there is now an open debate in government about how and when to ease.“The big concern is a second peak,” Johnson’s spokesman James Slack said on a call with reporters on Monday. “If you move too quickly, the virus could begin to spread exponentially again.”Slack said Johnson is focusing on his recovery at Chequers, his country residence, and while he is receiving daily updates, he is not doing government work.The government is also under increasing pressure to explain elements of its response, including delays in getting vital equipment and on testing health workers and others for the virus. On Sunday, the government issued a furious defense of Johnson’s handling of the crisis.Furious RebuttalAfter a report in the Financial Times criticizing the procurement of ventilators and a Sunday Times story which suggested Johnson failed to take the virus seriously in its early stages, the government published two separate rebuttals, one 2,900 words long and the other 2,100 words long.“This article contains a series of falsehoods and errors and actively misrepresents the enormous amount of work which was going on in government,” the response to the Sunday Times began. It went on to question several of the assertions in the piece.Since Johnson declared at the end of February that the virus was the government’s top priority, ministers have struggled to deliver on their own targets, with shortages of tests and protective equipment for health workers. By Sunday afternoon, 16,060 people with coronavirus had died in hospitals. The numbers who have died elsewhere, particularly in care homes, are still being counted.UK Reports 5,850 New Coronavirus Cases, 596 DeathsSome parts of the government’s response are still coming. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak will on Monday launch a 1.25 billion-pound ($1.56 billion) support package for companies focused on research. It’s made up of a 500 million-pound loan fund for high-growth companies, where the government will match private investments with loans that convert to equity if they’re not repaid, and 750 million pounds of grants and loans for smaller firms.Five TestsMonday will also mark the moment companies can apply for support paying their staff through the Treasury’s furlough plan. The Resolution Foundation think tank estimated the plan would cover 8 million people. It said it expected almost half of workers in the hospitality and retail sectors will be furloughed.Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, one of those leading the response while Johnson recovers from his Covid-19 infection, said the government will continue to refer to the five tests set out by Raab on April 16 before deciding to lift restrictions. There are signs that the number of deaths is leveling off, but officials say it’s too early to call the peak of the virus.Sunday saw newspaper reports that the government had drawn up a three-stage plan for ending the lockdown that could see schools reopen as soon as May 11. “That is not true, we have not made that decision,” Gove told the BBC.But Gove confirmed the idea of a staged easing of the lockdown when it does come, saying the hospitality industry would be “among the last” to exit. He said that a contact-tracing phone app, which would help Britain resume public life by enabling the government to see who people with the virus might have passed it to, was in beta testing.Too EarlyEngland’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said it was too early to say whether the UK had responded well or badly to the virus compared to other countries, because the final totals of deaths weren’t yet known.She also hinted at frustration with the discussions about personal protective equipment (PPE), calling for a “more adult and more detailed conversation” about the issue. She said there had been unprecedented demand and that supply had nevertheless been maintained.On Monday, Slack said 12 million items of PPE had been delivered yesterday, bringing the total to date to 1 billion items. The government has also put the Royal Air Force on standby to speed up a shipment of supplies from Turkey which has been delayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-resists-easing-lockdown-on-second-wave-fears/story-CUyFXYkpGXgR4o1sHGCtQL.html
20-04-2020||World||New York mayor says lack of coronavirus testing may delay city reopening||April 20 (Reuters) - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday that it could take weeks if not months before the country’s most populous city reopens due to a lack of widespread testing, even as officials elsewhere began rolling back restrictions on daily life.De Blasio, whose city is at the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the United States, said New York needed to be conducting hundreds of thousands of tests a day and to see hospitalizations decline further before reopening the economy.“We could get there but we can’t do it without widespread testing and so far the federal government still can’t get their handle on that,” de Blasio said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” adding that ending social distancing too soon could rekindle the virus.“The federal government, especially, needs to get the memo that this thing ain’t over and if you pretend it’s over it is only going to boomerang back and make it worse.”De Blasio’s warning on testing echoed comments by several governors over the weekend disputing President Donald Trump’s claims that they have enough tests for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.The United States has by far the world’s largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 750,000 infections and over 40,500 deaths, nearly half of them in the state of New York, according to a Reuters tally.Trump’s guidelines to reopen the economy recommend a state record 14 days of declining case numbers before gradually lifting restrictions. Yet the Republican president appeared to encourage protesters who want to reopen sooner with a series of Twitter posts on Friday calling for them to “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia, all run by Democratic governors.An estimated 2,500 people rallied at the Washington state capitol in Olympia to protest Democratic Governor Jay Inslee’s stay-at-home order, one of several protests.Residents in Florida were allowed to return to some beaches after Governor Ron DeSantis approved the relaxing of some restrictions.Charlie Latham, mayor of Jacksonville Beach, said the first weekend the beach there was reopened with limited hours went well, with no arrests for people violating social distancing rules, which included a prohibition of chairs or blankets.“We thought that the public was ready to maintain the social distancing standards and to exercise good judgment. And it’s paid off, it’s paid off really well,” Latham told Fox News. (reporting by Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut and Doina Chiacu in Washington D.C.

20-04-2020||World||Fauci tells protesters no recovery if virus not ‘under control’||Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert on the White House coronavirus task force, pushed back against protesters demonstrating against stay-at-home orders, saying the U.S. economy won’t recover until the virus is “under control.”Fauci said his message to the protesters is that “this is something that is hurting from the standpoint of economics” but that re-opening too soon could cause even more harm. His comments on ABC’s “Good Morning America” contrasted with remarks made by President Donald Trump, who has encouraged the protests.”Unless we get the virus under control, the real recovery economically is not going to happen,” Fauci said. “So what you do if you jump the gun and go into a situation where you have a big spike, you’re going to set yourself back.”Fauci acknowledged it can be “painful” to carefully follow federal guidelines recommending a phased re-opening, but failing to do so is “going to backfire.”Protests have erupted in Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and other states demanding that governors lift strict social distancing policies that have battered the U.S. economy. Some demonstrators have called for Fauci’s firing.Trump has encouraged the protests, tweeting that protesters should “liberate” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia. The president said Sunday he watched footage of the crowded protests, called them “orderly” and said people “were all six feet apart.”“Some have gone too far, some governors have gone too far,” Trump said when asked about his advice to the protesters. “Some of the things that happened are maybe not so appropriate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-tells-protesters-no-recovery-if-virus-not-under-control/story-Al5EDSFRUR2Sz90E1mRvpI.html
20-04-2020||World||White House to hold call with governors on testing supplies||After insisting it was up to governors to ramp up coronavirus testing in their states, the Trump administration is finally acknowledging their pleas for help.Vice President Mike Pence will lead a teleconference with the nation’s governors Monday morning from FEMA headquarters in response to calls for a national testing strategy to help secure in-demand supplies like testing swabs and chemical reagents — a day after Trump announced that he would be using the Defense Production Act to compel one company to manufacture swabs.Pence will “review what more they can do and do together to develop locally tailored testing strategies,” Trump said at a White House news conference Sunday. “We want to help them out.”Officials and health experts say the country needs to dramatically scale its testing infrastructure if it is going to safely roll back restrictions and reopen businesses without risking a major spike in infections that would negate weeks of social distancing and economic strife.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, told ABC’s “Good Morning America” Monday morning that the nation is currently running about 1.5 to 2 million tests per week. But, “we really need to get up to, at least, you know, maybe two times that, three times that.”Administration officials have insisted that the U.S. currently has enough testing capacity to safely implement “Phase One” of a plan they released last week to begin a slow return to normalcy. And they have argued that states could be running twice as many tests as they are now if only they were using all the equipment they already have access to.“So we really gotta help them to get to it. And that’s what’s being done right now, to try to make the connectivity between what’s unused capacity as well as tests within that capacity to help them,” Fauci said. “We gotta keep going. It’s gotta be done together really in a partnership.”Trump on Sunday said the White House would be sending sending governors a list of the large laboratory machines in their state before the call.“They have a lot of machinery in the states that some aren’t that aware of, but they’re there,” he said.But governors on both sides of the aisle have been complaining for weeks now that they can’t ramp up testing without federal assistance, especially when it comes to accessing supplies.“We really need help,” Republican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio said Sunday on NBC’s ”Meet the Press.”Maryland’s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN Sunday.that testing was “probably the number one problem in America, and has been from the beginning of this crisis.”“To try to push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing, and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren’t doing our job, is just absolutely false,” he said. “Every governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests, not only from the federal government, but from every private lab in America and from all across the world.”Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, another Republican, on Friday called on the federal government to take a larger role to stop states from competing against once another for supplies.“It’s a perilous set of circumstances trying to figure out how to make this work, and until we’ve got the testing up to speed — which has got to be part of the federal government stepping in and helping — we’re just not going to be there,” he said.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.In recent days, however, protesters have taken to the streets in some states, flouting their governors’ stay-at-home orders and social distancing regulations as they demand an end to restrictions.Fauci told ABC that, “clearly this is something that is hurting from the standpoint of economics,” but warned that, “unless we get the virus under control, the real recovery economically is not gonna happen.”“So what you do if you jump the gun and go into a situation where you have a big spike, you’re gonna set yourself back,” he said. “It’s gonna backfire. That’s the problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-to-hold-call-with-governors-on-testing-supplies/story-kxUjVp40tKcDXrYngWAS1J.html
20-04-2020||World||‘The more transparent China is on Covid-19, ‘the better for all’: Merkel||German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday urged China to be as transparent as possible about the coronavirus outbreak, as Beijing faces mounting pressure over its management of the crisis. Critics have accused China of downplaying the scale and scope of the outbreak when it first emerged late last year, while conspiracy theories have swirled in the US the virus could have been leaked from a lab. Merkel urged for more information about the early days of the outbreak, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. “I believe the more transparent China is about the origin story of the virus, the better it is for everyone in the world in order to learn from it,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin Monday.Chinese scientists say the virus was likely first transmitted to humans at a wet market where wild animals were sold. Unproven theories that the virus came from a maximum-security virology lab in Wuhan have been raised by US officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who has said an investigation was under way into how the virus “got out into the world”.The Wuhan Institute of Virology has strongly rejected claims it could be the source of the outbreak, calling it “impossible”.Chinese authorities have been accused of initially downplaying the outbreak and last week authorities in Wuhan admitted mistakes in counting their death toll and revised the figure up by 50 percent.French President Emmanuel Macron last week told the Financial Times it would be “naive” to think China had handled the pandemic well, adding: “There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.”In Britain, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said China will face “hard questions” about the coronavirus outbreak, namely “how it came about and how it couldn’t have been stopped earlier”. Australia meanwhile has called for an independent investigation into the global response to the pandemic, including the World Health Organization’s handling of the crisis.Its foreign minister has said the country would “insist” on a review that would probe, in part, China’s response to the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-more-transparent-china-is-on-covid-19-the-better-for-all-merkel/story-aAaB3S5HY04pJDkQ4qc0FJ.html
20-04-2020||World||Russia quarantines thousands of troops after calling off Red Square parade||Russia’s ministry of defence said on Monday it had ordered thousands of troops into a two-week quarantine after a vast Red Square military parade in Moscow they had been rehearsing for was called off because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.Up to 15,000 troops were due to parade alongside military hardware on May 9 to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s World War Two victory, an event the Kremlin hoped would showcase Russia’s military and diplomatic clout.But a sombre President Vladimir Putin was forced to push back the commemorations last week to a later, unspecified date.Putin said the Victory Day events, including the parade he personally oversees from a raised stand every year, were “sacred” to Russians, but that the coronavirus outbreak in Russia meant the event was too risky to hold.TV footage of rehearsals showed thousands of troops marching in lockstep next to one another at a training ground outside Moscow earlier this month. There was no evidence of social distancing and none of them were shown wearing masks.All of the soldiers who took part in the rehearsals in Moscow would be sent back to their permanent garrisons across the country where they would be isolated for a fortnight, the defence ministry’s Zvezda TV channel said on Monday.The ministry did not say if the quarantine was anything more than a precaution and whether any of its soldiers had fallen ill or been put under observation, but that all military vehicles, trains and aircraft used to rebase them would be disinfected.The soldiers had been issued personal protective equipment to be rebased, it said.Russian media reports suggest the virus has in fact spread among those who took part in rehearsals.The head of St Petersburg’s Nakhimov cadet school, who had been rehearsing for the parade, told the Fontanka media outlet on April 16 that he was in hospital with a fever and had been tested for the coronavirus, though his results had not yet come back.Confirmed infections in Russia have risen rapidly this month, despite authorities imposing lockdown restrictions in Moscow and elsewhere.Russia’s Kommersant newspaper last week reported that, as of the end of March, three people in the military had caught the coronavirus and at least 133 people been put under observation.Later that day, the defence ministry said the coronavirus situation was stable and entirely controllable, the RIA news agency reported. On Thursday, however, the ministry said 14 servicemen and a civilian had been diagnosed with the coronavirus at a cadet school in the Siberian region of Tyumen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-quarantines-thousands-of-troops-after-calling-off-red-square-parade/story-usPFaXlT0cP8RdkokgrgdI.html
20-04-2020||World||Brazil President Bolsonaro mixes with crowds again in push to reopen economy||President Jair Bolsonaro escalated his campaign for the reopening of the Brazilian economy after he attended a protest against restrictive measures imposed by state governors to slow the coronavirus’ spread.The Brasilia demonstration on Sunday, similar to others that took place in several Brazilian cities the same day, was organized by his more radical supporters -- some of whom demanded a military intervention in Congress and the Supreme Court, institutions that have mostly sided with the governors.“We don’t want to negotiate anything,” Bolsonaro said in an improvised speech delivered from a flatbed truck, according to videos posted on social media. “We want action for Brazil.”He had previously shared on Twitter a newspaper report about the growing number of Brazilians unable to pay their bills, saying it’s not difficult to guess what comes next if lockdown measures remain in place.The far-right president, worried about the impact of a looming recession in Latin America’s largest economy, has defied medical guidance on social distancing, repeatedly mingling with the population and greeting supporters. He has urged Brazilians to resume work even as deaths from Covid-19, which he has called “just a little flu,” near 2,500. Last week, he fired his health minister after repeatedly clashing with him over the handling of the pandemic.AuthoritarianismWhen leaving his official residence early on Monday, Bolsonaro said that he hopes this is the last week of lockdowns. Meanwhile, health officials say Brazil is probably still weeks away from the peak in Covid-19 cases. The state of Sao Paulo, the epicenter of infections in Brazil, has extended quarantine orders until May 10.Bolsonaro also said Brazil is a democracy, and that he respects the constitution as well as bodies such as Congress and the Supreme Court. “My role is to preserve the people’s liberty without chaos,” he said.Still, his attendance in a demonstration where participants called for the shutdown of democratic institutions caused outrage among political leaders and members of the top court.“The whole world is united against the coronavirus,” Lower House Speaker Rodrigo Maia, one of the main targets of Bolsonaro and his supporters, said in a Twitter post. “In Brazil, we have to fight against the coronavirus and the virus of authoritarianism. It’s a lot of work, but we’ll win.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-president-bolsonaro-mixes-with-crowds-again-in-push-to-reopen-economy/story-GATn7zMC3jeskcy0GfYQxI.html
20-04-2020||World||Coronavirus sent influenza into hiding, but at a cost||At least one victim of the coronavirus pandemic will not be mourned.Influenza, which each year kills hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, all but vanished in Europe last month as coronavirus lockdowns slowed transmission, according to EU data and scientists.The northern hemisphere’s winter flu outbreak normally runs from October until mid-May and in some seasons has claimed lives on the scale of Covid-19, despite the existence of a vaccine.Influenza killed 152,000 people in Europe in the 2017-18 winter. So far, Covid-19 has taken nearly 100,000 lives across the continent, albeit in a shorter period of time.“The flu season ended earlier than usual this year and this is probably due to the measures taken regarding SARS-CoV-2, such as social distancing and mask wearing,” Holger Rabenau, virologist at the Frankfurt University Hospital, told Reuters, using the scientific name of the new coronavirus.Although that is welcome, the dearth of cases could slow progress towards a vaccine for next season’s flu.Laboratories have been overwhelmed with Covid-19 and have had fewer flu samples at their disposal, meaning they “may not have the full picture of the virus circulating in the last part of the season,” said Pasi Penttinen, a senior flu expert at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).Fewer data and delays in processing information could affect the quality of the vaccine for the 2021 winter season in the southern hemisphere, whose composition is usually decided in September based on samples collected at the start of the year.“It might be a problem,” Penttinen told Reuters, as less information on the possible mutations of this year’s virus lowers the chances of assembling the most effective jab against strains expected to be prevalent the following year.The problem is unlikely to affect next winter’s vaccine for the northern hemisphere because its composition was agreed in February, Penttinen said.Decisions over the composition of vaccines are taken early because it takes several months to manufacture the millions of flu jabs needed every year.UNDER-REPORTING?Data on flu-related fatalities are not yet available but early estimates point to much lower mortality this year.Only 4,000 flu patients needed intensive care treatment this season, according to data from 11 European countries, around half the number in the same period of the previous two seasons.Denmark, which went into strict lockdown in early March, saw only a fraction of its usual death toll of around 1,000 people from flu this winter, said Lasse Vestergaard, an infectious diseases expert at Denmark’s Statens Serum Institut.Denmark had 355 Covid-19 deaths as of April 20, according to a Reuters tally.Even without the arrival of coronavirus, this flu season had been mild, with the peak of detected infections reached at the end of January and a steep drop in cases thereafter, according to EU data and experts. By the end of March, after lockdown measures had been in place for a few weeks across Europe, reported influenza outbreaks had all but disappeared.Seasonal flu activity was also lower this season in Japan, possibly due to coronavirus measures such as wearing masks or washing hands more frequently, according to a study published this month by experts at the University of Tokyo and the Japanese centre for disease control.While lockdowns appear to have hampered the transmission of flu, it is unclear whether under-reporting may have also contributed to its apparent early demise. People with milder flu symptoms have mostly steered clear of hospitals during the Covid-19 epidemic, experts say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-sent-influenza-into-hiding-but-at-a-cost/story-wBt3EgBRQthD6oCJ8uRBUP.html
20-04-2020||World||China rejects Australia’s call for probe into virus response||China on Monday rejected Australia’s call for a probe examining the global response to the coronavirus pandemic -- including Beijing’s early handling of the outbreak.Washington and several allies have accused China of failing to adequately respond to the viral disease threat in the weeks after it was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year. US President Donald Trump also cut funding to the World Health Organization after accusing it of mismanaging the crisis and covering up the seriousness of the initial outbreak before it spread around the world and killed more than 165,000 people. But Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the accusations disrespected “the Chinese people’s tremendous efforts and sacrifices” in fighting the contagion. “Any question about China’s transparency in the prevention and control of epidemic situation is not in line with facts,” Geng told a regular press briefing.He was speaking in response to a question about Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, who a day earlier said her country would “insist” on the probe into the response by Beijing and the WHO. Authorities in Wuhan initially tried to cover up the outbreak, punishing doctors who had raised the alarm online in December.There were also questions about China’s recording of COVID-19 infections, as it repeatedly changed its counting criteria at the peak of the outbreak.Chinese scientists have rejected conspiracy theories pushed by some in the US government claiming the virus could have originated at a maximum-security virology lab in Wuhan. But Trump has suggested that China could have been “knowingly responsible” for spreading the infection and could face consequences as a result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rejects-australia-s-call-for-probe-into-virus-response/story-qs4liSWr8USNdxRfhpczlO.html
20-04-2020||World||China’s only Covid-19 high-risk zone is Beijing’s central district||Beijing’s Chaoyang district which houses several embassies and the swanky central business district with malls and skyscrapers is now the only “high risk” Covid-19 zone in the country after a case of cluster infection was discovered last week.Two other medium risk zones in China are two districts in the southern province of Guangzhou and the town of Suifenhe located near the Russian border in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.In all the remaining 2587 districts and counties in China, the risk level has been downgraded to low including in Wuhan, the capital of hard-hit Hubei province and the first epicentre of the pandemic.An area is classified as a high-risk zone when it has more than 50 cumulative confirmed cases and a cluster of outbreaks within 14 days.According to this standard, an imported case confirmed in Chaoyang district on April 14 caused three more infections in the family and became a cluster outbreak.According to 2019 population data, more than 3.47 million people live in the district.Chinese health authority said Monday that it received reports of 12 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland Sunday, of which eight were imported.The other four new cases were domestically transmitted, the national health commission (NHC) said in a daily report.Overall, China has reported 4632 deaths and 82747 confirmed cases.The entire number of imported COVID19 cases is on the decline in China, but the risk of imported cases from land borders gradually increased, causing emergence of local cases linked to such imported ones, which in turn led to cluster epidemic, an NHC official was quoted as saying by the state media.Health authorities in Beijing has identified eight groups that must take nucleic acid tests for Covid-19, including confirmed cases and their close contacts, visitors to fever clinics, patients planning to be hospitalised and inbound travelers from overseas or other regions in China, the city government said on Sunday.The tabloid Global Times reported that the move to designate Chaoyang as a “high-risk zone triggered heavy concern on social media platforms amid viral reports on Monday.“Chaoyang residents expressed worry over the epidemic situation in the district and how the ranking would affect their lives, wondering if they would be asked to undergo a 14-day quarantine if they leave the district,” the report said.Meanwhile, Beijing has reopened 73 major tourist sites, or 30.7 percent of the total in the municipality.It includes parts of the Great Wall of China that could be accessed from the city.“All of them are outdoor landscape resorts as required by the Beijing municipal bureau of culture and tourism in a plan for the reopening of tourist sites. The reopening time of indoor sites is yet to be announced,” official news agency Xinhua reported.The tourist sites that resume operation should receive no more than 30 percent of the maximum real-time number of visitors, and no more than 30 percent of the daily visitor capacity, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chaoyang-china-s-only-covid-19-high-risk-zone-is-beijing-s-central-district/story-mET9FmWxeKzeqcTym01NHP.html
20-04-2020||World||Crops rot as Italian farmers hit by coronavirus, drought||Floriana Fanizza gazes desolately at her celery crop, lost to the coronavirus because it could not be harvested.Italian farmers are being brought to their knees by a six-week lockdown aimed at stopping a deadly epidemic in its tracks. They are also suffering a drought caused by the driest spring in more than half a century.Border blocks, restaurant closures and a lack of seasonal workers mean nearly four out of 10 businesses in the fruit and vegetable sector are struggling, according to Italy’s biggest agricultural union Coldiretti.On the Fanizza family farm in Fasano, a town near the Puglia coast in southern Italy, some pickers, fearful for their health, stayed at home as the country went into shutdown at the start of March.That meant there were not enough hands to harvest the celery and turnip crops, which were ruined. The clock is now ticking on seeding vegetables for harvesting this summer.“To sow properly, we need seven or eight people,” 41-year-old Fanizza says.“We hope we’ll be able to find them, otherwise we will have to reduce production.” Some 350,000 foreigners are usually employed seasonally in Italy’s agriculture sector.The coronavirus crisis means this year there is a shortage of between 250,000 and 270,000, according to the farming ministry.Urgent action needed “Something must be done urgently, as the harvests of strawberries, asparagus, artichokes and greenhouse fruits (such as melons, tomatoes and peppers) are already underway,” Coldiretti said in a note.And others will soon begin, such as cherries, apricots and plums, it said.The production crisis could impact food availability.Italy’s agricultural sector is the third biggest in Europe in terms of overall value -- it was worth 56.6 billion euros ($61.5 billion) in 2019 -- after France (75.4 billion euros) and Germany (57 billion euros).With Romanians alone accounting for 110,000 of the country’s 350,000 foreign seasonal workers, Rome is in talks with Bucharest over “green corridors” to ease movement between the two countries.Minister of Agriculture Teresa Bellanova has also called for mass regularisation of undocumented migrants in Italy in order to get the economy moving again.Many are currently living in shanty towns and are exploited by the mafia and an illegal labour system known as “caporalato”, where intermediaries who bring workers to farmers take a large part of their meagre wages.The proposal, approved by Coldiretti, was slammed by the far-right. Driest spring in 60 yearsThe virus is not the farmers’ only problem. Italy is also experiencing its driest spring in the last 60 years.It has seen just over half its usual rainfall since the beginning of the year, creating a water shortage the size of Lake Como -- the third largest lake in Italy, according to weather experts.“It hasn’t rained for a long time and the land is arid, especially for wheat,” farmer Fanizza says. “The situation is critical, we need to irrigate our fields”.The government has set up a 100 million euro fund to support agricultural businesses.Rome has also forked over 50 million euros to buy food and distribute it to Italy’s poorest, a three-pronged approach aimed at helping the hungry, cutting waste and preventing price drops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crops-rot-as-italian-farmers-hit-by-coronavirus-drought/story-WQzZ9FDTBf8tBWrfg30AlO.html

The hospital was closed several days ago after the first COVID-19 case was confirmed, he said.Regarding the lack of testing kits in Kabul and other provinces, Mayar said: “We will receive 5,000 kits today from the UN,” adding that “more will be bought to solve the problem.”The number of deaths from the COVID-19 disease globally is more than 165,238, and more than 2.4 million have been infected with the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-s-covid-19-cases-climb-to-1-026/story-4POvbrSGYZ90GTroVj1vFI.html
20-04-2020||World||Iran opens up as economic woes trump coronavirus infection fears||Iran on Monday began opening intercity highways and major shopping centers to stimulate its sanctions-choked economy, gambling that it has brought under control its coronavirus outbreak — one of the worst in the world — even as some fear it could lead to a second wave of infections.Stores from high-end malls to the meandering alleyways of Tehran’s historic Grand Bazaar opened their doors, though the government limited their working hours until 6 p.m. Restaurants, gyms and other locations remain closed, however.There are still lingering questions over Iran’s outbreak and the safety of those returning to work. Taxi drivers partitioned their seats from the customers with plastic shields and wore masks, having seen colleagues sickened and killed by the virus and the COVID-19 illness it causes.“We, the taxi drivers, are at the highest risk than anybody else because we are constantly in touch with people,” cab driver Nemat Hassanzadeh said. “Despite that, we have no choice but to work because we cannot afford to sleep at home and not to work with these high prices. ... I am a tenant and need the money to pay the monthly rent and also pay off my car loan.”Iran’s outbreak has killed over 5,000 people in over 80,000 reported cases, though even Iran’s parliament suggests the death toll is nearly double that and overall cases remain vastly underreported. Deaths and new cases continue to be reported.Iran downplayed the crisis for weeks, even as top officials found themselves sick with the virus. The country’s civilian government, led by President Hassan Rouhani, has declined to implement the 24-hour lockdowns seen in other Mideast nations.Authorities have defended their response by pointing to the harsh economic impact such a lockdown would have. Iran already struggles under severe U.S. sanctions blocking the sale of its crude oil abroad, measures imposed after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. That has led to a monthslong period of increasing tensions between the nations — tensions that have persisted through the pandemic.The state-owned polling center ISPA found the virus has hurt the income of 50% of those surveyed, with 42% saying their businesses closed as a result. Of those polled this month, 13.5% said the outbreak left them jobless. The survey interviewed 1,563 people and offered no margin of error.Iran’s economy suffered from over 20% unemployment among its youth and over 40% inflation even before the outbreak.“I only pick passengers with masks. I cannot put my health at risk,” said Ali Qomi, who uses his personal car as a gypsy cab, like many other unemployed Iranians. “We poor people have no way except working to afford the increasing prices of our daily needs.”That need has put drivers at risk. In Tehran, taxi officials say over a dozen cab drivers died from the virus and more than 300 contracted it. But distancing and government decisions have seen more people drive themselves, taking away from the cabbies’ possible fares. Meanwhile, some worry the plastic guard shield they put up may not be enough protection.“I don’t think it will be really that effective but its presence is better than its absence,” said lawyer Mahsa Leilidoost, a recent taxi passenger.Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak in Tehran, warned that re-opening of businesses may spread the infection, Iranian media reported.“The significant point is that more commuting, especially through public transportation, adds to the possibility of contracting” the virus, he said.Mosques and shrines remain closed after earlier being suspected of being a transmission source for the virus. That’s even as the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan is due to begin later this week, based on the sighting of the crescent moon.Rouhani said some sites will likely open May 4, around 10 days into the fasting month. But Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, has already suggested that mass gatherings may be barred throughout Ramadan over the virus.In Saudi Arabia, home to the holiest sites in Islam and ruled by the Sunni Al Saud family, a top council of clerics has called on people in the kingdom to pray at home throughout Ramadan. The council advised Muslims to conduct nightly prayers at home “in order to preserve the lives of people and grow closer to the Almighty God.”Already in Sudan, mosques in the capital, Khartoum, are closed as part of a three-week lockdown over the virus that will extend into Ramadan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-opens-up-as-economic-woes-trump-coronavirus-infection-fears/story-EHPDtCsenmIvpau9evgqHI.html
20-04-2020||World||40,000 and counting: Covid-19 death toll in US tops global numbers||The death toll from the coronavirus disease Covid-19 rose to more than 40,000 in the United States on Sunday, the highest in the world and almost double the number of deaths in the next hardest-hit country Italy.It took the United States 38 days after recording its first fatality on February 29 to reach 10,000 deaths on April 6, but only five more days to reach 20,000 dead, according to news agency Reuters.The United States’ toll increased to 40,000 from 30,000 in four days after including untested but probable Covid-19 deaths reported by New York City. The US toll exceeds that of Italy, which has the second-highest number of deaths at 23,660, according to Johns Hopkins.The United States has by far the world’s largest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, with more than 7,50,000 infections - a number that has doubled in 13 days. New cases on Saturday rose by nearly 29,000.New York has borne the brunt of the virus, which has killed more than 18,000 people in the state, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.The tracker also shows total US caseload of 7,42,442 - nearly four times that of Spain, which has almost 1,96,000 cases.However, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that the outbreak is “on the descent”, adding “it’s no time to get cocky and it’s no time to get arrogant.”The first sign of easing emerged in Europe as Italy, Spain and France reported the smallest increases in fatalities in week. Germany is letting smaller stores, car dealerships, bike shops and bookstores reopen Monday. Still, social restrictions imposed to curb the virus must be eased in phases and don’t spell the end of the epidemic, World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/40-000-and-counting-covid-19-death-toll-in-us-tops-global-numbers/story-Pew4WM7i62LwMOQLRSkmcO.html
20-04-2020||World||UK high court judgement on Mallya extradition appeal today||The high court of England and Wales is due to deliver its judgement on Monday on controversial businessman Vijay Mallya’s appeal against his extradition to India to face charges financial offences worth around Rs 9000 crores.The judgement by Justice Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing will be handed down at 10.30 am UK time by email. The ruling marks an advanced stage in the extradition case that began with Mallya’s arrest in 2017 and hearings in the magistrates court and the high court.Mallya’s appeal was heard over three days in February, when lawyers on both sides sparred over details of the case. The Crown Prosecution Service representing India accused his Kingfisher Airlines of “absolute and outrageous lies” while seeking bank loans, and Mallya’s lawyer alleging “a series of errors” in India’s case.According to Mark Summers of CPS, Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines submitted “absolute and outrageous lies” about projections of profitability and loss while applying to IDBI and SBI for loans in 2009, a proposition disputed by Mallya’s lawyer Claire Montgomery.Summers quoted from emails, witness statements, brand valuations, business case projections and thousands of other documents to reiterate to the judges the government of India’s primary charges of conspiracy and substantive fraud against Mallya.He insisted that chief judge Emma Arbuthnot of the Westminster Magistrates Court was correct in her ruling that there is a prima facie case against Mallya, for which he needs to be extradited to India to face trial.“Profitability of the company was knowingly fudged (in loan applications), wildly untrue and patently dishonest claims were made on projections of the company’s profits and loss. Promises of equity to be infused were liberally made that never came. A honest person would have presented accurate picture to banks”, Summers said.India’s case rests on what has been mentioned as “three chapters of dishonesty” by Mallya—misrepresentations to various banks to acquire loans, the misuse of the loans and his conduct after the banks recalled the loans.Summers cited in this regard issues related to the Kingfisher villa in Goa, the claimed Rs 3000 crore brand value of Kingfisher when a consultancy that had valued it at half that figure was not submitted to banks, an aircraft bought allegedly for Mallya’s personal use, and the “siphoning off” of funds to trusts reportedly controlled by his children.“There is at least a case to answer”, he told the judges, insisting that a reasonable jury at trial could conclude that Mallya and his company indulged in conspiracy, fraud, and used loans for unintended purposes, including part of the loans going to his motor racing team.Summers noted that in extradition cases, British courts are solely required to establish whether the person requested has a prima facie case to answer, not to establish the truth and arrive at a conviction.Montgomery, on the other hand, has insisted that Mallya’s inability to repay bank loans was due to a genuine business failure and the result of wider challenges facing the aviation industry at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-high-court-judgement-on-mallya-extradition-appeal-today/story-oJtuNi9eieXUAIFjmhBLaI.html

They have expertise in this area,” he was quoted as saying.The theory that Covid-19 virus originated in the lab is making rounds for quite some time.US President Donald Trump last week acknowledged Fox News report that the novel coronavirus may have been accidentally leaked by an intern working at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.The Fox News, in an exclusive report, based on unnamed sources has claimed that though the virus is a naturally occurring strain among bats and not a bioweapon, but it was being studied in Wuhan laboratory. The initial transmission of the virus was bat-to-human, the news channel said, adding that the “patient zero” worked at the laboratory. The lab employee was accidentally infected before spreading the disease among the common people outside the lab in Wuhan city.Professor Montagnier was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the identification of AIDS virus, with his colleague professor Françoise Barre-Sinoussi.His fresh claim on coronavirus, however, received criticism from scientists, including his colleagues. “Just in case you don’t know. Dr Montagnier has been rolling downhill incredibly fast in the last few years. From baselessly defending homeopathy to becoming an antivaxxer. Whatever he says, just don’t believe him,” tweeted Juan Carlos Gabaldon.As per a recent Washington Post, two years ago, the US embassy officials in China raised concerns about the insufficient biosafety at the Chinese government’s Wuhan Institute of Virology where deadly viruses and infectious diseases are studied.Though the institute, located quite close to the Wuhan wet market, is China’s first biosafety level IV lab, the US state department had warned in 2018 about “serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory”.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

It’s not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting,” according to a purported copy of the letter shared by Financial Times media reporter Mark Di Stefano on Twitter.But they did not want to be used as “currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion”.“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know -- as well as complete strangers -- have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue,” according to an excerpt published by the Guardian.The newspaper described the letter as an “unprecedented attack on a large part of the media”.Harry and Meghan made a bombshell announcement in January that they wished to withdraw from frontline royal duties and become financially independent.Their departure -- dubbed “Megxit” by the British press -- followed reports Meghan was unhappy with royal life and both of them had complained about media intrusion.The couple’s hostility towards some media oulets spilled over into legal action last year, with Harry suing over alleged voicemail interception and Meghan filing a claim over a private letter to her father appearing in The Mail on Sunday after he shared it with the tabloid.In their message to the editors, the pair said their new policy did not apply to all media and that they would continue to work with journalists around the world.The couple relocated to California last month and have kept a low profile, with even their location unknown amid unconfirmed reports that the pair are living in Malibu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-and-meghan-blacklist-uk-tabloids-over-distorted-stories/story-lXTC8i4Z8AcjdmdlI0cwvN.html
20-04-2020||World||Gunman kills 16 in Canada’s Nova Scotia in mass shooting lasting 12 hours||In one of the most horrifying mass murders in Canadian history, a 51-year-old white male went on a rampage lasting nearly 12 hours, killing 16 people including a police officer in the province of Nova Scotia. The killing spree, which began on Saturday night, ended on Sunday morning when the shooter, identified as Gabriel Wortman, was gunned down by police in an encounter.While no motive has yet been attributed to the killing spree, police do not believe this was a random act as Wortman was dressed in the uniform of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP and, at one point, was believed to be driving a vehicle camouflaged as a police cruiser.RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki said investigators will “have to do a lot of work on finding the motivation, a lot of background, a lot of profiling-type events and a lot of crime scene processing,” according to CBC News.Among those killed by Wortman was a veteran RCMP officer, Constable Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two, who responded to the “active shooter” alert.Wortman’s rampage began at around 11.30 pm at the township of Portapique, and ended 12 hours later at a petrol pump in the town of Enfield, following a chase by the local RCMP with officers firing upon the suspect. Wortman is believed to have owned a denture clinic and properties in Halifax, the capital of the province, and Portapique where the rampage started.In a statement, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau mourned the victims, as he said, “I was saddened to learn about the senseless violence in Nova Scotia, which claimed the lives of multiple people, including one member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.” He added, “Our hearts go out to the people who have lost loved ones, and to the RCMP family mourning a fallen officer.”Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil expressed his anguish over the tragedy calling it “one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province’s history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunman-kills-16-in-canada-s-nova-scotia-in-mass-shooting-lasting-12-hours/story-2qCONT6RDuPcuxvuISUwtL.html
20-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Canada moves to protect companies from takeover by ‘predatory foreign investors’||The Canadian government has introduced emergency measures to protect vulnerable companies from takeover by “predatory foreign investors,” a move similar to the Indian government’s decision to remove the automatic approval route for investments from countries sharing a border with India. Ottawa announced a slew of measures that will “subject certain foreign investments into Canada to enhanced scrutiny” under these “extraordinary circumstances.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed these concerns during his daily media briefing and said his government “will be strengthening our oversight and paying close attention to foreign investment in this country to ensure that there aren’t people taking advantage of this crisis.”As with New Delhi’s decision, no country has been named in the announcement from Ottawa, though there have been fears within the country that Chinese state-owned companies may take advantage of the situation. A statement from Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada appears to underscore this point. In a statement, it noted that some investments by state-owned enterprises “may be motivated by non-commercial imperatives that could harm Canada’s economic or national security interests, a risk that is amplified in the current context.” In this context, it decided that all foreign investments by such companies or by “private investors assessed as being closely tied to or subject to direction from foreign governments” will be subject to the enhanced scrutiny under the Investment Canada Act.The statement added the rationale for these steps: “Many Canadian businesses have recently seen their valuations decline as a result of the pandemic, consistent with patterns in other major economies. These sudden declines in valuations could lead to opportunistic investment behaviour.”The Canadian government will pay “particular attention” to investments to businesses related to public health or involved in the supply of critical goods and services.It said that the government “will ensure that in-bound investment does not introduce new risks to Canada’s economy or national security, including the health and safety of Canadians.”These protectionist measures will remain in place till “the economy recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-canada-moves-to-protect-companies-from-takeover-by-predatory-foreign-investors/story-8hGFKFbpkpTdHbhCjyWAaI.html

20-04-2020||World||New York passes Covid-19 ‘high point’ as Trump, governors feud||New York, the epicenter of America’s coronavirus infections, appeared to have passed the peak of the outbreak on Sunday, as President Donald Trump clashed with state governors over ending lockdowns.The United States has so far recorded more than 746,000 coronavirus cases and 40,000 deaths, far more than any other nation.New York has borne the brunt of the virus, which has killed more than 18,000 people in the state, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.“We are past the high point, and all indications at this point is that we are on the descent,” state governor Andrew Cuomo told a press conference. “Whether or not the descent continues depends on what we do, but right now we’re on the descent.”He added that “it’s no time to get cocky and it’s no time to get arrogant.”New York’s improving data came as the ongoing political battle between Trump and other state governors worsened again, with virus testing rates emerging as the focus.Experts say extensive testing is crucial to a safe reopening of the economy, but some state governors said testing capacity fell far below the levels needed to avoid sparking new outbreaks of the virus.Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News Sunday that every US state had the ability to do enough testing “to move into phase one.”“Phase one” ends stay-at-home restrictions for healthy people, and allows restaurants, cinemas, sporting venues, places of worships and gyms to re-open with physical distancing.But Virginia Governor Ralph Northam pushed back at the Republican administration’s claims that there was enough testing, saying “that’s just delusional.”Gretchen Whitmer, governor of Michigan, said “we could double or even triple the number of tests that we’re executing daily if we had the swabs and reagents.” She called for more federal government help.“I am right on testing. Governors must be able to step up and get the job done,” Trump tweeted.‘Delusional’ With tens of thousands dead the battle lines are being drawn ahead of the November election, and Trump -- who declared himself “a wartime president” during the pandemic -- is seeking to reduce damage to his chances of holding onto office.The anti-lockdown protests in several US cities in recent days attracted support from Trump, who in tweets called to “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia -- all states with Democratic governors -- from stay-at-home orders.“Our president, obviously, has been unable to deliver on tests. Now he has chosen to focus on protests,” Northam told CNN’s “State of the Union.”Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state, also a Democrat, went further still: “To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law... it is dangerous.”The Republican governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, said Trump’s encouragement of protesters who picketed the colonial-era statehouse in Annapolis a day earlier was “not helpful.”“To encourage people to go protest the plan that you just made recommendations on, on Thursday, it just doesn’t make any sense,” Hogan, who chairs the National Governors Association, told CNN.Cuomo announced this week that New York state’s shutdown -- which orders residents to stay at home except to exercise or perform essential business -- has been extended until May 15.In Florida, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis allowed the reopening of some beaches as of this weekend.Although fog shrouded the area around the state’s Jacksonville Beach, those who turned out were “keeping their distance” from each other, Captain Rich Banks of Neptune Beach Ocean Rescue said.“We’ll see what happens when it really gets sunny and hot,” Banks said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-passes-covid-19-high-point-as-trump-governors-feud/story-o1dCT6RFSzdsFAK8wBnp6J.html
20-04-2020||World||Canada shooting suspect disguised himself as cop, made his car look like police cruiser||A man wearing a police uniform went on a shooting rampage as he drove around the Canadian province of Nova Scotia on Sunday, killing 13 people, including a police officer. Officials said the suspected shooter was also dead.Several of the dead were found inside and outside one home in the small, rural town of Portapique, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of Halifax late Saturday. Police began advising residents of the town — already on lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic — to lock their doors and stay in their basements. Several homes in the area were set on fire as well.Police identified the man believed to be the shooter as Gabriel Wortman, 51, who was thought to live part-time in Portapique. Authorities said he disguised himself as a police officer in uniform at one point and made his car look like a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser.Wortman was arrested by the RCMP at a gas station in Enfield, just outside Halifax. Police later announced that he had died.“This is one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province’s history,” said Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil. He said it was an additional “heavy burden” amid efforts to contain the new coronavirus.RCMP spokesman Daniel Brien confirmed that 13 people had been killed as had the shooter. He said he could not rule out that the death toll could still rise. Already, that makes it one of the worst shootings in Canadian history.Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada. The country overhauled its gun-control laws after the country’s worst mass shooting in 1989, when gunman Marc Lepine killed 14 women and himself at Montreal’s Ecole Polytechnique college. It is now illegal to possess an unregistered handgun or any kind of rapid-fire weapon. Canada also requires training, a personal risk assessment, two references, spousal notification and criminal record checks to purchase a weapon.“We believe it to be one person who is responsible for all the killings and that he alone moved across the northern part of the province and committed what appears to be several homicides,” RCMP Chief Superintendent Chris Leather said.Police have not provided a motive for the attack, but Leather said many of the victims did not know the shooter.“That fact that this individual had a uniform and a police car at his disposal certainly speaks to it not being a random act,” Leather said.Leather said they would investigate whether the attack had anything to do with the coronavirus pandemic but no link has been found thus far.The dead officer was identified as Constable Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two and a 23-year veteran of the force. Another officer was also injured.Leather said at point there was an exchange of gunfire between the suspect and police. There were half a dozen police vehicles at the scene of a gas station where the suspect was shot. Yellow police tape surrounded the gas pumps, and a large silver-colored SUV was being investigated.Police said earlier Sunday the suspect was driving a car that looked like a police vehicle and was wearing a police uniform, but later said he was “believed to be driving a small, silver Chevrolet SUV.” They said he is not an RCMP employee or officer.Cpl. Lisa Croteau, a spokeswoman with the provincial force, said police received a call about “a person with firearms” at around 10:30 p.m. Saturday and the investigation “evolved into an active shooting investigation.”“My heart goes out to everyone affected in what is a terrible situation,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.Christine Mills, a resident of the area, said it had been a frightening night for the small town, with armed officers patrolling the streets. In the morning, helicopters flew overhead searching for the suspect. “It’s nerve-wracking because you don’t know if somebody has lost their mind and is going to beat in your front door,” she said.Tom Taggart, a lawmaker who represents the Portapique area in the Municipality of Colchester, said the quiet community has been shaken.“This is just an absolutely wonderful, peaceful quiet community and the idea that this could happen in our community is unbelievable,” Taggart said by phone from his home in nearby Bass River.A Gabriel Wortman is listed as a denturist — a person who makes dentures — in the city of Dartmouth, near Halifax, according to the Denturist Society of Nova Scotia website. A suspect photo issued by the RCMP appears to be of the same person seen in video footage being interviewed about dentures by CTV Atlantic in 2014.Mills also said that Wortman was known locally as someone who divided his time between a residence in Halifax and a residence in Portapique.Taggart said he didn’t know Wortman well, but spoke to him a few times when he telephoned about municipal issues.Taggart described knowing Wortman’s “lovely big home” on Portapique Beach Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-shooting-suspect-disguised-himself-as-cop-made-his-car-look-like-police-cruiser/story-sBGtxgfpvWYSMDs8QKASDJ.html

Signs that the outbreak could eventually be easing prompted Switzerland, Denmark and Finland to begin reopening shops and schools this week.Spain’s fatalities fell to 410 from 565 the previous day. The deaths in the third hardest-hit country in the world after the US and Italy has reached 20,453. “It’s a number that gives us hope,” said health ministry emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon of the daily death toll, which is at its lowest in four weeks.Germany has declared the virus is “under control”, having reported 3,400 deaths, and is beginning the task of lifting some restrictions without triggering a secondary outbreak - with some shops allowed to reopen on Monday, and some children returning to school within weeks.Parts of Italy began emerging from lockdown, too, with residents in Venice seen to be strolling around the quiet canals.France has shown signs of a lockdown bearing fruit. The country reported 395 new deaths, the smallest increase in five days, while the number of hospitalised patients also declined. The British government on Sunday insisted it is not yet safe to ease the lockdown, amid criticism that PM Boris Johnson’s administration didn’t respond quickly enough in the early stages of the outbreak, which may have led to thousands of deaths.The UK reported 596 new deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 16,060. Michael Gove, senior cabinet minister, firmly rejected reports alleging that Johnson did not attend five meetings related to the crisis, and that ministers were slow in responding despite evidence of its seriousness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-100-000-deaths-1-million-cases-in-europe/story-UGi3YtlvYDpgrZOuVgPvOJ.html

Police later announced that he had died.“This is one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province’s history,” said Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil.RCMP spokesman Daniel Brien confirmed that 13 people had been killed as had the shooter. He said he could not rule out that the death toll could still rise. Already, that makes it one of the worst shootings in Canadian history.Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada. The country overhauled its gun-control laws after the its worst mass shooting in 1989, when gunman Marc Lepine killed 14 women and himself at Montreal’s Ecole Polytechnique college. This weekend’s shooting is the deadliest since then. It is now illegal to possess an unregistered handgun or any kind of rapid-fire weapon in Canada. The country also requires training, a personal risk assessment, two references, spousal notification and criminal record checks to purchase a weapon.Police have not provided a motive for the attack, but RCMP Chief Superintendent Chris Leather said many of the victims did not know the shooter.“That fact that this individual had a uniform and a police car at his disposal certainly speaks to it not being a random act,” Leather said. He added that police believe he acted alone.Leather said they would investigate whether the attack had anything to do with the coronavirus pandemic but no link has been found thus far.The dead officer was identified as Constable Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two and a 23-year veteran of the force. Another officer was also injured.Leather said at point there was an exchange of gunfire between the suspect and police. There were half a dozen police vehicles at the scene of a gas station where the suspect was shot. Yellow police tape surrounded the gas pumps, and a large silver-colored SUV was being investigated.Police said earlier Sunday the suspect was driving a car that looked like a police vehicle and was wearing a police uniform, but later said he was “believed to be driving a small, silver Chevrolet SUV.” They said he is not an RCMP employee or officer.Cpl. Lisa Croteau, a spokeswoman with the provincial force, said police received a call about “a person with firearms” at around 10:30 p.m. Saturday and the investigation “evolved into an active shooting investigation.”“My heart goes out to everyone affected in what is a terrible situation,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.Christine Mills, a resident of the area, said it had been a frightening night for the small town, with armed officers patrolling the streets. In the morning, helicopters flew overhead searching for the suspect. “It’s nerve-wracking because you don’t know if somebody has lost their mind and is going to beat in your front door,” she said.Tom Taggart, a lawmaker who represents the Portapique area in the Municipality of Colchester, said the quiet community has been shaken.“This is just an absolutely wonderful, peaceful quiet community and the idea that this could happen in our community is unbelievable,” Taggart said by phone from his home in nearby Bass River.A Gabriel Wortman is listed as a denturist — a person who makes dentures — in the city of Dartmouth, near Halifax, according to the Denturist Society of Nova Scotia website. A suspect photo issued by the RCMP appears to be of the same person seen in video footage being interviewed about dentures by CTV Atlantic in 2014.Mills also said that Wortman was known locally as someone who divided his time between a residence in Halifax and a residence in Portapique.Taggart said he didn’t know Wortman well, but spoke to him a few times when he telephoned about municipal issues.Taggart described knowing Wortman’s “lovely big home” on Portapique Beach Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-10-killed-in-shooting-rampage-in-canada-suspect-dead/story-OvqAEhbizi14IjC2H2REZO.html
20-04-2020||World||Donald Trump warns China of dire consequences||US President Donald Trump on Saturday said China should face “consequences” if it was found to have been “knowingly responsible” for the coronavirus outbreak.“It could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn’t, and the whole world is suffering because of it,” Trump said at a briefing.“If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake,” he said. “But if they were knowingly responsible... then sure there should be consequences.”The US president offered no evidence to back his claim, but some sections of the media and his allies have recently contended that - with giving any proof - the virus escaped a virology laboratory in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak in China.There have been news reports of the lab receiving funding from the US, and American diplomats expressing concerns about safety measures in place at the facility. There have also been reports that US intelligence agencies have launched an investigation into the lab.China has reacted sharply to Trump’s charges. The director of the laboratory in Wuhan has rejected claims that it could be the source of the outbreak, calling it “impossible”. In an interview with state media published on Saturday, Yuan Zhiming, the director of the laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said that “there’s no way this virus came from us”. None of his staff had been infected, he told state-backed media outlet CGTN, adding that the “whole institute is carrying out research in different areas related to the coronavirus”.The origin of the pandemic has been traced to a wet market in Wuhan, where the Covid-19 virus is believed to have been transmitted to humans.Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, displayed a graph at a briefing attended by Trump that showed the death rates of various nations, and China was shown to be at the bottom with the lowest rate. Birx said she included China in the chart to highlight how “unrealistic”its coronavirus numbers are. The US mortality rate is 11.24 per 100,000, which is much higher than China’s reported rate of 0.33.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-warns-china-of-dire-consequences/story-kMtjxCQ1Q2zQIs3ha9AoTL.html
