My sincere thanks on behalf of the UK government to India for approving this important shipment,” Ahmad said.The shipment, set to arrive on a plane by Sunday, will coincide with a series of charter flights laid on by the UK government to ferry thousands of British residents stranded in India’s coronavirus lockdown.“We have been working very closely with the Indian authorities, here at the Indian High Commission in London, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), and at state level in India to put in place all the necessary requirements for British nationals wanting to return to the UK,” Ahmad said.“The sheer logistics of this exercise involves every individual who has registered on to our central database being sent detailed information about booking their seat on the flights as well as local support for them to be able to get to the airports in the particular states, given the lockdown and curfews in place,” he said.The travellers are set to be flown out from Goa, Mumbai, Delhi, Amritsar, Ahmedabad, Thiruvananthapuram via Kochi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Chennai via Bengaluru over the coming week. They will be checked for any symptoms of the novel coronavirus before being allowed to board the charter flights and on landing in the UK, they will be subject to the same self-isolation and social distancing stipulations as other UK-based citizens, the FCO said.An estimated 21,000 British residents are currently in India, of which around 5,000 are set to be repatriated over this weekend and the next week with a total of 19 charter flights confirmed between the different cities of India back to London. Passengers are given a chance to book on to these flights at a standard 600-650 pound rate, with those facing financial difficulties given the opportunity to access an interest-free loan to be paid back over a six-month period.The British High Commission in New Delhi has said that it is prioritising the more vulnerable within the nationals registered on its database wanting to return to the UK. The charter flights announced so far are expected to make “serious inroads” into repatriating the large numbers stranded in India, with an end of April target set for getting the majority back to the UK.In reference to some calls for a possible passenger swap on these flights, for thousands of stranded Indians in the UK to be flown back to India by return journey, the UK government said that is a decision for the Indian authorities – given the ban on international flights in India. The FCO said in the spirit of cooperation it has announced a series of measures to assist the Indians caught up in the crisis in the UK, including an extension to any expiring visas until the end of May and steps to safeguard university accommodation for Indian students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-expects-first-batch-of-3-million-paracetamol-packets-from-india-soon/story-ik9AYCyXGiMyo6cWKSez0H.html
10-04-2020||World||From outbreak to pandemic: The WHO’s coronavirus response||The World Health Organization (WHO), attacked by the United States for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, has published a blow-by-blow account of its actions from the first cases in China at the end of December up until the declaration of a pandemic on March 11.Here are key points of the WHO’s timeline covering the first 100 days of the coronavirus outbreak.- First cases in Wuhan -On December 31, 2019, China reported to the WHO a “cluster” of pneumonia cases “of unknown cause” in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei.Of a total of 44 cases, 11 patients were “severely ill”, the others stable.On January 1, the WHO activated a crisis group, putting the body “on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak”.On January 4, the WHO on social media reported a cluster of pneumonia cases “with no deaths”, in Wuhan. A day later, it published its first “Disease Outbreak News” destined for scientists and public health specialists on the new virus.On January 10, the WHO sent “technical guidance” with advice to all countries on how to detect, test and manage potential cases. Evidence at the time suggested “no or limited human-to-human transmission”, the WHO said.- Outside China -On January 11, China gave the WHO the genetic sequence of Covid-19.On January 13, Thailand reported the first imported case on its territory.On January 14, Maria von Kerkhove, Covid-19 technical lead at the WHO, told a press briefing that there “may have been limited human-to-human transmission”, based on 41 confirmed cases, and that there was the risk of a wider outbreak.On January 20 and 21, WHO experts from China and the western Pacific region went on a brief field visit to Wuhan.On January 22, the WHO mission to China said there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan -- among close contacts such as families or in health care settings -- but that “more investigation is needed to understand the full extent of transmission”.On January 22 and 23, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus convened an emergency committee to assess whether the COVID-19 outbreak constituted a “public health emergency of international concern”.The committee, consisting of independent international experts, was unable to reach a consensus and asked to meet again 10 days later.On January 28, a WHO delegation travelled to Beijing, led by Tedros, who agreed with the Chinese government that an international team of scientists would be dispatched to China.- The road to pandemic -On January 30, the WHO declared Covid-19 to be “a public health emergency of international concern”.Between February 16 and 24, a scientific mission of experts from the US, China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Nigeria, Russia, Singapore and Canada travelled to Wuhan.On February 24, a team of experts from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control travelled to Italy, which became the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak after China.On March 11, the WHO designated Covid-19 as a pandemic.At that time, 90 percent of cases were declared in just four countries, according to the WHO, with 81 countries reporting no cases at all, and 57 countries reporting up to 10 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-outbreak-to-pandemic-the-who-s-coronavirus-response/story-me7rXDePphgAgPJ0kQw0eI.html
10-04-2020||World||New Ebola case in Congo days before outbreak’s expected end||A new case of the Ebola virus has been confirmed in eastern Congo, just three days before the country expected to declare an end to the outbreak, the World Health Organization said Friday.The new case was confirmed in Beni, a community which had been an epicenter of the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.It had been nearly 42 days without a case, and WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the declaration had been planned for Monday. “We have been preparing for and expecting more cases,” he said, reflecting the caution that mixed with optimism in recent days.“I am so sad,” WHO Africa chief Matshidiso Moeti said in a tweet.Health workers in Congo had been awaiting the end of one global public health emergency — Ebola — while bracing for the arrival of another: the coronavirus.“We’ll just have to go for another 42 days,” or the required period of time without a case for the Ebola outbreak to be declared over, said Mike Ryan, the emergencies chief for the WHO.“Maybe that’s our lesson for COVID-19: There is no exit strategy until you’re in control of the situation,” Ryan said. “You must always be ready to start again … never be surprised.”The Ebola outbreak has claimed more than 2,260 lives — second to the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa.The current outbreak declared in August 2018 has occurred in especially challenging conditions amid deadly rebel attacks, community suspicion and some of the world’s weakest infrastructure in remote areas. Some Ebola responders were attacked and killed.“This is a devastating development for the communities in eastern (Congo) who are also under threat from the coronavirus outbreak, in addition to ongoing conflict and displacement,” Kate Moger, a regional vice president with the International Rescue Committee, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-dr-congo-ebola-case-emerges-just-before-epidemic-s-expected-end/story-at0joFaWklEo0xiyALC5RI.html
10-04-2020||World||WHO warns about dangers of premature lifting of Covid-19 restrictions||The World Health Organisation (WHO) warned countries on Friday to be cautious about lifting restrictions introduced to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.The WHO would like to see an easing, but at the same time “lifting restrictions could lead to a deadly resurgence,” Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference.He said there had been a “welcome slowing” of epidemics in some European countries - Italy, Germany, Spain and France - but there had been an “alarming acceleration” in other countries including community transmission in 16 countries of Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-about-dangers-of-premature-lifting-of-covid-19-restrictions/story-8b4nM9orOL57Zeugl5vQEO.html
10-04-2020||World||Singapore witnesses jump in coronavirus cases||Singapore reported almost 200 new coronavirus cases and one death Friday as a country previously seen as a model for tackling the disease battles a fast-moving second wave of infections.The city-state was among the first places to report Covid-19 cases after the virus emerged in China, but kept the outbreak under control with a strict regime of testing and contact-tracing.It has however seen a sharp surge in locally transmitted cases this month, prompting the government to impose tough curbs it had previously resisted, including the closure of most workplaces.On Friday health authorities reported 198 new cases and an additional death, taking the city-state’s total number of infections to 2,108 including seven fatalities. The figure is low by global standards -- the worldwide death toll is approaching 100,000 -- but observers say Singapore’s experience offers a warning to other countries to keep their guard up, even when it appears they have got on top of the crisis.Several places in Asia which kept cases down in the early stages of the outbreak are now facing a second wave as infected citizens return from overseas and local transmissions increase.Massive dormitory complexes housing mostly South Asian workers have emerged as infection hotspots in Singapore, with more than 500 cases so far reported at the sites. Authorities have quarantined several dorms housing tens of thousands of workers, and are moving a large number to other living quarters in a bid to reduce the chances of infection.Speaking Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said: “We are paying close attention to the welfare of the foreign workers. “They came to Singapore to work hard for a living, and provide for their families back home.”sr/axn||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-witnesses-jump-in-coronavirus-cases/story-wwkxuj3oFEG3IvIsAomfhO.html
10-04-2020||World||WHO denies ignoring Taiwan early coronavirus warning||The World Health Organisation on Friday denied having brushed off a Taiwanese warning on human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus soon after its outbreak in China late last year. The US has accused the body of “putting politics first” by ignoring Taiwan’s warning in late December, and thus helping Beijing conceal the pandemic’s gravity. President Donald Trump has threatened to withhold funding for the WHO, which is at the forefront of fighting the pandemic that has infected more than 1.5 million people worldwide since emerging in Wuhan, China. The United States said Thursday it was “deeply disturbed that Taiwan’s information was withheld from the global health community, as reflected in the WHO’s January 14, 2020 statement that there was no indication of human-to-human transmission”.But on Friday the Geneva-based UN body sent AFP an email in which it denied the charges. The WHO said it received an email on December 31 from Taiwanese authorities which mentioned “press reports of cases of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan and that Wuhan authorities believed “it was not SARS”, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome which killed 774 people in 2002 and 2003. “There was no mention in this mail of human-to-human transmission,” the WHO maintained. The UN body said it had asked Taiwanese authorities to show how it “communicated to us” their suspicions about transmission, insisting “we are only aware of this single email which makes no mention of transmission between humans”. “But we have not received a response,” the WHO said. Its boss Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has urged world leaders “not to politicise the virus” has received the backing of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who said it was not the time to criticise an “essential organisation”. Relations between the WHO and Taiwan had been strained even before the pandemic but have deteriorated even further over the past three months. Critics of Tedros have accused the WHO under his leadership of being too close to Beijing and complimentary of China’s response to the coronavirus.Some public health experts say that the WHO had little choice but to cooperate with China to preserve access in Wuhan. China considers Taiwan -- a self-ruling democracy where the mainland’s defeated nationalists fled in 1949 -- to be a province awaiting reunification and has sought to exclude it from all international organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-denies-ignoring-taiwan-early-coronavirus-warning/story-uN5ebrCidDoOyUrXJ3tTUJ.html
10-04-2020||World||UK Covid-19 death toll nears 9,000; PM Boris out of ICU||Prime Minister Boris Johnson was described on Friday as being in “very good spirits” after being moved out of the intensive care unit of the St Thomas’ Hospital, as the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic in the UK neared 9,000.The UK-wide figure released on Friday evening was 8,958. However, the figure relates to those who passed away in hospitals and does not include those in retirement villages, care homes and hospices. There are concerns that the overall figure may be much higher.A Downing Street spokesman said on Friday evening: “The Prime Minister has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery.“He has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received. His thoughts are with those affected by this terrible disease.”Stanley Johnson, the prime minister’s father, expressed relief that his son is out of the ICU and wanted him to rest. His illness had “got the whole country to realise this is a serious event”, he told BBC.The government immediate concern is the prospect of people moving out of homes during the Easter holiday weekend, particularly as the weather is increasing warm and sunny.Health secretary Matt Hancock harped on the core message to people to stay at home at the daily briefing, cautioning that Easter will be a “test of the nation’s resolve. However warm the weather, however tempting the beach or park, we need everyone to stay at home”.“NHS staff are battling day and night to keep desperately sick people breathing and they need you to stay at home.”The police warned those breaking social distancing rules during the warm weekend that they can expect prosecution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-death-toll-crosses-8-000-pm-boris-out-of-icu/story-kkzMlcujyrhWcmSQ1uJuqI.html
10-04-2020||World||South Korea holds parliamentary polls amid Covid-19 pandemic||More than 450 South Koreans quarantined at special facilities for coronavirus patients started casting their ballots Friday, as the country kicked off early voting for next week’s general election. South Korea is among the first countries to hold a parliamentary election during the pandemic, with citizens still asked to maintain social distancing after enduring one of the worst early outbreaks of the virus. Seoul authorities set up polling stations at eight quarantine facilities nationwide -- provided for patients with mild symptoms -- so they can vote without having to leave the premises. At one such facility in the southern city of Gyeongju, patients queued to cast their ballots, spaced at least one metre (three feet) apart and wearing protective masks and disposable plastic coats. They were asked to wear plastic gloves after washing their hands with a sanitiser. Medical staff also voted.Polling station officials donned full-body protective gear, including goggles. Vice health minister Kim Gang-lip said Friday people who were under self-quarantine -- who are banned from leaving home during the early voting period -- would be able to vote on election day Wednesday with special time slots reserved for them. More than 5.3 million Koreans cast their ballots Friday -- the first day of the two-day early voting period -- in a record high early voter turnout, Yonhap news agency reported. South Korea was among the first countries to be hit by the virus outside China, where the coronavirus first emerged, and for a time had the world’s second-largest outbreak before it was largely brought under control through a widespread testing drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-holds-parliamentary-polls-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-uDuX7uJqgEEMREH3gtfxXN.html
10-04-2020||World||Saudi, Russia seek to finalise oil cuts in G20 talks, want US involved||Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies will press Mexico on Friday to join an accord for collective oil production cuts equivalent to 10% of global supplies and will push the United States and other producers to remove a further 5%.The plan for cuts top the agenda for Friday’s video conference of energy ministers from the Group of 20 (G20) major economies, after Moscow, Riyadh and others in the OPEC+ group forged a deal in marathon talks on Thursday, only to have it stumble when Mexico balked at the initiative.Oil prices have plunged to their lowest in two decades as global measures to prevent the coronavirus spreading led to a collapse in demand for crude, at the same time as Moscow and Riyadh’s battle for market share produced a flood of extra oil.U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened OPEC leader Saudi Arabia, which hosts Friday’s call, with punitive steps if it did not fix the oversupply problems, which has hit budgets of oil producing nations and hammered higher-cost U.S. oil production.As OPEC+ sought to finalise its deal on cuts after 10 hours of talks via video link, Trump spoke by phone with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia.“We had a big talk as to oil production and OPEC and making it so that our industry does well and the oil industry does better than its doing right now,” Trump said.Mexico, which has long been in a standoff with Washington over Trump’s plan to build a wall between the two countries, cares less about low oil prices because of its unique hedging programme, which protects it against price falls.The G20 video conference, which will be joined by U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, is due to start at 1200 GMT.Markets were closed on Friday for the extended Easter break in major centres. Brent oil prices closed on Thursday at about $32, half their level at the end of 2019 and finding little support despite the unprecedented cuts outlined by OPEC+. U.S. WTI prices closed below $23 per barrel, a level which drives most of the American oil industry into losses.OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other allies, drew up plans for combined cuts of 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in May and June, with calls by OPEC+ officials for U.S. producers and others to cut a further 5 million bpd.Even if OPEC+ secures agreement on those curbs that will cut the equivalent of 15% of global production, it still leaves the market with a huge overhang of crude as demand has plunged by as much as 30%.PATCHING UP DIFFERENCESOil importing countries could offer some additional support during Friday’s talks by announcing extra purchases of crude for their strategic reserves, International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Thursday.But there is only so much importers can buy when the world’s storage capacity on land and at sea is rapidly filling up.In a statement on Friday, Birol said he hoped the G20 talks would “help restore some much-needed stability to oil markets.”The crisis in the oil market has pushed Russia and Saudi Arabia to patch up differences after their acrimonious OPEC+ meeting in March where a dispute over how best to tackle falling prices led them to scrap their existing pact on production restraint that had helped balance the market for three years.The Kremlin said Thursday’s talks showed the desire to coordinate for “the stabilisation of the global oil trade situation and the mitigation of the negative impact from volatile oil prices on the global economy.”But a final push by OPEC+ to close the deal on Thursday tripped when Mexico refused to sign up to the plan under which it would cut about 400,000 bpd. Mexico said it had proposed a cut of 100,000 bpd.“This whole agreement is hinging on Mexico agreeing to it,” Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told Reuters, adding he hoped it would “see the benefit of this agreement not only for Mexico but for the whole world.The deal envisaged all members reducing output by 23%, with Saudi Arabia and Russia each cutting 2.5 million bpd and Iraq cutting over 1 million bpd. Riyadh and Moscow agreed that their cuts would both be calculated from an October 2018 baseline of 11 million bpd, even though Saudi supplies surged to 12.3 million bpd this April.Under the plans, OPEC+ would ease cuts to 8 million bpd from July to December and relax them further to 6 million bpd between January 2021 and April 2022, OPEC+ documents showed. UBS said the cuts were still not enough because of a rapid decline in demand. It also said the effective cuts will be smaller than the headline number because the baseline used was from October 2018 levels, when overall production was higher.“We still see Brent falling to $20 per barrel or lower in the second quarter of 2020,” UBS said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-saudi-russia-seek-to-finalise-oil-cuts-in-g20-talks-want-us-involved/story-cwfiJzbkslnnhVSyLleVzI.html
10-04-2020||World||What you need to know about the coronavirus right now||Here’s what you need to know about the coronavirus right now:The spread: 100,000 deathsIn all likelihood the Covid-19 illness associated with the new coronavirus will claim its 100,000th death during the next 24 hours. From the report of the first fatality in early January, it took a month to record 1,000 deaths and a further month to hit 10,000. That was just three weeks ago. The death toll now compares with that of London’s Great Plague in the mid-1660s, which killed an estimated 100,000 people, about a third of the city’s population at the time.But it is still far short of the so-called Spanish flu, which began in 1918 and is estimated to have killed more than 20 million people by the time it ended in 1920.A very European compromiseEurope’s finance ministers put the phone down on each other last night having achieved a compromise agreement on half a trillion euros’ worth of support for their coronavirus-battered economies - but left open the question of how to finance recovery in the bloc headed for a steep recession.The controversy over whether - as countries in southern Europe had sought - members of the eurozone could issue joint debt has also been left until another day.Relax? Don’tU.S. state and public health officials are doubling down on their message that Americans must resist the impulse to ease social separation measures at the first glimpse of progress now being seen in the coronavirus battle.Calls for heightened vigilance, countering talk from the Trump administration of reopening the economy next month, came as new evidence emerged that stay-at-home restrictions were working to flatten the arc of infections in New York state, the U.S. epicentre of the pandemic.Virtual EasterThis Easter weekend, chocolate-makers of the world will miss out on what is one of their biggest sales bonanzas of the year. With big family gatherings off limits, friends and relatives are unable to meet and hand over Easter egg treats, and chocolate makers’ online sites are struggling to keep up with demand for deliveries. Easter eggs are on sale in shops but those customers who do venture out have been focused more on stocking up on basics such as pasta and tinned food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-right-now/story-aVGWKzBsoRHxt3SfgKFtgI.html
10-04-2020||World||Spain sees lowest daily toll in 17 days, with 605 deaths||Spain has recorded its lowest daily death toll from the new coronavirus in 17 days, with 605 people dying, the government said on Friday.The update raised the overall number of fatalities to 15,843 in Spain, which has suffered one of the worst outbreaks of Covid-19 in the world, and where the total number of confirmed cases now stands at 157,022.The figures showed the death rate slowing to four percent, down from just under four percent on Thursday in line with a trend which began on March 25 when it stood at over 27 percent. The rate of infection also slowed, with 4,576 new cases over the past 24 hours, while the number of people who recovered from the virus rose to 55,688. Although health chiefs say the pandemic has peaked, they have urged the population to pay strict attention to the ongoing national lockdown which was put in place on March 14 in order to slow the spread of the virus. The restrictions will remain in place until April 25 although the government has made clear it expects to announce another two-week extension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-sees-lowest-daily-toll-in-17-days-with-605-deaths/story-kozx4kCn4d2g1OdOYmINDN.html

The state’s confirmed cases jumped by 10,000 on Thursday to 159,937, of whom 7,000 have died, the BBC reported.The US as a whole has recorded 466,299 cases, the highest in the world and 16,686 deaths. The news of the images have come after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had indicated earlier this week that “temporary burials” might be necessary until the crisis had passed. “Obviously the place we have used historically is Hart Island,” the BBC quoted the Mayor as saying.Stay-at-home orders have in the meantime closed non-essential businesses in 42 states, while drastically slowing the US economy.New data on Thursday showed unemployment claims topped 6 million for the second week in a row, bringing the number of Americans out of work over the last three weeks to 16.8 million.Chicago meanwhile imposed a curfew on liquor sales from 9 p.m. on Thursday to stop the persistent violation of a ban on large gatherings.The measure, due to remain in place until 30 April, comes after health officials this week said black Chicagoans account for half of all the Illinois city’s coronavirus cases and more than 70 per cent of its deaths, despite making up just 30 per cent of the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-new-york-using-mass-graves-amid-covid-19-outbreak-report/story-CfPPh6OBgAqY6dKGCaiUBN.html
10-04-2020||World||Italy eyes lockdown extension to May 3||Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was reportedly ready Friday to extend most measures of Italy’s month-long lockdown until early May in order to avoid a second coronavirus wave.Italy’s main newspapers said Conte will published a decree either Friday or Saturday prohibiting people from taking walks or lounging in parks until May 3.The reported decision followed days of consultations with government scientists and regional leaders.Italy’s death toll from the novel coronavirus has officially reached 18,279 since the end of February, the highest in the world.But daily rises in new infections have slowed dramatically and Italy is gradually approaching a point when the number of people officially suffering from COVID-19 might begin to drop.The Corriere della Serra newspaper said Conte will bow to growing pressure and allow a tiny number of businesses to reopen when the existing restrictions expire on April 13.These reportedly include book and stationery stores as well as lumber companies and factories that make agricultural machinery.The government and scientists reportedly view these as businesses with the least amount of human interaction.It will represent “a small, cautious, symbolic opening,” the Corriere della Serra wrote.“We do not have the conditions to restart thing now,” Conte reportedly told union and business leaders during a private videoconference on Thursday.Only grocery stores and pharmacies have been allowed to operate since a general lockdown began at the peak of the Mediterranean country’s outbreak on March 12.A study released by the Confcooperative small business lobby said the closures have left more half of Italy’s 1.3 million construction workers and over a third of the 11.4 million services sector employees furloughed.Government scientists have also been pushing for the ban on public gatherings to be extended as long as possible as a safety precaution.But Conte was now reportedly ready to let Italians freely leave their houses for the first time time in nearly two months on May 4.“If scientists confirm it, we might begin to relax some measures already by the end of this month,” he told the BBC on Thursday.

10-04-2020||World||Wuhan rent protest shows unrest brewing in China after lockdown||Dozens of small shop owners protested outside one of Wuhan’s biggest shopping malls to demand a cut in rent, in one of the first signs of unrest since authorities lifted a lockdown at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.Sitting down about one meter apart, the shop owners on Friday sat or kneeled outside the Grand Ocean Department Store, wearing masks and holding placards as police monitored. A day earlier they chanted “Exempt rental for a year, or refund the lease” in videos uploaded on the Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo that were quickly censored.“Can’t survive” said a sign held by one woman who rented a stall at Grand Ocean, which also called on the landlord to return the rent and security deposit during the period of the lockdown.The woman said the property developer in charge of the mall, which translates to World City, should exempt rent for them because 99% of protesters are small shop owners and they haven’t had any business since the virus outbreak. Most neighborhoods in the city are still facing string restrictions on movement and there’s little business traffic.Another protester said the government didn’t respond after their protest yesterday, and said the police had assaulted people on Wednesday. None of the protesters Bloomberg spoke with revealed their names due to concern of retribution.A woman who answered the phone at World City said they haven’t restarted work and couldn’t answer questions. A call to Grand Ocean’s general office was not answered.Hubei ClashesWuhan officially emerged on Wednesday from a mass quarantine put in place on Jan. 23. The strict restrictions helped China stem the outbreak of the deadly disease known as Covid-19, but it also led to a deep slump in investment and consumption that pushed the economy into its most dire situation in decades.The demonstration, however small, shows the challenges President Xi Jinping now faces in getting millions of people back to work all while preventing a second wave of infections. Early in the crisis, Xi warned the virus posed a threat to “social stability” in China, and since then he’s seen tensions flare both within the country and with the U.S., its main export market.The protest in Wuhan this week comes after earlier violent clashes on the border of surrounding Hubei province and neighboring Jiangxi province in late March. Scenes captured on videos posted on social media showed Hubei police clashing with officers from Jiangxi who wanted to keep the border closed.China has recently signaled its desire to deal with any signs of dissent harshly. Earlier this week, Chinese authorities placed outspoken property tycoon Ren Zhiqiang under investigation after a copy of an essay widely attributed to him criticizing the government’s virus response was circulated on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-rent-protest-shows-unrest-brewing-in-china-after-lockdown/story-6WT0OeeTX7LhPe4nRveLZN.html
10-04-2020||World||Top oil producers except Mexico agree to output cuts: OPEC||Major oil producers except Mexico agreed to cut output in May and June by 10 million barrels per day, OPEC said Friday, after marathon talks to counter a collapse in prices.The agreement, which reduces production to eight million bpd from July to December, depends on Mexico’s consent for it to take effect, the oil cartel said after a videoconference.The virtual meeting of OPEC countries and their OPEC+ allies including Russia, as well as other key non-members, began just after 1440 GMT on Thursday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIt was seen as the best chance of providing support to prices, which have been wallowing near two-decade lows due to the coronavirus pandemic and a Saudi-Russian price war.Talks dragged on into the small hours of Friday. Bloomberg News reported that the main sticking point was the refusal of Mexico to sign up to its share of cuts under the deal, which would have been 400,000 barrels per day.Mexican Energy Minister Rocio Nahle Garcia tweeted that her country had suggested a cut of 100,000 barrels.Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA said in an earlier statement that Caracas “supports the proposal of Saudi Arabia and Russia to reduce production by around 10 million barrels per day”.xClick here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakUS President Donald Trump had expressed optimism about the prospects for an agreement -- even as the talks appeared to be at an impasse.“I would say they are getting close to a deal. We will soon find out,” Trump told a press briefing at the White House at around 2230 GMT on Thursday.Trump was speaking fresh from a conference call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- both countries being key players in the talks.At the beginning of the meeting, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo warned that the rapid economic damage wrought by the virus meant the industry’s “supply and demand fundamentals are horrifying”.“Our industry is hemorrhaging; no-one has been able to stem the bleeding,” Barkindo said, bemoaning companies already filing for bankruptcy and tens of thousands of jobs that have been lost.Another virtual meeting is scheduled for June 10 “to determine further actions, as needed to balance the market”, OPEC said.“The extraordinary producing-countries meeting is the only hope on the horizon for the market that could prevent a total price collapse,” said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy.Saudi Arabia will on Friday host a separate virtual gathering of energy ministers from the G20 group of major economies in a similar bid to ensure “market stability”.Oil prices have slumped since the beginning of the year as the COVID-19 pandemic sends large parts of the planet into lockdown and brings the global economy to a virtual standstill.Compounding the problem, Riyadh and Moscow have both ramped up output in a bid to hold on to market share and undercut US shale producers.“Saudi Arabia and Russia have been extremely clear that they will cut production if -- and only if -- other major oil producers join in as well,” said SEB oil analyst Bjarne Schieldrop.While the US is not in the OPEC or OPEC+ groups, it is supportive of a reduction in supply in order to stabilise prices and breathe new life into its shale industry.Shale has transformed the nation into the world’s top producer, but the industry cannot sustain its high cost base as prices collapse.Yet the US oil sector appears reluctant to trim production, having extracted a near-record 13 million barrels per day in the final week of March. This fell to 12.4 million bpd last week.At the same time, the global supply glut -- already weighing on oil markets before the new coronavirus crisis -- has stretched oil storage capacity to its limits, forcing many producers to scale back output.In his opening statement to the meeting carried by the Rossiya 24 channel, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak welcomed the presence of several nations outside the OPEC+ alliance, namely Canada, Norway, Argentina, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Chad, Ecuador and Trinidad and Tobago.The International Energy Agency warned Monday that the world is set for its first annual decline in oil consumption in more than a decade because of the pandemic.The outbreak has shut down large swathes of the global economy, including key sectors such as air travel, manufacturing and retail.The global oil glut could reach 25 million bpd in April, according to Rystad Energy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-oil-producers-except-mexico-agree-to-output-cuts-opec/story-AF3VlLUQSU4iuBA1tqzHsN.html
10-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: Saudi-led ceasefire in Yemen begins, lifting hopes for peace||A nationwide ceasefire in response to the global coronavirus outbreak went into effect in Yemen on Thursday, raising hope for an end to the five-year-old war that has pushed millions to the brink of famine.A Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen’s Houthi movement said it would halt military operations from 0900 GMT for two weeks in support of United Nations efforts to end the conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people.The Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which controls the capital Sanaa and most big urban centres, has yet to announce whether it will follow suit in what would be the first major breakthrough in peace efforts since late 2018.The coalition said its move is intended to facilitate talks sponsored by U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths for a permanent truce, motivated in part to avoid a potential outbreak of the new coronavirus, though no cases have been reported in Yemen.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a statement said Washington welcomed the ceasefire announcement and urged Houthis to respond in kind to the coalition’s initiative. He called on all parties to cooperate with Griffiths’ efforts for talks.In a statement, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the Saudi-backed government and the Houthis to engage “in good faith and without preconditions” in the talks to agree a nationwide truce mechanism, humanitarian and economic confidence-building steps and a resumption of negotiations on a political settlement.“We are tired of the war,” said 49-year-old Abd al-Basset Muhammad, who owns a juice shop in the southern port of Aden, interim seat of the Saudi-backed government. “If the war hasn’t already killed you, you are dying of hunger or disease.” The conflict, widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been in military stalemate for years. Riyadh last year took over most of the costly and unpopular military campaign after coalition partner the United Arab Emirates significantly scaled down its presence.Some Saudis and Yemenis residing in the kingdom, where cities have been targeted by Houthi missiles, welcomed the news.“A lot of money was spent on the war. If there was no war, that money would be spent on education,” Saudi national Ammar Khaled told Reuters outside a supermarket in the capital Riyadh.A Houthi official said on Wednesday the group had sent the United Nations a proposal calling for an end to the war and what it describes as a coalition blockade. The coalition, which patrols the coast and controls airspace, denies imposing a blockade and says it aims to halt import of weapons.In the Yemeni capital, some remained sceptical. Engineer Abdulrahman al-Qadi said he saw no point in only a two-week ceasefire. Ahmed al-Nuwaira, a member of Sanaa’s parliament, agreed: “Let them (the coalition) open the airports, (humanitarian) corridors and ports,” he said. CORONAVIRUS FEARSThe United Nations and Western allies have pointed to the threat of the coronavirus to push the combatants to restart talks to end the war, which has shattered Yemen’s health system.The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, Lise Grande, told Reuters at least half of Yemen’s population was in a “very degraded health status” while three quarters require some form of humanitarian assistance or protection.“There aren’t sufficient supplies, capabilities, facilities. If the virus spreads the impact will be catastrophic,” she said. The warring parties last held U.N.-sponsored political negotiations in Sweden in 2018. They agreed a peace deal for the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, but this has yet to be fully implemented because of deep mistrust on all sides.Yemen witnessed a lull in hostilities after Saudi Arabia and the Houthis began back-channel talks late last year. But there has been a recent increase in attacks, including Houthi missile launches at Saudi cities and retaliatory coalition air strikes.“We cannot control a global pandemic amongst bombs and airstrikes,” said Tamuna Sabedze, International Rescue Committee’s Yemen country director.Two weeks was not enough time to prepare for any coronavirus outbreak, she said. The Houthis ousted the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi from power in Sanaa in late 2014, prompting the coalition to intervene in March 2015 to restore him. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.

10-04-2020||World||‘We can get creative’: Pope guides locked-down world through virtual Easter||Church doors will be shut and the Vatican sealed off when Pope Francis leads 1.3 billion Catholics in Easter Sunday celebrations held under a worldwide coronavirus lockdown.Fear and confusion in the face of a disease whose toll has unrelentingly climbed towards 100,000 are reshaping society and transforming the way religion is observed.Even such hallowed traditions as the pope’s messages to the faithful on Saint Peter’s Square are being replaced by livestreamed prayers that Francis reluctantly records from the seclusion of his private library.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Vatican has been closed to visitors for a month and the 83-year-old pontiff -- beloved for breaking stuffy customs and mingling with the people -- has complained of feeling “caged”.“We have to respond to our confinement with all our creativity,” Francis said in an interview published by several Catholic newspapers this week.“We can either get depressed and alienated... or we can get creative.” RELIGIOUS IMPROVISATIONThe pope’s virtual prayers are just the starkest example of religious improvisation in the age of social distancing and confinement.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakOthers abound worldwide -- from the Archbishop of Panama blessing his tiny Central American nation from the air in a helicopter to the faithful in Spain blasting religious music from their balconies during Holy Week.The scale of the unfolding tragedy has seen a New York City cathedral replace rows of wooden seats with hospital beds in case of overcrowding in surrounding emergency wards.The powerful Catholic Church in the Philippines is urging the faithful not to kiss the cross and its Orthodox counterpart in Greece is planning to hold mass behind closed doors for its Easter on April 19.“Seven out of 10 Greeks enjoy roasting lamb for Easter,” Greek meat trader Angelos Asteriou told AFP in Paris.“That’s not happening this year.”Jews across the world did their best by using Zoom or other video conferencing apps to “seder-in-place” when the eight-day Passover holiday kicked off on Wednesday evening.Westminster Abbey in London is following the technological trend by releasing Easter podcasts for the faithful of the Anglican Church.Prince Charles -- the heir to the British throne who was briefly quarantined last month after testing positive for the virus -- recorded a reading of the Gospel for Easter Sunday.And priests at France’s Roman Catholic shrine in the southwestern town of Lourdes began relaying nine consecutive days of prayers on Sunday by Facebook Live and YouTube.“Since the pilgrims can no longer come to us, we invite ourselves into their homes,” Sanctuary of Lourdes rector Olivier Ribadeau Dumas said.‘SAINTS NEXT DOOR’The pope himself previously observed Holy Thursday service marking Christ’s last supper -- most famously depicted by Leonardo da Vinci in a mural housed in Milan -- by washing the feet of 12 inmates on the outskirts of Rome.The virus has now made this impossible.Francis instead said a prayer for the dozens of priests and health workers who have died across Italy while attending to the sick since the outbreak began in the Mediterranean country’s north in February.“They are the saints next door, the priests who gave their lives by serving,” Francis said.The Argentine-born pontiff has reportedly been tested twice for COVID-19 since coming down with a cold at the end of February.He has enjoyed a life of good health despite losing part of a lung as a young man and suffering from sciatica -- a nerve condition that causes pain in his hip.Francis told the Catholic newspapers that people across the world can try to spiritually escape their confinement through introspection.“So: to be in lockdown, but yearning, with that memory that yearns and begets hope,” the pope said.“This is what will help us escape our confinement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-can-get-creative-pope-guides-locked-down-world-through-virtual-easter/story-4hxWduAoQ4HlLQHnnGXFMP.html
10-04-2020||World||Saudi, Russia outline record oil cut under US pressure as demand crashes||OPEC, Russia and other allies outlined plans on Thursday to cut their oil output by more than a fifth and said they expected the United States and other producers to join in their effort to prop up prices hammered by the coronavirus crisis.But the group, known as OPEC+, said a final agreement was dependent on Mexico signing up to the pact after it balked at the production cuts it was asked to make. Discussions among top global energy ministers will resume on Friday.The planned output curbs by OPEC+ amount to 10 million barrels per day (bpd) or 10% of global supplies, with another 5 million bpd expected to come from other nations to help deal with the deepest oil crisis in decades.Global fuel demand has plunged by around 30 million bpd, or 30% of global supplies, as steps to fight the virus have grounded planes, cut vehicle usage and curbed economic activity.An unprecedented 15 million bpd cut still won’t remove enough crude to stop the world’s storage facilities quickly filling up. And far from signalling any readiness to offer support, US President Donald Trump has threatened Saudi Arabia if it did not fix the oil market’s problem of oversupply.Trump, who has said US output was already falling due to low prices, warned Riyadh it could face sanctions and tariffs on its oil if it did not cut enough to help the US oil industry, whose higher costs have left it struggling with low prices.A White House aide said Trump held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia about the talks, after a US official said the OPEC+ move towards cuts sent an “important signal” to the market.Officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have said the scale of the crisis required involvement of all producers.“We are expecting other producers outside the OPEC+ club to join the measures, which might happen tomorrow during G20,” the head of Russia’s wealth fund and one of Moscow’s top oil negotiators, Kirill Dmitriev, told Reuters.Thursday’s OPEC+ talks will be followed by a call on Friday between energy ministers from the Group of 20 (G20) major economies, hosted by Saudi Arabia.OPEC and Russian sources said they expected other producers to add 5 million bpd to cuts, although an OPEC+ statement on Thursday made no mention of any such condition.Brent oil prices, which hit an 18-year low last month, were trading around $32 a barrel on Thursday, half their level at the end of 2019.US DILEMMAOPEC+ would cut output by 10 million bpd in May to June, OPEC+ documents showed. All members would reduce output by 23%, with Saudi Arabia and Russia each cutting 2.5 million bpd and Iraq cutting over 1 million bpd.Under the plans, OPEC+ would then ease cuts to 8 million bpd from July to December and relax them further to 6 million bpd from January 2021 to April 2022, the documents showed.The United States, whose output has surged to surpass Saudi and Russian production, was invited to Thursday’s OPEC+ talks but it was not clear if it had joined the video conference. Brazil, Norway and Canada were also invited.US officials have already said US output would fall naturally over two years but have not committed to any cuts.In a sign OPEC+ was struggling to win broader support, Canada’s main oil province of Alberta said output had already dropped and that it had not been asked by OPEC for more cuts. The province said it backed a US idea for tariffs on imported crude.Before the talks, Moscow and Riyadh had been at odds over what level of production to use to calculate reductions, after Saudi Arabia hiked its supply in April to a record 12.3 million bpd, up from below 10 million bpd in March. Russian output, meanwhile, has been running about 11.3 million bpd.The two nations fell out during an acrimonious meeting in Vienna in March, when a previous production deal collapsed.The two sides agreed on Thursday that cuts would be made from an 11 million bpd baseline for both countries, OPEC+ documents showed.“We have managed to overcome differences. It will be a very important deal. It will allow the oil market to start on a path to recovery,” said Dmitriev, who last month was the first official to propose a deal involving members other than OPEC+.Several US states could order private companies to limit production under rarely used powers. The oil regulator in Texas, the largest producer among US states with output of about 5 million bpd, meets on April 14 to discuss possible curbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-russia-outline-record-oil-cut-under-us-pressure-as-demand-crashes/story-o7wl31WA0TXW5mA9u11rxH.html

The existence of this document, which has been distributed in Canada by the First Responder Terrorism Awareness Program of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP, was first reported by the Canadian outlet Global News.Meanwhile, Canada’s PM Justin Trudeau came out of self-isolation after 25 days and chaired a cabinet meeting. He warned that the government is unable to predict when the pandemic will peak in the country.

10-04-2020||World||At UNSC meet, the US spotlights origin of Covid-19 in swipe at Beijing||At the UN Security Council’s virtual meeting on the coronavirus pandemic late on Thursday, the United States called for “science-based data collection and analysis of the origins, characteristics and spread of the virus”.“We cannot stress enough how important these methods are,” Ambassador Kelly Kraft told the security council at its first closed-door meeting to discuss the pandemic that has killed 90,000 and infected 1.5 million people across 200 countries.Ambassador Kelly Craft’s reference on the origin of the virus echoes a point that US President Donald Trump and his administration has frequently made, variously labelling the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen the “Chinese Virus” to underscore that it was spotted in the Chinese city of Wuhan and message that Beijing should have acted faster to warn the world.China has blocked the pandemic from being discussed by the UN Security Council for all of March when it held the UNSC president’s post, arguing that the pandemic was not within its mandate.Washington, on the other hand, insisted that any council action refer to the origins of the virus, much to the annoyance of China. US President Trump had set the tone for his administration’s stand at Thursday’s council meeting this week when he put the World Health Organisation on notice, calling it “China centric” and giving the US bad advice.“The United States reiterates today the need for complete transparency and the timely sharing of public health data and information within the international community. The most effective way to contain this pandemic is through accurate, science-based data collection and analysis of the origins, characteristics, and spread of the virus,” Ambassador Kelly Craft said early in her remarks on the disease.China’s UN Ambassador Zhang Jun, according to news agency Reuters, told the Security Council that it should reject any acts of stigmatization and politicisation. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who briefed the council about the pandemic, described it as the “gravest test” since the UN was founded 75 years ago.The secretary-general reiterated that the United Nations faces “its gravest test” since the organization was founded 75 years ago from the pandemic and concluded saying: “This is the fight of a generation — and the raison d’être of (the reason for) the United Nations itself.”The council had met on Thursday at the request of nine of the elected members. After the meeting the council issued a short statement, agreed by consensus, which expressed support for Guterres’ efforts concerning “the potential impact of Covid-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-unsc-meet-the-us-spotlights-origin-of-covid-19-in-swipe-at-beijing/story-SFObtDYas43W5XKZbm7vKK.html

Trouble is, there’s no master plan.The juggling act for policy makers will be to reopen without triggering a second wave of infections. History serves as a warning. The 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic hit in three waves before finally being contained.Wuhan, the original epicentre of the outbreak, provides a test case after China lifted its quarantine. Austria, Denmark and Norway are on course to open up.Even Italy, which has the highest death toll from the disease, has been weighing its exit strategy after a moderating trend in infections. And in the US, Donald Trump is talking about getting people back to work.As leaders prepare to tackle phase two of the pandemic - the gradual reopening of the world’s shattered economy - the stakes could scarcely be higher. With planes grounded, supply chains ruptured and factories idled, the $90 trillion global economy is enduring one of its worst shocks since the Great Depression.Unfortunately, there’s no off-the-shelf plan for governments to decide when to rev up the economic engines.“We have to reopen somehow. We can’t go in shutdown mode for 20 months,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy and professor at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “If we shut down like Wuhan, we destroy society as we know it. If we allow the virus to run willy nilly, we will destroy our health-care system and the economy with it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-and-the-90tn-question-how-to-get-people-to-return-to-work/story-cDEldqlzc5mUseCLh9sexH.html

The same scenario would see the number of people living below the $5.50 a day threshold rise by 548 million people to nearly 4 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-crisis-could-plunge-half-a-billion-people-into-poverty-report/story-uadI8xt36ETreUEGEHTEFI.html

Spain reported 446 new deaths and Italy confirmed 610 new fatalities as the two countries continue to bear the brunt. In Italy, which is now planning to extend its lockdown until May 3, about 100 doctors have died since the pandemic reached the country in February.The pandemic is marching into areas previously only lightly affected: in Africa, Ethiopia declared a state of emergency and Liberia said it was locking down its capital Monrovia.Its deadly tentacles also crept deep into the Amazon rainforest, with the first case detected among the Yanomami, an indigenous people isolated from the world until the mid-20th century and vulnerable to disease.Also on Thursday, the US accused the World Health Organization (WHO) of putting politics first by ignoring Taiwanese warnings over China’s coronavirus outbreak, laying out its case against the UN body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-cases-hit-1-5-million-deaths-near-100k/story-Iv3hxKWNv5fHIwy6HbksPP.html

In January, the IMF projected global growth of 3.3 percent this year and 3.4 percent in 2021. But that was a different world.Also read: India sets up 1,200 Covid-19 containment zones; Maharashtra tops this listThe US economy has purged 17 million jobs since mid-March, with the latest weekly data issued Thursday showing 6.6 million workers filed for unemployment benefits, and economists projecting a double-digit jobless rate this month.The World Bank said Thursday the pandemic might cause the first recession in Africa in 25 years.Researchers at the Institute for International Finance (IIF), a global banking association, expect a 2.8 percent plunge in global GDP, compared to a decline of 2.1 percent in 2009 during the global financial crisis. That is a sharp reversal from October, when the IIF predicted 2.6 percent growth.Recovery depends on decisive actions now, Georgieva said. The IMF has $1 trillion in lending capacity and is responding to unprecedented calls from 90 countries for emergency financing.Send more lifelinesCountries already have taken steps worth a combined $8 trillion, but Georgieva urged governments to do more.“Lifelines for households and businesses are imperative” to “avoid a scarring of the economy that would make the recovery so much more difficult.”The IMF board approved a doubling of emergency lending facilities that will provide about $100 billion, and is moving ahead with debt relief for the poorest countries and also help for countries with unsustainable debt levels.“The bleak outlook applies to advanced and developing economies alike. This crisis knows no boundaries. Everybody hurts,” Georgieva said.Also read: Coronavirus may not go away in warmer weather, says US reportShe noted that about $100 billion in investments already had fled emerging markets -- more than three times the capital exodus seen in the 2008 global financial crisis.US officials have scrambled to apply a tourniquet to stem the bleeding of jobs in the world’s largest economy and keep the financial system from freezing up.

10-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: New York reports record 824 Covid-19 deaths in 24 hours despite flattening curve||New York City reported a record 824 deaths from the coronavirus in 24 hours, a grim reminder that despite flattening infection curves and lower hospital admissions, the health crisis in the largest US city is far from over.Statewide, the fatality rate has worsened by the day. New York reported 799 new deaths on Thursday, on top of about 1,500 in the prior two days. Total coronavirus deaths in the state now exceed 7,000.The city and state take snapshots of the virus’s effects at different times of day, which may partly account for why the city reported more deaths than the state did. A spokesman for the governor, Rich Azzopardi, said the city and state were working to come up with a unified reporting system to eliminate their discrepancies.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The latest spike in deaths, which lag as an indicator of the virus’s spread, comes as the rate of hospitalizations in the city and state is dropping sharply.At his daily virus briefing on Thursday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said there had been only 200 net new hospitalizations over 24 hours, the lowest number since the crisis broke out. That number had been as high as 1,400 just a week ago. Likewise, the rate of new intensive-care admissions and intubations -- when patients are put on a ventilator -- also plummeted.But New York State also reported more than 10,600 new positive cases on Wednesday, a second day above 10,000 after multiple days when the number was trending downward. At more than 159,000 infections, New York’s cases have now eclipsed those of Spain and Italy. It’s unknown how many people have been infected but never tested.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayAbout 18,000 people in the state are hospitalized for the virus. If New York is indeed reaching a plateau, the statistics suggest that the state will need far less hospital capacity than it raced to build at the onset of the crisis.After early models predicted a wave as big as 135,000 coronavirus patients, New York nearly doubled its hospital capacity to about 90,000 beds, with hospitals filling hallways, lobbies and conference rooms with them. If the spread continues to slow, the question may become what to do with the excess capacity the state no longer needs.That wasn’t a question Cuomo was prepared to answer on Thursday, saying it was too early to begin making such assessments.“I don’t want to get into a retrospective when we’re in the middle of the game,” Cuomo said. But he added: “The expert models were all off.”He urged New Yorkers to continue practicing social distancing, noting that the curve could begin trending up again if people become complacent and that the state needed to prepare for potential additional waves of the virus.“We’re in a battle right, but this is about a war,” Cuomo said.Also read: India gears up to begin plasma therapy trialsMayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the apparent flattening of the infection curve might mean that the city could reach a second phase as early as June that would relax restrictions on movement outside the home. That would require much wider testing and continued adherence to some level of social distancing, he said.The mayor gave no estimates for when, or under what conditions, businesses, schools, courts, restaurants or theaters could reopen.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “If we do things right and get testing we can make steady progress,” de Blasio said. “If we don’t do things right or get thrown a curve ball we may have to tighten restrictions further.”The city death toll reached 4,426 on Thursday morning, up from more than 3,600 the previous day. Confirmed cases totaled roughly 84,000, up about 6,400 from 24 hours earlier.As the caseloads stabilize and then decrease, city officials plan to isolate mildly symptomatic patients in hotel rooms while they fight off the virus to prevent them from infecting others in their households, de Blasio said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-new-york-reports-record-824-covid-19-deaths-in-24-hours-despite-flattening-curve/story-wg4z4Bq2Y45amnLIzZ5lBI.html
10-04-2020||World||US threatens to block China Telecom from serving American market||The top departments of the US government have endorsed cutting off Beijing-controlled China Telecom from serving the US market because of legal and security risks, the Justice Department announced Thursday.The departments, including Defense, State, and Homeland Security, said after a broad review that the Federal Communications Commission should “revoke and terminate” all authorizations for the Chinese giant’s US subsidiary, China Telecom (Americas), to provide international telecommunications services to and from the United States.“The Executive Branch agencies identified substantial and unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks associated with China Telecom’s operations, which render the FCC authorizations inconsistent with the public interest,” the Justice Department said in a statement.The agencies -- which also included the Justice Department, the Commerce Department, the US Trade Representative and US counter-intelligence -- said China Telecom is vulnerable to “exploitation, influence and control” by the Chinese government. They said it has inaccurately reported to US authorities where it stores its US records and how it manages cybersecurity.The agencies also made the recommendation based on “the nature of China Telecom’s US operations,” which they said allow Chinese government actors “to engage in malicious cyber activity enabling economic espionage and disruption and misrouting of US communications.” The recommendation has to be decided upon by the FCC, but will almost certainly involve the White House, where it could be weighed amid ongoing trade negotiations with Beijing. It came just five days after President Donald Trump’s administration formed an interdepartmental body to formally review national security concerns related to foreign telecommunications companies involved in the United States.In September 2019 two senators, Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Tom Cotton, asked the FCC to consider banning China Telecom and another company, China Unicom, from the US market over national security concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-threatens-to-block-china-telecom-from-serving-american-market/story-sVfqsB65TNvXRiUJMeqt6I.html
10-04-2020||World||‘You’re a third-rate reporter’: Trump’s Covid-19 press briefings appal citizens||“Nasty,” Donald Trump calls one reporter, “third-rate,” he brands another. The US president seems to loathe journalists but at his tempestuous coronavirus press conferences he just keeps coming back for more.Every day for weeks now, Trump has spent up to two hours of primetime television delivering his unique blend of insults, jokes and cheerful boasts.The briefings began as a way to inform an anxious nation on the COVID-19 emergency, turning health officials, like infectious diseases specialist Anthony Fauci, into household names. The usually bland vice president Mike Pence has won respect for his calm but unvarnished updates on the numbers of the sick and dead.Sooner or later, though, the events were bound to become all about this most limelight-loving of presidents. And it was sooner.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicTrump made himself lead actor, director and producer in the latest version of a reality TV show he has been playing much of his life -- the omnipotent, irascible chief executive.In some ways it seems to have worked. Ratings have been as high, Trump likes to quote from a newspaper report, as the finale to “The Bachelor” reality show.However, many of those viewers must have included Americans simply hoping for information on the pandemic -- a captive audience.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakBy Thursday, even the pro-Republican editorial board of The Wall Street Journal had had enough, urging Trump to leave the briefings to experts and to keep himself mostly away.“A friend of ours who voted for President Trump sent us a note recently saying that she had stopped watching,” the editorialists wrote in a drily devastating review.“Why? Because they have become less about defeating the virus and more about the many feuds of Donald J. Trump.” “Fake News!” Trump tweeted furiously back at the The Wall Street Journal.But coincidentally or not, on Thursday evening he for the first time left his briefing after around only 20 minutes. The sober experts stayed to give the bulk of the presentation -- just as the Journal had recommended.‘Thank you Mr President’At least until Thursday’s curtailed episode, the briefings follow a careful choreography, all designed to magnify Trump.When officials do get to the microphone, the first thing they do is give praise. This is just a recent smattering:“As the president said so well,...”“I just want to begin by thanking President Trump.”“Another example of the bold leadership of President Trump.”“Great to see countries of the world rally behind President Trump.”Things aren’t quite so ardent between Trump and the journalists.Trump’s media bashing is nothing new. But in a room with only a handful of reporters allowed due to social distancing measures, the presidential aggression gets very personal.“You’re a third-rate reporter and what you just said is a disgrace, OK?” Trump told ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl.Trump called other reporters “nasty” and “terrible.” He cautioned yet another to “be nice. Don’t be threatening.”Trump even lashed out at the Fox News correspondent for asking a tough question, apparently wondering why the reporter was not throwing softballs, as the network’s overtly pro-Trump hosts do.“I thought you were with Fox,” he said.It gets weirderWhether Trump truly loathes journalists is a matter of speculation.As a veteran self-publicist, he revels above all in maximum exposure. He speaks to reporters far more often than typical predecessors in the Oval Office.Trump can also count on a friendly question or two from fringe right-wing cable outlets like OANN, which have an increasingly strong presence in the briefing room.“They treat me very nicely,” Trump recently told the OANN’s reporter, before she even began her question.At another briefing, the new correspondent for a rival conservative network, Newsmax, turned out to be none other than Sean Spicer -- a former Trump spokesman.But there are softball questions and then there are the plain bizarre, leaving both reporters and Trump’s staff, waiting near the podium, in disbelief.At a briefing this Wednesday, it was time for the latter: a New York Post reporter wanting to know if Trump would pardon the convicted murderer/zoo keeper star of Netflix hit “Tiger King.”Forgotten was the raging pandemic. Forgotten were the millions of newly unemployed Americans. Forgotten were arguments over whether Trump dealt well or badly with an unprecedented crisis.It was time to banter about “Joe Exotic” and Trump joking -- presumably -- that he’d “look into” the pardon idea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-re-a-third-rate-reporter-trump-s-covid-19-press-briefings-appal-citizens/story-Izzg6wDFyBlKH0PVMu9pHK.html
10-04-2020||World||Covid-19: US criticizes WHO for ignoring Taiwan’s virus warnings||The United States on Thursday accused the World Health Organization of putting politics first by ignoring early coronavirus warnings by Taiwan, which voiced outrage over criticism from the UN body’s chief. President Donald Trump has gone on an offensive with threats to withhold funding for the WHO, which is at the forefront of fighting the pandemic that has infected more than 1.5 million people worldwide since emerging in Wuhan, China late last year.Critics say that Trump’s sudden threats against the WHO amount to a political ploy to find a foreign scapegoat as he comes under fire for not doing more to prepare for and control COVID-19, which has killed about 15,000 people in the United States.Trump himself said in January that the United States had the coronavirus “totally under control” and predicted it may go away in April as temperatures rise.Elaborating on Trump’s case against the WHO, the State Department said the WHO was too late in sounding the alarm over COVID-19 and overly deferential to China. It questioned why the Geneva-based body did not pursue a lead from Taiwan.The United States is “deeply disturbed that Taiwan’s information was withheld from the global health community, as reflected in the WHO’s January 14, 2020 statement that there was no indication of human-to-human transmission,” a State Department spokesperson said.“The WHO once again chose politics over public health,” she said, criticizing the WHO for denying Taiwan even observer status since 2016.The WHO’s actions have “cost time and lives,” the spokesperson said.Taiwan, which has succeeded in limiting the virus to just five deaths despite the island’s proximity and ties with China, warned the WHO on December 31 of human-to-human transmission, Vice President Chen Chien-Jen has said.Chen, an epidemiologist, told the Financial Times that Taiwanese doctors had learned that colleagues in Wuhan were falling ill but that the WHO did not work to confirm the finding.China considers Taiwan -- a self-ruling democracy where the mainland’s defeated nationalists fled in 1949 -- to be a province awaiting reunification and has sought to exclude it from all international organizations.Taiwan decries ‘slander’ WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in an appeal Wednesday for unity, said that he had been subjected to insults including racial slights since the public health crisis began.The Ethiopian doctor turned diplomat did not mention the United States -- the largest donor to the WHO at more than $400 million last year -- but singled out non-member Taiwan.“Three months ago, this attack came from Taiwan,” Tedros told reporters in Geneva, referring to online criticism and insults.“Taiwan, the foreign ministry also, they know the campaign. They didn’t disassociate themselves. They even started criticizing me in the middle of all that insult and slur, but I didn’t care,” Tedros said.The comments sparked anger in Taiwan, which described Tedros’ comments as “baseless” and said it was seeking an apology for “slander.”“Our country has never encouraged the public to launch personal attacks against him or made any racially discriminatory comments,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou told reporters on Thursday.In a Facebook post, President Tsai Ing-wen invited Tedros to visit Taiwan and learn from its handling of the epidemic, challenging him to “resist pressure from China.” “We have been blocked from international organizations for many long years and we know what it feels like to be discriminated against and isolated more than anyone else,” she said.Beijing responded that Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party, which emphasizes Taiwan’s separate identity, has engaged in “political manipulation” over the WHO.“Its true aim is to seek independence through the pandemic. We are firmly opposed to this, and their scheme will never succeed,” a foreign ministry spokesman said in Beijing.Critics of Tedros have accused the WHO under his leadership of being too close to Beijing and complimentary of China’s response to the coronavirus.But some public health experts say that the WHO had little choice but to cooperate with China to preserve access in Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-criticizes-who-for-ignoring-taiwan-s-virus-warnings/story-Ure39apWRsQ4osPjQN3oYO.html
10-04-2020||World||At UNSC meet, UN chief Guterres warns of bio-terrorism, social unrest||Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the UN Security Council on Thursday that the coronavirus pandemic is threatening international peace and security — “potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease.”The UN’s most powerful body, which has been silent on Covid-19 since it started circling the globe sickening and killing tens of thousands, issued its first brief press statement after the closed meeting. It expressed “support for all efforts of the secretary-general concerning the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries and recalled the need for unity and solidarity with all those affected.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicGuterres, who called for a cease-fire for all global conflicts on March 23, said the crisis has “hindered international, regional and national conflict resolution efforts, exactly when they are needed most.”He cited other pressing risks to global security from the pandemic: terrorists seeing an opportunity to strike, groups seeing how a biological terrorist attack might unfold, the erosion of trust in public institutions, economic instability, political tensions from postponing elections or referenda, uncertainty sparking further division and turmoil in some countries, and Covid-19 “triggering or exacerbating various human rights challenges.”Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe secretary-general reiterated that the United Nations faces “its gravest test” since the organization was founded 75 years ago from the pandemic and concluded saying: “This is the fight of a generation — and the raison d’être of (the reason for) the United Nations itself.”Guterres spoke by video conference at a closed council meeting on Covid-19’s impact on the council’s mandate, which is the preservation of international peace and security. It was the first discussion by its 15 ambassadors on the pandemic. While the meeting was closed, the UN spokesman released Guterres’ briefing and a number of ambassadors released their remarks to the media.The UN chief said the engagement of the Security Council will be “critical to mitigate the peace and security implications of the Covid-19 pandemic.” He added that “a signal of unity and resolve from the Council would count for a lot at this anxious time.”Diplomats said the Security Council was initially blocked from issuing a statement or adopting a resolution by U.S. insistence that the origin of the virus in China or Wuhan be included, which China objected to, but Belgium’s UN Ambassador Marc Pecsteen de Buytswerve, an elected council member, said that was not mentioned on Thursday. He and the nine other elected council members had been pressing for a meeting and succeeded in getting the secretary-general to brief on Thursday.According to diplomats, French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Donald Trump agreed to organize a video conference of leaders of the five permanent council members, also including China, Russia and Britain, and France wanted that before a council meeting, but it couldn’t be arranged. Meanwhile, the 10 elected members had been pressing for a council meeting and briefing from Guterres — and they had the nine votes needed for it to happen on Thursday.Pecsteen de Buytswerve said even though the press statement from the council was “very minimal” it is an expression of support for the secretary-general and his call for peace and a cease-fire “and that’s the most important thing at this stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-warns-covid-19-threatens-global-peace-and-security/story-uJZNckaWUflliEHw0lh0mK.html
10-04-2020||World||Netanyahu thanks PM Modi for delivering hydroxychloroquine to Israel||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday thanked his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for rushing a five-tonne cargo of medicines, including anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, seen as a possible cure for COVID-19.“Thank you, my dear friend @narendramodi, Prime Minister of India, for sending Chloroquine to Israel. All the citizens of Israel thank you!”, Netanyahu said in a tweet Thursday evening.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Israeli’s PM’s thanked India two days after a plane carrying materials used to make medicines for treating coronavirus patients arrived in Israel from India on Tuesday. The five tonne shipment included ingredients for drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, being seen worldwide as the best possible cure as of now for treating COVID-19 patients.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak The dreaded coronavirus has infected nearly 10,000 people in Israel and claimed 86 lives. As many as 121 others are on ventilators in serious condition. The Indian consignment reached Israel within days after Netanyahu spoke to Modi on April 3, requesting supply of hydroxychloroquine, with India being the world’s largest producer and exporter of the drug. India, however, had to restrict its export to meet domestic contingencies. Netanyahu had been in touch with Modi ever since the coronavirus crisis erupted. He had made a special request on March 13 asking the Indian prime minister to approve and allow export of masks and pharmaceuticals to Israel.“I also spoke to the prime minister of India, my friend Narendra Modi. We are dependent on supply lines from various countries. We are looking into it all the time,” Netanyahu had then said addressing a press conference.The Israeli leader spoke to Modi a second time on April 3 to discuss various steps to deal with the coronavirus crisis. Several countries have been experimenting with hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus symptoms. US President Donald Trump recently touted its potential in treating COVID-19 positive patients, requesting India to help his country with supplies. Experts, however, have urged caution until bigger trials validate hydroxychloroquine’s efficacy. Chloroquine can have potentially serious side effects, especially in high doses or when administered with other medications. Netanyahu’s thanks to India followed soon after US President Donald Trump described Modi as “terrific” for allowing the export of hydroxychloroquine to the US, seen as a possible cure for COVID-19, saying India’s help in the extraordinary times “will not be forgotten”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-thanks-pm-modi-for-delivering-hydroxychloroquine-to-israel/story-oS9cgCFlz0DyefbmWbBSIN.html
10-04-2020||World||Covid-19: UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson out of intensive care unit||Prime Minister Boris Johnson left intensive care on Thursday evening as he continues to recover from COVID-19, but he remains under close observation in hospital, his office said on Thursday. Johnson, 55, was admitted to St Thomas’ Hospital on Sunday evening with a persistent high temperature and cough, and was rushed to intensive care on Monday where he spent three nights receiving treatment.“The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery,” a spokesman from his office said in an emailed statement.“He is in extremely good spirits.”Johnson was the first world leader to be hospitalised with the coronavirus, forcing him to hand control of the world’s fifth-largest economy to foreign minister Dominic Raab just as Britain’s outbreak approaches its most deadly peak.Raab tweeted that the improvement in Johnson’s condition was “the news we all wanted to hear”. U.S. President Donald Trump described it as “great news”.Johnson’s ongoing recovery prompted a small rise in the value of sterling against the dollar.However, the government statement did not give any details on when Johnson may be able to resume leadership, and Raab - speaking before the latest announcement - had stressed the importance of allowing the prime minister to focus on recovery.No further updates on Johnson’s health were expected on Thursday.Raab is deputising for Johnson during the most stringent shutdown in Britain’s peacetime history. Earlier he told a news conference it was too early to end the lockdown because Britain had not reached the peak of the outbreak yet.The UK death toll in hospitals from coronavirus now stands at 7,978, a rise of 881 on the day but a smaller increase than the 938 seen in Wednesday’s data. GOVERNMENT SPENDINGWith Johnson absent and the death toll still mounting, the British government is wrestling with two major issues - how to finance a vast increase in state spending to support the shuttered economy, and when to start easing lockdown measures.With the economy facing potentially the worst hit since World War Two, the government said it had expanded its overdraft facility with the Bank of England.The central bank has agreed temporarily to finance government borrowing in response to COVID-19 if funds cannot immediately be raised from debt markets, reviving a measure last widely used during the 2008 financial crisis.The BoE said it was a short-term measure and both it and government said any borrowing from the Ways and Means facility - effectively the government’s overdraft with the Bank - would be repaid by the end of the year.The government has made pledges costing tens of billions of pounds to support businesses and workers hit by the virus. On Thursday, the government said an additional 1.2 million claims for welfare payments had been filed since March 16. Raab said the peak of the virus outbreak had yet to be reached and that the government would not be able to say more about the duration of the lockdown until late next week, once experts have had chance to analyse data on how well it is working. It was introduced last month.“The measures will have to stay in place until we’ve got the evidence that clearly shows we’ve moved beyond the peak,” he said.While Johnson’s condition was improving, the likely length of his recovery remained unknown, with some political commentators saying there was a power vacuum in his absence.Raab said on Thursday he had the power to make “necessary decisions” in the prime minister’s absence and that government will continue to follow the strategy set out by Johnson. He said cabinet could take decisions collectively.The United Kingdom is entering what scientists say is the deadliest phase of the outbreak, with deaths expected to continue to rise over the Easter weekend.But in a sign the shutdown measures were working, health officials have said the number of coronavirus infections and hospital admissions had begun to show signs of flattening.Police said they would be taking tougher action to do just that before the four-day Easter holiday weekend because many people were continuing to ignore the ban on social gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-out-of-intensive-care-unit/story-uSEQS9t1ZZO3tsLU0bo7ZM.html
