A Pakistan national and a former Lashkar-e-Tayebba (LeT) operative, Farooqui was arrested for the massacre of 27 Sikh worshippers at Shor Bazaar Gurudwara in Kabul on March 25.During interrogation by Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS), Farooqui is understood to have laid bare links of ISKP with Pakistan’s Inter Service Intelligence. Top ISKP operatives Ali Mohammed from Islamabad and Salman from Karachi were also arrested along with Tanweer from Bangladesh. Salman, according to officials, is responsible for ISIS media links with so-called ISIS India. The other two arrested were top fighters for the terrorist group.“The ISKP is just a demon child of Pakistan’s ISI, which is designed to hit at targets for larger tactical purposes of Rawalpindi GHQ. Among those arrested include terrorists from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Nangarhar, Quetta, Pakistan- occupied-Kashmir, Karachi and Kunar Province. This is the biggest achievement of Afghan security forces to date,” said a senior counter-terror official.WATCH | Mastermind of Kabul Gurudwara attack, ISKP terrorist Farooqui, capturedPakistani national Mawlawi Abdullah, who was earlier associated with proscribed Lashkar-e-Tayebba group and then Tehreek-e-Taliban terror group, replaced Mawlawi Zia-ul-Haq aka Abu Omar Khorasani as ISKP chief in April 2019.Farooqi belongs to the Mamozai tribe and hails from the Orakzai agency area on the Pak-Afghan border. His links with LeT and Haqqani network have also been revealed in the NDS official statement.According to counter-terror operatives in Kabul and Delhi, Mawlawi Farooqi on the instructions of Haqqani Network and LeT used Kasaragod resident Muhsin Tikaripur along with three other Urdu-Punjabi speaking attackers to massacre 27 innocent Sikh men and women in Shor Bazaar, Kabul. Mushin was killed in the attack and his mother in Kerala informed of his death. The leader of Haqqani Network Sirajuddin is also the sword arm of the Taliban with very close links to Pakistani deep state. Tihan Singh an Indian national was also killed in the attack.Although 27 Sikhs were killed in the terror attack which was criticised by US, allies and India, the main target of ISKP was the Indian Embassy in Kabul as both Pakistan and Taliban wanted India out of the developing Afghan political equation in the context of a peace deal with the US. Similar threats have been posed to Indian consulates in Jalalabad, Herat and Kandahar with India forced to withdraw its staff for purposes of safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iskp-chief-s-arrest-for-gurdwara-attack-brings-out-clear-link-to-pakistan-s-isi-official/story-NPxxscxPawaFkD0y0WrALN.html
04-04-2020||World||Some US companies wait for clarity on Covid-19 aid package||As the Trump administration on Friday began processing financial aid for small businesses under the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief legislation that the president signed into law last week, some large businesses and corporation are waiting for more clarity on the conditions attached to these payments.They are specially anxious about the possibility of the government picking up equity in borrowing firms in exchange. Boeing, which is looking at a substantial assistance package, has already opposed it saying it will explore other options. if forced to part with equity.The administration is actively weighing, acquiring stake in borrowing companies, the big ones, as compensation. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Thursday it was under discussion now in the context of relief for the airlines industry and “I’ll be working very closely with the President, and we’ll make sure that we strike the right balance. This “not a bailout” and taxpayers should “get compensated”, he added.The Trump administration is eager to ensure the terms of the relief package — called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) — were not as lenient as assistance put together by the Obama administration after the 2008 financial crisis, which has been used by some of the borrowing companies to buy back their own stock to boost them on the exchange and to make hefty payments to top executives.“We don’t let them buy back the stock; we don’t let that happen,” President Trump had said, when signing the legislation into law. “(with) tough limits on executive compensation.”The 42.2 trillion package included $300 billion in direct payment to American families; $350 in job retention loans to small business; $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits; $500 billion in loans for industries hit hard by the virus; and $100 billion for healthcare workers.The coronavirus outbreak shut down large parts of the country, forcing many businesses to close to lay off workers to survive. Airlines and related sectors are the worst hit, along with small businesses (those employing 500 workers or less). Unemployment has shot up with a record 6.6 million filing for benefits last week, in addition to the 3.3 million the week before.The amount set aside for industries is a mix of grants and loans and it has been earmarked for airlines, cargo carriers and those deemed essential for national security. Boeing falls in the third category and is looking at $17 billion along with others.The treasury department announced a set of conditions last week for disbursing loans to these industries. Borrowers are prohibited from buying back their stocks, or of their parent companies, until 12 months from the date when the loan is no longer outstanding.Borrowers are also banned from paying “dividends or make other capital distributions with respect to the common stock of the borrower” for after the same waiting period of 12 months.The borrowing company must also “maintain its employment levels as of March 24, 2020, to the extent practicable, and in any case will not reduce its employment levels by more than 10 percent from the levels on such date”.And, of course, the borrower must be an American company with “significant operations in and a majority of its employees based in the United States”.There is no indication in the treasury department announcement of “Procedures and Minimum Requirements” of the government acquiring a stake in the borrowing company. As Mnuchin said at a White House briefing earlier this week, the matter is still being considered, and he did not rule it out.Boeing has opposed it publicly and repeatedly. “I don’t have a need for an equity stake,” Boeing co-CEO Dave Calhoun told Fox Business just days before Trump signed the relief legislation into law. “If they force it, we just look at all the other options and we’ve got plenty of them.” He had then added the company was looking at borrowing from the government and had every intention of repaying the whole amount, with interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-us-companies-wait-for-clarity-on-covid-19-aid-package/story-e1vOjxxvhktRbpxAVkdDUJ.html

Parliament is due to resume on April 21.Britain’s health, council and police officials reiterated their core message to the people to stay at home and not venture out to enjoy the warmer weather over the sunny weekend. There have been reports that some people have been flocking to beaches and parks.Neil Ferguson, a leading expert advising the Johnson government, told BBC that the pandemic was expected to plateau in the next week to 10 days, but that the public’s behaviour was crucial for determining what happens next.If people continued to follow guidelines to stay at home, he was hopeful that some of the intensive social distancing measures could be substituted for rapid testing and contact tracing in a few weeks’ time, once case numbers are lower.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-invites-opposition-to-join-in-covid-19-fight/story-YmX9XzPNAhoNfVB1k5E9tM.html
04-04-2020||World||Keir Starmer is new Labour leader; regaining ‘Indian’ support key task||Keir Starmer, who was on Saturday elected leader of the Labour party after Jeremy Corbyn resigned after the party’s heavy defeat in the December election, has a full in-tray before him that includes trying to regain the support of large sections of the Indian community.Starmer, 57, who was first elected MP in 2015 and served as the shadow Brexit secretary, defeated Rebecca Long-Bailey and Indian-origin Lisa Nandy in the contest. He has often participated in events of the Indian community.A former head of prosecutions in the Crown Prosecution Service, Starmer admitted that the party has a “mountain to climb” after the fourth election loss in a row, but promised: “Where that requires change, we will change. Where that requires us to rethink, we will rethink”. India has also congratulated Starmer. Indian high commissioner Ruchi Ghanashyam tweeted: “Congratulations on your election as the leader of the Labour Party Sir @Keir_Starmer. I am confident that under your leadership the Labour Party will further strengthen its historic bonds with India and will build enduring bridges to connect with the Indian diaspora in the UK.”The Indian community has for long supported Labour, mainly due to its stand on immigration, but has been haemorrhaging support from second and third generation members of the community, who have increasingly gravitated to the Conservative party in recent elections.Under Corbyn’s leadership, Labour riled many for its stand on Jammu and Kashmir, which has been perceived in New Delhi and the UK as being anti-Indian. A resolution adopted at its annual conference in September called for outside intervention in the dispute.Rajesh Agarwal, deputy mayor of London and co-chair of Labour Friends of India, said: “The Labour Party must also make the changes necessary to win hearts, minds and trust of the British people, including that of the 1.5 million strong British Indian community”.“Labour is the natural party for British Indians but last few years have seen the relations strained. I hope the change in leadership is the beginning of a healing process & the party will be able to regain the trust of the community”.Starmer recalled the party’s past achievements while in government in his acceptance speech: “We created the NHS. We created the welfare state. We passed equalities legislation, the Race Relations Act…But we’ve just lost four elections in a row”.“We’re failing in our historic purpose. Be in no doubt I understand the scale of the task, the gravity of the position that we’re in. We’ve got a mountain to climb. But we will climb it, and I will do my utmost to reconnect us across the country, to re-engage with our communities”.Under his leadership, he said the party will engage constructively with the government, not oppose it for opposition’s sake; not score points or make impossible demands.Nandy, who finished third in the election, extended support to Starmer: “We have been competitors in this contest but never opponents,” noting that Labour’s road back to power is “steep but does not have to be long. Our country is crying out for fresh leadership. We start today.”Manoj Ladwa, a leading London-based community figure and former chair of the community engagement forum of the Labour Friends of India group in the party, welcomed Starmer’s election and called for a ‘reset’ in relations with the Indian community. He said: “Under the leadership of his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, Labour recklessly alienated many British Indians. Corbyn’s supporters frequently sniped against India, a country that is a hugely important strategic and economic partner for the UK. I like many other traditional Labour voters left the Labour Party for those very reasons”.“If Keir Stammer is serious about becoming the next British Prime Minister, he has to urgently press the reset button with countries like India and communities like Britain’s 1.5 million Indian diaspora, which the previous leadership was overtly hostile to”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/keir-starmer-elected-new-labour-leader/story-oEaPGJlDDKxVfVzPElSuFJ.html

04-04-2020||World||Covid-19’s impact may last up to two years, say health officials in Canada||The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic could be felt for as long as two years, according to Canadian public health officials.According to Dr Peter Donnelly, president and CEO of Public Health Ontario, projections undertaken for Canada’s most populous province took into the possibility of secondary and tertiary waves of the infection, which could stretch the period it continues to have an effect from between 18 months and two years.By putting in place restrictive measures to counter the spread of Covid-19, it may have escaped a far worse fate. As Donnelly said, “Over the full two-year course of the pandemic, had we done nothing, Ontario may have suffered 100,000 deaths.”Even then the modelling done by provincial health experts is sobering. By the end of April, the province could tally approximately 1,600 deaths due to the novel coronavirus with nearly 80,000 infected.By the end of the whole cycle of the pandemic, which could stretch into spring 2022, the number of deaths projected for the province range from a best case scenario of 3,000 to a high of 15,000.“When you think that the mortality of this disease is up to 10 times higher, and you remember we have no vaccine, and we have no specific treatment; then suddenly the figure of 15,000 becomes entirely logical and comprehensible,” he said.The Canadian government has also said it will release projections shortly, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying they will be made available in the “coming days.”However, a lower number could be in play if the province were to introduce “enhanced measures” like reducing the number of businesses considered “essential” and allowed to remain open.Of course, figures from such modelling cannot be entirely reliable, as Donnelly pointed out, that when applied to brand the new viral disease, the results could be “inexact.” But such data can prove prescriptive for policy-makers as well as the public, seeing evidence of their actions curbing the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-s-impact-may-last-up-to-two-years-say-health-officials-in-canada/story-8BQcIMx1ZJ2mYlaltYnqaN.html
04-04-2020||World||China honours coronavirus victims with 3 minutes of reflection||With air raid sirens wailing and flags at half-mast, China on Saturday held a three-minute nationwide moment of reflection to honor those who have died in the coronavirus outbreak, especially “martyrs” who fell while fighting what has become a global pandemic.Commemorations took place at 10 a.m. in all major cities, but were particularly poignant in Wuhan, the industrial center where the virus was first detected in December.Wuhan was placed under complete lockdown on Jan. 23 in an effort to stem the spread of the virus and has been lauded as a “heroic city” by the nation’s communist leadership for the sacrifices made by its 11 million citizens.People have gradually been allowed to travel in and out of Wuhan under strict conditions. The quarantine on the city is to be formally lifted on Wednesday.In Beijing, President Xi Jinping led other top officials, all dressed in black suits with white carnations, as they bowed before a flag at half-mast in the leadership compound of Zhongnanhai.On Saturday, China reported one new confirmed case in Wuhan and 18 among people arriving from abroad, along with four new deaths, all in Wuhan. China now has recorded a total of 81,639 cases and 3,326 deaths, although those figures are generally considered to be understated because of a lack of testing and a reluctance to report the scale of the original outbreak.China’s slow, cautious emergence from the global pandemic comes as the U.S. is struggling to deal with the outbreak that has taken more than 1,860 lives in New York City alone. Hard-hit European nations Italy, Spain and France are also seeing rising numbers of cases and deaths, although strict social distancing measures such as those adopted by China appear to be having an effect.The State Council, China’s Cabinet, ordered that national flags be flown at half-mast around the country and at Chinese embassies and consulates abroad, and the suspension of all public recreational activities.The horns of automobiles, trains and ships joined in what the official Xinhua News Agency called a “wail in grief” for three minutes. China has held such moments of silence in past, often to mark World War II-era atrocities by Japan, but rarely on a national scale.The commemoration also comes on the traditional Qingming festival, when Chinese visit the graves of their ancestors. Officials have banned such observances this year to avoid large gatherings that might contribute to a feared second wave of infections.More than 3,000 health care workers contracted COVID-19 and the government says 14 died of the disease. Among them was doctor Li Wenliang, who was threatened with punishment by police after publicizing news of the outbreak but has since been listed among the national “martyrs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-honours-coronavirus-victims-with-3-minutes-of-reflection/story-29xYH7Ey9DMdgwz2LuRLRI.html

On Saturday, China mourned those in the country who lost their lives in the battle against coronavirus. The country observed a nationwide three-minute silence.Here are the key developments from across the globe:1. The United States recorded nearly 1,500 coronavirus deaths between Thursday and Friday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. This is the worst 24-hour death toll globally since the pandemic began.2. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday renewed his call for a global ceasefire, urging all parties to conflict to lay down arms and allow war-torn nations to combat the coronavirus pandemic. “The worst is yet to come,” Guterres said.3. The US government on Friday said that citizens who lack health insurance will be covered by the government if they fall sick with coronavirus.4. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva is describing the situation as “a crisis like no other.” “We are now in recession, it is way worse than the global financial crisis and it is a crisis that requires all of us to come together.” Georgieva says 90 countries have already approached the institution for emergency financing.5. US employment plunged by 701,000 in March and the jobless rate surged to 4.4% amid the coronavirus crisis.6. The United Kingdom death toll from the coronavirus rose by 684 to 3,605 as of 1600 GMT on April 2, up 23% on the previous day.

Singapore will shutter schools and most workplaces as the city-state unveiled a raft of stricter measures intended as a “circuit breaker” to slow the spread of coronavirus.8. Coronavirus can spread through just breathing and talking, said a high-level US scientific this week, suggesting that the virus that causes the disease is airborne and is spreading more easily and sustainably between people than previously believed.9. More than 900 people died in Spain over the past 24 hours for the second day running. Spain has the world’s second-highest death toll after Italy with 10,935 fatalities from 117,710 confirmed cases.10.

To silence the guns, we must raise the voices for peace,” he said.Guterres did not mention the UN Security Council, where divisions between the United States and China have blocked action.The EU “strongly supports” the call, its foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said after a video conference of the bloc’s foreign ministers.“We urge all those involved in armed conflicts anywhere in the world to engage in efforts to find a political solution to the conflict,” Borrell told a media conference in Brussels.- Call for more aid -Since the beginning of the global pandemic, the Security Council has not met once on COVID-19, making no statement or joint resolution.On Thursday the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for international cooperation and “multilateralism” in addressing the virus, which has infected more than one million worldwide and killed more than 50,000.Guterres appealed for developed countries and multilateral institutions to do more to aid poorer countries face the pandemic.“To act early rather than later is essential... This is particularly true with the developing world,” he said.Guterres noted that the ceasefire in Idlib, Syria is holding but said it needs to be expanded to the entire country to allow full efforts to slow the coronavirus spread.But he also said expressions of support for a ceasefire by different factions fighting in Libya had not ended the violence.“This war is now not allowing the response to COVID-19 to take place,” he said.“This is the moment to stop. It’s not morally acceptable to continue with this conflict.”prh/rmb/ec||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-worst-yet-to-come-for-countries-in-conflict-says-un-chief-antonio-guterres/story-dtMJuRHTeRWpIIU8N8bVFI.html

She is calling on countries to prioritize health expenditures and to make sure doctors, nurses and other health workers are paid. She adds that the world’s most fragile countries must be protected, noting that “USD 90 billion have flown out” and damaged emerging economies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-leader-says-coronavirus-is-crisis-like-no-other/story-wYa1nX74sdMD7D9fy6UT2L.html

It includes over 20,000 Americans repatriated in the past week alone,” Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Ian Brownlee told reporters during a conference call on Friday.He said the US State Department has approximately 70 flights scheduled in the coming days which should bring back several thousand more US citizens.“South Asia now has the most US citizens wishing to return. So far the US has brought home almost 1,000 Americans from South Asia and are working aggressively to assist thousands more who have expressed an interest in returning,” Brownlee said. “The total number we’re looking at overseas at this point is about 22,000. The greatest number of those – certainly the plurality of those – are in South and Central Asia, many of them in India,” he added.Brownlee urged Americans to return to their home country as soon as possible. “For the US citizens contemplating whether or not to come home, the time to act is now. Flights will not continue indefinitely, but we want to do all we can to assist you while we are still able to do so,” he said. More than 53,000 people have died from coronavirus since it was first detected late last year in China, and the United States, Spain and Britain all reported their highest daily death tolls. The deadly infection has so far claimed the lives of over 7,000 people in the US and infected over 2,70,000 others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-37-000-americans-stranded-overseas-repatriated-till-now-us-official/story-CViucJTNd1CuxS4JmsaPWP.html

Although he’d never served at any level of government before, his marriage to Trump’s daughter Ivanka put him at the heart of power after the 2016 election.Now Kushner’s surprise appearance at Trump’s daily coronavirus briefing Thursday has confirmed his rise to the top tier on one of the greatest crises to hit the country in its history.Trump’s vice president, Mike Pence, is meant to be coordinating the complex government response to an illness overwhelming the health system and economy.For days there had been whispers that Kushner, a real estate scion who casts himself as a dynamic thinker, was running a shadow team. On the briefing room podium, Kushner emerged from that shadow.While making sure to say he was there to assist Pence, Kushner spoke with the self-confidence -- critics often call it arrogance -- of someone enjoying unique influence.Asked to describe his still vaguely defined mission, Kushner suggested he would reinvigorate a team struggling with the dire challenge of battling the pandemic across the vast, diverse country.Kushner said Trump had asked him “to make sure that we think outside the box, make sure we’re finding all the best thinkers in the country, making sure we’re getting all the best ideas.”Drama in the house The Trump White House is regularly marked by personnel dramas that wouldn’t look out of place on the president’s old reality TV show “The Apprentice.”Senior figures come and go at a fast pace, sometimes fired by tweet, and in several cases departing on the bitterest of terms.A month ago, Trump fired his third chief of staff. The replacement, Mark Meadows, took weeks to assume his office, meaning the president was without a key aide just as the coronavirus was ballooning into disaster.The slick, apparently highly focused Kushner saw his moment.This isn’t the first time Kushner takes up a role that many might shy from.Earlier this year, he brought out Trump’s plan for nothing less than resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Again, he went into that diplomatic minefield with no relevant experience.The plan was panned by almost everyone except for the Israeli government and its Washington backers. But the episode demonstrated Kushner’s extraordinary position.Now, with state governors and Trump wrangling over who has responsibility for securing and delivering medical supplies to coronavirus-hit areas of the country, Kushner is back, promising to get results where others failed.He said he would “break down every barrier needed to make sure the teams can succeed.”Scared’The White House feels it is being unfairly blamed for delays in the supply chain from equipment stockpiles and manufacturers to hospitals and ordinary citizens.In the world’s richest country, lifesaving ventilators are in desperately tight supply. It is difficult for most people even to get a simple face mask.Trump argues the shortfall of medical supplies is the fault of state governors, not the federal government, which he describes as a mere back-up, rather than leader.In his briefing appearance, Kushner was right on message, saying that individual states have no automatic right to such assistance.“The notion of the federal stockpile was it’s supposed to be our stockpile,” Kushner said, drawing instant scorn from his opponents on Twitter. “It’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use.”In scathing comments, Kushner went on to say that the crisis was revealing which politicians were “better managers.” He described some governors as “scared” and confused.Supporters of Kushner say he is unusually bright, even a “hidden genius,” as Trump’s former UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, said in 2018.On the frontline of the pandemic, the controversial son-in-law will have his chance to prove that right and his detractors wrong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-son-in-law-jared-kushner-takes-surprise-top-role-in-coronavirus-fight/story-tnVheb2EEJH3lveVtDUtdN.html

So when she recovered, the New York City mother became one of the country’s first survivors to donate her blood to help treat other seriously ill patients.“It is definitely overwhelming to know that in my blood, there may be answers,” Pinckney told The Associated Press.Doctors around the world are dusting off a century-old treatment for infections: Infusions of blood plasma teeming with immune molecules that helped survivors beat the new coronavirus. There’s no proof it will work.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here But former patients in Houston and New York were early donors, and now hospitals and blood centres are getting ready for potentially hundreds of survivors to follow.The Food and Drug Administration Friday announced a national study, led by the Mayo Clinic, that will help hospitals offer the experimental plasma therapy and track how they fare. The American Red Cross will help collect and distribute the plasma.“There’s a tremendous call to action,” said Dr. David Reich, president of New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital, which declared Pinckney recovered and raced to collect her blood. “People feel very helpless in the face of this disease. And this is one thing that people can do to help their fellow human beings.” As treatments get underway, “we just hope it works,” he said.What the history books call “convalescent serum” was most famously used during the 1918 flu pandemic, and also against measles, bacterial pneumonia and numerous other infections before modern medicine came along. Why? When infection strikes, the body starts making proteins called antibodies specially designed to target that germ. Those antibodies float in survivors’ blood — specifically plasma, the yellowish liquid part of blood — for months, even years.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage When new diseases erupt and scientists are scrambling for vaccines or drugs, it’s “a stopgap measure that we can put into place quickly,” said Dr. Jeffrey Henderson of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who is helping to develop a nationwide study.This “is not a cure per se, but rather it is a way to reduce the severity of illness,” Henderson said.Doctors don’t know how long survivors’ antibodies against Covid-19 will persist.But for now, “they’re the safest ones on the street,” said Dr. Rebecca Haley of Bloodworks Northwest in Seattle, which is working to identify donors. “We would not be making a dent in their antibody supply for themselves.” Last week, the Food and Drug Administration told hospitals how to seek case-by-case emergency permission to use convalescent plasma, and Houston Methodist Hospital and Mount Sinai jumped at the chance.And a desperate public responded, with families taking to social media to plead on behalf of sick loved ones and people recovering asking how they could donate. According to Michigan State University, more than 1,000 people signed up with the National Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Project alone. Dozens of hospitals formed that group to spur plasma donation and research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-in-my-blood-there-may-be-answers-says-a-covid-19-survivor-in-new-york/story-y12yyLMwNEUCFwieT2O58M.html
04-04-2020||World||‘I choose not to do it’, says Donald Trump after recommending all to wear masks||President Donald Trump on Friday recommended that Americans cover their faces with masks when outdoors, a policy U-turn following growing scientific research suggesting their widespread use can stem the spread of the coronavirus.Trump told a White House briefing that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was urging people to wear face coverings like scarves or homemade cloth masks, but to keep medical-grade masks available for health workers.“It’s going to be really a voluntary thing,” he underlined. “You don’t have to do it and I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it and that’s okay.”The about-face was widely expected after senior health officials told reporters the scientific evidence had evolved.Speaking to Fox News on Friday, Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, cited “recent information that the virus can actually be spread even when people just speak as opposed to coughing and sneezing.”Days earlier, the CDC’s Robert Redfield said up to a quarter of people who are infected may be asymptomatic.Taken together, the developments represent powerful arguments in favor of the widespread use of facial coverings.Previously, the advice was that masks should only be used by sick people and their caregivers.The new recommendations are in line with those made by France’s National Academy of Medicine on Friday, and by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio a day earlier. The city has seen almost 1,000 of the US’s nearly 7,000 deaths. But the message was undermined by the fact that none of the officials present at Friday’s briefing were following it.Trump said he would not be wearing one “as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don’t know, it somehow, I don’t see it for myself.”- Breathing and speaking -Fauci’s comments about the virus’s spread via breathing came after the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) sent a letter to the White House on April 1 summarizing recent research on the subject.It said that though research isn’t yet conclusive, “the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolization of virus from normal breathing.”Until now, US health agencies have said the primary pathway of transmission is respiratory droplets, about one millimeter in diameter, expelled by sick people when they sneeze or cough.These quickly fall to the ground around a meter (three feet) away.But if the virus can be suspended in the ultrafine mist people expel when exhaling -- in other words, an aerosol -- it becomes much harder to prevent its spread. - The aerosol debate -A recent NIH-funded study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could become an aerosol and remain airborne for up to three hours.The paper received widespread attention even as critics said the findings were overblown because researchers had used a medical device called a nebulizer to deliberately create a viral mist, something they argued would not occur naturally.The NAS letter pointed to preliminary research by the University of Nebraska Medical Center that found the genetic code of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, its RNA, in hard-to-reach areas of patients’ isolation rooms.The NAS scientists also cited two other studies -- both not yet peer reviewed -- from Hong Kong and mainland China.The Hong Kong researchers had some patients with coronavirus and other viral respiratory illnesses wear masks, while other patients in the study didn’t cover their faces. They found fewer droplets and aerosols from coronavirus patients who wore masks.The Chinese paper raised concerns that personal protective gear used by health workers could be a source of airborne virus.The team studied hospitals in Wuhan and found two major areas where the virus was aerosolized: patient bathrooms and rooms where medical staff removed protective gear.This may be because doffing protective gear causes particles to get re-suspended in the air. Even if these particles are not of breathable size, they could settle on people’s hands and bodies, the NAS panel said.So far, the World Health Organization has been more cautious on the airborne threat.In an analysis published on March 29, it wrote that aerosol transmission was only known to occur during particular medical treatments that required assisted breathing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-new-research-us-recommends-face-masks-to-stop-virus-spread/story-61woogevvs0GTowwP9KUbL.html

We continue to honour his legacy as a courageous journalist and demand justice for his brutal murder,” Pompeo tweeted.The United States on Friday criticised the Pakistani court for overturning the death sentence of Sheikh, calling the verdict an “affront” to victims of terrorism everywhere.“The overturning of the convictions for Daniel Pearl’s murder is an affront to victims of terrorism everywhere,” Alice Wells, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, said in a tweet.But the top diplomat for South Asia, however, welcomed Pakistani prosecutors’ indications that they would appeal the decision.“We welcome Pakistan’s decision to appeal the verdict. Those responsible for Daniel’s heinous kidnapping and murder must face the full measure of justice,” Wells said.Ahmed Omer Saeed Sheikh, the terrorist who had been convicted of the 2002 abduction and murder of journalist Daniel Pearl, had his death sentence commuted to a prison term of seven years by a Pakistani court on Thursday.The Sindh high court ruling came in response to appeals by Sheikh and three other men convicted in connection for the killing of the Wall Street Journal journalist.The high court overturned the verdict of an anti-terrorism court.Sheikh (46), a British citizen of Pakistani origin, was freed by India with Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Masood Azhar and terrorist Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar in exchange for the passengers of Indian Airlines flight IC-814, which was hijacked by a group of Pakistani terrorists and taken to Kandahar in December 1999.The murder conviction of Sheikh was overturned by the high court, which found him guilty of the lesser charge of kidnapping, for which he was given the seven-year prison term.The court also acquitted and set free the three other men – Fahad Naseem, Salman Saqib and Sheikh Adil, who were earlier sentenced to life imprisonment.Daniel Pearl was an American national and the South Asia bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal. He was kidnapped in Karachi on January 23, 2002 and later beheaded by his abductors.The four men were convicted by the anti-terrorism court on July 15, 2002. They filed appeals in the high court four days later.Pakistan’s Sindh province government on Friday invoked the Maintenance of Public Order to keep in jail the British-born al-Qaeda leader. He has been in jail for the past 18 years.The Sindh government acted swiftly to invoke the MPO which allows it to keep the four convicts behind bars for three months.According to a notification issued by the Sindh Home Ministry, the release of Sheikh and his three associates could jeopardize the law and order situation in the province, thus necessitating their continued detention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-not-forget-daniel-pearl-says-pompeo-demands-justice-for-scribe-s-murder/story-ZfGB842kq0h88NQ1BZAnOM.html

A statement from the royal family said the message will be addressed to the UK as well as the 54 countries in the Commonwealth, including India.The special address reflects the seriousness of the situation: it will be her only fourth such address at a time of national crisis during her 68-year reign, besides the annual Christmas Day message. She previously delivered such special messages after the Queen Mother’s death in 2002, before the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, and during the First Gulf War in 1991. She also delivered a televised address to mark her Diamond Jubilee in 2012.As the number of cases rose to 38,168 in the UK, Prince Charles opened the mega hospital – called the NHS Nightingale Hospital – in the sprawling ExCel Centre in east London, which was converted into the hospital with 4,000 beds in nine days with the help of Britain’s armed forces.More such hospitals in large public spaces are due to open in Cardiff, Glasgow, Manchester, Harrogate and Bristol. The prince of Wales, who recently recovered from the virus, inaugurated the hospital via video-link from his home in Birkhall, Scotland, saying he is “one of the lucky ones to have Covid-19 mildly”.He said at the opening event: “It is without doubt a spectacular and almost unbelievable feat of work in every sense, from its speed of construction - in just nine days as we’ve heard - to its size and the skills of those who have created it”.“An example, if ever one was needed, of how the impossible could be made possible and how we can achieve the unthinkable through human will and ingenuity”.Health secretary Matt Hancock added: “In these troubled times with this invisible killer stalking the whole world, the fact that in this country we have the NHS is even more valuable than before. It is the best of efforts. It is the best of the NHS”.“And it is the best of Britain to come together in these difficult circumstances to put together such a facility, at such pace, that will be there for people so that we can give the very best care. And so that as a nation we can come through this crisis in the best way we possibly can”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-queen-to-address-coronavirus-crisis-in-special-tv-broadcast/story-m3me9jS6mWNWk8D6x0JcXJ.html
04-04-2020||World||‘Superheroes’: Coronavirus survivors donate plasma hoping to heal the sick||As she emerges from quarantine, recovered COVID-19 patient Diana Berrent is eager to join the battle against the pandemic and donate precious antibodies that researchers hope might help others.In mid-March, the New Yorker woke up with a 102-degree (39 Celsius) fever and intense chest heaviness, becoming one of the first from her Long Island neighborhood to test positive for coronavirus.This week, Berrent was the first survivor in her state screened for antibodies -- immune system-generated proteins that can ward off viruses -- to contribute to initial tests seeking treatment for the infection that’s left more than 51,000 people dead worldwide.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageConvalescent plasma, the fluid in blood teeming with antibodies post-illness, has proven effective in small studies to treat infectious diseases including Ebola and SARS.Now, the US Food and Drug Administration has greenlit physicians to experiment with the strategy as coronavirus patients fill hospitals and the nation’s positive caseload spikes to over 236,000.Bruce Sachias, chief medical officer of the New York Blood Center -- which will collect, test and distribute donations in the city -- said while there is reason to believe plasma transfusions can help alleviate the current crisis, tests underway are not intended to yield golden-ticket solutions.“It’s really important for us to be very cognizant of the fact that we’re still in very new territory,” he said.- Crisis mode -Eldad Hod and Steven Spitalnik -- transfusion medicine doctors leading trials at Columbia University’s Irving Medical Center -- are cautiously optimistic but, like Sachias, emphasize the unknowns.Spitalnik told AFP they believe “within seven to 14 days after the onset of an infection, that people will develop an immune response and eventually make high amounts of antibodies -- although exactly when the peak of antibody production will be, we don’t know.”He said some data suggests antibody production could peak around 28 days post-infection, and hopes the new research could provide a clearer picture.Hod said each donation “can potentially save three to four lives.”The primary goal now is acquiring a significant plasma stock, so researchers can conduct formal studies with control groups who would receive non-convalescent plasma, and others the antibody-packed donations.Initial plasma, however, will be distributed for “compassionate use,” Hod said -- to patients outside studies but for whom other strategies have failed. They also aim to test treatments on already-hospitalized patients and as a preventative therapy in settings like nursing homes.Spitalnik said that normally they would want “highly controlled” clinical trials, which take longer but are more definitive.But “this is a crisis,” he said. “We understand and we are amenable to doing things that will take shorter amounts of time -- but hopefully we’ll yield at least some rigorous results.”- Internal hazmat suit -Berrent is eager to open her personal blood bank and crossing her fingers in hope the process can prove life-saving.“We can be superheroes,” the 45-year-old photographer told AFP.“These are unprecedented, frightening times where everything is beyond our control -- except for we as survivors can help,” Berrent said.“We can be the ones running towards the fire in our own internally built hazmat suit. And that is a tremendous opportunity -- how could you not take advantage of that?”Berrent’s antibody levels met donation requirements -- but she is waiting on results of a nasal swab test to make sure any remnants of coronavirus have dissipated.In the meantime, she’s started the more than 17,000-member Facebook group “Survivor Corps” to mobilize other survivors to share their immunity.“I can’t wait to donate,” Berrent said. “We need a forward-looking solution-based approach that offers hope because things are very, very bleak right now.”- ‘Science will win’ -A Houston hospital has already transfused plasma from a recovered patient into someone critically ill, though it’s still too early to determine efficacy.Sachias said hundreds of people who believe they have recovered from COVID-19 have applied to help in New York, the US epicenter of the highly contagious virus that accounts for nearly half of related deaths stateside.As their research gets underway, Hod said one silver lining of coronavirus’ global scale has been the boost to collaborative scientific efforts, saying data is being shared more openly than ever before.“I think a lot of the scientific community has tried to put their egos aside... and banded together to try and work together for the common good,” he said. “And I think in the end, science will win.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/superheroes-coronavirus-survivors-donate-plasma-hoping-to-heal-the-sick/story-iTnPjccx6iXPTg8S4OR1rN.html
