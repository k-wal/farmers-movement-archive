Both will be important in getting people back into the workplace and containing the virus as that happens, the experts said.“When one starts to relax some of those restrictions, we know that there will be people who will be getting infected. I mean, that is just reality,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”“The critical issue is to be able to, in real time, identify, isolate and contact trace. That’s called containment.”The FDA is working with developers around the country to try to ramp up diagnostic testing, Hahn said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “So all hands on deck to try to get more diagnostic tests in.”The FDA has approved one antibody test and Hahn warned that some other tests on the market may not be accurate.Governor Phil Murphy said New Jersey has been able to test only symptomatic patients and needs more testing to stay ahead of the virus.He told CBS “Face the Nation” he had been in intense discussions over the weekend with leaders in neighboring states “on the whole question of testing, contact tracing, what are the rules of the road going to be for things like bars and restaurants to make sure we don’t have unintended consequences on one side of the river versus the other.”His New York counterpart, Andrew Cuomo, said on Sunday they needed more tests, more federal help and a public health strategy that is consistent with an economic strategy.“The last thing we want to see is an uptick in the infection rate,” Cuomo told reporters.New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio said he was pleading with the White House and FEMA for more testing to go beyond prioritized hospitalized patients, healthcare workers and first responders.De Blasio told reporters he wanted a “Phase Two” test plan to focus on communities of color, low-income communities and immigrants and said he needed 110,000 individual testing kits this week.To reopen safely, U.S. communities must be able to verify whether anyone who has symptoms has contracted the disease, said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University.“Right now, we can’t do that in most places in the country, there’s just not enough capacity. We need to be able to have the capacity,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-experts-stress-need-for-widespread-coronavirus-testing/story-qwKD0qId1oxtR1sA74vM0J.html
12-04-2020||World||Italy coronavirus deaths rise by 431, fewest in more than three weeks||Italy reported 431 new coronavirus deaths in the past day, the fewest in more than three weeks, as declining numbers of intensive care patients pointed to a lessening severity of the country’s outbreak.The daily count is the lowest since March 19, when Italy registered 427 dead.Italy’s new deaths linked to the virus in the last 24 hours compared with 619 the day before. That brings the total number of fatalities to 19,899. Italy has had more deaths than any other country in Europe. It was surpassed globally by the United States yesterday.Italy reported 4,092 new cases of the disease, compared with 4,694 a day earlier, civil protection officials said.The thousands of new cases come as testing surges. The approximately 200,000 tests performed in the past four days comprise a fifth of the the roughly 1 million total in Italy during the outbreak, according to civil protection figures compiled by Bloomberg.Confirmed cases in the country now total 156,363.In another sign of improvement, the number of patients in intensive care declined for an ninth straight day after having risen steadily through April 3 to a peak of 4,068.“The worst of the first big wave of the epidemic is exhausting itself,” Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at Milan’s Sacco hospital, said in an interview today with Sky TG24 television. “Things are going better because fewer people need an intensive care bed.”The improvement was the result of the strict measures that have largely shut down public activity in Italy for more than a month, Galli said.On Friday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced he was extending Italy’s nationwide lockdown until May 3, rejecting pressure from businesses and opposition politicians who’ve clamored to restart the economy. His decision reflected moves across Europe, where many health officials and politicians, hoping to stem a second wave of the pandemic, are warning against letting up on restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-coronavirus-deaths-rise-by-431-fewest-in-more-than-three-weeks/story-0XbRXojpDAHky6kf6D6PGJ.html
12-04-2020||World||Covid-19 US toll grows, as do media accounts of Donald Trump’s missteps||As the United States went from one coronavirus death on February 29 to more than 20,600 Sunday, media accounts are growing of the Trump administration’s response beset by unheeded warnings, delays and the president’s own reluctance to acknowledge the seriousness of the crisis.The New York Times added to the growing litany of these accounts Saturday reporting that President Donald Trump and his administered squandered precious time over January, February and up until mid-March when mitigation efforts went into full force. He had focussed on other things, it said, in a long report, despite the fact that “an array of figures inside his government — from top White House advisers to experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies — identified the threat, sounded alarms and made clear the need for aggressive action.”.Associated Press reported Sunday a similar state of paralysis in the administration as it failed to stockpile medical supplies, impose travel restrictions in time and as the president seemed consumed by the impeachment trial and the White House was low to act, riven by infighting and turnover of personnel.The Washington Post nailed the dysfunction in the administration way back on April 4, and reported that because of the missed warnings, in echoes of the failures leading up to the 9/11 attacks, the United States “ will likely go down as the country that was supposedly best prepared to fight a pandemic but ended up catastrophically overmatched by the novel coronavirus, sustaining heavier casualties than any other nation”.The United States on Monday had the highest number of fatalities at 20,646, with 1,920 reported in the last 24 hours; and the most confirmed cases with 530,000. It now accounts for a fifth of the global toll of 110, 052 and nearly a third of all the confirmed cases, 1.7 million.New York state remained the worst hit with 1818,825 confirmed cases and 8,650 death, up by 758. The toll in New York City, the epicenter of the American outbreak, went up to 6,367. Federal and state officials have, however, pointed to a drop in hospitalization and “flattening” of other metrics to express optimism the situation may be improving. New York city mayor Bill de Blasio announced the schools and educational institutions will remain closed for the remainder of the academic year and will reopen in September. But Governor Andrew Cuomo has other ideas and told reporters there was a need for a state-wide decision on the issue.New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Louisiana were among the other states with high incidence of infections of fatalities.As a reflection of the magnitude of the crisis confronting the country, Wyoming on Saturday became the last state to go under disaster declaration, a federal measure that paves the way for enhanced federal help. All 50 states are under these disaster provisions now, for the first time in US history.Essential medical supplies such as masks, gowns and ventilators remain an issue, despite ramped up production at home and purchases abroad. The defense department is jumping in with $133 million to manufacture 40 million N-95 masks over the next three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-toll-grows-as-do-media-accounts-of-donald-trump-s-missteps/story-eMAt5BiljIkTfvErUX5KGI.html

The toll was 510 on Saturday, the lowest since March 23.But the number of new infections continued its slow, rising by 4,167 to 166,019, a smaller increase than was recorded on Saturday.Although health chiefs say the pandemic has peaked, they have urged the population to strictly follow a national lockdown which was put in place on March 14 in order to reduce the spread of the virus. “We are still far from victory, from the moment when he will recover normality in our lives,” Sanchez said during a televised address.“We are all keen to go back out on the streets... but out desire is even greater to win the war and prevent a relapse,” he added.His comments come as Spain braced for the reopening of some sectors of its economy, with some factory and construction workers set to return to work on Monday.The government on March 30 tightened the lockdown by halting all non-essential activities for two weeks but this measure is now about to be lifted, drawing criticism from some regional leaders and unions.Police will hand out face masks at metro and train stations on Monday as some companies re-open after this so-called “economic hibernation” period.‘Gradual’ left of restrictions The rest of the lockdown restrictions in the nation of around 47 million people will remain in place until April 25 although the government has made clear it expects to announce another two-week extension.They prevent people from going outside except to go to work if they can not do so from home, buy food, seek medical care and briefly walk their dog.Sanchez warned on Sunday that Spain had not entered the “second phase” in the fight against the coronavirus of a “de-escalation” of lockdown measures “which will start at the earliest in two weeks and will be very gradual and very prudent”.“Health will always be the priority,” he added.Earlier on Sunday Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto warned that rules on social distancing will remain in place this summer “even on the beach”.“Until there is a vaccine nothing will be the way it was before,” she added in an interview published in daily newspaper El Pais.Spain is the world’s second-most visited country after France and tourism is crucial for the domestic economy, making up nearly 12 percent of gross domestic product.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-far-from-victory-in-coronavirus-fight-says-pm-pedro-sanchez/story-AJRnEpUQiLWqlAfiGTAyLK.html
12-04-2020||World||PM Boris discharged from hospital, a week after being admitted for Covid-19||Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on Sunday moved from St Thomas’ hospital to the country house of Chequers in Buckinghamshire to rest and recuperate from coronavirus, as a senior government advisor admitted the UK could have the worst death rate in Europe.With Saturday figures putting the death toll at 9,875, the weekend is set to see the figure cross 10,000. The government’s medical advisors believe that if the eventual figure is below 20,000, “it will have done well”.In his first statement after emerging from ICU, Johnson thanked doctors: “I can’t thank them enough. I owe them my life.”A Downing Street spokesman later said: “The PM has been discharged from hospital to continue his recovery, at Chequers. On the advice of his medical team, the PM will not be immediately returning to work”. “He wishes to thank everybody at St Thomas’ for the brilliant care he has received. All of his thoughts are with those affected by this illness.”The UK parliament is due to reopen virtually on April 21. Queen Elizabeth continued an optimistic note to the country in a rare Easter message: “Coronavirus will not overcome us…We need Easter as much as ever…As dark as death can be - particularly for those suffering with grief - light and life are greater”.Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies said on Sunday that the UK is likely to see the worst death rate in Europe.He told BBC: “The numbers in the UK have continued to go up. I do hope we’re coming close to the number of new infections reducing … and the number of deaths plateauing and starting to come down”.“And yes, the UK is likely to be certainly one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe”.Farrar added that a second or third wave of the virus “was probably inevitable” and treatment and a vaccine was “our only true exit strategy”. A vaccine could be available by autumn but it would take longer to ramp up manufacturing to the scale required to vaccinate many millions.“I would hope we would get (that) done in 12 months but that is in itself an unprecedented ambition,” he said.As medical professionals continued to complain of lack of personal protection equipment while treating patients, new details of those contracting and dying from the virus include pharmacist Pooja Sharma, who worked at the Eastbourne General Hospital in east Sussex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-boris-discharged-uk-may-have-europe-s-worst-death-rate/story-OghXOTrD8PgdCabUUJLK9J.html

Nirav Modi, who is wanted in India to face charges of major financial offences, is due to appear by videolink from the Wandsworth prison for another remand extension hearing on April 15.Assange’s partner, Stella Moris, 37, revealed in the Mail on Sunday that Assange had watched the births of both children in London hospitals via live videolink, adding that both boys had visited him in prison, and that they were planning to marry, whether Assange is released or not.There were genuine fears of Assange’s health, the South Africa-born lawyer said. His next extradition hearing is due in the Westminster Magistrates Court on May 18.The Observer reported that as part of the bail application, Moris revealed in that they began a relationship when she interacted with him on extradition’s legal issues in 2011: “Over time Julian and I developed a strong intellectual and emotional bond. He became my best friend and I became his,” she wrote.Moris said she had gone to great lengths to protect the couple’s children, adding that she was making the statement now because their lives were “on the brink” and she feared Assange could die. According to her, Assange is in isolation for 23 hours a day and all visits have stopped.“My close relationship with Julian has been the opposite of how he is viewed – of reserve, respect for each other and attempts to shield each other from some of the nightmares that have surrounded our lives together,” Moris said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/julian-assange-seeks-bail-fearing-coronavirus-in-jail/story-01TPbIQBuUIAq1v1AdAgWK.html

People in the city of 7.4 million have made a point of wearing masks in the past months.“We always stay at home and it is quite boring,” said Banny Mak, 24, a local resident.“We are social animal(s), we need to go out for some fun. I think with proper protection (for) ourselves and to protect other people. I think it is already ok to go out.”Hong Kong has recorded 1,005 cases of COVID-19, which has killed four people in the city.It banned public gatherings of more than four people for 14 days from March 29, after recording the biggest daily increase in new COVID-19 infections, and later extended that restriction until April 23.Police have been visible in some of the popular sites, although there were no signs or reports of arrests in a city where pro-democracy activists who clashed with security forces regularly last year have paused their demonstrations.While Hong Kong, along with Singapore and Taiwan, have been held up as examples in their efforts to curb the coronavirus, the widespread flouting of social distancing rules over the weekend threatens to derail the city’s efforts so far.“I was a little bit scared when I was on the MTR (metro)... there were so many people,” said resident Irene Chong, 24. “I (am) concerned, but I wear mask and bring alcohol (disinfectant) and stuff.”In a Facebook post on Saturday, the Chinese-ruled city’s leader Carrie Lam urged citizens to comply with social distancing orders in restaurants and said the government would ramp up checks.“But the most important thing is that customers oblige by the rules. I hope everybody will feel at ease when eating, and go home early,” she wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-social-animals-hong-kong-residents-flout-coronavirus-rules-to-throng-popular-sites/story-GPW3BsdA44OkOk9zt16tOM.html

The travellers accounted for more than half of 97 imported infections China disclosed on Sunday morning. No other information was provided about the flight.Russia has emerged as a fresh source of imported virus infections for China, which seems to have tamed its own outbreak and has now pivoted toward staving off cases from elsewhere. China has grounded all but one inbound flight per week for foreign airlines in a bid to limit imported cases, but new infections have also found their way back to the country through land borders, especially the one with Russia.China’s northeastern Heilongjiang province has reported more than 100 imported infections from Russia at its land borders so far this month. Russia is tightening a lockdown of its capital amid a worsening spread of the virus that is straining local health systems.Russia on Sunday reported the number of new coronavirus cases in the country increased by 31% overnight to 2,186. That took the total to 15,770. Twenty-four deaths related to Covid-19 were reported, double the count in the previous period and bringing the nation’s total to 130.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-russian-flight-had-half-of-covid-19-infections-found-in-china-on-saturday/story-kRS2ACz8Wp8DnCHqbj6tuO.html

The outbreak has killed more than 2,200 people since August 2018 in an area of the country where militia violence hobbled efforts to contain it.The latest victim was an 11-month-old girl, who was treated at the same health centre as the previous case, a 26-year-old electrician, said Boubacar Diallo, deputy incident manager for the WHO’s Ebola response.It is not yet clear how the electrician contracted Ebola. He had no known contacts with other Ebola patients and was not a survivor of the virus who could have relapsed, the government said on Friday.Flare-ups or one-off transmissions are common towards the end of Ebola outbreaks, and a new case does not necessarily mean that the virus will spread out of control again.The WHO has identified 215 people who came into contact with the electrician, including 53 health workers at three facilities the man visited before he died, Diallo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congo-records-second-ebola-death-in-days-who/story-kOOx0feC0h0CYw7xJ66h8L.html

The Taliban cautioned that their decision to release a group of prisoners did not mean that the talks with Kabul were being restarted. “No the process is not back on, but this is a good will step by the [the Taliban] to accelerate the prisoners exchange process,” insurgent spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP.Javid Faisal, the spokesman for the Afghan National Security Council, chided the insurgents for not starting the process earlier, saying a reduction in violence and subsequent ceasefire between the two sides was needed. “They should also prepare for a face-to-face meeting with the Islamic republic of Afghanistan,” said Faisal. The insurgents have also stepped up their attacks on Afghan security forces in government-controlled areas across the country and accused US forces of aiding the Afghan government with air support, causing civilian casualties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-set-to-release-first-prisoners-in-fragile-afghan-exchange/story-skn3BO8YmnlFyCnO4swLBN.html

Other Gulf states have taken similar precautions.The interior ministry said all precautionary measures across Saudi Arabia’s 13 regions remain in place.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe eastern Qatif region, where its first coronavirus cases were reported among Shi’ite Muslim pilgrims returning from Iran, has been sealed off since March 8.The United Arab Emirates, the region’s tourism and business hub, has the second highest tally at 3,736 cases with 20 deaths.Several Gulf Arab states have seen the virus spread among low-wage foreign workers, many of whom live in overcrowded accommodations.Qatar has locked down a large section of an industrial area, Dubai has sealed off two commercial districts with a large population of migrant workers, and Oman has closed off its Muscat governorate, which includes the capital.Millions of migrant workers, mainly from Asian countries, including Nepal, India and the Philippines, are among the region’s large expatriate population.India’s ambassador to the UAE told local English-language daily Gulf News on Saturday that the Indian government cannot repatriate a large number of its nationals while trying to break the chain of infection at home. “At this stage, we feel that it is best for them (Indians wishing to return home) to stay where they are,” Pavan Kapoor was quoted as saying. “Once the lockdown in India is lifted, we will certainly help them get back to their home towns and their families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-extends-coronavirus-curfew-indefinitely/story-C6tnJ8h9tUYKierWLxnhhI.html

Ri Son Gwon, who was named the North’s top diplomat in January, was also elected as an alternate member of the Political Bureau alongside Kim’s sister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-sister-rises-in-north-korea-hierarchy-reinstated-in-key-decision-making-body/story-EFd69LFjsBGGMPJuU5pE2O.html

But there are worries about a steady rise in infections linked to those arriving from overseas and recent transmissions at bars and other leisure facilities.

12-04-2020||World||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fathered two kids with lawyer in Ecuador embassy: Report||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fathered two children with one of his lawyers while holed up in Ecuador’s embassy in London for much of the past decade, a report on Sunday said. The 48-year-old Australian is allegedly the dad of two boys -- aged two and one -- born to South African-born lawyer Stella Morris, the Mail on Sunday reported. The newspaper published the report alongside photographs of Assange with the toddlers and an interview with Morris who said they “fell in love” and were planning to marry. The couple have been engaged since 2017, according to the paper, which said it learned about the revelations in court papers seen last week. Assange is being held in London’s high security Belmarsh prison as he fights an extradition request by the United States to stand trial there on espionage charges. The Mail on Sunday said Morris chose to reveal their relationship and the existence of their sons because “she fears Assange’s life is at serious risk if he remains in Belmarsh”, due to the spread of coronavirus. Morris wants the one-time hacker released under British government plans to allow some prisoners temporary release, amid fears Covid-19 could sweep through jails. But Assange last month failed in a bail bid based on his risk of catching the virus, with a British judge saying there were “no grounds” for his release. Assange’s lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.WikiLeaks responded to the report on Twitter. “Julian Assange’s newly revealed partner, mother of their 2 young children, urges UK government to bail him and other vulnerable prisoners as #coronavirus sweeps prisons,” it said. The whistleblowing organisation posted its own video interview with Morris soon after, in which she detailed her purported five-year relationship with Assange. Assange faces charges under the US Espionage Act for the 2010 release of a trove of secret files detailing aspects of US military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. He ensconced himself in the Ecuadoran embassy in 2012 after skipping bail to avoid separate legal proceedings in Sweden, but was finally dragged out last year. He reportedly conceived the first child with Morris in 2016, according to the Mail on Sunday. The couple had begun a relationship the previous year while the lawyer visited him to work on his legal situation, it said. Assange watched the birth of both children in London hospitals via live video-link and met the elder boy, named Gabriel, after he was smuggled into the embassy, the paper added. Both boys are said to be British citizens and have reportedly visited their father in prison. Morris told the Mail on Sunday: “I love Julian deeply and I am looking forward to marrying him. “Julian has been fiercely protective of me and has done his best to shield me from the nightmares of his life.” She said she had lived “quietly and privately”, raising Gabriel and his brother Max, while “longing for the day we could be together as a family”. Morris added: “Now I have to speak out because I can see that his life is on the brink.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-fathered-two-kids-with-lawyer-in-ecuador-embassy-report/story-gPyAXlqP19joDcnEVhOsVP.html

Aside from China, South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the virus.Recorded cases of infection across 193 countries now exceed one 1.7 million, including more than 108,000 deaths, according to an AFP tally Sunday based on official country data and WHO figures.sh/je||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-calls-for-stronger-covid-19-measures-avoids-wearing-mask/story-eYZfixQwoOPPDXwNehSwdP.html

Watch| Pope Francis celebrates Easter vigil in empty church, delivers a ‘message of hope’ “The virus will decide” when the country can begin to reopen from state-at-home orders imposed in recent weeks across 42 states, he added.Those measures have taken a staggering toll on American commerce, with some economists forecasting job losses of up to 20 million by month’s end, raising questions about how long business closures and travel restrictions can be sustained.The Trump administration renewed talk of quickly reopening the economy after an influential university research model this week lowered its U.S. mortality forecasts to 60,000 deaths by Aug. 4, from at least 100,000, assuming that social-distancing measures remain in place. The New York Times cited separate forecasts from the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services projecting the death toll could reach 200,000 if stay-at-home orders are lifted after 30 days.The United States by far accounts for most of the world’s confirmed cases of Covid-19, the highly contagious lung ailment caused by the novel coronavirus, with at least 500,000 known infections and more than 18,600 deaths. Only Italy has recorded more fatalities.Prisons and jails, along with nursing homes and other institutions with large populations confined in close quarters, have proven especially vulnerable to outbreaks, with hundreds of infections and several deaths reported among inmates in Illinois, New York and Louisiana. On Friday, officials said 68 residents and two staff members at a San Francisco homeless shelter had tested positive, marking one of the largest known clusters of coronavirus infections yet in such a facility anywhere in the country.The outbreak there seemed at odds with promising data presented by California Governor Gavin Newsom showing that social distancing has worked so far to flatten the arc of infections in his state.New York state, the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic with some 7,800 deaths to date, likewise has seen glimmers of hope this week.After three days of record daily deaths, New York state’s Covid-19 toll from April 9 stood at 777, down from 799 deaths a day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo reported on Friday. But New York’s ICU admissions declined “for the first time since we started this journey,” he said.In Michigan, more than 200 people died from Covid-19 in the last day. “We are not out of the woods yet,” Governor Gretchen Whitmer said.GOOD FRIDAY AT A DISTANCEAt his daily White House briefing, President Donald Trump said he was receiving fewer calls from governors urgently seeking equipment and help.Meanwhile, with more than 90% of the country under stay-at-home orders, the holiest weekend on the Christian calendar began with services livestreamed or broadcast to congregants watching from home. Many churches sat empty on Good Friday, when they would typically be overflowing with worshipers.“We gather normally at Easter to worship. We gather for children’s Easter egg hunts, for family meals, with friends. We can’t do any of that this year,” said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy lamented to reporters.“I’m really missing the community aspect of being with everyone,” said Rebecca Swindle, a 26-year-old mother of two in central Florida whose church began holding virtual services five weeks ago to help curb coronavirus transmission. Swindle said she planned to watch a livestream of Good Friday evening prayers - normally “a huge gathering of worshiping God” - and to promote her church’s online Easter service on her Facebook profile.One megachurch in South Carolina turned to the model of once-popular drive-in movies, presenting services filmed live and shown on a big screen with the audio broadcast over the radio to worshipers in their cars. A handful of holdout U.S. churches planned to go ahead with in-person Easter Sunday services, saying their rights to worship outweighed public health warnings.“Satan and a virus will not stop us,” said the Reverend Tony Spell, pastor of the evangelical Life Tabernacle Church near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He expects more than 2,000 to gather at his megachurch on Sunday.FOOD DRIVE DRAWS THOUSANDSFriday also ended another week of missed paychecks for millions of Americans, with restaurants, businesses, entertainment venues and schools shuttered across the nation.In Los Angeles, some 5,000 families waited at the Forum arena to pick up food in a Good Friday donation drive.“This is slated to be our biggest distribution to date,” said Michael Flood, head of the LA Regional Food Bank. “It’s continuing to demonstrate just how many families and individuals the current economic conditions have hit.”At the other end of the food supply chain, a beef production plant in Greeley, Colorado, owned by meatpacking company JBS USA said it would spend more than $1 million for coronavirus testing kits to screen its workers after 36 employees became infected.Two employees have died of Covid-19, according to the union representing workers at the plant. The company said it was shutting down over the holiday weekend to “further enhance previously announced deep cleaning efforts at the facility.” New York plans to open coronavirus testing sites in five minority neighborhoods to improve testing in a population that has been hit disproportionately hard. Several U.S. states have reported Covid-19 deaths among blacks and Hispanics far higher than their portion of the population.African Americans comprise 70% of Louisiana’s coronavirus deaths but only a third of its population, said Governor John Bel Edwards, whose state has reported 755 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/empty-churches-food-drive-mark-start-of-easter-weekend-in-coronavirus-hit-us/story-sJ0eK2liD0YXDfO2C8bz8M.html

The number of cases was up to 529,740.Crates of Hydroxychloroquine covered in blue protective wrapping were offloaded from a cargo flight from India at the Newark international airport in New Jersey which is also among the hardest-hit states in the country. Ordered by the United States in March, the drugs were possibly headed for the federal stockpile from which they will be distributed. Supporting our partners in the fight against #Covid19.

Consignment of hydroxychloroquine from India arrived at Newark airport today,” Taranjit Sandhu, Indian ambassador to the United States wrote in a tweet with a picture of the packages being carted away at the airport.India lifted restrictions on the export of Hydroxychloroquine and a bunch of other drugs earlier in the week at the request of President Trump in a phone call last Saturday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Thanking India for the “HCQ decision”, he has since said it “will not be forgotten”.The American president has been advocating the use of Hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus disease despite no evidence that it works. He has argued that it has been used to treat malaria for decades and is proven to be safe and patients have nothing to lose by trying it. Medical experts have warned, however, of side-effects that can be fatal.The Food and Drug Administration, the US drug regulator, first allowed it to be prescribed by physicians to severely ill patients under “compassionate use” guidance and then sanctioned a large-scale trial among the ailing in New York, the epicentre of the American outbreak.India is one of the world’s largest producers of Hydroxychloroquine but it had ordered an export ban on it and two dozen other medicines to shore up its own reserves in the wake of the epidemic. Those restrictions were removed earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-antimalarial-drug-cleared-at-trump-s-request-arrives-from-india-as-us-toll-overtakes-italy-s/story-0lYk1dNESRtJ8LbvRTt0TP.html

But, it could not deter Pakistani citizens from travelling to the coronavirus-hit Iran in large numbers for pilgrimage.Senge also said that Pakistan’s failure to impose a nationwide lockdown will result in a surge of coronavirus cases. He praised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for swift action by imposing a countrywide lockdown.Senge said: “As one of the most accomplished Indian politicians, PM Modi holds immense respect and leverage among the country’s people. This will help him take decisive actions to control the China Virus. But more important than this is cooperation from the governments of all States and Union Territories.”He added: “Pakistan, which is one of the worst-hit countries among SAARC members, should follow PM Modi and lockdown the country to minimize fatalities. PM Imran Khan’s failed policies are turning occupied Gilgit Baltistan into an epicentre of China Virus.”In Pakistan, the Covid-19 cases have sharply increased to 4,788 and the toll has reached 71, officials said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-in-gilgit-surge-as-pak-sends-iran-returned-pilgrims-to-the-region-says-activist/story-QDarUmYuttwp55ZGlrexdL.html
12-04-2020||World||Amid Covid-19 lockdown, European nations see drop in electricity consumption||An independent European think-tank called Bruegel has come up with research that shows the pattern of electricity consumption in selected countries in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown. As the Covid-19 pandemic has shut schools, schools and offices across the globe, electricity consumption by nations has witnessed a slump. With people working from home and no one really leaving the house under lockdown situations, people might think this would be bumping up their electricity cost, but keeping the bigger picture in mind, the lockdown has significantly slashed energy consumption at the macrocosmic level.The economic think tank, in its study, analysed electricity consumption in some European nations with the corresponding day (April 10) last year. It was found that Italy, which has been most badly hit by coronavirus among all European nations, witnessed as much as 27% less electricity consumption as compared to the same day in 2019. The study also factored in other European nations like Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, among others.As per the analysis, Spain had consumed 21% less electricity on April 10 this year as compared to the same day in 2019. France saw 16% less electricity this year on April 10 as compared to 2019 while the UK saw a reduction of 14%.The analysis painted a peculiar picture for Germany which saw just 8% reduction in its electricity consumption this April 10 as opposed to the same day last year. More than a million people have been infected by the deadly contagion while over 80,000 have lost their lives to Covid-19 worldwide. The US death toll from coronavirus eclipsed Italy’s for the highest in the world on Saturday, surpassing 20,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-lockdown-european-nations-see-sharp-decline-in-electricity-consumption/story-oLIPAbFwIOk8DPc3iDqPzM.html
12-04-2020||World||US Covid-19 death toll highest in world, crosses 20,000 to overtake Italy’s||The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus eclipsed Italy’s for the highest in the world Saturday, surpassing 20,000, as Chicago and other cities across the Midwest braced for a potential surge in victims and moved to snuff out smoldering hot spots of contagion before they erupt.With the New York area still deep in crisis, fear mounted over the spread of the scourge into the nation’s heartland.Twenty-four residents of an Indiana nursing home hit by COVID-19 have died, while a nursing home in Iowa saw 14 deaths. Chicago’s Cook County has set up a temporary morgue that can take more than 2,000 bodies. And Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has been going around telling groups of people to “break it up.”In Europe, countries used roadblocks, drones, helicopters, mounted patrols and the threat of fines to keep people from traveling over Easter weekend. And with infections and deaths slowing in Italy, Spain and other places on the Continent, governments took tentative steps toward loosening the weeks-long shutdowns.Glorious weather across Europe posed an extra test of people’s discipline.“Don’t do silly things,” said Domenico Arcuri, Italy’s special commissioner for the virus emergency. “Don’t go out, continue to behave responsibly as you have done until today, use your head and your sense of responsibility.”The outbreak’s center of gravity has long since shifted from China to Europe and the United States, which now has by far the largest number of confirmed cases — over a half-million — and a death toll higher than Italy’s count of nearly 19,500, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.The death rate — that is, the number of dead relative to the population — is still far higher in Italy than in U.S., which has more than five times as many people. And worldwide, the true numbers of dead and infected are believed to be much higher because of testing shortages, different counting practices and concealment by some governments.About half the deaths in the U.S. are in the New York metropolitan area, where hospitalizations are nevertheless slowing and other indicators suggest lockdowns and social distancing are “flattening the curve” of infections and staving off the doomsday scenarios of just a week or two ago.New York state on Saturday reported 783 more deaths, for a total over 8,600. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the daily number of deaths is stabilizing “but stabilizing at a horrific rate.”“What do we do now? We stay the course,” said Cuomo, who like other leaders has warned that relaxing restrictions too soon could enable the virus to come back with a vengeance.With authorities warning that the crisis in New York is far from over, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city’s 1.1 million-student school system will remain closed for the rest of the academic year. But Cuomo said the decision is up to him, and no such determination has been made.In the Midwest, pockets of contagion have alarmed state and city leaders and led to stricter enforcement.Nearly 300 inmates at the Cook County Jail have tested positive for the virus, and two have died. In Wisconsin, health officials expect to see an increase in coronavirus cases after thousands of people went to the polls during Wisconsin’s presidential primary Tuesday.Michigan’s governor extended her state’s stay-at-home order with new provisions: People with multiple homes may no longer travel between them.And in Kansas, the state Supreme Court heard arguments in a dispute Saturday between Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and Republican lawmakers who overturned her executive order banning religious services and funerals with more than 10 people.Elsewhere around the world, Italian authorities set up roadblocks around Milan to discourage people from going on Easter weekend trips. British police kept a close watch on gatherings in parks and at the seaside on one of the hottest days of the year. And France deployed some 160,000 police, including officers on horseback who patrolled beaches and parks.“It’s useless to pack your bags for a vacation,” Paris police tweeted.With religious leaders around the globe urging people to observe Easter safely at home, the archbishop of Turin, Italy, allowed a video streaming display of the Shroud of Turin, believed by the faithful to be the burial cloth of Jesus, so that they can pray in front of it during the epidemic.Pope Francis celebrated an Easter vigil Mass in an empty St. Peter’s Basilica, where the footsteps of the pontiff and his small entourage on the marble floor could be heard clearly as they walked in slow procession toward the altar. Francis likened coronavirus fears to anxiety felt by Jesus’ followers after his crucifixion.“For them, as for us, it was the darkest hour,” he said, encouraging people to “sow seeds of hope, with small gestures of care.”Meanwhile, Austria aims to reopen small shops on Tuesday. Spain, with more than 16,300 dead, plans to allow workers in some nonessential industries to return to factories and construction sites Monday. Spanish authorities said they will distribute 10 million face masks at major train and subway stations.“We think that with these measures we will prevent a jump in infections,” Health Minister Salvador Illa said.Italy continued to include all nonessential manufacturing in an extension of its national lockdown until May 3. But Premier Giuseppe Conte held out hope that some industry could re-open earlier if conditions permit.Arcuri said that the exit from the lockdown will include increased virus testing, the deployment of a voluntary contact-tracing app and mandatory blood tests as Italy seeks to set up a system of ‘’immunity passports.’’India extended its lockdown of the nation of 1.3 billion people by two more weeks. But Iran, the site of the worst outbreak in the Middle East, reopened government offices and businesses outside Tehran.In Indonesia, inmates set fire to a prison on Sulawesi island during a riot, apparently angry over restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus. There were no reports of riot-related deaths.Britain on Saturday reported 917 more deaths from the coronavirus, down from the peak of 980 recorded a day earlier. The country’s overall death toll neared 10,000. At the same time, data suggest that the number of hospital admissions in Britain is leveling off.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the first major world leader confirmed to have COVID-19, continued to recover at a London hospital, where he was able to take short walks, according to his office.Worldwide, confirmed infections rose above 1.7 million, with over 108,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins.

12-04-2020||World||Pope Francis to livestream Easter mass amid Covid-19 lockdown||Pope Francis will break with centuries of tradition and livestream Easter Sunday mass to allow the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics celebrate their holiest holiday under a coronavirus lockdown.Fear and confusion in the face of a disease whose official death toll has soared past 100,000 -- but whose real one is feared to be higher still -- are reshaping society and transforming the way religion is observed.Watch| Pope Francis celebrates Easter vigil in empty church, delivers a ‘message of hope’ Even such hallowed traditions as the pope’s messages to the faithful on Saint Peter’s Square have been replaced by prayers that Francis reads into a camera from the seclusion of his private library.His only audience is the camera and the 83-year-old Argentine has admitted that the entire experience makes him feel “caged”.Life in confinement Francis cut a lonely but striking figure when he slowly entered a dark and starkly empty Vatican square in his white robe for a torch-lit Good Friday procession.It had taken place around the Roman Colosseum in the presence of at least 20,000 faithful for more than 50 years.But Rome and the rest of Italy have been living under forced confinement since early March.His Easter Sunday Mass and “Urbi et Orbi” blessing drew 70,000 to Saint Peter’s Square last year.The Vatican’s entrance is now sealed off by armed police wearing facemasks and rubber gloves.The pope has openly admitted that he was struggling along with everyone else to make sense of these extraordinary times.“We have to respond to our confinement with all our creativity,” Francis said in an interview published by several Catholic newspapers this week.“We can either get depressed and alienated ... or we can get creative.”Religious improvisation The pope’s virtual prayers are just the most vivid example of religious improvisation in the age of social distancing and confinement. The faithful have already followed his advice and found creative solutions.Thus the archbishop of Panama took to the air and blessed his tiny Central American nation from a helicopter. The faithful in Spain blasted religious music from their balconies during Holy Week.The scale of the unfolding tragedy has seen a New York City cathedral replace rows of wooden seats with hospital beds in case the surrounding emergency wards get full to overflowing.The Catholic Church in the Philippines is urging the faithful not to kiss the cross. Its Orthodox counterpart in Greece is planning to hold mass behind closed doors for its Easter on April 19.“Seven out of 10 Greeks enjoy roasting lamb for Easter,” Greek meat trader Angelos Asteriou told AFP in Paris.“That’s not happening this year.”Jews across the world did their best by using Zoom or other video conferencing apps to “seder-in-place” when the eight-day Passover holiday started on Wednesday evening.Westminster Abbey in London is following the technological trend by releasing Easter podcasts for the faithful of the Anglican Church.And priests at France’s Roman Catholic shrine in the southwestern town of Lourdes began relaying nine consecutive days of prayers on Sunday by Facebook Live and YouTube. ‘Saints next door’ The pope himself has in previous years observed Holy Thursday service marking Christ’s last supper by washing the feet of 12 inmates on the outskirts of Rome.The virus has now made this impossible.Francis instead said a prayer for the dozens of priests and health workers who have died across Italy while attending to the sick since the outbreak began in the Mediterranean country’s north in February.“They are the saints next door, the priests who gave their lives by serving,” Francis said.He invited five nurses and doctors to accompany him for the Good Friday processions in order to highlight their profession’s sacrifices over the past month.Francis himself has reportedly been tested twice for COVID-19 since coming down with a cold at the end of February.He told the Catholic newspapers that people across the world could try to spiritually escape their confinement through introspection.“So: to be in lockdown, but yearning, with that memory that yearns and begets hope,” the pope said.“This is what will help us escape our confinement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-to-livestream-easter-mass-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-YzVzI9EyHxgOIRvx0GxUWK.html
12-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Canadian Parliament passes emergency economic aid measure for workers, companies||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made his first appearance in the country’s Parliament for a sitting to pass an emergency measure to provide relief to workers and companies impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.Trudeau was in self-isolation since March 12, after his wife Sophie Gregoire was diagnosed with coronavirus infection following her return from an event in London. Trudeau returned to in-person meetings late last week and spoke during the sitting of the House of Commons in Ottawa, the country’s capital.A small number of MPs, living within easy reach of Parliament, were present in the House as it passed the legislation required to offer early wage subsidy relief by employers and employees buffeted by the economic impact of the pandemic.Only 32 MPs were present as the bill was passed, even as the Government pushes for an early arrangement wherein Canada’s parliamentary business can be conducted virtually. The session on Saturday, however, lasted for nearly six hours as MPs debated the bill tabled by the government. House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota described it as an “”exceptional day in the midst of exceptional times.”Trudeau also chose the occasion for a rousing speech with overtones of a wartime mobilisation. “Without reservation, without pause, we must fight for every inch of ground against this disease. We must be there for one another as we spare no effort to safeguard our collective future,” he said.The “frontline” in this battle, he said, was “everywhere”. “In our homes, in our hospitals and care centres, in our grocery stores and pharmacies, at our truck stops and gas stations. And the people who work in these places are our modern day heroes,” he went on to tell assembled MPs, though the message may have been directed at Canadians overall.Canada had 23,197 cases of coronavirus and 678 deaths due to the disease as of Saturday, according to news agency AFP. The Canadian economy lost more than one million jobs last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-canadian-parliament-passes-emergency-economic-aid-measure-for-workers-companies/story-U5jIczaSxYE2vaGe21KwcL.html
12-04-2020||World||France reports fall in daily coronavirus deaths, toll tops 13,800||France on Saturday reported a lower daily toll for deaths from Covid-19, declaring a “plateau” had been reached in the country’s coronavirus epidemic, albeit at a very high level.The French health authorities said in a statement that 345 more people had died in hospitals and 290 in nursing homes -- 635 over the last 24 hours -- to bring the total death toll to 13,832.The day earlier, 554 had died in hospitals and 433 in nursing homes, a total of 987.“A very high plateau for the epidemic appears to have been reached but the epidemic remains very active,” top French health official Jerome Salomon told reporters. “We must absolutely remain vigilant.” France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic, with only essential trips allowed that must be justified with a signed piece of paper.For the third consecutive day, the number of coronavirus patients in intensive care was down, with 121 fewer people in such units for a total of 6,883.France now has 90,676 confirmed cases of Covid-19 although the real number is likely far higher due to a lack of testing, the statement said.Salomon said that if the plateau trend continues it means “we have succeeded in reaching a first step together and the lockdown is showing its first effects”.But he warned: “It remains a very high plateau... there are still many hospital admissions... It is far too early -- and not reasonable -- to make predictions about the future.” French President Emmanuel Macron is due on Monday to address the nation for a third time during the crisis and is expected to announce that the lockdown will be extended beyond its current April 15 expiration date.Macron will have to steer a careful course amid the tentative signs of improvement, telling people they must still stay at home while giving indications about how the confinement may be relaxed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-reports-fall-in-daily-coronavirus-deaths-toll-tops-13-800/story-UvrRal53KglomoxnsOKLuI.html
12-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Easter gives hope in our ‘darkest hour’, despite fear, says Pope Francis||Easter offers a message of hope in people’s “darkest hour,” Pope Francis said, as he celebrated a late-night vigil Mass Saturday in St. Peter’s Basilica, with the public barred because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pontiff in his homily likened the fears of current times to those experienced by Jesus’ followers the day after his crucifixion. “They, like us, had before their eyes the drama of suffering, of an unexpected tragedy that happened all too suddenly,’‘ Francis said. “They had seen death and it weighed on their hearts. Pain was mixed with fear” about their own lives. “Then, too, there was fear about the future and all that would need to be rebuilt.” Francis added: “For them, as for us, it was the darkest hour.” Watch: Pope Francis celebrates Easter vigil in empty church, delivers a ‘message of hope’ Easter vigil Mass in the basilica is among the Vatican’s more evocative ceremonies. Celebrants enter in darkness, except for candlelight. The pontiff holds a tall Easter candle, which is lit for him. Then the basilica’s lights are turned on, in a sign of joy. But this night, when the basilica was illuminated, all its emptiness was painfully visible, and the footsteps of the pope and his small entourage on the marble floor could clearly be heard as they walked in slow procession toward the altar. Francis encouraged faithful to sow “seeds of hope, with small gestures of care, affection of prayer.” “Tonight we acquire a fundamental right that can never be taken away from us: the right to hope,’‘ Francis said. Still, he acknowledged the difficulty of obtaining optimism, saying “as the days go by and fears grow, even the boldest hope can dissipate.” Describing the Easter message as a “message of hope,’‘ Francis urged Christians to be ”messengers of life in a time of death.” During Easter vigil Mass, adults converting to Catholicism are baptized by the pope, but the pandemic containment measures forced elimination of that tradition during the ceremony. Earlier on Holy Saturday, the Turin Shroud, a burial cloth some believe covered Jesus, and which was associated with a 16th-century plague, was put on special view in a chapel in that northern city, through video streaming to inspire hope during the coronavirus outbreak. Francis hailed the initiative by the Turin archbishop, saying making it visible meets the requests of the faithful who are suffering through the COVID-19 outbreak. The linen, kept behind bulletproof glass in a Turin chapel, is shown to the public only on very special occasions. In the 16th century, Milan’s archbishop, the future St. Charles Borromeo, intensely desired to pray before the shroud while that city was ravaged by plague. The Duke of Savoy, in 1578, decided to bring the burial cloth of Christ from Chambéry, in France, to Turin, according to a Vatican account of that period. Charles made the pilgrimage to Turin on foot, praying and fasting during the journey. Skeptics say the linen bearing the figure of a crucified man is a medieval forgery. Believers regard it as one of Christianity’s most awe-inspiring reminders of Jesus’ crucifixion. The cloth belongs to the Vatican, which has allowed its scientific testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-easter-gives-hope-in-our-darkest-hour-despite-fear-says-pope-francis/story-WUQw6qeVAJ33eXOLuCmJMM.html
12-04-2020||World||Bangladesh executes ex-Army officer for assassinating founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman||Bangladesh has executed a former military captain for his involvement in the 1975 coup in which the country’s founder Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated, nearly four-and-a-half decades after the massacre.Abdul Majed was hanged at 12.01 AM (local time), Law Minister Anisul Huq told PTI.An official of the Dhaka Central Jail at Keraniganj on the outskirts of the capital said that a doctor declared Majed dead at 12.15 AM.Inspector General of Prisons Brigadier General AKM Mostafa Kamal Pasha at a media briefing in front of the jail said that the body would now be handed over to the family members for burial.“Concerned officials who were required to witness the execution under law were present,” he said, adding this was the first case of execution since the Dhaka Central Jail was relocated at the newly-built facility at Keraniganj two years ago.Jailor Mahbubul Islam later said that the officials present included Dhaka’s deputy commissioner who is the district magistrate as well, police superintendent and the civil surgeon and the deputy inspector general of prisons.A number of people gathered in front of the jail at the midnight, defying COVID-19 restrictions.He said that Mazed was executed by hanging.Majed was arrested in Dhaka on Tuesday after hiding in India for nearly two-and-a-half decades.On Friday, Majed’s wife and four other relatives met him for nearly two hours in the prison.President Abdul Hamid on Thursday rejected his mercy plea, removing the last hurdle for his hanging.A specialised police unit arrested Majed, one of the fugitive convicted Bangabandhu assassins, as he returned home after hiding for nearly two and half decades in India.Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said the “self confessed killer” was not only involved in Bangabandhu’s assassination but also took part in the subsequent killing of four national leaders in high security Dhaka Central Jail on November 3, 1975.He said previous reports indicated Majed was hiding in India but eventually he was arrested from Dhaka as he secretly returned last month.Police’s Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit arrested him in a predawn raid at Mirpur area while he was roaming around a shrine.Majed is one of the six absconding ex-army officers who were handed down capital punishment after trial in absentia.A prosecution lawyer said Majed told the court that he returned to Bangladesh on March 15 or 16.The convict, he said, claimed he managed to live secretly in Kolkata for the past 23 years.Twelve ex-military officers were sentenced to death for the August 15, 1975 killing of Father of the Nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with most of his family members. Five of them have been executed while one died of natural causes as he was on the run abroad.Bangabandhu’s elder daughter and incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and younger daughter Sheikh Rehana survived as they were on a visit to the then West Germany at the time of the putsch, which also toppled Bangladesh’s post independence government.The five convicts were hanged at Dhaka Central Jail on January 28, 2010, after a protracted legal procedure while the delayed trial process began in 1996 when an infamous indemnity law was scrapped as it was protecting the assassins from justice until then.Majed was one of the remaining fugitives believed to be hiding abroad with no confirmed whereabouts.The rest of the fugitives included the key mastermind of the coup ex-lieutenant colonel Abdur Rashid. Interpol issued red alert against the absconders believed to be hiding in several countries including Pakistan.Bangladesh confirmed two cases where two convicts took refuge in the United States and Canada, one of them is said to have shot dead Bangladesh’s founder.Dhaka said it was trying to extradite them but Canada declined to entertain the request citing provisions of the country’s laws.After the 1975 carnage, Majed was rehabilitated in civil service during the subsequent regime of former military-dictator-turned-politician Ziaur Rahman as an ex-cadre official and posted as the director of National Savings Department.He later fled the country while serving in the finance ministry along with other 1975 coup plotters as the 1996 general elections brought Awami League back to power which vowed to expose to justice Bangabandhu killers in line with its election manifesto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-executes-ex-army-officer-for-assassinating-founder-sheikh-mujibur-rahman/story-s7cfyGVrcGQC5FswWQkccM.html

The total toll touched toll topped 13,800. It reported 4,785 new infections.Italy has topped 19,000 deaths and 150,000 cases of the coronavirus. The milestones were hit Saturday, even as the country continued to see a slight decrease in numbers of people hospitalised and in intensive care.Deaths rose by 3.2% or 619, to 19,468. The government resisted pressure to lift its lockdown, extending confinement measures until May 3.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-amid-subdued-festivities-un-chief-urges-united-fight/story-a8icjjBSIQTDK5nWZCeDQN.html
12-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: US now has most Covid deaths, overtaking Italy||It was a day of tragic records for the US on Saturday, as the coronavirus pandemic continued to torment the country, forcing authorities to start digging up trenches for mass graves.With at least 19,833 deaths reported from the Covid-19 outbreak, the US has now become the most affected country in terms of fatalities - overtaking Italy, which has reported 19,468 deaths.America is already the worst-hit nation in terms of cases. It is the only country to have reported more than 500,000 infections. New York is the most affected American state, having recorded nearly 9,000 deaths and over 172,000 infections.Earlier in the day, the US also became the first country to report more than 2,000 fatalities from the coronavirus disease in a single day. By Saturday, the global death toll had gone past 106,000, while the number of cases worldwide stood at 1.73 million.Amid the deepening crisis in the country, US President Donald Trump said that he will appoint a special task force next week that will decide on when to reopen the country.Despite the rising number of cases and fatalities, US officials insist there are signs of an improvement in the situation, especially in the areas with a high incidence of cases. New York state has seen a drop in instances of hospitalisation. New Jersey and Connecticut have somewhat stabilised and although cities such as Boston and Chicago continue to report cases, the rate of increase has stabilised.But the crisis has not yet reached the peak, health officials said. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House task force for the coronavirus outbreak, said, “As encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak.” April 16 is widely believed to be the projected peak day in the US.Trump is admittedly in a hurry to reopen the country as the economy continues to take a hammering due to shutdowns . Asked if he is determined to remove the restrictions by May 1 as he had vowed earlier, he said, “I would love to open it. I’m not determined (on) anything. The facts are going to determine what I do.”‘Virus found in air up to 13 ft from patients’A study examining air samples from hospital wards with Covid-19 patients has found the virus can travel up to 13 feet, twice the distance current guidelines say people should leave between themselves in public.The preliminary results of the investigation by Chinese researchers were published on Friday in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal of the US CDC.They add to a debate on how the disease is transmitted, with the scientists cautioning that the small quantities of virus they found at this distance are not necessarily infectious. The researchers were led by a team at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-us-now-has-most-covid-deaths-overtaking-italy/story-2Wo2gbPhtoN1fGo6AXzK1H.html
