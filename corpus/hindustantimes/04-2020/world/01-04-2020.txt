01-04-2020||World||‘Coronavirus cough’ is now a crime in United Kingdom||Threatening people in emergency and essential services with a ‘coronavirus cough’ by individuals claiming to have the virus has been made a criminal offence following reports of the police, shop workers and vulnerable people being deliberately coughed at in the UK.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said such behaviour is illegal and assaults specifically against emergency workers are punishable by up to 12 months in prison. Coughs directed as a threat at other key workers or members of the public could be charged as common assault.Some individuals have already been charged and sentenced for such assaults. The police have also been given new powers to ensure and enforce social distancing. Some gatherings and parties by people ignoring official advice have been thwarted by the police. Max Hill, director of public prosecutions, said: “Emergency workers are more essential than ever as society comes together to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. I am therefore appalled by reports of police officers and other frontline workers being deliberately coughed at by people claiming to have Covid-19”.“Let me be very clear: this is a crime and needs to stop. The CPS stands behind emergency and essential workers and will not hesitate to prosecute anybody who threatens them as they go about their vital duties.”East London-based Darren Rafferty, 45, has admitted three counts of assaulting an emergency worker after claiming to have coronavirus and directing coughs at Scotland Yard officers arresting him for another offence.Blackburn-based David Mott, 40, has been jailed after threatening to spit at the police who had asked him what he was doing out with two others after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced stricter social distancing rules on March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-cough-is-now-a-crime-in-united-kingdom/story-yi7u7epjsQKyLUQGNpxqOK.html

The woman, whose name was not released, was admitted to the IJsselland Hospital near Rotterdam a week and a half ago with breathing difficulties and tested positive for coronavirus.She was kept in isolation but has now recovered enough to leave hospital. The centenarian, who lives independently, will rest in a nursing home before returning to her home, the hospital said on its website. “She is a tough lady, and it’s great to see her following the medical advice, like sneezing in her elbow and even telling me to keep proper distance,” pulmonologist Sunil Ramlal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-a-spark-of-hope-101-year-old-dutch-woman-recovers-from-coronavirus/story-E4hjlMhuTUGLYmxsB1cQhP.html

In a tweet, city Mayor John Tory said, “Today we announced the cancellation of mass events permitted by the City through to June 30th. While the City recognizes the importance of special events and festivals to the livability and vitality of the city, protecting the health and safety of residents is of primary concern.” Among the major events that will be affected by this decision are Hot Docs, the largest documentary film festival in North America and the annual Pride parade.These details underscore a point that many officials have made, though without getting into specifics, that battling COVID-19 will be a “long haul.”Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that how long the impact lasts will “hinge” on the “choices” Canadians make. He said during a media appearance: “We will be able to say more about how many weeks or months this lasts for as we see the impacts of the behaviours people have engaged in over these days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-canada-may-extend-restrictions-to-fight-covid-19-till-july/story-WucEfDYHmBbOcMmHGWudcM.html
01-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update:Donald Trump urged to pause H1B visa programme amid job losses||A US body representing American technology workers has urged President Donald Trump to suspend for this year the H-1B visa programme, the most sought-after among the Indian IT professionals, to protect their interests amidst the massive layoffs in the country due to the coronavirus pandemic.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.Also read: Donald Trump warns US headed for ‘very, very painful two weeks’Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.US Tech Workers, a nonprofit organisation which describes itself as representing the voices of American workers harmed by the H-1B visa programme, in its letter to Trump also urged him to suspend the H-2B visa programmes for the foreign guest workers too.“We have written a letter asking that the H-1B & H-2B visa programme be suspended for this year due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Letters have been sent to the office of the President, to his Chief of Staff, & to all members of congress,” the organisation said.H-2B visas are mostly for foreign farm workers. US businesses hire people from Latin American countries.“With the historical displacement of workers, compounded by the current crisis, it is very concerning that the Department of Homeland Security is working to accelerate the delivery of H-1B and H2-B workers to the United States. We ask that you stand up for the productive class of this country and protect the interest of American workers,” the letter said.Also read: H-1B workers seek 180 instead of 60-day stay in US amid layoffsAccording to some reports, the Department of Labour would be looking at 50-70 million unemployed Americans by the end of April.Last Thursday, unemployment claims ramped to three millions, shattering the record high of 695,000 in October 1982, the letter pointed out.“We urge you to pause the H-1B visa programme that would bring in 85,000 workers this year and suspend the recently approved addition of 35,000 workers for the H-2B visa. Overall the importation of workers should be undertaken with great caution during this period of tremendous uncertainty,” the letter said.“Battling both a pandemic and the resulting fallout to our economy from the coronavirus is no time to approve employment visas for more foreign workers,” wrote US Tech Workers in the letter to Trump.Economic experts fear massive layoffs in various sectors of the American economy due to the current economic distress that is only going to deteriorate in the coming months.A record 3.3 million Americans have filed initial jobless claims for the week ending March 21.Even as the peak of coronavirus in the US is two weeks away, millions of people in the country have lost their jobs.According to an estimate, some 47 million people could be rendered unemployed.Meanwhile, a report released by the CATO Institute think-tank, said that more than 200,000 petitions filed for Indians could “die of old age” before they receive green cards. This is mainly because of the projections according to which Indian technology workers would have to wait for decades to receive permanent legal residency or a Green Card.Based on the statistics obtained from the US government under the Freedom of Information Act, which is similar to India’s Right to Information, the institute said that for the first time, the US government has approved more than 1 million petitions for workers, investors, and their families who cannot receive legal permanent residence solely as a result of the low green card caps.The government is approving nearly two petitions for the employment-based immigrants for every Green Card it is issuing to them. At the current rate of increase, the backlog will exceed 2.4 million by 2030, it said.Skilled Indian workers make up 75 per cent of the employment-based backlog, and recently backlogged Indian workers face an impossible wait of nine decades if they all could remain in the line, the CATO Institute said.A Green Card allows a non-US citizen to live and work permanently in America.According to the estimates by the Johns Hopkins University, there are more than 850,500 confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, and over 41,000 deaths.The US now has the highest number of cases in the world at 184,183 and more than 4,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-donald-trump-urged-to-pause-h1b-visa-programme-amid-job-losses/story-sS41N6L6STdCFRsQTwrHgL.html

Ramjee was married to pharmacist Pravin Ramjee, a South African of Indian descent. Her funeral arrangements have not been announced. Attendance at funerals in South Africa is highly restricted and requires permits as the country is going through a 21-day nationwide lockdown announced last week by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Five South Africans have died from COVID-19 since Sunday, the third day of the lockdown. Over 13,50 cases have been reported in the country so far. The South African government on Tuesday announced that it will double to 10,000 the teams going door-to-door to test people for COVID-19, mainly in the overcrowded Black townships created during the apartheid era. On Sunday evening, in a national broadcast, Ramaphosa cautioned thousands of South Africans who have not been taking the lockdown seriously. The death toll from the rapidly-spreading coronavirus pandemic has risen to 41,654 and over 850,580 people have been infected by the deadly virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prominent-indian-origin-virologist-in-south-africa-dies-from-coronavirus/story-0zBBV4VLddWno3OULIlMCJ.html
01-04-2020||World||Royal no more: Harry and Meghan start uncertain new chapter||Prince Harry and his wife Meghan officially make the transition Tuesday from senior members of Britain’s royal family to — well, it’s unclear. International celebrities, charity patrons, global influencers?The royal schism that the couple triggered in January by announcing that they would step down from official duties, give up public funding, seek financial independence and swap the U.K. for North America becomes official on March 31.The move has been made more complicated and poignant by the global coronavirus pandemic, which finds the couple and their 10-month-old son Archie in California, far from Harry’s father Prince Charles — who is recovering after testing positive for COVID-19 — and Harry’s 93-year-old grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.“As we can all feel, the world at this moment seems extraordinarily fragile,” the couple said in a final post Monday on their now-mothballed SussexRoyal Instagram account.“What’s most important right now is the health and well-being of everyone across the globe and finding solutions for the many issues that have presented themselves as a result of this pandemic,” they added. “As we all find the part we are to play in this global shift and changing of habits, we are focusing this new chapter to understand how we can best contribute.”It is less than two years since ex-soldier Harry, who is sixth in line to the British throne, married American actress Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle in a lavish ceremony watched by millions around the world.Soon the couple began to bristle at intense scrutiny by the British media — which they said tipped into harassment. They decided to break free, in what Harry called a “leap of faith” as he sought a more peaceful life, without the journalists who have filmed, photographed and written about him since the day he was born.Harry has long had an uncomfortable relationship with the media, which he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana. She died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi.Harry’s unhappiness increased after he began dating Markle, then the star of TV legal drama “Suits.” In 2016 he accused the media of harassing his then-girlfriend, and criticized “racial undertones” in some coverage of the biracial Markle.It’s clear that Meghan’s upbeat Californian style — embodied in the glossy images and life-affirming messages of the couple’s Instagram account — rankled with sections of Britain’s tabloid press, which is both insatiable for royal content and fiercely judgmental of the family members.The couple — who are keeping their titles, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, but will no longer be called Their Royal Highnesses — had hoped to keep using the Sussex Royal brand in their new life. But last month they announced they wouldn’t seek to trademark the term because of U.K. rules governing use of the word “royal.”The couple plans to launch a non-profit organization for their charitable activities in areas including youth empowerment, mental health, conservation, gender equality and education. Harry will also continue to oversee the Invictus Games, the Olympics-style competition he founded for wounded troops.Meghan has been announced as the narrator of “Elephant,” a Disney nature documentary.But for now, the couple’s office said they want the world to focus “on the global response to COVID-19.”“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will spend the next few months focusing on their family and continuing to do what they can, safely and privately, to support and work with their pre-existing charitable commitments while developing their future non-profit organisation,” the couple’s office said in a statement.The newly independent Harry and Meghan will also need to earn money to help pay for a multi-million dollar security bill.As senior royals, they have had bodyguards funded by British taxpayers. Since late last year, Harry and Meghan have since been based on Canada’s Vancouver Island, where security was provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Canadian authorities warned last month that would end once the couple ceased to be working royals.The duke and duchess recently moved to the Los Angeles area, where Meghan grew up and where her mother still lives. The news led President Donald Trump to tweet on Sunday: “the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!”Harry and Meghan’s office said “security costs are being personally covered by the couple.”Some royal historians warned that Harry and Meghan could struggle to find a fulfilling role. Comparisons have been drawn to King Edward VIII, who abdicated in 1936 to marry divorced American Wallis Simpson. The couple lived the rest of their lives in luxurious but lonely self-imposed exile from Britain.Royal historian Penny Junor said U.K.-based royals were helping boost the nation’s morale during the coronavirus pandemic. The queen has issued a message to the nation, while Harry’s brother Prince William and his children joined in a public round of applause for health care workers.“All of this is absolutely what the family is about, and those members of the royal family that are on a limb now are pretty irrelevant,” Junor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/royal-no-more-harry-and-meghan-start-uncertain-new-chapter/story-4WT9aCxltdz8RLsgMRDbbJ.html

But it could be a major source of contagion as it packs pilgrims closely in religious sites.Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia suspended prayers inside all its mosques except the two holiest sites in Islam as it increased efforts to contain the new coronavirus.The announcements risk riling fringe Muslim hardliners, for whom religion trumps health considerations.Saudi Arabia is scrambling to limit the spread of the disease at home. The kingdom’s health ministry has reported 1,563 coronavirus infections and 10 deaths from the illness so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-urges-muslims-to-defer-hajj-plans-over-coronavirus/story-ivXEvV2H3QbQObk0JnMMiM.html

All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall.”The Republican leader’s government has faced stark criticism for failing to heed early global alarms about the virus outbreak, after death tolls began to spike in places like China and Italy.The United States now has more than 165,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the most worldwide, and the US death toll has surged past 3,400 -- exceeding China’s official toll.Obama’s tweet included a link to a story about the Trump administration’s new rules.In a statement, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation were rolling back “costly, increasingly unachievable fuel economy and vehicle CO2 emissions standards.” The stringency of those so-called CAFE standards will now be increased by 1.5 percent annually through 2026, substantially less than the roughly 5.0 percent annual increases issued in 2012, the EPA said. So far, Obama has only rarely engaged in the 2020 presidential race, which features his former vice president Joe Biden as the Democrat likely to face Trump in November’s election.The former commander-in-chief has not publicly endorsed any candidate in the Democratic nomination race, which has boiled down to Biden and leftist rival Bernie Sanders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-suggests-donald-trump-team-denied-warnings-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-EQzi1lRJtq8a69A7uuIuTO.html

But his condition deteriorated as he began having trouble breathing, a major impact of COVID-19, and was admitted to his local Hillingdon Hospital for a week.“Following my light coronavirus symptoms, my condition deteriorated and I was hospitalised. I have now been discharged from hospital and I am recovering well at home,” said Sharma.“Now I am back home again and self-isolating, and following all the NHS [National Health Service] and government advice. I want to urge everyone else to do the same. Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives,” he said.Sharma paid tribute to his local hospital for the “exceptional care” he received and also to the wider health service working hard at a time of immense pressure.“The amazing men and women of the NHS working in almost impossible situations, with too little kit and too little support deserve our help. I am asking everyone of you to do what you can to help them,” he said.Now back working from home, the MP reached out to his constituents to get in contact regarding any of their loved ones stranded abroad as the UK government announced a 75-million pound effort to charter special rescue flights to bring travellers back from countries under travel lockdowns, including India.“Many people also have friends and family stranded abroad, and this is very worrying for everyone involved. Please rest assured I have been liaising with the Foreign Office on this matter, and my staff continued to work on this while I was in hospital,” he said.Sharma’s update came as UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who had also gone into self-isolation after testing positive for COVID-19, revealed that he was “on the mend” and continued to work from home during his self-isolation.Prime Minister Boris Johnson also remains in self-isolation at 10 Downing Street after his coronavirus diagnosis, while Prince Charles continues to work from home as he came out of self-isolation on Monday, a week after his diagnosis.The UK remains under strict stay-at-home social distancing rules and the government has said it is “ramping up” its testing capacity by buying “many millions” of tests to diagnose the infection as the death toll from the deadly virus hit 1,448 in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/veteran-indian-origin-british-mp-discharged-from-hospital-after-covid-19-diagnosis/story-GtnTkBMGL0DLahKCakpVzI.html

He was 96.Anderson died Sunday at the Princeton Windrows retirement community in Princeton, New Jersey, his daughter said. No cause was reported.He researched the electronic behavior of solid materials such as glass, crystal and alloys, The New York Times reported.Bogdan Andrei Bernevig, a Princeton professor of physics, said in a statement that Anderson will be known as the man who started solid state physics as a field.Bernevig described Anderson as complex and said that “I was always in awe of his intellect. He was working on theories for regular days well into his 90s.”Anderson graduated from Harvard in 1949 and then worked for Bell Telephone Laboratories until he began teaching at Princeton and the University of Cambridge.During his career in academia, Anderson advised another Nobel Prize winner, F. Duncan Haldane, who won the 2016 prize in physics. Anderson inspired another winner, Brian Josephson, who won the 1973 Nobel Prize and took a class taught by Anderson at Cambridge.Anderson was drafted during World War II into the Navy and assigned to work at the U.S. Naval Research Lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philip-anderson-nobel-laureate-in-physics-dies-at-96/story-gyxWqxHhxBBt5WbkNGuOXI.html
01-04-2020||World||Coronavirus the worst global crisis since World War II, says UN chief||The coronavirus pandemic is the worst global crisis since World War II, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday, expressing concern that it could trigger conflicts around the world.Guterres said that the scale of the crisis was due to “a disease that represents a threat to everybody in the world and... an economic impact that will bring a recession that probably has no parallel in the recent past.”“The combination of the two facts and the risk that it contributes to enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict are things that make us believe that this is the most challenging crisis we have faced since the Second World War,” he told reporters.The New York-based United Nations was founded at the end of the war in 1945 and has 193 member states.“A stronger and more effective response... is only possible in solidarity if everybody comes together and if we forget political games and understand that it is humankind that is at stake,” Guterres added.More than 40,000 people have been killed so far as the disease spreads across the world, and causes economic devastation.“We are far from having a global package to help the developing world to create the conditions both to suppress the disease and to address the dramatic consequences,” Guterres warned, pointing to unemployment, the collapse of small firms and vulnerable people in the informal economy.“We are slowly moving in the right direction, but we need to speed up, and we need to do much more if we want to defeat the virus.”The UN on Tuesday created a new fund to help developing countries after last week appealing for donations for poor and conflict-hit nations.Beyond traditional aid from rich countries “we need to have innovative financial instruments,” so that developing nations are able to respond to the crisis, Guterres said.He warned that the coronavirus outbreak could return from poorer countries, especially in Africa, to hit wealthy countries again, and that millions could die.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-the-worst-global-crisis-since-world-war-ii-says-un-chief/story-wGFf7TCnrwF2ugbpgcGVSO.html
01-04-2020||World||‘There’s no magic bullet’: Covid-19 will kill 100,000 to 240,000 Americans, say White House experts||The two top US government scientists spearheading the fight against the coronavirus said Tuesday that 100,0000 to 240,000 Americans could die in the outbreak despite the social-distancing mitigation guidelines that have shut down schools, restaurants, cinema and all non-essential activities.Anthony Fauci, a leading epidemiologist and member of the White House task force, and Deborah Birx, a physician who serves as coordinator of the task force, warned fatalities could be much higher — 1.5 to 2.2 million — if nothing was done. Social-distancing is working, it’s effective and is perhaps the best strategy yet, they added.“There’s no magic bullet. There’s no magic vaccine or therapy. It’s just behaviors,” Birx said, addressing the daily White House briefing along with Fauci and President Donald Trump. “Each of our behaviors translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic. Over the next 30 days.”Fauci added: “We gotta brace ourselves: in the next several days to a week or so, we’re going to continue to see things go up. We cannot be discouraged by that. Because the mitigation is actually working, and will work.”The experts used charts and graphs with mathematical modeling for their presentation that was intended to explain why Trump announced Monday he was extending the social-distancing guidelines by a month to April 30, overturning his earlier plan to end them by Easter and put the country back into business.President Donald Trump warned, “We’re going to go through a very tough two weeks … (and they will be) very, very painful two weeks”. That was much in in line with his grim projection that the death-rate will peak after two weeks around Easter.He added: “Our strength will be tested, our endurance will be tried, but America will answer with love and courage and ironclad resolve.”The staggeringly grim numbers are projections based on multiple models based on assumptions gleaned from experiences in other countries such as China and Italy and on early days of the outbreak in the United States, with heavy casualties from the two worst hit states, New York and New Jersey.Fauci underlined the projections with a degree of caution saying they are as good as the assumptions that the models were based on. And indicated they could change based on new information inputs. Another experts has said the toll could be brought down to 80,000 if all states came under stay-at-home orders one week.At least 30 of the 50 states are under stay-at-home orders or versions of it, covering an estimated 80% of Americans. The remaining states have been a cause of concern as experts have warned some of them could be taken by surprise by a sudden flare-up, such as in Louisiana.More than 810 people died of the coronavirus in the United States on Tuesday in another single-day high, taking the toll to 3,900 so far; with nearly 190,000 confirmed cases, an increase of more than 44,000 over Monday.

The boy’s family said Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab “started showing symptoms and had difficulties breathing” before he was admitted to hospital.“He was put on a ventilator and then put into an induced coma but sadly died yesterday morning,” the family said through a family friend, Mark Stephenson, adding: “We are beyond devastated.”Nathalie MacDermott, a lecturer at King’s College, said: “While we know it is much less likely for children to suffer severe COVID-19 infection than older adults, this case highlights the importance of us all taking the precautions we can to reduce the spread of infection in the UK and worldwide.”She urged research into deaths outside the groups expected to succumb to infection as it “may indicate an underlying genetic susceptibility.”On Tuesday, Britain announced 381 deaths from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, the highest figure in the country since the start of the pandemic, bringing the death toll to 1,789.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/13-year-old-uk-boy-dies-after-contracting-covid-19/story-kS8afY0pAsrkeVkCGmrHSK.html

It’s just behaviors, each of our behaviors translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days,” Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator at the White House, said.Birx displayed a chart at the press conference charting a range of 100,000 to 240,000 deaths in the United States, when current efforts at mitigation are taken into account.Infectious diseases specialist Anthony Fauci told the press conference that “mitigation is actually working” and that authorities are “doing everything we can to get it (the death toll) significantly below that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-donald-trump-warns-us-headed-for-very-very-painful-two-weeks/story-jkajSpnSRHq4nuLmc2eCoM.html
01-04-2020||World||Covid-19: UK visa of medical staff from India, non-EU countries extended free for a year||Grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, the Boris Johnson government on Tuesday extended for free the visa of nearly 2,800 doctors, nurses and paramedical staff from India and non-EU countries currently working in the National Health Service.They will also be exempted from paying the annual immigration health surcharge of £400 for every person in the family, home secretary Priti Patel announced. It will benefit those whose visa is due to expire before October 1. The extension will also apply to their family members.The visa extension was announced as new figures by the Office for National Statistics showed that the number of deaths is higher than those released by the Department of Health and Social Care, which releases figures of deaths in hospitals, and not those in homes and care-homes.The Home Office also lifted the restriction on the number of hours student nurses and doctors can work in the NHS. Pre-registered overseas nurses who are currently required to sit their first skills test within three months and to pass the test within eight months, will now have this deadline extended to the end of the year as well.Patel said: “Doctors, nurses and paramedics from all over the world are playing a leading role in the NHS’s efforts to tackle coronavirus and save lives. We owe them a great deal of gratitude for all that they do”.“I don’t want them distracted by the visa process. That is why I have automatically extended their visas – free of charge – for a further year”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-visa-of-medical-staff-from-india-non-eu-countries-extended-free-for-a-year/story-mrWfsdGhd8qN2bOJzpU8IP.html
01-04-2020||World||Employers trusted more than govt and media, says global survey on Covid-19||People rely upon the major news outlets, nearly twice as much as global health organizations WHO or social media for information about the Covid-19 pandemic. But when it comes to credible information, people trust their employers more than the government or the news media, according to the Edelman Trust Barometer special survey.The online survey was conducted in 10 countries: Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, the UK and the US. The firm had surveyed 10,000 people.About 70 percent said they were following news on the virus on a daily basis and 74 percent expressed concern that there was a lot of fake news and false information being spread about the virus.The barometer shows that ‘my employer’ is the most trusted institution. Sixty-three percent said that they would believe information from their employers after one or two exposures, versus 58 percent for a government website and 51 percent for traditional media.“That explains our finding that employer communications is the most credible source of information about the coronavirus,” Richard Edelman, chief executive officer of the global communications firm said in a statement releasing the findings.The survey also revealed that the young - people in the 18-34 age-group - were more likely to turn to social media for information about coronavirus as compared to other adults. Over one-third of people said they would never believe social media if it were the only place they had seen the information.There’s also a lack of faith in the country’s preparedness to deal with Covid-19. Except for people from Canada and Germany, the respondents from all the other eight countries think their employer is better prepared to respond effectively and responsibly to the challenge posed by the virus than their country.In response to a question on the agency that was trusted to respond effectively and responsibly to the coronavirus challenge, employers figure next only to the health authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/employers-trusted-more-than-govt-and-media-says-global-survey-on-covid-19/story-a1AEIAhjsdW8MA9gyK6kAL.html
01-04-2020||World||Russian doctor who met Putin last week diagnosed with coronavirus||A doctor who gave Russian President Vladimir Putin a tour of Moscow’s main coronavirus hospital last week said on Tuesday he had himself been diagnosed with the virus. Putin visited the Kommunarka hospital last Tuesday where he chatted to the doctor, Denis Protsenko. Neither man was wearing protective equipment during their conversation, TV footage from the visit showed.Protsenko, writing on Facebook said: “Yes, I have tested positive for coronavirus, but I feel pretty good. I’ve isolated myself in my office. I think the immunity I’ve developed this month is doing its job.” The Kremlin said that Putin was being regularly tested for coronavirus and that “everything is okay,” the RIA news agency reported. It has previously said that Putin is being protected from viruses and other illnesses “around the clock”.Putin donned a hazmat suit and a respirator during his visit to the hospital last week when dropping in on patients. But he did not have his protective gear on during a meeting with Protsenko, with whom he was photographed shaking hands.The Kremlin reported a coronavirus case in Putin’s administration on Friday, but said the person in question had not come into contact with the president and that all measures were being taken to prevent the virus from spreading further. Russian lawmakers on Tuesday granted the government powers to declare a national emergency over the coronavirus, and approved penalties for violations of lockdown rules including, in extreme cases, jail terms of up to seven years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-doctor-who-met-putin-last-week-diagnosed-with-coronavirus/story-5jmIkv6aATtEzLX0csTFgK.html

The twin developments came as the total number of deaths in the US surpassed China’s toll of 3,305.The US, Italy, Spain, China and Germany are now the five most affected countries in terms of number of confirmed cases.The US death toll, which has now touched 3,400, is more than the nearly 3,000 people killed in the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. Close to 175,000 have been infected across the US.More than 575 people died in the US on Monday, the deadliest single day toll in the country’s battle against the outbreak, and President Donald Trump called for vigorous adherence to social-distancing guidelines over the next 30 days.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageThe US president also sought to address concerns about the availability of essential medical supplies needed to test and treat patients and protect health care workers. He said the US will be in “a good shape” when the death rate is expected to peak in two weeks when it comes to the availability of ventilators.The US has ramped up acquisition of supplies at home, through stepped up production by American companies and purchases abroad, as complaints of shortages persisted, specially in hot spots such as New York state, New Jersey, Washington and those other states that are potentially on the edge.New York state remains the worst hit, with more than 67,000 cases and at least 1,300 deaths; New York City alone had 914 fatalities at one stage.“Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days, this is a very vital 30 days,” Trump said at a White House briefing, referring to the extended period of social-distancing guideline, during which the administration also fears the death-rate to peak. While the existing social-distancing guidelines will remain in place for this period, the administration is expected to release its strategy going forward on Tuesday, along with data and findings that have been used by its top experts to warn of between 100,000 to 200,000 deaths.It wasn’t clear if new measures could be announced as well, but The Washington Post reported on Monday that the CDC is considering recommending people use masks when they step out. Across the border, the Canadian government is preparing to mobilise nearly 24,000 troops to assist in the effort to contain the pandemic, even as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pointedly said the country was on a different “trajectory” from the spread of the disease in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-coronavirus-cases-cross-800-000-after-us-sees-deadliest-day/story-7SHpAuNI01E00MZfo7xCDL.html
