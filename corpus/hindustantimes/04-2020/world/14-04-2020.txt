It is a battle that China cannot afford to lose is how the state media has described the race.The first vaccine, developed by a research team led by military doctor Chen Wei with the Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences, was the first to be approved to enter clinical trial in March, official news agency, Xinhua reported Tuesday.The first phase of the clinical trial was completed at the end of March, and the second phase started on April 12, the report said.It is the first Covid-19 vaccine in the world that has entered the second phase of clinical trial, the Xinhua report quoted the World Health Organisation as saying.The news about three vaccines entering different clinical trial stages comes in the backdrop of a steady rise of imported Covid-19 cases in China.The Chinese national health commission (NHC) said Tuesday that it received reports of 89 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland on Monday, of which 86 were imported.Three new domestically transmitted cases were reported, all in the southern Guangdong province.As of Monday, the mainland had reported a total of 1,464 imported cases.The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 82,249 by Monday, including 1,170 patients who were still being treated, 77,738 people who had been discharged after recovery, and 3,341 people who died of the disease.Meanwhile, local reports said that medical resources were “strained and the local capacity to deal with the onslaught of imported Covid-19 cases has reached its limits in the Chinese city of Suifenhe, bordering Russia”.The NHC had dispatched to the border town to help local health authorities, and donations of medical equipment from across the country had arrived.According to the tabloid, Global Times, while recording 243 confirmed Covid-19 cases, the Suifenhe land port next to the Russia border has 1,479 people under collective quarantine, 15-20 percent of whom may be diagnosed and tested positive, local officials said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-experimental-vaccines-go-on-human-trial-imported-cases-keep-rising/story-g3Jm7liQhxksDtjc6U05oN.html
14-04-2020||World||Obama endorses Biden, slams politics of ‘meanness’||Former President Barak Obama on Tuesday endorsed his former vice-president Joe Biden for the 2020 White House race saying he has the character and experience to guide the country through “one of our darkest times” and heal it through its recovery.The former president also called for Americans to unite in a “great awakening” against current-day politics, which he said was characterized, among other things, by “just plain meanness”.Obama, who remains one of the most popular and revered Democrat in the country, had held off on his endorsement of his former deputy as be believed, his office said in a statement, that for Democrats to do well in November, Democratic voters should be allowed to pick their own nominee.That process formally ended in way Monday as Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed the former vice-president, following up the suspension of his own bid for the party nomination  earlier.“Choosing Joe to be my Vice President was one of the best decisions I ever made, and he became a close friend,” former President Obama said in a video message. “And I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a President right now.”The former president went on to list the high points of Biden’s role as his vice-president — led the recovery from the 2008 recession, helped him manage the H1N1 and Ebola outbreaks and restore American leadership in combating nuclear proliferations and climate change.“Joe has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery,” Obama said.“Right now,” he added in a barely concealed swipe at President Donald Trump’s politics, “we need Americans of goodwill to unite in a great awakening against a politics that too often has been characterized by corruption, carelessness, self-dealing, disinformation, ignorance, and just plain meanness. And to change that, we need Americans of all political stripes to get involved in our politics and our public life like never before.”Obama will be campaigning for Biden and other Democrats up and down the ticket as he did in the 2018 elections when the party won back control of the House of the Representatives.The former president and his erstwhile deputy were friends indeed, as Obama noted in the endorsement. Even while in office, they were seen close, as were their families. Obama delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Beau Biden, Biden’s eldest son who died of brain cancer in 2015.The two have remained close since, unlike others such as Former President Bill Clinton and his deputy Al Gore, who barely speak to each other; or Former President George W Bush and his vice-president Dick Cheney, who had worked closely while in office but, as Cheney said later, they were not friends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/obama-endorses-biden-slams-politics-of-meanness/story-sykepejBGKyHqU4M4imfYL.html
14-04-2020||World||Barack Obama endorses Joe Biden, says former VP has ‘qualities we need’||Former President Barack Obama endorsed Joe Biden in a video on Tuesday, giving the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee a boost from the party’s biggest fundraiser and one of its most popular figures.“I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now,” Obama said in a nearly 12- minute video, touting him as a “close friend” and lauding him for his perseverance and compassion.Obama and Biden are close friends from their two terms in the White House, when Biden served as vice president. Biden leaned heavily on his affiliation with the former president throughout the Democratic primary, framing his pitch as an extension of Obama’s presidency. In recent weeks, he has told donors he’s been in touch with Obama about his vice-presidential pick.The endorsement marks Obama’s return to presidential politics more than three years after leaving the White House. He rarely talks directly about his successor, President Donald Trump, and avoided intervening in the Democratic primary. The field at one point spanned nearly two dozen candidates and Obama offered private counsel to anyone who asked it, but but made no efforts to bolster an individual campaign — including Biden’s.But Obama has been following the Democratic race closely from the sidelines and is eager to take a more active public role in the campaign. He’s expected to headline fundraisers for Biden and public events in key swing states, if those events can still be held given social distancing guidelines during the pandemic. An Obama adviser said the former president is taking his cues from Biden’s campaign on how he can be most useful as he eases back into a more overtly political role.The endorsement comes a day after Bernie Sanders also backed Biden. The former vice president now has the support of all of his former Democratic primary rivals except for Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts senator is expected to formally throw her support behind Biden soon, according to a person familiar with her plans.Two other prominent Democrats who have yet to formally endorse Biden are former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, the party’s 2016 nominee. Hillary Clinton has been in regular touch with Biden, including several times since Sanders dropped out of the race, according to an aide.Obama has been an obvious shadow throughout the 2020 Democratic primary. Biden coined the “Obama-Biden administration” moniker when he’d talk about various accomplishments.But he also tried to insist he was running as his own man, telling anyone who asked that he urged Obama not to endorse him out of the gate or even in the thick of the primary.Obama’s tenure became a sort of punching bag for some presidential hopefuls in a primary fight that early on was defined by a debate over the need for generational and systemic change versus a return to normalcy after the Trump era.Julian Castro, 45, pushed Biden repeatedly on whether he argued with Obama privately over deportations overseen by that administration. Pete Buttigieg, 38, and Beto O’Rourke, 47, subtly jabbed Biden – and by extension Obama -- by suggesting the party shouldn’t “return to the past.” Sanders and Warren suggested that the 2010 Affordable Care Act hadn’t gone far enough.But Biden was a staunch defender of the Affordable Care Act and on the trail, often referred to himself as an “Obama-Biden Democrat.” The former vice president called it “bizarre” for Democrats, even faintly, to attack Obama’s record.The conversation around Obama’s presidency shifted as the primary wore on. By the time voting began, Buttigieg was almost explicitly comparing his youthful bid to Obama’s 2008 campaign and the progressives were framing their health-care proposals as a way to build on Obama’s legacy. Billionaire candidate Mike Bloomberg, meanwhile, featured Obama in his ubiquitous advertising effort, much to Biden’s chagrin.“You’d think Mike was Barack’s vice president,” Biden once quipped to donors.For his part, Biden leaned even more heavily into Obama as primary voting began. Aiming at Sanders, the self-described “democratic socialist,” and billionaire Bloomberg, who’d been elected New York City mayor as a Republican, Biden said in a Feb. 21 interview with The Associated Press that “they’re not bad folks. They’re just not Democrats.”Campaigning before increasingly diverse audiences in Nevada and South Carolina, Biden ramped up his recollections of when Obama tapped him for the ticket in 2008. Biden recalled Inauguration Day 2009, waiting for the train in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, “for a black man to pick me up … for the two of us to be sworn in as president and vice president of the United States.”Often drawing nods and vocal affirmation from his audiences, Biden said he had thought of that day as a national victory over institutional racism. Now, in the Trump era, Biden calls that conclusion a mistake.“I thought we could defeat hate,” he said, but, “it never goes away.“On Feb. 29, Biden took the stage in South Carolina to celebrate a nearly 30-point victory that would propel him past Sanders and everyone.He dusted off a line he’d used many times before: “I’m a proud Obama-Biden Democrat,” Biden said.Obama was watching. His sideline approach nearing its end, he called his former vice president that night to congratulate him on his victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-endorses-joe-biden-says-former-vp-has-qualities-we-need/story-wsibTkRZVir1wXdX9LpedM.html
14-04-2020||World||US nears COVID-19 peak, Donald Trump feuds with governors on reopening||A top government health official has sad the United States could be “nearing” the peak of its coronavirus outbreak this week and an acrimonious debate has broken out between President Donald Trump and some state governors on who will determine when to reopen the country, and by how much.“We are nearing the peak right now,” Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told NBC news Monday, echoing growing consensus among officials and public health experts. “You’ll know when you’re at the peak when the next day is actually less than the day before.The number of fatalities in the United States went up by 1,509 Monday over Sunday, which was marginally less the 1,514 the day before, but a lot less than 1,920 in the 24 hours ending Saturday. The death toll stood at 23,649 Monday, and confirmed cases at 582,634, up by 25,306.The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which has been widely cited by the White House, has projected April 16 as the peak day for the US outbreak.Experts of the White House coronavirus task force and other public officials have for some days expressing “cautious optimism” on the basis of signs that they interpret to indicate a peak was at head — such as the “flattening” in the number of new cases in hotspots metros .Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, has cited dropping hospitalization numbers to express optimism the state, which has has more cases than all of China and many other countries, may have turned around, or is close to it. “The worst is over” he told reporters Monday, adding for emphasis the need to not ease up.”, “if we continue to be smart going forward.”New York state had 196,146 confirmed cases Tuesday, which was way more than Spain or Italy or France, the three European nations hit the hardest until they were overtaken by the United States and now by one of its states. The state accounted for a little less than half of all US fatalities, at 10,058.New York City, the epicenter of the American epidemic, had 106,763 cases (alone more than China or the United Kingdom) and 7,249 deaths.The situation is improving as public health official and experts have stated giving rise to talk of reopening the country and removing social-distancing guidelines enforce since mid-March that had shut down businesses, forced wide-scale layoffs and inflicted grave economic hardship on millions of families.But the way forward has become mired in a bitter debate between the American president and state governors over, essentially, who will lead the reopening. Trump insists on leading it claiming complete powers on this issue of public health matters and police powers inside states. “When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total,” he said at the daily briefing of the White House coronavirus task force.Constitutional experts and critics, joined even by some of the president’s Republican allies, have dispute that, citing the constitution.“If he ordered me to reopen in a way that would endanger the public health of the people of my state, I wouldn’t do it,” Governor Cuomo said of the president’s plans. Other governors, including some belonging to the Republican party, have disagreed with the president.Trump hit back singling the New York governor. “Cuomo’s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state’s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc. I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nears-covid-19-peak-donald-trump-feuds-with-governors-on-reopening/story-cpfiej2biKwbmRdteXzLZK.html

There has been no reduction in violence and the Taliban have done nothing to demonstrate that they will act against al-Qaeda in keeping with the agreement they signed with the US,” said a person familiar with developments who declined to be named.“The Taliban’s top leadership continues to be in Pakistan and there is little doubt that the group is acting at the behest of the Pakistani military to ensure India has little or no role in the current situation in Afghanistan,” the person said, adding similar concerns were prevalent among diplomats of several Western nations.The Indian government, which has pledged more than $3 billion for the development of Afghanistan, has said it backs an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process for peace and reconciliation that ensures a peaceful and stable Afghanistan free from “externally sponsored terrorism”.ToloNews reported the Taliban’s draft charter is seen by the Afghan government as suggesting that the group’s plans for their “future government” are not very different from policies of their former regime. According to the document, final decisions in all matters will be made by the “emir” or Taliban chief and free speech, human rights and civil rights will be implemented within the framework of Islamic teachings.The draft charter also suggests executive leaders will not be chosen through elections, as called for in the Afghan Constitution, but by the “Ahl al-hall wal-aqd” or a group qualified to appoint or remove a leader. Jalaluddin Shinwari, a former Taliban member who served as chief justice during the Taliban regime, said the group still wants an Islamic emirate. “So far this is their demand,” he said.Afghan rights activists said the charter could take the country back to where it was at the end of the Taliban regime in 2001. The head of Kabul-based Afghanistan Human Rights Organization, Lal Gul Lal, was quoted as saying that Afghans “should not start from the beginning once again”.Taliban’ spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, however, told ToloNews the draft charter did “not belong to the group”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-calls-for-islamic-emirate-in-afghanistan-drafts-a-charter-with-rules/story-uIeM27BHbUObbGgSn2h5wJ.html
14-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Donald Trump claims he has ‘total’ authority over reopening economy||President Donald Trump claimed the “total” authority to decide how and when to reopen the economy after weeks of tough social distancing guidelines aimed at fighting the new coronavirus. But governors from both parties were quick to push back, noting they have primary responsibility for ensuring public safety in their states and would decide when it’s safe to begin a return to normal operations.Trump would not offer specifics about the source of his asserted power, which he claimed, despite constitutional limitations, was absolute.“When somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total,” Trump said Monday at the White House. “The governors know that.”The comments came not long after Democratic leaders in the Northeast and along the West Coast announced separate state compacts to coordinate their efforts to scale back stay-at-home orders or reopen businesses on their own timetables.Anxious to put the crisis behind him, Trump has been discussing with senior aides how to roll back federal social distancing recommendations that expire at the end of the month.While Trump has issued national recommendations advising people stay home, it has been governors and local leaders who have instituted mandatory restrictions, including shuttering schools and closing nonessential businesses. Some of those orders carry fines or other penalties, and in some jurisdictions they extend into the early summer.And governors made clear Monday they wouldn’t tolerate pressure to act before they deem it safe.“All of these executive orders are state executive orders and so therefore it would be up to the state and the governor to undo a lot of that,” New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said on CNN.“The government doesn’t get opened up via Twitter. It gets opened up at the state level,” said Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.Meanwhile, governors were banding together, with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island agreeing to coordinate their actions. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced a similar pact. While each state is building its own plan, the three West Coast states have agreed to a framework saying they will work together, put their residents’ health first and let science guide their decisions.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, stressed the efforts would take time.“The house is still on fire,” Murphy said on a conference call with reporters. “We still have to put the fire out, but we do have to begin putting in the pieces of the puzzle that we know we’re going to need ... to make sure this doesn’t reignite.”Trump, however, insisted it was his decision to make.“The president of the United States calls the shots,” he said, promising to release a paper outlining his legal argument.Trump can use his bully pulpit to pressure states to act or threaten them with consequences, but the Constitution gives public health and safety responsibilities primarily to state and local officials.Though Trump abandoned his goal of beginning to roll back social distancing guidelines by Easter, he has been itching to reboot an economy that has dramatically contracted as businesses have shuttered, leaving millions of people out of work and struggling to obtain basic commodities. The closure has also undermined Trump’s reelection message, which hinged on a booming economy.Trump’s claim that he could force governors to reopen their states also represents a dramatic shift in tone. For weeks Trump has argued that states, not the federal government, should lead the response to the crisis. And he has refused to publicly pressure states to enact stay-at-home restrictions, citing his belief in local control of government.While Trump can use his daily White House briefings and Twitter account to try to shape public opinion and pressure governors to bend to his will, “there are real limits on the president and the federal government when it comes to domestic affairs,” John Yoo, a University of California at Berkeley law school professor, said on a recent Federalist Society conference call.Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, a supporter of Trump, said the question of when to lift restrictions would be “a joint effort” between Washington and the states.Talk about how and when to reboot the nation’s economy has come as Trump has bristled at criticism that he was slow to respond to the virus and that lives could have been saved had social distancing recommendations been put in place sooner.That frustration was amplified by comments made by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, who told CNN on Sunday that, “obviously,” had the country “started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives.”Trump responded by reposting a tweet that included the line, “Time to #FireFauci,” raising alarms that Trump might consider trying to oust the 79-year-old doctor. But at Monday’s briefing, Trump insisted Fauci’s job was safe after Fauci took the podium to try to explain his comments.Trump has complained to aides and confidants about Fauci’s positive media attention and his willingness to contradict the president in interviews and from the briefing room stage, according to two Republicans close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal conversations.But Trump has told aides that he knows blowback to removing Fauci would be fierce and that — at least for now — he is stuck with the doctor. On more than one occasion, however, he has urged that Fauci be left out of task force briefings or have his speaking role curtailed, according to the Republicans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-donald-trump-claims-he-has-total-authority-over-reopening-economy/story-Ask27WIXCbIocATlyDe19H.html
14-04-2020||World||117 million children face measles risk from Covid-19 response: UN||Around 117 million children worldwide risk contracting measles because dozens of countries are curtailing their vaccination programmes as they battle COVID-19, the United Nations warned Tuesday. Currently 24 countries, including several already dealing with large measles outbreaks, have suspended widespread vaccinations, the World Health Organization and the UN’s children’s fund UNICEF said.An additional 13 countries have had their vaccination programmes interrupted due to COVID-19. In a joint statement, the Measles and Rubella Initiative (M&RI) said it was vital that immunisation capacity was retained during and after the current pandemic.“Together, more than 117 million children... could be impacted by the suspension of scheduled immunization activities,” it said.“The M&RI supports the need to protect communities and health workers from COVID-19 through a pause of mass campaigns, where risks of the disease are high.” “However, this should not mean that children permanently miss out.”Measles, a highly contagious disease, effects around 20 million people every year, the majority of whom are aged under five. Despite a cheap and readily available vaccine, measles cases have surged in recent years, largely in part to what the WHO terms “vaccine hesitancy”. In 2018, 140,000 measles deaths, mostly among children and babies, were recorded -- most were preventable, meaning that the countries they occurred in had a vaccination programme.Of the two dozen countries to have officially suspended measles vaccine programmes -- ostensibly to protect health workers and prioritise COVID-19 response -- several have seen worrying rises in measles cases in recent years.In particular, Bangladesh, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Nigeria, Ukraine and Kazakhstan are all battling large outbreaks.DR Congo alone has had 6,000 measles deaths in its current epidemic.The country last week also recorded a new case of Ebola -- just days before the UN was due to announce an end to that outbreak. ‘Catch-up’ Robin Nandy, UNICEF’s chief of immunisation, told AFP that COVID-19 was likely to place additional strain on already overburdened healthcare systems.“We have to be mindful of the impact of COVID-19, threatening outbreaks of measles, an extremely contagious and potentially lethal disease for which there already exists a safe and effective vaccine,” he said. “We are therefore urging countries to prepare and plan now for intensive catch-up vaccinations once physical distancing restrictions are lifted.”Billions of people around the world face weeks of lockdown as governments figure out their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts have warned since the start of the outbreak that response programmes to other infectious diseases -- from polio to tuberculosis -- are likely to suffer as health services triage workers to COVID-19 cases.And while COVID-19 is overwhelmingly more serious in older patients, many communicable diseases, including measles, inordinately target children.“Children younger than 12 months of age are more likely to die from measles complications, and if the circulation of measles virus is not stopped, their risk of exposure to measles will increase daily,” said the M&RI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/117-million-children-face-measles-risk-from-covid-19-response-un/story-YYE0wJZzwy0mFsC1kEStpI.html

It has referred to two notices published by Chinese universities where such restrictions have been mentioned.The notices quoted by CNN say that the universities have asked teachers to strictly manage the papers related to virus tracing. They also talk about adding an extra layer of vetting by a scientific research team.The pages carrying the notices have now been deleted, the CNN further reported.A Chinese reseacher quoted by the CNN said that it is a “coordinated effort” from the Chinese government “to control the narrative, and paint it as if the outbreak did not originate in China”. The researcher’s identity has not been revealed.One of the universities quoted by CNN is the Fudan University in Shanghai. The other university is China University of Geoscience in Wuhan, reported CNN.China is, meanwhile, fighting hard to stop a second wave of coronavirus infections.Though the northeast border remains China’s priority, state media reported late on Monday that more than 100 people had been arrested in March for illegally entering China through its southwestern border in Yunnan province.Russia has become China’s largest source of imported cases, with a total of 409 infections originating in the northern neighbour. Chinese people there should stay put and not return home, the state-owned Global Times said in an editorial Tuesday.China’s northeastern border province of Heilongjiang saw 79 new cases of imported coronavirus cases on Monday, all Chinese citizens travelling home from Russia, state media said. Mainland China reported 89 new cases.Heilongjiang’s provincial authority said on Tuesday that it had established a hotline to reward citizens as much as 5,000 yuan ($710) for handing over or reporting illegal immigrants.

The foreign ministry declined to comment.The ministry had said that three companies had won preliminary approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to export kits, but did not identify the firms.After struggling with the first large outbreak of the virus outside of China, South Korea has largely managed to curb its spread without lockdown orders helped by a massive testing campaign and intensive contact tracing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-set-to-double-supply-of-coronavirus-tests-to-us/story-CDXsQg52MBHXre4WUOiQcP.html
14-04-2020||World||Saudi Arabia races to contain coronavirus in Islam’s holiest city||Saudi authorities are racing to contain an outbreak of coronavirus in the Islamic holy city of Mecca, where crowded slums and labor camps have accelerated the spread even with much of the country under a 24-hour curfew.The total number of coronavirus cases reported in Mecca, home to 2 million people, reached 1,050 on Monday compared to 1,422 in the capital of Riyadh, a city more than three times the size. Mecca’s large number of undocumented immigrants and cramped housing for migrant workers have made it more difficult to slow the infection rate.In late March, after five Mecca-based employees of Saudi Binladin Group, one of the kingdom’s biggest construction companies tested positive, authorities locked down housing for 8,000 laborers and suspended work on the expansion of the grand mosque, Islam’s holiest site, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. Some workers were placed in hotel quarantine, the document showed. The company did not respond to a request for comment. It was unclear if the camp remained in lockdown.Shielding Mecca from a pandemic that’s overwhelmed countries like Italy and the United States is crucial for Saudi Arabia. That’s partly because of the city’s significance to the world’s Muslims, but also because the royal family grounds its rule in guardianship of the birthplace of Islam. Millions of Muslim pilgrims visit Mecca each year; King Salman’s official title is “custodian of the two holy mosques.”The government is conscious that the virus sweeping Mecca would “call into question its responsibility in the protection of those spaces, which is part of the legitimacy of the country itself,” said Yasmine Farouk, a visiting fellow in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This is sensitive.”Role of foreignersOverall, Saudi Arabia has reported one of the lowest rates of infection in the region, with around 5,000 cases in a population of over 30 million. Mecca was one of the first Saudi cities to be placed under a full-day curfew, and authorities took unprecedented precautions, suspending religious tourism in February and closing mosques across the country in March.The outbreak underlines a nationwide issue of soaring cases among foreign residents. Foreigners make up about a third of the Saudi population but account for 70% to 80% of new cases recently, according to the health ministry -- a rate that’s sparked debate about their role in society.Some Saudis have attacked foreigners, accusing them of price-gouging, fear-mongering and deliberately spreading infection. Others say that the solution lies in better living conditions for the blue collar foreigners who underpin daily life, driving garbage trucks and cleaning streets. Saudi novelist Mohammed Alwan recently wrote on Twitter that he hopes authorities will create “humane requirements for workers’ housing” after the pandemic.Health minister Tawfiq Al-Rabiah acknowledged the problem in a televised address on Monday, saying a government committee had been formed to deal with the issue.The government has also promised free coronavirus treatment for foreign residents, including undocumented immigrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-races-to-contain-coronavirus-in-islam-s-holiest-city/story-icBfCP1lBWfxav1ChIvnAN.html

14-04-2020||World||Tornadoes bring death, destruction in southern US||Tornadoes ripped through the southern United States, killing at least 32 people and leaving behind splintered buildings and downed powerlines, officials and US media said Monday.Twisters caused catastrophic damage Easter Sunday and early Monday morning as storms moved through a region stretching from Texas to Georgia, prompting the National Weather Service to issue its highest level of tornado alert.Images showed lines of smashed, roofless houses where tornadoes had blasted through, many homes just piles of rubble sitting atop foundations.Aircraft parked at a regional airport in Monroe, Louisiana were piled on top of each other.“By the grace of God, early reports show only a few minor injuries,” Monroe Mayor Jamie Mayo said on Twitter, and the city’s account later posted pictures of downed power lines.In neighboring Mississippi, however, at least 11 people were killed, according to the state’s emergency management agency.The Weather Channel said at least 32 people had died across the region, combining local tolls.There were nine people who died in South Carolina, the outlet reported, citing the state’s governor Henry McMaster, and they reported one death in North Carolina. Seven people were reported to have been killed when tornadoes hit a mobile home park near the Georgia-Tennessee border.“There’s been loss of life, there’s been significant loss of property,” Tennessee Governor Bill Lee said Monday, according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press. The National Weather Service in the state found damage caused by winds estimated to be up to 145 miles (235 kilometers) per hour.The Weather Channel reported one person in Arkansas was killed when a tree fell on a house, plus two other deaths in Alabama.- ‘Horrible, destructive power’ -US President Donald Trump offered his “warmest condolences” to those affected. “My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet,” he said, promising that the Federal Emergency Management Association was already offering assistance. “It’s a tough deal,” he said. “It was a bad grouping of tornadoes -- something incredible, the horrible, destructive power.”Over 1.3 million electricity customers were without power after the storms went through, reported PowerOutage.US.The governors of Mississippi and Louisiana declared states of emergency.“The damage is devastating,” Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said on Twitter. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves tweeted that he had declared a state of emergency “to protect the health and safety of Mississippians in response to the severe tornadoes and storms hitting across the state.”“We are mobilizing all resources available to protect our people and their property,” Reeves said, telling residents “you are not alone.”Earlier on Sunday, Reeves urged residents to take the “severe storms very seriously.”“Please take precautions to keep your family safe.”He later retweeted a message from the state disaster agency reminding people to cover their noses and mouths and practice social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus if they had to go to public storm shelters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tornadoes-bring-death-destruction-in-southern-us/story-Chchnj4fOd2wfyc2tsywIM.html

I can only say that my heart goes out to you under such very difficult circumstances,” he said. Vaisakhi will not be marked with the customary large gatherings and melas in different parts of the UK this year as the community is urged to stay safe amid the coronavirus pandemic, with all events cancelled. London’s annual Vaisakhi on the Square held at Trafalgar Square, scheduled for next Saturday, was cancelled. A similar mega Vaisakhi event held at Handsworth Park in Birmingham, one of the cities with the UK’s largest Sikh population, stands cancelled amid the lockdown, with celebrations in Leicester, Southall and Gravesend also called off. The events at annual Vaisakhi events, including colourful street processions in the form of nagar kirtans, feeding the community with langars as well as cultural activities including the traditional Sikh martial art of Gatka, have been replaced by a focus on community service to help the vulnerable during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-prince-charles-praises-selfless-service-by-british-sikhs-in-vaisakhi-message/story-ZnYT1xN2A3YM5Qx1pfih7O.html

In his greeting to the community to mark the festival, Trudeau said, “In years past, families and friends would celebrate Vaisakhi by gathering at their local Gurdwaras to pray, read from the sacred scripture, and take part in vibrant parades and processions known as Nagar Kirtans. This year, as we continue to feel the impacts of the Covid-19 global pandemic, the Sikh community is celebrating differently, following the recommendations of our public health experts.”Earlier, Trudeau, during a regular media briefing, had also welcomed the service being provided by the community during the crisis, as he said, “Right now, when people need help most, you’re stepping up once again. In Regina, you’re delivering supplies to your neighbours, while in Mississauga you’re donating to the Seva Food Bank.”Among the major Vaisakhi events are those in Toronto and Vancouver. The latter staged by Canada’s most historic gurdwara, the Khalsa Diwan Society, was scheduled for April 18. However, the organisers cancelled the parade, which witnessed the participation of Trudeau last year, “keeping in mind public health and safety”. Similarly, the event in Toronto attracts nearly 50,000 people each year and this too has been cancelled, as the Ontario Sikhs and Gurdwaras Council, noted this was done keeping in mind the “best interest” of communities and “safety of people” which were of “utmost importance.”The premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, Doug Ford, also recognised the role the Indo-Canadians has played during the crisis. He thanked the Canada India Foundation and the Hindu Federation for “using their networks to bring together volunteers and resources to help the vulnerable and those most in need during Covid-19, whether its delivering groceries, donating cooked food, providing medical supplies, or transportation.”The BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, meanwhile, has donated 13,000 medical-grade protective face masks to hospitals in the country. These were originally acquired by BAPS Charities for their health drives and blood donation camps. But, Shirish Shah, President of BAPS Charities, Canada, said, “We feel that the healthcare professionals are vital to our community and with the level of risk they are undertaking, they need to be well protected. If they are safe, we are safer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-re-stepping-up-when-people-need-help-most-trudeau-hails-indo-canadians-in-fight-against-covid-19/story-MnW4OQISwZahhLUyZ7IgPI.html

14-04-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic surpasses worst-case scenario in Canada||The number of deaths due to the Covid-19 pandemic in Canada has already surpassed the worst-case scenario presented by the government just last week in modelling of the spread of the disease till April 16.Federal health authorities released modelling for the impact of the pandemic last week and forecast total fatalities may range between 500 and 700. Critics said the estimate for the number of deaths could be understated since the country had already crossed 500 deaths on April 9. That appeared to be borne out as the total number of fatalities touched 780 by Monday evening, three days short of the end of the projection date of April 16.Through its duration, depending on different scenarios, the number of deaths in the country could range between 11,000 and 22,000, while the number of cases could touch 1.9 million, according to the models presented. They also forecast that the country could witness between 22,580 and 31,850 cases by April 16 and the number reported till Monday night, at nearly 26,000 are within that range.The reason behind the surge past the outlet limit projected is a series of mass casualties in long-term care establishments across the country, which have claimed dozens of lives of the most vulnerable segment, the elderly and those already afflicted with critical illnesses.Such deaths in concentrated numbers at facilities of that nature have been reported from the provinces of Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec. Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr Theresa Tam said that these cases were “driving the severe outcomes in Canada” and this had proved “absolutely a key feature of this epidemic.”The Quebec government on Monday said it was putting the safety and general conditions of the province’s 2,600 long-term care and nursing home facilities under the microscope following the deaths of 31 people in a single home for the elderly since March 13.Police and the coroner’s office are investigating the deaths at the Residence Herron, a 139-unit home in Montreal, which has been put under provincial control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-surpasses-worst-case-scenario-in-canada/story-kjuK3AW0EaEwQTMf0nMggK.html

The 566 new deaths reported by the civil protection service take Italy’s fatalities total to 20,465 - officially second in the world behind the US.The drop in patients in intensive care from a peak of 4,068 on April 3 to 3,260 on Monday confirmed a general improvement in Italy’s Covid-19 trends.The rise in new infections dropped to a new low of just 2%. But a top Italian infectious diseases expert said data were hard to read because new cases showing up now could have occurred up to three weeks ago, given the incubation period.The Mediterranean country last week extended its national lockdown until May 3.In contrast, Spain, one of the countries worst hit by the epidemic, on Monday started to ease tough lockdown restrictions that have kept people confined to their homes for more than a month and put a brake on economic activity.Spain’s cumulative death toll from the coronavirus rose to 17,489 on Monday, up 517 from 16,972 on Sunday, the health ministry said. Confirmed cases totalled 169,496, up from 166,019 the previous day.However, in a sign that the situation was taking a turn for the better, some businesses, including construction and manufacturing, were allowed to reopen.But most of the population are still confined to their homes, and shops, bars and public spaces will remain closed until April 26.People at main transport hubs were handed face masks as they went to work on Monday morning. “The health of workers must be guaranteed. If this is minimally affected, the activity cannot restart,” interior minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Cadena Ser radio station.The lockdown has helped slow a spiralling death rate that reached its peak in early April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-us-italy-loses-20-000-lives-to-coronavirus/story-BZfN03ntUqJ4RDy0itgf0I.html

Iran is among the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic and has recorded more than 73,000 confirmed case and nearly 4,600 deaths.Iran’s foreign ministry tweeted that Zarif and Jaishankar had exchanged views on the latest situation regarding the Covid-19 outbreak in the region and the world and the collective ways to cope with it. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt said they also discussed the “illegal and unilateral US sanctions against the Iranian people”.Besides, Zarif and Jaishankar also discussed the latest political developments in Afghanistan, especially the peace process in that country. Jaishankar tweeted that he and Zarif discussed “respective responses to the #Coronavirus challenge” and “exchanged views on regional developments”. He did not give details or say whether the US sanctions on Iran had figured in the discussions.The Covid-19 crisis also figured in a telephone conversation on Monday between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc. This was the latest in a string of such conversations the Indian premier has had with world leaders to forge a common approach to the pandemic.“The leaders agreed on the potential for bilateral collaboration in fighting Covid-19, including for facilitating supplies of required medical equipment. They also committed to provide necessary support to each other’s citizens present in their territories,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement.Both leaders also stressed the importance of the strategic partnership between India and Vietnam and expressed satisfaction at recent progress on various fronts.

14-04-2020||World||US President Trump says it’s his call when to reopen economy after coronavirus, not governors’||President Donald Trump claimed the authority Monday to decide how and when to reopen the economy after weeks of tough social distancing guidelines aimed at fighting the new coronavirus. But governors from both parties were quick to push back, noting they have the primary constitutional responsibility for ensuring public safety in their states and would decide when it’s safe to begin a return to normal operations.Democratic leaders in the Northeast and along the West Coast announced separate state compacts to coordinate their efforts to scale back stay-at-home orders or reopen businesses on their own timetables, even as Trump tried to say it’s his call.“When somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total,” Trump said at Monday’s White House coronavirus briefing. “The governors know that.”But he would not offer specifics about the source of his authority, which governors asserted was a vast power grab, or his plan to reopen the economy.Anxious to put the twin public health and economic crises behind him, Trump has backed federal social distancing recommendations that expire at the end of the month. But it has been governors and local leaders who have instituted mandatory restrictions, including shuttering schools and closing non-essential businesses.Taking to Twitter, Trump wrote that some are “saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect ... it is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons.”Trump can use his bully pulpit to pressure states to act or threaten them with consequences, but the Constitution gives public health and safety responsibilities primarily to state and local officials.Meanwhile, the president’s guidelines have little force. Governors and local leaders have issued orders that carry fines or other penalties, and in some jurisdictions extend out into the early summer.“All of these executive orders are state executive orders and so therefore it would be up to the state and the governor to undo a lot of that,” New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said on CNN.Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said, “Seeing how we had the responsibility for closing the state down, I think we probably have the primary responsibility for opening it up.”Wolf joined governors in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island in agreeing to coordinate their actions. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced a similar pact. While each state is building its own plan, the three West Coast states have agreed to a framework saying they will work together, put their residents’ health first and let science guide their decisions.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy stressed the efforts would take time.“The house is still on fire,” he said on a conference call with reporters. “We still have to put the fire out, but we do have to begin putting in the pieces of the puzzle that we know we’re going to need ... to make sure this doesn’t reignite.”Though Trump abandoned his goal of rolling back social distancing guidelines by Sunday, he has been itching to reopen an economy that has dramatically contracted as businesses have shuttered, leaving millions of people out of work and struggling to obtain basic commodities. The closure has also undermined Trump’s reelection message, which hinged on a booming economy.Trump’s claim that he could force governors to reopen their states represents a dramatic shift in tone. For weeks now, Trump has argued that states, not the federal government, should lead the response to the crisis. And he has refused to publicly pressure states to enact stay-at-home restrictions, citing his belief in local control of government.While Trump can use his daily White House briefings and Twitter account to try to shape public opinion and pressure governors to bend to his will, “there are real limits on the president and the federal government when it comes to domestic affairs,” John Yoo, a University of California at Berkeley law school professor, said on a recent Federalist Society conference call.“The government doesn’t get opened up via Twitter. It gets opened up at the state level,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said.Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, a supporter of Trump, said the question of when to lift restrictions would be “a joint effort” between Washington and the states.Talk about how and when to reboot the nation’s economy has come as Trump has bristled at criticism that he was slow to respond to the virus and that lives could have been saved had social distancing recommendations been put in place sooner.That frustration was amplified by comments made by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s nation’s top infectious diseases expert. Asked Sunday on CNN if acting earlier could have saved lives, Fauci said that, “obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives.”Trump responded by reposting a tweet that referenced Fauci’s comments and included the line, “Time to #FireFauci,” raising alarms that Trump might consider trying to oust the 79-year-old doctor.Trump has complained to aides and confidants about Fauci’s positive media attention and his willingness to contradict the president in interviews and from the briefing room stage, according to two Republicans close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal conversations.But at Monday’s briefing, Trump said, “I’m not firing him. I think he’s a wonderful guy.”Trump has told aides that he knows blowback to removing Fauci would be fierce and that — at least for now — he is stuck with the doctor. On more than one occasion, however, he has urged that Fauci be left out of task force briefings or have his speaking role curtailed, according to the Republicans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-trump-says-it-s-his-call-when-to-reopen-economy-after-coronavirus-not-governors/story-VX9fuGKt6oaE6ejyj42q5L.html
14-04-2020||World||Covid-19 Update: Confirmed cases of coronavirus surpass 2 million worldwide||New York’s coronavirus death toll topped 10,000 even as the lack of fresh hot spots in the U.S. or elsewhere in the world yielded a ray of optimism and fueled discussions Monday about how some places might begin to reopen.The brunt of the disease has been felt most heavily in New York, Italy, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, but grim projections of a virus that would spread with equal ferocity to other corners of America and the world have not yet materialized after more than a month of measures meant to blunt its impact. Even so, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide surpassed 2 million on Monday.The death toll in populous states such as Florida and Pennsylvania was on par with some individual counties outside New York City. Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city and a hub for immigrant communities and business travelers in the energy industry, has been largely spared compared to other parts of the U.S. As Colorado deaths surpassed 300 on Monday, Gov. Jared Polis compared that figure to New York’s thousands and called it “a tragic indication of our success in Colorado.”Officials around the world worried that halting quarantine and social-distancing measures could easily undo the hard-earned progress that those steps have achieved in slowing the spread.Still, there were signs countries were looking in that direction. Spain permitted some workers to return to their jobs, while a hard-hit region of Italy loosened its lockdown restrictions. Governors on both coasts of the U.S. announced that they would join forces to come up with a coordinated reopening at some point, setting the stage for a potential conflict with President Donald Trump, who asserted that he is the ultimate decision-maker for determining how and when to reopen.Trump continued those assertions during an afternoon White House briefing on Monday, pushing back against reporters’ questions about whether the president or governors have the authority to ease the restrictions. He said his administration has “a very good relationship” with the governors, but “the federal government has absolute power” in that decision-making process if it chooses to exercise it.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the briefing that he expects more than 80 million Americans will have tax rebates directly deposited into their bank accounts by Wednesday. Under the program, single filers will receive $1,200 and joint filers $2,400, though it phases out for higher incomes. The rebates are aimed at boosting the economy as the country responds to the coronavirus.New York saw a few positive signs Monday even as it reached another bleak milestone. It marked the first time in a week that the daily toll dipped below 700. Almost 2,000 people were newly hospitalized with the virus Sunday, though once discharges and deaths are accounted for, the number of people hospitalized has flattened to just under 19,000.“This virus is very good at what it does. It is a killer,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday.In the U.S., about half of the more than 22,000 deaths reported are in the New York metropolitan area. Meanwhile, tracking maps maintained by Johns Hopkins University showed a dense patchwork of coronavirus cases along the Northeast corridor, as well as significant outbreaks corresponding to other major metropolitan areas — though nothing on the scale of what New York has endured.Houston’s 18 total deaths since the start of the outbreak make up a tiny fraction of the one-day toll in New York City, prompting Mayor Sylvester Turner to say the city was achieving its goal of slowing “the progression of this virus so that our health care delivery system would not be overwhelmed.”Dr. Sebastian Johnston, a professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, said it appeared that COVID-19 had peaked in much of Europe, including France, Spain, Germany, Italy and the U.K. He was worried the virus might now start to take off in countries across Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia. There’s also concern about Russia.Hot spots may yet emerge as states lift stay-at-home orders, said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington institute that created widely cited projections of virus-related deaths. He pointed to states where the number of COVID-19 cases is still climbing: Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida.“Don’t consider relaxing social distancing in the near term,” Murray said he’d advise leaders in those states. “You need to stay the course.”To date, some U.S. infections have taken off like sparks starting fires, while others have sputtered out. Trevor Bedford, whose lab at Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has been tracking the pandemic using the virus’s genetic code, acknowledges it’s a “dice roll” that makes it hard to predict hot spots.And when restrictions are eased, people will not immediately dive back into their social connections, at least not without precautions, Bedford said.A study released Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, relying on data from mobile devices in New Orleans, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, suggested that social-distancing policies prompted more people to stay at home in March and might have curbed spread of the virus.Researchers say people increasingly left their devices, and themselves, at home as cities, states and the federal government adopted increasingly restrictive closures and social distancing policies.The report “provides some very early indications that these measures might help slow the spread of COVD-19,” the authors said.In Washington, the Trump administration sought to delay deadlines for the 2020 census because of the outbreak, a move that would push back timetables for releasing data used to draw congressional and legislative districts.The infection rate remains relatively low in areas of the developing world that have poor or nonexistent health care infrastructure. The rapid spread of the coronavirus beyond cities to more rural areas often depends on travel and social connections, said Dr. Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief.But he noted that rural areas often have less sophisticated health surveillance systems to pick up potential disease clusters, prompting the question, “Is it that it’s not there or is it that we’re not detecting the disease when it is there?”In some European countries, officials pointed to positive signs as they began prepping for the reopening of largely shuttered economies and industries.Italian authorities announced on Monday that there were 3,153 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, approximately a 1.9 percent increase. That brings the country’s overall toll of known cases to nearly 160,000. The day-to-day death toll, 566, however, was up, from the 431 new deaths registered on Sunday.Italy’s day-to-day increase in infections was one of the lowest in weeks, bolstering a generally downward trend. Slightly eased restrictions were about to take effect in some sectors of the country, such as allowing stores selling necessities for newborns to reopen.The hard-hit Veneto region, which has been credited with a rapid response to the virus that has helped limit the number of fatalities. is entering a phase the governor, Luca Zaia, termed ‘’lockdown light.’’Zaia is allowing residents to go beyond 200 meters (219 yards) from home for physical fitness and permitting open-air markets, under a new ordinance taking effect Tuesday. The ordinance also makes masks or other face coverings mandatory everywhere outside the home.In hard-hit Spain, workers were permitted to return to some factory and construction jobs as the government looked to restart manufacturing. Retail stores and services were still required to stay closed, and the government required office workers to keep working from home.Some health experts and politicians argue that it’s premature to ease the lockdown in a nation that has suffered more than 17,750 deaths and reported more than 170,000 infections, second only to the United States’ nearly 683,000 infections.Health Minister Salvador Illa said Monday that he would proceed with “the utmost caution and prudence ... and always based on scientific evidence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-confirmed-cases-of-coronavirus-surpass-2-million-worldwide/story-riL0vF0V1Gjm4M7ntu0Q2H.html

14-04-2020||World||France extends lockdown as countries see hope of Covid-19 peak||France extended its nationwide lockdown on Monday for another month in a bid to halt the coronavirus pandemic, as other hard-hit countries considered easing their measures with hopes rising that death rates may soon plateau.More than half of humanity is now under confinement to contain the virus, which has killed more than 117,000 people and infected nearly 1.9 million since emerging in China late last year. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage Most of the dead are in Europe, but the United States has also been hard hit -- particularly New York state where more than 10,000 have died, close to half of all fatalities in the country.Governments around the world are under pressure to save their economies from total collapse as a result of the mass shutdown of businesses and confinement of people, but officials are also trying to avoid a deadly second wave of the disease. While New York’s governor said the peak had passed on Monday, Spain started to ease lockdown orders on Monday and Austria readied to reopen some shops. But France did not follow suit, extending a lockdown in place since March 17 until May 11, after which schools and businesses are set to gradually reopen. President Emmanuel Macron said the epidemic was “beginning to steady... (and) hope is returning”, speaking in a televised address to the nation.“May 11 will be the start of a new phase. It will be progressive and the rules can be adapted according to our results,” he added. France reported a slight increase in hospital deaths on Monday -- though still below its record numbers of last week -- and a slight dip in intensive care patients for a fifth day running. The announcement came as the World Health Organization said lifting curbs too soon could unleash a second wave of cases and warned that only a vaccine would fully halt the spread of the COVID-19 disease.‘Path to normalcy’ But in some hotspots, there were slivers of hope that regular life may soon resume. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared that the “worst is over” in the state, saying he was working on a plan to gradually reopen the economy.“I believe we can now start on the path to normalcy,” he said. The impact on New York has been brutal, with unclaimed victims buried in unmarked mass graves and makeshift morgues set up for the dead.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to end the restrictions in place across much of the country as soon as possible to revive the hammered American economy. European governments were also keen to get their economies moving again.In Spain, where more than 17,000 have died, construction and factory workers were allowed back on the job on Monday and police handed out face masks at train stations to commuters.“It’s amazing that the government is doing this because either you can’t find them in shops or they’re very expensive,” said nurse Brenda Palacios, who took two masks.Austria said it would reopen small shops and hardware and gardening stores on Tuesday following a one-month lockdown, with coronavirus infections stabilising. And Italy will reopen some bookshops and laundries on a trial basis on Tuesday, although it has officially extended its national lockdown until May 3.Italy is the second worst-hit country after the United States and its death toll topped 20,000 on Monday -- however, the number of critically ill patients dropped for the 10th successive day.Meanwhile, German scientists recommended a gradual lifting of restrictions later this week with the rate of new infections falling and a death toll that remains far below other major European nations.WHO vaccine warning But the World Health Organization warned that even the most careful easing of lockdowns was no substitute for a vaccine -- a process that is likely to take at least a year. “Ultimately, the development and delivery of a safe and effective vaccine will be needed to fully interrupt transmission,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from Geneva.He added that coronavirus was 10 times deadlier than the 2009-10 swine flu outbreak.Similar warnings will weigh heavily on decisions being made in other countries. In Britain, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab warned its three-week lockdown would not be lifted this week as the virus has not yet peaked.Raab is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was released from hospital Sunday after being treated for coronavirus, thanking doctors who he said saved his life. Britain recorded 717 deaths on Monday, a slight drop from the day before, taking the toll to over 11,000. China infections rise In China, officials reported 108 new symptomatic cases Monday, the highest number of confirmed infections in a single day in over a month.Imported cases accounted for most of the total, officials said.Russia reported its highest daily rise in cases so far, as the capital Moscow began to issue digital travel permits.And in India, key industries warned of social unrest unless Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes concessions when he announces any extension Tuesday to a three-week lockdown of the country’s 1.3 billion people.It is not only humans under threat, with a major western Indian zoo bringing in social distancing for its big cats after a tiger in the United States caught the virus.“We have decided to isolate them to avoid any kind of infection,” superintendent Bharatsinh Vihol said at the Kamala Nehru Zoological Garden in Gujarat state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-extends-lockdown-as-countries-see-hope-of-covid-19-peak/story-ulbTAixQKTILiBZyOPRQJN.html
14-04-2020||World||Covid-19: ‘Worst is over’, says New York governor as coronavirus death toll tops 10,000||New York’s governor declared Monday that the “worst is over” for its coronavirus outbreak, despite deaths passing 10,000, as several states began devising a plan to reopen their shuttered economies.Andrew Cuomo said lower average hospitalization rates and intubations suggested a “plateauing” of infections in America’s coronavirus epicenter but warned the outbreak could worsen if restrictions are lifted too quickly.“The worst is over if we continue to be smart going forward. I believe we can now start on the path to normalcy,” Cuomo told reporters.The governor, a Democrat, said 671 people had died in New York in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths in America’s hardest-hit state to 10,056.It was the lowest single-day toll in New York since April 5. The highest of 799 was reported on Thursday of last week.Cuomo, and the governors of neighboring New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island, later held a joint conference call where they announced a taskforce to come up with a reopening plan.On the West Coast, the governors of California, Oregon and the state of Washington also announced an agreement on a shared vision to reopen their economies and prevent the spread of the virus.Details about their plans were expected on Tuesday. Earlier, President Donald Trump tweeted that any decision to end shutdowns rested with him, even though it was individual governors who rolled out the lockdowns in the first place.America’s federal system of government delegates powers to the governors of the 50 states, but the president in theory can use his powers to oversee a coordinated national strategy.Cuomo said 18 officials, three from each of the six east coast states, would start work immediately on a “coordinated” proposal to get businesses and schools open again. “We didn’t start with a timetable but we’ll say to the group, ‘We want it ASAP but we want it smart,’“ Cuomo explained. He said at his earlier press conference that the reopening would be gradual, would involve easing isolation measures and could start with recalibrating who is an essential worker. ‘Delicate balance’ It would also require an increase in testing to monitor infection rates and would be based on data and the advice of health experts, not politicians.“This is a delicate balance,” Cuomo said. “It’s not going to be, we flip the switch, and everybody comes out of their house, gets in their car, waves and hugs each other, and the economy will start.”The governor described restarting New York’s shuttered economy as like “opening a valve,” and implored people to “do it carefully, do it slowly and do it intelligently.”“If you see that infection rates start ticking up, which would be undermining everything we have accomplished thus far, then you know you’ve opened the valve too fast,” he said.Cuomo encouraged New York’s 19.5 million inhabitants to continue to follow social distancing guidelines, saying “two or three days of reckless behavior” could set the fight against the pandemic back.New York state -- the epicenter of the US outbreak -- accounts for almost half of the country’s more than 23,070 deaths, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University.The virus has particularly spread among Latino and African-American communities living in deprived neighborhoods where many residents work in service sectors and often lack comprehensive health insurance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-worst-is-over-says-new-york-governor-as-coronavirus-death-toll-tops-10-000/story-RDmerNtK4RguhStMpBCBgN.html

Speaking to the BBC, Gates said several countries have failed on providing proper health care and there will be a “post mortem” when the disease is tackled. “We are in uncharted territory due to a lack of investment and preparation,” Gates said.Gates said his foundation is paying for the construction of facilities that will manufacture seven coronavirus vaccines and the best two vaccines would be picked up for final trials. Gates has also called upon donor governments to help low- and middle-income countries prepare for this pandemic, in addition to helping their own citizens respond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/very-few-nations-will-get-a-grade-on-response-to-pandemic-bill-gates/story-4JMiPoAXOPLUz2Lr26rYTK.html

A total of 49 Chinese nationals who entered Heilongjiang province from Russia tested positive.On Monday, two people were reported dead in Hubei, pushing the toll to 3,341 while total cases stood at 82,160. As of Sunday, the mainland had reported a total of 1,378 imported cases.Chinese cities near the border with Russia are tightening controls and imposing quarantines in response to influx of infected patients from the country.No case occurred in November: ChinaChina on Monday rejected reports that the earliest case of Covid-19 in its territory occurred last November and that it had concealed the real situation regarding the pandemic, describing them as a distortion of facts.Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement: “Recently, certain Indian media ignored the facts that China had officially released and continued to blame China for concealing the real situation. These claims are fact-distorting and irresponsible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tightens-border-with-russia-after-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-UttR9oatiXztsHOMNAu9rJ.html
14-04-2020||World||Bernie Sanders endorses former rival Joe Biden for president||Bernie Sanders endorsed his former rival Joe Biden for president on Monday in a joint online appearance.“I am asking all Americans, I’m asking every Democrat, I’m asking every independent, I’m asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse,” Sanders said.The backing is a crucial development for Biden, who must bridge the Democratic Party’s ideological divide to unify voters against President Donald Trump in the fall. Biden and Sanders, a leading progressive, clashed throughout the primary over policy issues such as the “Medicare for All” universal health care plan.The endorsement stands in contrast to the extended 2016 fight between Sanders and Hillary Clinton, who became the nominee that year. Sanders endorsed Clinton, but only after the end of a drawn-out nominating fight and amid a bitter fight over the Democratic platform that extended to the summer convention.Sanders did not immediately address Monday whether he would continue to fight for delegates at state conventions around the country or whether he’d simply use his newfound alliance with Biden to influence the nominee and the policy slate that he will present voters.Appearing in a split screen with Biden, Sanders said there’s “no great secret out there that you and I have our differences.”But he cited ongoing work between the two camps on several policy matters as a reason for the endorsement. And he said the biggest priority was defeating Trump.“We’ve got to make Trump a one-term president,” Sanders said. “I will do all that I can to make that happen.” do all that I can to make that happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bernie-sanders-endorses-former-rival-joe-biden-for-president/story-ychl4r4ty2VGGHhwvSnhpN.html
14-04-2020||World||Imran Khan rushes back to UNSC over Kashmir, this time over domicile law||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has gone back to the United Nations Security Council over Jammu and Kashmir, this time over the new set of domicile rules notified by the home ministry last month. In a letter to the UNSC, Pakistan foreign minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi accused India of taking advantage of global focus on coronavirus to change Kashmir’s demographics.Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s letter was sent on Sunday, barely three months after its last attempt to rake up the Kashmir issue with the backing of its all-weather ally Beijing was rejected. India’s foreign ministry hasn’t responded to Pakistan’s effort yet.One Indian official said New Delhi will respond to Pakistan’s “three-page rant” at an appropriate time. He, however, underlined that the letter to UNSC was sent on the same day Prime Minister Imran Khan sent out a video SOS to the international community for help to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.In his letter to Jose Singer, the Special Envoy of the Dominican Republic who holds the UNSC President’s post this month, Pakistan alleged that the government’s new domicile rules for Jammu and Kashmir were designed to change the “demographic structure” of Jammu and Kashmir.The Union home ministry had last month issued rules that reserve all government jobs in J&K for domiciled residents of the union territory. In this set of rules, the government had accepted demands from people who spent a lifetime in J&K that they should also be counted as residents. Accordingly, people who have lived in the UT for 15 years are being treated as domiciled residents.Pakistan said this “action and its possible consequences” had triggered fear among Kashmiris. “They are now threatened by “demographic flooding” by outsiders,” Qureshi said.“The timing of the Indian action, at this moment of global health crisis, is particularly reprehensible as it seeks to take advantage of the international community’s focus on the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and further advance the ruling BJP’s sinister, “Hindutva” agenda,” Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in his letter to the UNSC President.Qureshi also accused India of ceasefire violations along the border of the two countries.There has been a spike in firing along the Line of Control, the de facto border this year; both countries blame each other for starting it off.Qureshi said there had been 700 ceasefire violations by India since December 2019.India, on the other hand, has counted nearly 1,200 ceasefire violations between January and March; 411 of them last month when Covid-19 cases started to peak globally. The Indian Army sees a link between a spike in ceasefire violations by Pakistan and continuing efforts to push terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir. Intelligence agencies have reported that there were more than 200 Pakistan-trained terrorists waiting to cross over into India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-rushes-back-to-unsc-over-kashmir-this-time-over-domicile-law/story-MdXpD19QXze2CCnimkQt7I.html
