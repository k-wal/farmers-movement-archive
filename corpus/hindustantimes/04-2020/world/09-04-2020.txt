The report also pointed to chatter on social media from some terrorist elements pushing for targeting stores owned by the people of “Indian descent.”The alert was issued by the National Counterterrorism Centre in America, and formed part of a security advisory from the US rail industry. The existence of this document, which has been distributed in Canada by the First Responder Terrorism Awareness Program of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP, was first reported by the Canadian outlet Global News. Terrorists are being encouraged not just to use conventional means for attacks but also to infect large groups with the Covid-19 virus.The report warned that extremists on the social media platform Telegram, considered popular among members and followers of the Islamic State, had advocated for infecting rabbis and store owners ‘of Indian descent.” However, the concern is not limited to jihadi groups but also over white supremacists.The report stated: “Pandemics and other natural crises create unprecedented challenges that terrorists could exploit to conduct attacks against and already stressed society, and strained government and public safety system,” according to excerpts published by Global News.While the majority of people remain at home due to fear of coronavirus infection, places where there are still larger gatherings like hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets could be “potentially attractive targets” for terrorists. It also noted that terrorists with Covid-19 were asked to spread the disease in places like mosques, synagogues and neighbourhoods with diverse populations.The US intelligence report also said, “A related concern is propaganda calling on ‘believers,’ adherents, and supporters to exploit the prevailing duress on law enforcement and security professionals to attempt to execute attacks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terrorists-could-plot-attacks-as-public-safety-system-under-stress-due-to-covid-19-report/story-y7HkQbsMkBMFu2pumHKcnL.html

The monarch has isolated himself in a palace on an island on the Red Sea, and the crown prince is sheltering with senior member of his government at a remote site where he has planned to build a futuristic city, the publication said.It cited an internal memo issued by the hospital on the beds being set aside. “We don’t know how many cases we will get but high alert,” the message said, instructing that “all chronic patients to be moved out ASAP.”A senior royal who is governor of Riyadh is among those infected and is in intensive care, the report said.The coronavirus does not discriminate, as it has demonstrated. US Prime Minister Boris Johnson remained in ICU in London for the third day Thursday, and many members of the Iranian government are reported to have been infected.Saudi Arabia has nearly 3,300 reported cases confirmed infection and 44 deaths. But the kingdom began its mitigation effort even fore the first case was reported , air travel was suspended on March 2 and so was pilgrimage to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.There are indications the kingdom may cancel this year’s Haj pilgrimage, which has been held annually without interruption since 1798.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/150-saudi-royals-infected-says-report/story-ISXH1kP6fsF4y1ReknErOK.html

Then, a rider||The Pakistan government on Thursday pledged $3 million to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation’s (SAARC) Covid-19 Emergency Fund on the condition that the facility be administered by the Saarc secretariat.Pakistan is the last of Saarc’s eight members to contribute to the fund, which was created with an initial corpus of $10 million provided by India following a video conference of leaders of the grouping on March 15.“While communicating Pakistan’s decision to the Saarc Secretariat, it has been conveyed that all proceeds of the Fund should be administered by the Saarc Secretariat and that the modalities for the Fund’s utilisation should be finalised through consultations with the Member States as per the Saarc Charter,” said a statement from Pakistan’s Foreign Office.“Pakistan’s perspective in this regard was also conveyed during a telephone conversation between Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood and Secretary General SAARC Esala Ruwan Weerakoon, today,” the statement added.According to New Delhi, India’s engagements with Saarc members on Covid-19 related matters are stand-alone events whereas Pakistan has sought to bring all issues under the Saarc secretariat in a bid to block Indian initiatives.On Wednesday, Pakistan skipped a video conference of senior trade officials of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc), saying it chose not to participate since the Saarc secretariat wasn’t involved in organising it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pledges-3-mn-to-saarc-covid-19-emergency-fund/story-Amx06zCQoTxMYhMVhwjxSN.html
09-04-2020||World||Covid-19: UK to continue lockdown as coronavirus death toll nears 8,000||It is too early to lift the ongoing lockdown, foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Thursday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson continued to improve in the intensive care unit, while the UK’s death mounted by another 881 to 7,978.“Thank you for your sacrifice but we’re not done yet. We must keep going. The measures will have to stay in place until the evidence shows we have moved beyond the peak”, Raab, who is deputising for Johnson, said at the daily briefing. The number of cases rose to 65,077.“The early signs suggest they are having an impact. We mustn’t give the coronavirus a second chance to kill more people. I know it is tough going but this is a team effort. The measures will have to stay in place until we have got evidence that shows we have moved beyond the peak”.Chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said social distancing is helping to stop the virus spreading within the community. There “might even be some flattening” of new cases, he said, because had it not been flattening, there would have been “many, many more” cases.Meanwhile, initial data and anecdotal evidence of medical professionals suggested that 35% of critically ill coronavirus patients are of Indian and other non-white origin in the UK, with London boroughs with large Indian population figuring among the most afflicted.The London area has the largest number of cases in the UK, followed by the Midlands (including Birmingham, Leicester). The London boroughs with high number of cases include Brent, Barnet, Ealing and Harrow – each with a high presence of Indian-origin people.Kamlesh Khunti, a medical expert at the University of Leicester, told BBC: “A lot of people have been concerned about this issue based on anecdotal reports and now this data is showing a signal regarding a higher number of black and minority ethnic populations being admitted to intensive care units.”NHS doctors who have died so far are all from minority origin, including Jitendra Kumar Rathod. Nurses who have passed away also include some of Asian origin. Their deaths have been highlighted by anti-racism campaigners who hail their contribution to the NHS.According to Khunti, the reasons Indian and other non-white people figure more in the figures, despite accounting for only 14 per cent of the UK population, include many coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, working in public-facing occupations, holding different cultural beliefs and behaviours or being at high risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-to-continue-lockdown-as-coronavirus-death-toll-nears-8-000/story-UBTO8PACZCiNZJs7ypeDlM.html

Many establishments shut down and others downsized to survive the cascading drop in business.Janet Yellen, the former chair of the US federal reserve, has said the unemployment rate in the US is already at 12-13%, which is the worse it’s been since the Great Depression of 1929, according to the Washington Post, which cited another economist saying this is “the Great Depression II”. The Great Depression was the worst economic downturn in US history and lasted for years, into the 1930s, with unemployment shooting up to 25% at its peak.The coronavirus had killed more than 14,800 people in the United States till Thursday morning, when the new unemployment numbers were announced, and left 432,000 reported cases of confirmed infections, almost a fourth of the global total of 1.5 million. New York state remained the worst hit with more than 6,200 deaths; 4,571 in New York City alone.The adjoining state of New Jersey was next with 1,500 fatalities; followed by Michigan with nearly 960; Louisiana with 650; and California with more than 500. Hundreds of fatalities have been reported from many other states. African Americans have accounted for a disproportionately higher rare of death than other racial demographics.But US public health officials have said despite these growing numbers of infections and fatalities, there is evidence that social-distancing and all other mitigation efforts are working, which has caused a lowering of the projection of deaths. To 60,415 by August, from more than 80,000 at the start, according to the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation.“We’ve carefully looked at Italy and Spain,” Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House task force on the coronavirus, told reporters at the daily briefing Wednesday, referring to the two European nations that have had the highest fatalities so far with 17,699 and 15,328 respectively. “ And we are doing much better, in many cases, than several other countries. And we’re trying to understand that”But Birx and Anthony Fauci, the leading epidemiologist and a member of the White House task force, have stressed the need to keep the mitigation efforts in place, arguing now is not the time to ease them.President Trump is going with their advice, but has been keen to reopen up the country and put it back in business precisely because of the kind of unemployment numbers that are being reported and has repeatedly sought to be more optimistic; he has taken to saying he can see the light at the end of the tunnel these days.“We’re hopefully heading toward a final stretch -- the light at the end of the tunnel, as I was saying,” the president said at the daily briefing. “As we continue to wage all-out medical war to defeat the virus, we’re also fighting an economic war to ensure we can quickly turn to full financial strength”.The Trump administration has sought a relief package of $250 billion in addition to the record $2.2 trillion cleared March end. The additional amount is meant for small businesses (with 500 and less workers) that employ 48% of the US workforce., to enable them to stay in business and hold on to their employees.The $2.2 trillion package, which pumps money into every corner of the economy, includes enhanced unemployment benefits of $600 a week for the next four months; in addition to the direct payment of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child that most Americans below a certain income level are expected to receive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-leaves-6-6m-more-americans-jobless-kills-more-than-14-800/story-OR70gVD9lOSkcbgBpMVqNK.html

Several of the other captured terrorists are Pakistani nationals, Afghanistan’s spy agency or National Directorate of Security (NDS) said.Farooqi has been linked to the March 25 attack on a Sikh place of worship in Kabul that killed more than 25 people, including an Indian national. Indian security officials have also said the ISKP targeted the Sikhs after being unable to attack the heavily fortified Indian mission in Kabul.On Thursday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office called in Afghan ambassador Atif Mashal and informed him of Islamabad’s views regarding the arrest of ISKP leader Aslam Farooqi by Afghan authorities.“It was underscored to the ambassador that since Aslam Farooqi was involved in anti-Pakistan activities in Afghanistan, he should be handed over to Pakistan for further investigations,” said a statement from the Foreign Office.The statement added, “It was emphasised that Pakistan had been expressing its concerns over the activities of this group, which were clearly detrimental to Pakistan. Pakistan’s position in this regard was being regularly shared with the Government of Afghanistan and others concerned.”Pakistan also called for the two sides to “coordinate actions against the menace of terrorism, including through established mechanisms”.Security officials in New Delhi were sceptical about Pakistan’s demand. One official, who declined to be named, said: “It seems the Pakistanis are more worried about what Aslam Farooqi could divulge about his long-standing links to the Pakistani military establishment.”The ISKP has claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Afghanistan’s minorities such as the Hazara Shias and Sikhs. However, it has been put on the backfoot after coordinated operations by Afghan forces since November in Nangarhar led to the surrender of hundreds of the group’s fighters and sympathisers.When ISKP claimed the March 25 attack on the Sikhs in Kabul, it said an Indian national from Kerala – Muhsin Trikaripur alias Abu Khalid al-Hindi – was among the attackers. All the terrorists involved in the attack were killed.Two other top ISKP leaders, both Pakistani nationals, were captured along with Farooqi. Also known as Mawlavi Abdullah, Farooqi became head of the ISKP last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-asks-afghanistan-to-hand-over-captured-iskp-leader-aslam-farooqi/story-05ZVJSIIN2oZQxaYtcgdfK.html

But an emergency situation is not a blank cheque to disregard human rights obligations,” said Michelle Bachelet.The former Chilean president was addressing the first-ever virtual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.“Emergency measures should be necessary and proportionate,” she said.“I am profoundly concerned by certain countries’ adoption of emergency powers that are unlimited.” Free speech restrictions Many countries have adopted extraordinary measures to deal with the pandemic, which has killed nearly 100,000 people worldwide since it emerged in China in December.In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban is now ruling by decree until his government says the crisis has passed.“In a few cases, the epidemic is being used to justify repressive changes to regular legislation, which will remain in force long after the emergency is over,” said Bachelet.“In some countries we have already seen reports of journalists being penalised for reporting a lack of masks, health-workers reprimanded for saying they lack protection, and ordinary people arrested for social media postings about the pandemic.“Criticism is not a crime.”Bachelet also called on governments to “greatly increase access to accurate information and statistics” on the pandemic, stressing that “transparency is paramount and can be life-saving in a health crisis”.Some countries, organisations and leaders -- including US President Donald Trump -- have voiced doubts about the figures from China on the numbers of deaths and infections.Bachelet also urged countries to protect their most vulnerable citizens during the pandemic, including detainees, the poor, women and migrants.“Unchecked, the pandemic is likely to create even wider inequalities, amid extensive suffering,” she said, reiterating her call for a relaxation of international sanctions on countries like Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-no-blank-cheque-to-flout-civil-liberties-says-un/story-YIefXRntkSXqt8YY0o7qBN.html

He was acquitted.The affair made Tripp a villain to Democrats and Clinton supporters, but a minor hero to Republicans.Tripp said in a 1999 interview, on the day of Clinton’s acquittal, that she had no regrets despite having received numerous threats.“The public has no clue... absolutely no idea what Monica endured,” she told NBC.“It was worth it to me to do what I considered to be my patriotic duty.”She was later forced from her job, in which she was a political appointee, when Clinton left office in January 2001.After that she moved to Middleburg, Virginia where she operated a Christmas store, The Christmas Sleigh, with her second husband Dieter Rausch. Lewinsky, who made clear at the time that she felt deeply betrayed, tweeted earlier Wednesday about Tripp after news emerged that she was severely ill.“No matter the past, upon hearing that Linda Tripp is very seriously ill, I hope for her recovery. I can’t imagine how difficult this is for her family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/linda-tripp-who-exposed-clinton-lewinsky-sex-scandal-dies-of-cancer/story-Ew37d3KSoDXWPVl07W1V0K.html

So far, 572 patients have recovered from the deadly disease in Pakistan, ANI reported.Five people have died in the last 24 hours bringing the nation-wide toll to 64. Thirty-one patients are currently battling for life at healthcare centres, the news agency said.The country’s Punjab province has more than 2,100 affected people.Pakistan is making frantic efforts to tackle the pandemic. Prime Minister Khan once again warned the people to follow official guidelines on self-isolation or the virus would spread further.“It is a misconception that this pandemic will not spread rapidly; it will become worse in the days to come. If we don’t take preventive measures, the deadly disease will rise in the country like it did in Europe and will create a lot of trouble for us,” Khan said.He also said that the hospitals in Pakistan may not be able to cope with the patients, according to local media.He, however, defended his decision to not impose total lockdown, saying over 50 million were below the poverty line in the country and they could die of hunger if such step is taken.The Sindh province has reported as many as 1,128 cases, followed by 560 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 213 in Gilgit Baltistan, 212 in Balochistan, 102 in Islamabad and 28 in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK).The government has extended partial lockdown till April 14 and is constantly asking people to stay indoors and follow social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-near-4-500-in-pakistan-but-imran-khan-won-t-impose-total-lockdown/story-EDM40ZP2hGHAiNDb7zFvsI.html

While she was cleared of the infection recently, Trudeau had chosen to remain in self-isolation and Wednesday marked the first time he attended a meeting in person. He will continue to work mainly from home.However, as Covid-19 cases spike in Canada, Trudeau said the government couldn’t tell “exactly when we’re going to be peaking.” But, he added that if Canadians kept to measures like social distancing and leaving home only for essential activities, then the nation “will get through this much, much quicker.”He welcomed the positive effect that social distancing has had in curbing the spread of the disease, and added that such behavioural changes may be necessary for more than a year, till a vaccine to counter Covid-19 becomes a reality. “Once we are through this initial phase, we will then be in a mode, until there is a vaccine, which could take many many months, if not more than a year, to get to. We will be calibrating very carefully our behaviours as a country, as a society, as an economy, to managing the existence and persistence of COVID19,” he said while addressing the media.He also said that social distancing and staying at home had proved “very effective.”“It is clear that the best outcomes come when there is maximal social distancing, as we are pretty close to doing right now,” he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-25-days-in-self-isolation-canadian-pm-chairs-cabinet-meet-on-covid-19/story-41P4HVEiDAloEzfDk8oXpL.html
09-04-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson stable as lockdown extension looms||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday began a fourth day in intensive care “improving” in his battle with coronavirus, as his government prepared to extend a nationwide lockdown introduced last month.Johnson is the most high-profile world leader to become infected with Covid-19 and his transfer to intensive care on Monday is unprecedented for a prime minister during a national emergency in modern times.“He’s stable, improving, sat up and engaged with medical staff,” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC News. “I think things are getting better for him.”The disease has struck at the heart of the British government, infected more than 60,000 people nationwide and killed over 7,000, with another record daily death toll of 938 reported on Wednesday.Senior ministers were set to discuss at Thursday’s daily coronavirus response meeting the process for extending the stringent social distancing measures rolled out on March 23.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Johnson, will lead the so-called “war cabinet”, as he has done since Monday.However, ministers have made it clear no announcement on the status of the lockdown -- rolled out for an initial three weeks -- would be made until that period has ended on Monday, at the earliest.The Sun newspaper reported the government’s top scientific advisers will not meet until Friday to assess the situation.“You shouldn’t expect a decision today on restrictions,” Dowden said, stressing the actual review would happen next week.“Right now it’s just beginning to work,” he said of the lockdown, noting new Covid-19 cases in Britain were not “accelerating”.“When we have the opportunity to change it, we will, but that is not the moment now.” ‘Relentless’ Johnson arrived in hospital on Sunday night following concerns he still had a cough and high temperature 10 days after being diagnosed with coronavirus.He had spent the previous nine days in self-isolation in a flat above his Downing Street office.The 55-year-old Conservative leader was transferred to intensive care on Monday night on the advice of his medical team as his condition was seen to be deteriorating.He has received messages of support from around the world, with US President Donald Trump sending best wishes to his “very good friend”. Russian leader Vladimir Putin said Johnson’s “energy, optimism and sense of humour” would see him through.Experts have said it was not uncommon for Covid-19 patients to move to intensive care, but said it showed his condition was serious.The British government has been criticised for a slow response to the pandemic, initially refusing to follow other European countries in requiring people to stay home as the virus spread rapidly across the globe.Johnson himself said in early March that he was still shaking hands with people -- only for Covid-19 to sweep through the British establishment weeks later.Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, have both since been infected, although they have since recovered.The government has insisted that its coronavirus response has been led by the medical and scientific evidence throughout.Attention is now increasingly focused on when it might be able to lift the unprecedented restrictions it eventually put in place to stem the spread.Despite several European countries setting out plans to ease their lockdowns, British newspapers reported Thursday the measures were set to remain in the UK into at least May.Meanwhile, with good weather forecast for the upcoming long Easter weekend, The Times said political leaders from across Britain will unite to launch a “stay at home this Easter” campaign.“We need to be relentless,” a source told the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-stable-as-lockdown-extension-looms/story-iBQrN8Mdl4uRN7caBa6CMP.html

09-04-2020||World||Wuhan coronavirus lockdown over, but lingering fears slow recovery||Hairstylist “Ah Ping” is back in business now that Wuhan’s coronavirus lockdown has been lifted, but his salon has no customers, only empty chairs and lingering fears over a contagion that continues to haunt the city.Wuhan is waking from its coronavirus nightmare, loosening tight restrictions on movement and business as the global pandemic’s launchpad tries to move on.But full recovery remains hampered by fear of a potential new wave of infections.Many businesses and all schools are still closed, restaurants aren’t allowed dine-in customers, and some neighbourhoods remain sealed off behind barriers.Residents need to show they have a “healthy” rating on a mandatory phone app to leave their homes, use public transport, or enter most public spaces.“When people come out, infections will probably rise. I’m really afraid of this,” said “Ah Ping”, a nickname.The 43-year-old, who declined to give his full name, also worries about getting his life restarted.He paid his salon’s quarterly rent of 15,000 yuan ($2,100) in full just before Wuhan was locked down on January 23. Now another rental payment is due.“Isn’t that terrible? I paid 15,000 in rent and did no business,” he said.‘Not much change’ While many other Chinese cities are getting back to near-normal, Wuhan’s government has made clear that easing controls poses new perils and that a return to usual life will have to wait. In some areas, it’s been two steps forward, one step back.Wuhan authorities said 70 residential neighbourhoods -- out of nearly 7,000 recently declared “epidemic-free” -- lost that status this week, prolonging lockdown measures there.The government has suggested the status revocation was due to the discovery of asymptomatic cases.China initially withheld numbers of asymptomatic cases -- people who test positive but show no symptoms of COVID-19, the pneumonia-like illness caused by the virus.It said on Thursday that the country now has over a thousand such patients under medical observation -- with 674 of those in Hubei, where Wuhan is the provincial capital.Chinese officials have said the virus emerged from wildlife sold for food at a local wet market.Many Wuhan residents expressed to AFP journalists a continued fear about resuming normal activities.A 59-year-old shopkeeper who gave only her surname, Zhou, has reopened her little store, but says people are too scared to come out and shop.Dancing outside the shop to get the blood flowing, Zhou said she also fears moving around the city, rarely going out and only for essentials while wearing protective clothing, mask and gloves.“It’s really hard now. I know some people who have been infected. It’s really scary,” she said.Traffic has picked up after a ban on leaving the city was lifted on Wednesday, but vast numbers of businesses remain closed and plastic barriers in streets hamper movement.“The ban is not lifted, not in residential compounds. There’s not much change,” Zhou said. Health codes Daily new infections in Wuhan are now down to zero on most days, but suspicions linger over the data publicised by the secretive ruling Communist Party that stands accused of a slow response to the outbreak, cover-up attempts, and moves to silence domestic critics.Many residents are still unable to leave their homes due to the mobile phone health code system which tracks if where they live or have visited remain high-risk.This hinders movement back to prosperous coastal regions where many Wuhan citizens work, a major income source for their families.The welcome in those industrial zones is fraying.Wuhan travellers face mandatory 14-day quarantines upon returning to some areas, and web-users in places such as Shanghai have expressed fear and outrage at the prospect of people returning from Wuhan.A delayed recovery will add to the suffering of people like Hao Mei.When the lockdown came the 39-year-old was in Wuhan working odd jobs, so was forced to leave her son and daughter -- aged 14 and 10 -- at home in Enshi, around 550 kilometres (340 miles) away.“It was very difficult because I’m a single parent,” she said, adding that at first she cried every night. “The pressure is very big.”She is now heading back to Enshi, but with no family support the future is dim.“I’ll stay home for three days at most. If I don’t earn any money, I can’t keep my kids alive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-coronavirus-lockdown-over-but-lingering-fears-slow-recovery/story-2bYlwfWFk6QqRXQv22oQ0K.html
09-04-2020||World||‘I almost died’: Indian-origin Covid-19 survivor recalls her battle||“I almost died,” recalls Indian-origin Ria Lakhani, still struggling to breath normally, days after surviving a severe case of coronavirus that has killed over 7,000 people in the UK.“It (breathing) used to be such a natural action but now I have to remember how to inhale and exhale,” the BBC quoted her as saying from her home in north-west London.In self-isolation, she still cannot hug her husband, or see her parents and siblings. She still wakes up at night struggling to breathe.Lakhani, a sales executive, started to show symptoms of Covid-19 while in hospital, where she was admitted for an operation.Seven years ago, she was diagnosed with a rare condition which makes swallowing difficult. The surgery was designed to help her manage this oesophageal disease, called achalasia, the report said.Though her admission to hospital was supposed to be a routine one, the situation became serious very soon. She began to struggle with her breathing and then developed a temperature.While everyone hoped it was just a side-effect of her surgery, a Covid swab test was taken as a precaution. But to the surprise of all, it turned positive for coronavirus.Soon her room was cordoned off and the rest of the ward evacuated.As her condition deteriorated, she required more oxygen. She was then shifted to one of London’s major Covid-19 treatment centres.“Things went from bad to worse - taking a breath became as hard as climbing a mountain,” she wrote on Facebook.“I almost died,” she says, speaking from home to the BBC.“I almost didn’t come out of there. There was a point when I actually started to write difficult messages to my family. I almost died now I’m alive. How can life go back to normal after that?” Lakhani is still not clear whether she developed pneumonia but says even now, from her recovery bed at home in Harrow she can hear a “crackling sound” in her lungs”.According to the World Health Organisation, most people (about 80 per cent) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.Lakhani said her recovery has been slow. In hospital she could barely move at first and was given morphine on top of the oxygen because of the pain. She praised the medical staff who treated her. They are “true heroes,” she said.“It was the small wins and things like the nurses making sure Iris had a constant supply of hot tea and a sneaky extra slice of cake that made me smile.” At home, she has to maintain a distance from her husband and continues to be besieged by coughing fits.But she’s relieved that she was able to fight the virus, especially considering how many people have died.The UK’s death toll in the coronavirus pandemic continues to rise and hit 7,097 on Wednesday - a record increase of 938 in a day. The government has urged the public to continue to follow strict social distancing rules before a decision to review the measures can be taken.The UK also has over 55,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, putting immense pressure on the country’s medical system.“I can’t explain the moment I left the hospital, I’ll never take anything for granted again,” she added.

09-04-2020||World||China seeks to contain new coronavirus ‘silent carriers’ to prevent second wave of infections||China took new measures on Wednesday to try to prevent asymptomatic “silent carriers” of the new coronavirus from causing a second wave of infections, as the country reported another modest rise in confirmed cases.Mainland China reported 63 new infections on Wednesday, up from 62 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said. Of those, 61 were travellers arriving from overseas, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in China to 81,865.While new infections have fallen from their peak in February after China locked down several cities and imposed strict travel restrictions, authorities have called for continued vigilance amid fears of a fresh resurgence of infections.Aside from curbing an influx of infected travellers from abroad, China’s other concern is managing asymptomatic people, or virus carriers who exhibit no clinical symptoms such as a fever or a cough.On China’s Twitter-like Weibo service, “Are asymptomatic people really asymptomatic?” was the third most-discussed topic on Thursday afternoon, highlighting a state media interview with Liu Youning, a professor of respiratory medicine at the People’s Liberation Army General Hospital.Liu said asymptomatic carriers posed little risk, but that people should continue to avoid crowded areas, maintain social distancing, wear masks and wash hands.“Scary, we need to keep safe. Some people are already getting slack, they don’t wear masks when going outside,” wrote a user posting under the name “Lu Ban of the Vast Desert”.China reported 56 new asymptomatic cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of such cases to 657 since data for such infections were published daily from April 1. The State Council, or Cabinet, on Wednesday published new rules to manage asymptomatic coronavirus carriers, or what some state media described as “silent carriers” of the virus. Under the regulations, medical institutions must report detection of asymptomatic cases within two hours of their discovery. Local governments must then identify all known close contacts of the case within 24 hours.Asymptomatic patients will be quarantined collectively for 14 days, and will be counted as confirmed cases if they start to show symptoms. People who have had close contact with them must also be quarantined for two weeks.Earlier this week, a new function appeared on Tencent’s ubiquitous WeChat mobile platform allowing people to check if they have ever sat on trains and planes near an asymptomatic carrier who later became a confirmed case.The heightened sense of caution came as restrictions on outbound movement of people from Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province and epicentre of the outbreak in China, were lifted on Wednesday after a virtual lockdown of over two months.Easing was also evident elsewhere, as the commercial centre of Shanghai said it would begin reopening some schools from April 27.Makeshift hospitalOf the 61 new confirmed cases arriving from overseas, 40 were in China’s northeast Heilongjiang province, which shares a border with Russia. All 40 were returning Chinese nationals, reported Xinhua.The Heilongjiang city of Suifenhe is building a makeshift hospital because imported cases from Russia continue to rise, reported state-controlled tabloid Global Times on Thursday, as all of the city’s isolation hotels were full. Suifenhe has closed its borders to all arrivals and implemented restrictions on the movement of its citizens on Wednesday, similar to measures seen in Wuhan. Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people in the middle reaches of the Yangtze river, still sees tens of new cases of asymptomatic carriers each day. Hubei’s health authority has reported 303 new asymptomatic cases since it began publishing data for such cases on April 1, but only two asymptomatic patients in Wuhan were reported to have developed symptoms and become confirmed case in the same timeframe.Mainland China has reported 657 new asymptomatic cases so far this month. Of those, it said 57 have developed symptoms.Chinese health authorities estimated earlier in April that around two-thirds of the asymptomatic patients will later develop symptoms.As of Wednesday, 3,335 people in China have died from the virus that causes a flu-like respiratory disease. Wuhan accounts for more than 75% of the fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seeks-to-contain-new-coronavirus-silent-carriers-to-prevent-second-wave-of-infections/story-uUQ1NB1J7P9cKdsmCNvdeL.html

09-04-2020||World||‘I’m well’: 103-year-old Italian says courage, faith helped her fight Covid-19||To recover from the coronavirus, as she did, Ada Zanusso recommends courage and faith, the same qualities that have served her well in her nearly 104 years.Italy, along with neighboring France, has Europe’s largest population of what has been dubbed the “super old” — people who are at least 100. As the nation with the world’s highest number of COVID-19 deaths, Italy is looking to its super-old survivors for inspiration.“I’m well, I’m well,” Zanusso said Tuesday during a video call with The Associated Press from the Maria Grazia Residence for the elderly in Lessona, a town in the northern region of Piedmont. “I watch TV, read the newspapers.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicZanusso wore a protective mask, as did her family doctor of 35 years beside her, Carla Furno Marchese, who also donned eyewear and a gown that covered her head.Asked about her illness, Zanusso is modest: “I had some fever.”Her doctor said Zanusso was in bed for a week.“We hydrated her because she wasn’t eating, and then we thought she wasn’t going to make it because she was always drowsy and not reacting,” Furno Marchese said.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“One day she opened her eyes again and resumed doing what she used to before,” Furno Marchese said. The doctor recalled when Zanusso was able to sit up, then managed to get out of bed.What helped her get through the illness? “Courage and strength, faith,” Zanusso said. It worked for her, so she advises others who fall ill to also “give yourself courage, have faith.”COVID-19 can cause mild or moderate symptoms, and most of those who are infected recover. But the elderly and those with existing health problems can be at high risk for more serious illness.The virus has killed nearly 18,000 people in Italy and over 88,000 worldwide. The World Health Organization says 95% of those who have died in Europe were over 60 years old.Under Italy’s five-week-long lockdown, which is aimed at containing the spread of infections that have overwhelmed hospitals, visitors aren’t allowed at homes for the elderly.Her doctor asked Zanusso what she would like to do when “they open the doors.”“I’d like to take a lovely walk,” she replied. And your three great-grandchildren? “Watch them play together.”Deaths, hospitalizations and new infections are leveling off in Italy, and Premier Giuseppe Conte is expected to announce in the coming days how long the lockdown will remain in place, with expectations that some restrictions could be eased.For now, Zanusso is isolated from other residents as she awaits a follow-up swab test to confirm she is negative for the virus.She grew up in Treviso, in the northeastern Veneto region, where she worked for many years in the textile industry. Zanusso, who turns 104 on Aug. 16, had four children — three of whom are living — and has four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.“She’s old, but healthy, with no chronic illness,’’ her doctor said.This week, Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera devoted an entire page to the stories of super-old survivors, called “healing at 100 years old.” The inspirational portraits are a counterpoint to news of large numbers of deaths among elderly people living in Italian nursing homes and other assisted-living facilities.Of the victims, most elderly weren’t tested for COVID-19 if they died in nursing homes, so the numbers don’t figure into Italy’s overall coronavirus death toll, which is the highest in the world.Medical staff “went through a very hard time,’’ said Furno Marchese, the doctor. “It was a great emergency with so many residents ill, so to see a positive outcome was very rewarding, not only for me, but for all the people who worked hard here nonstop.”Outside the nonprofit, 61-bed Maria Grazia Residence, the Italian flag flies at half-staff in tribute to those who died of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-m-well-103-year-old-italian-says-courage-faith-helped-her-fight-covid-19/story-IXOLwZGZKr2tZG1IGwbuzN.html

That doesn’t bother me,” Trump told reporters during a White House news conference. Iran has become one of the world’s coronavirus epicenters, with more than 60,000 people infected and over 3,800 deaths.He was responding to a question on the call made by French President Emanuel Macron to his Iranian counterpart that Europe has started to ship the medical goods to Iran.“Medical good?... That doesn’t bother me,” Trump said.Earlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that the US has offered humanitarian assistance to Iran.“I regret that they chose not to take that. I’ve heard people talking about sanctions,” he said.“The world should note there are no sanctions that prevent humanitarian assistance, pharmaceutical medical supplies, pharmaceuticals from going to Iran. We offered American assistance; we try to help other countries get assistance in there as well. We had some ability to do that,” Pompeo said.On March 30, the UK, Germany and France circumvented Iran sanctions by using Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges for the first time to send medical goods to Iran in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Iran has the sixth highest number of fatalities after Italy, Spain, the US, France and the UK. In March, Iran became the first major COVID-19 hotspot outside Asia. It has now suffered more deaths than China, where the outbreak originated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-objection-to-europe-sending-medical-supplies-to-iran-trump/story-iq3wZ9NTHkh0mJgyEA9kiN.html

You know, we stopped counting how many bodies came out,” she said. “This is very serious. This is very real.” As the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus has now claimed more lives than did the attacks of September 11, the city has been forced to take over new spaces to absorb the loss.Emergency field hospitals have been set up in Central Park and other locales. And refrigerated trucks have fanned out across the city to process the pileup of corpses.As of Wednesday, New York state has had nearly 150,000 reported coronavirus cases and over 6,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.In her interview with Reuters, Monteleone recounted how she and her fiance discovered their front-row seat to the pandemic.When Kozlow was walking their dog last week, he called to tell her that he overheard two doctors saying the trucks would be coming in. Shortly after, Monteleone said she “turned around on the couch and peered out the window and saw it.”“This is what they were saying online was going to be mobilized throughout the city.”The following morning the couple awoke to workers setting up a platform and a ramp to serve two refrigerated trucks. It wasn’t long after that the couple saw “a pretty serious string of bodies.”Monteleone commended the head of Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, Ramon Rodriguez, for checking in on the neighbors.She said the couple were staying put - for now.“Everybody in my personal and professional life has urged us to leave. They don’t think this is a good place to be,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-is-very-real-from-their-window-new-york-couple-sees-trucks-remove-covid-19-victims-bodies/story-eePY7uf9Ksgo17PqTEeZWN.html
09-04-2020||World||Taiwan protests WHO leader’s accusations of racist campaign||Taiwan’s foreign ministry on Thursday strongly protested accusations from the head of the World Health Organization that it condoned racist personal attacks on him that he alleged were coming from the self-governing island democracy.The ministry expressed “strong dissatisfaction and a high degree of regret, and raised the most solemn protest.” Taiwan is a “mature, highly sophisticated nation and could never instigate personal attacks on the director-general of the WHO, much less express racist sentiments,” the statement said.Taiwan’s 23 million people have themselves been “severely discriminated against” by the politics of the international health system and “condemn all forms of discrimination and injustice,” the statement said.On Wednesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus accused Taiwan’s foreign ministry of being linked to a months-long campaign against him amid the COVID-19 pandemic. At a press briefing, Tedros said that since the emergence of the novel coronavirus, he has been personally attacked, including receiving at times, death threats and racist abuse.“This attack came from Taiwan,” said Tedros, who is a former Ethiopian health and foreign minister and the WHO’s first African leader.He said Taiwanese diplomats were aware of the attacks but did not dissociate themselves from them. “They even started criticizing me in the middle of all those insults and slurs,” Tedros said. “I say it today because it’s enough.” The basis of his allegations were unclear.Tedros was elected with the strong support of China, one of five permanent veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council and which claims Taiwan as its own territory. He has firmly backed Beijing’s claims to have been open and transparent about the outbreak, despite strong evidence that it suppressed early reports on infections, while echoing its criticisms of the U.S.At China’s insistence, Taiwan has been barred from the U.N. and the WHO and even stripped of its observer status at the annual World Health Assembly. At the same time, it has one of the most robust public health systems in the world, and has won praise for its handling of the virus outbreak.Despite its close proximity to China and the frequency of travel between the sides, Taiwan has reported just 379 cases and five deaths.U.S. and Taiwanese officials met online last month to discuss ways of increasing the island’s participation in the world health system, sparking fury from Beijing, which opposes all official contacts between Washington and Taipei.Also at Wednesday’s briefing, Tedros sought to rise above sharp criticism and threats of funding cuts from President Donald Trump over the WHO’s response to the outbreak.The vocal defense came a day after Trump blasted the agency for being “China-centric” and alleging that it had “criticized” his ban of travel from China as the COVID-19 outbreak was spreading from the city of Wuhan.In a further comment on Tedros’ remarks, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu tweeted that the island agreed with his assertion that there was, “No need to use COVID to score political points.”“We agree! Yet without evidence, #Taiwan is accused of orchestrating personal attacks.

We are first expecting to hold that meeting, and then we’ll see how events play out,” Singer had said last week. US President Donald Trump has fired a fresh salvo at the World Health Organization, accusing its chief of siding with China and “politicising” the coronavirus pandemic while repeating his threat to freeze the UN agency’s funding.In such a situation, Beijing is likely to face some heat at the UN Covid-19 session today. All the 10 non-permanent members of the UN Security Council have backed the informal discussion led by the UNSC President; the post is held by the Dominican Republic. But whether the closed-door discussion will conclude with any outcome depends on the proposals put up and the exercise of veto powers of China and its ally Russia.Coronavirus has infected more than a million people across the globe and has killed 80,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-to-discuss-covid-19-pandemic-in-closed-session-today/story-CKY8GmycgNBwv9Ip2jpz5I.html
09-04-2020||World||US to seize exports of masks and gloves amid coronavirus crisis||The United States will seize exports of key protective medical gear until it determines whether the equipment should be kept in the country to combat the spread of the new coronavirus, two federal agencies announced on Wednesday.US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will hold exports of respirators, surgical masks and surgical gloves, according to a joint announcement made with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA will then determine if the equipment should be returned for use in the United States, purchased by the US government or exported.President Donald Trump issued a memorandum on Friday that directed federal agencies to use any authority necessary to keep the highly sought-after medical supplies in the United States.Governors, mayors and physicians have voiced alarm for weeks over crippling scarcities of personal protective gear for first-responders and front-line healthcare workers, as well as ventilators and other medical supplies.The move to seize exports will include N95 respirator masks, which filter airborne particles and are used to protect against COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. The US manufacturing company 3M Co , a leading producer of the masks worldwide, said on Monday that it had reached a deal with the Trump administration that would allow it to continue to export the masks to Canada and Latin America despite the new restrictions. The company had said days earlier that ceasing exports to those regions would have “humanitarian implications.”A federal regulation that outlines FEMA’s procedures for seizing and vetting the exports will go into effect on Friday and remain in place until Aug. 10, according to a draft version posted online.FEMA will aim to make decisions about exports quickly and seek to minimize disruptions to the supply chain, the draft regulation said.Some state and local government officials have accused FEMA in recent days of confiscating shipments of masks and other supplies coming from overseas.An official with the US Department of Homeland Security who requested anonymity to discuss the matter earlier this week said half of the protective gear brought to the United States on US government flights can be redirected to high-need areas around the country, but disputed the idea that the equipment had been seized.FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-seize-exports-of-masks-and-gloves-amid-coronavirus-crisis/story-4VdLFVJKhk1zjdGz0KIRJN.html

By talking, yes, with drug traffickers, with militias, because they are human beings, too, and they need to help.” He said the authorities had just launched a pilot project in one favela on managing coronavirus risk, but did not say where.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakAn estimated 11.5 million Brazilians live in favelas, around six percent of the population.They are frequent scenes of street battles between armed gangs and police.Mandetta advocates strict social distancing measures to contain the virus, in line with World Health Organization recommendations.He has clashed with his boss, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who argues that closing businesses and telling people to stay home is unnecessarily damaging the economy.Brazil has confirmed nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases, with 800 deaths so far.

In a letter to PM Modi, President Bolsonaro compared India’s move to Lord Hanuman and Sanjeevani booti (herb) in the epic Ramayana.“Just as Lord Hanuman brought the holy medicine from the Himalayas to save the life of Lord Rama’s brother Laksmana, and Jesus healed those who were sick and restored the sight of Bartimeu, India and Brazil will overcome this global crisis,” President Bolronaro had said in his letter to Prime Minister Modi.India is the largest manufacturer and exporter of hydroxychloroquine in the world.But on Saturday, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade notified a ban on exports of hydroxychloroquine and any formulation containing the miracle drug from special economic zones (SEZs) and export-oriented units too.President Bolsonaro, who was in the country this January to be chief guest at India’s Republic Day celebrations, spoke with PM Modi the same day. He followed up the conversation with a letter on Tuesday that underscored the important role that he expected hydroxychloroquine to play in the fight against Covid-19.In all, India received similar requests from 20 countries as countries explore any possible cure for the pandemic that has infected 1.4 million people and killed nearly 82,000 around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-president-thanks-india-for-timely-help-after-nod-to-hydroxychloroquine/story-ABkm3ylEZpEeU1TtMeyXYO.html

Talks will resume on Thursday.A blistering row erupted after Mauro Ferrari quit as the head of European Research Council, EU’s top science funding agency, and attacked the bloc’s handling of the crisis. The ERC hit back with a lengthy statement accusing Ferrari of being “economical with the truth”.France reported fewer new cases though deaths rose sharply. The total cumber of cases rose by 3,777. Deaths rose by 1,417 to 10,328 .France’s central bank estimated its first-quarter gross domestic product to shrink 6% from previous quarter, the biggest quarterly contraction since World War 2.

09-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Australia passes record $80 billion employment-rescue package||Australia’s parliament passed a record A$130 billion ($80 billion) jobs-rescue plan late Wednesday, as the government continues efforts to buttress the economy from the coronavirus outbreak.“It’s unprecedented in its scale and its scope, and around six million workers should be able to use this program to stay in a job,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a television interview. The package “will help build that bridge to the recovery on the other side.”The support will see the government pay wage subsidies of A$1,500 every two weeks per employee to help struggling businesses keep people in work. It’s the latest step in Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s plan to ensure the economy can survive in “hibernation” during the health crisis and then quickly be revived when businesses such as restaurants, clubs, casinos and cinemas are allowed to reopen.Since the coronavirus threat emerged, the conservative government has abandoned plans to return and keep the budget in surplus, pumping an unprecedented amount of stimulus into the economy in a bid to avert it from falling into a crippling long-term recession.Total fiscal and monetary stimulus has now exceeded A$320 billion, or 16.4% of gross domestic product. Asked on Sky News Thursday whether further huge fiscal support was likely, Frydenberg said the A$130 billion “jobkeeper” package would be “hard to beat.” Australians would be paying back the debt burden “for years to come,” he said.The jobs-rescue plan was passed on Wednesday in a special sitting of parliament with a reduced number of lawmakers.In other economic measures, Morrison last week announced it will make childcare free to help workers stay in their jobs. On Tuesday, he said a new industry code of practice for commercial tenancies would be legislated to provide rent relief for businesses hit by the outbreak. Any decline in revenue for small- or medium-sized enterprise will be reflected in a proportionate drop in rent they have to pay, he said.Still, Morrison’s government can only do so much. Some economists are forecasting that Australia’s unemployment rate could soar to 12%, from 5.1% in February, as potentially hundreds of thousands of workers lose their jobs amid the shutdown. The nation’s central bank has cutting its rates to 0.25% and shifted to bond-buying operations.Australia’s Huge Household Debt Threatens to Worsen RecessionMorrison has grown more confident that social-distancing restrictions and the nation’s relatively high rates of testing appear to be working to control the outbreak and “flatten the curve” of growth. As of 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Australia had 6,013 confirmed cases, up 1.8% from the day before. Fifty people have died.Authorities are warning they don’t want Australians to relax during the Easter break, which starts on Friday. In New South Wales, the most populous state that’s been hardest hit by the outbreak, police warned on Wednesday they will use the holiday period to patrol country roads, back streets, main highways and caravan parks to ensure people are complying with the restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-australia-passes-record-80-billion-employment-rescue-package/story-o7pFUZs0hIEA3RI0ctvXuI.html

Ramaphosa has “accepted the minister’s apology for the violation but was unmoved by mitigating factors she tendered,” it said.“The nation-wide lockdown calls for absolute compliance on the part of all South Africans,” Ramaphosa was quoted as saying. “None of us -- not least a member of the national executive -- should undermine our national effort to save lives in this very serious situation,” said Ramaphosa. “No-one is above the law.”Shortly after the president’s statement, the minister issued an apology.“I regret the incident and I am deeply sorry for my actions,” said Ndabeni-Abrahams in a statement issued through her ministry. “I hope the president and South Africans will find it in their hearts to forgive me.”“I wish to use this opportunity to reiterate the President’s call for all of us to observe the lockdown rules.

09-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: CDC loosens rules to let essential workers return||In a first, small step toward reopening the country, the Trump administration issued new guidelines Wednesday to make it easier for essential workers who have been exposed to Covid-19 to get back to work if they do not have symptoms of the coronavirus.Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, announced at the White House that essential employees, such as health care and food supply workers, who have been within 6 feet of a confirmed or suspected case of the virus can return to work under certain circumstances if they are not experiencing symptoms.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe new guidelines are being issued as the nation mourns some 13,000 deaths from the virus and grapples with a devastated economy and medical crises from coast to coast. Health experts continue to caution Americans to practice social distancing and to avoid returning to their normal activities. At the same time, though, they are planning for a time when the most serious threat from Covid-19 will be in the country’s rear-view mirror.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakPresident Donald Trump said that while he knows workers are “going stir crazy” at home, he can’t predict when the threat from the virus will wane.“The numbers are changing and they’re changing rapidly and soon we’ll be over that curve. We’ll be over the top and we’ll be headed in the right direction. I feel strongly about that,” Trump said about the coronavirus, which he called “this evil beast.”“I can’t tell you in terms of the date,” Trump said, adding cases could go down and then once again “start going up if we’re not careful. ”At some point, he said at his daily briefing, social distancing guidelines will disappear and people will be able to sit together at sports events. “At some point we expect to be back, like it was before,” he said.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said if the existing guidelines asking people to practice social distancing through the end of April are successful in halting the spread of the virus, more relaxed recommendations could be in order.He said the White House task force was trying to dovetail public health concerns with practical steps that need to be in place when the 30-day guidelines end at the end of the month so the nation can “safely and carefully march toward some sort of normality.”If, by fall, things start to return to normal, Americans will still need to wash their hands frequently, sick schoolchildren should be kept home and people with fevers need to refrain from going to work, Fauci said during an online interview Wednesday with the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association.People also should never shake hands again, Fauci said, only half-jokingly.“I mean it sounds crazy, but that’s the way it’s really got to be,” he said. “Until we get to a point where we know the population is protected” with a vaccine.Under the new guidelines for essential workers, the CDC recommends that exposed employees take their temperatures before their shifts, wear face masks and practice social distancing at work. They also are advised to stay home if they are ill, not share headsets or other objects used near the face and refrain from congregating in crowded break rooms.Employers are asked to take exposed workers’ temperatures and assess symptoms before allowing them to return to work, aggressively clean work surfaces, send workers home if they get sick and increase air exchange in workplaces.Fauci said he hoped the pandemic would prompt the U.S. to look at long-term investments in public health, specifically at the state and local level. Preparedness that was not in place in January needs to be in place if or when Covid-19 or another virus threatens the country.“We have a habit of whenever we get over a challenge, we say, ‘OK, let’s move on to the current problem,’” he said. “We should never, ever be in a position of getting hit like this and have to scramble to respond again. This is historic.”Even the new guidelines will not be a foolproof guard against spreading infection.Recent studies have suggested that somewhere around 10% of new infections might be sparked by contact with individuals who are infected but do not yet exhibit symptoms. Scientists say it’s also possible that some people who develop symptoms and then recover from the virus remain contagious, or that some who are infected and contagious may never develop symptoms.As of Wednesday, the U.S. had more than 400,000 confirmed cases of infection.On the other side of the globe, the journey back to normalcy is further along.In Wuhan, the Chinese industrial city that first reported cases of the new coronavirus, authorities ended a 76-day lockdown Wednesday. Residents can travel in and out of the city without special authorization, but must use a smartphone app showing they are healthy and have not been in recent contact with anyone confirmed to have the virus.Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, chimed in with a cautionary tweet from the sidelines, writing: “Social distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring — something we have yet to put in place nationwide.”Conservative voices, for their part, are pushing for an economic and social restart, urging Trump to overrule health officials.“At some point, the president is going to have to look at Drs. Fauci and Birx and say, we’re opening on May 1,” Fox commentator Laura Ingraham tweeted. “Give me your best guidance on protocols, but we cannot deny our people their basic freedoms any longer.”For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.___AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner in Chicago contributed to this report.

09-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: New York hits new coronavirus peak but curve flattening||New York recorded a new single-day high for coronavirus deaths on Wednesday but Governor Andrew Cuomo said the epidemic appeared to be stabilizing. Cuomo said 779 people had died in the last 24 hours, bringing the total death toll in New York state from Covid-19 to 6,268.The previous high of 731 was set on Monday. New York is bearing the brunt of America’s deadly coronavirus pandemic, accounting for around half the number of deaths across the country.The governor said that despite the rise, the hospitalization rate was continuing to decrease because of social confinement orders.“We are flattening the curve,” the governor told reporters.He added that if the rate continues to go down the hospital system will stabilize over the next two weeks, which will “minimize” the need for temporary hospitals. Field hospitals have been set up in Central Park, at the home of the US tennis center, in a convention center and on a US navy ship to deal with the influx of patients. Cuomo said the death toll was high because people put on ventilators when hospitalization rates soared in previous weeks were now passing away. On Monday, the governor extended the state-wide shutdown of schools and non-essential businesses until April 29.He again implored residents to continue to stay at home unless absolutely necessary.“It’s not a time to get complacent. It’s not a time to do anything different than where we’ve been doing,” Cuomo said.“We are in the midst of it. We’re not through it. It’s not over,” he added.COVID-19 has killed almost 13,000 people in the United States, and the number of confirmed cases has grown to more than 401,000, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said this week that New York’s death toll could be higher because many deaths occurring at home are not being counted.Meanwhile, preliminary data released Wednesday showed that New York’s Latino and African-American communities were dying of Covid-19 at a higher rate than whites.In multi-ethnic New York City, Hispanic people made up 34 percent of deaths while comprising 29 percent of the population. Black people represent 28 percent of fatalities while comprising 22 percent of the population. Whites make up 27 percent of the death toll and are 32 percent of the Big Apple’s population.“It always seems that the poorest people pay the highest price. Why is that?” Cuomo asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-new-york-hits-new-coronavirus-peak-but-curve-flattening/story-wwCGPetCEAfFU9utVQO1bK.html
