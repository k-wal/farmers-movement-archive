President Donald Trump hosted a videoconference with other G7 leaders -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- as the world’s biggest economies increasingly look to ending the economic paralysis caused by attempts to stop the virus’ spread. “G7 leaders tasked their ministers to work together to prepare all G7 economies to re-open safely and on a foundation that will allow the G7 nations to reestablish economic growth with more resilient health systems and trusted supply chains,” the White House said in a statement. “G7 leaders agreed to remain committed to taking every necessary measure to ensure a strong and coordinated global response to this health crisis and the associated humanitarian and economic calamity and to launch a strong and sustainable recovery,” the statement said. The United States is current chair of the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-to-collaborate-on-economy-reopenings-white-house/story-cG4J5s1NR8MKNnQl6NEnAN.html

It was also agreed to suspend debt payments from the world’s poorest countries - freeing up £12 billion to tackle the virus.“The Chancellor, who led development of the action plan with his Indian counterpart, also called on more G20 Finance Ministers to fund the development of vaccines, with the UK already contributing £250 million for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations – a global organisation that conducts research to develop vaccines against infectious diseases”, the Treasury added.The meeting also agreed an enhanced IMF support package, more joined-up efforts by international organisations fighting the pandemic, and to share best practice on containment measures, officials added.Sunak said: “The UK is at the forefront of international action in the fight against the Covid-19 outbreak…It’s right that we have suspended debt payments for the world’s poorest countries and are supporting the most vulnerable health systems in the world, which in turn makes us all safer”.In total, the UK has so far contributed £744 million in aid to the fight against coronavirus to help slow down the spread of the disease around the world and help manage the global economic damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-nirmala-sitharaman-lead-g20-plan-to-tackle-covid-19-pandemic/story-FTTrljlUT8K3YkwrAwSljM.html

He has threatened to cut US funding, the largest portion of the organization’s revenue.According to the White House, other G7 leaders were sympathetic to his stand.“The leaders recognized that the G7 nations annually contribute more than a billion dollars to the World Health Organization (WHO), and much of the conversation centered on the lack of transparency and chronic mismanagement of the pandemic by the WHO,” the White House said in a statement.“The leaders called for a thorough review and reform process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-g7-leaders-call-for-thorough-review-and-reform-at-who/story-4KbfO8eSJx2KGmq37nmJRK.html
16-04-2020||World||Singapore reports record jump in coronavirus infections||Singapore late Thursday reported a record jump in coronavirus cases, most of them linked to packed dormitories housing foreign workers, as it battled a second wave of infections.The affluent city-state had initially been held as a gold standard in the global fight against the Covid-19 disease, but a surge in the number of cases has left the government scrambling to contain the spread.The Ministry of Health reported 728 new cases as of midday Thursday -- the biggest rise in a single day -- bringing the total number of infections to 4,427, including 10 deaths.“The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories has increased significantly, in line with our continued efforts to actively test and isolate the infected workers,” the ministry said in a statement.It said 654, or around 90 percent, of the new cases were linked to the dorms and another 26 were foreign workers living outside the facilities.Around 200,000 workers, mostly from South Asia, live in 43 dorms across the island, forming an essential part of the country’s work force.Many of them are construction workers typically toiling for long hours, earning in the region of $400 to $500 a month building the city-state’s glittering skyscrapers and shopping malls.Following criticism of poor living conditions in the dorms, the government swung into action, moving thousands of them to other accommodation -- including a floating complex -- in order to decongest the facilities and lessen the chances of infection.The government is also providing meals and ramped-up cleaning services at quarantined dorms, and is helping run the facilities, which are usually privately operated.Writing on Facebook this month, veteran Singapore diplomat Tommy Koh slammed “the disgraceful way” in which the foreign workers were being treated.He said it should be a “wake-up call to treat our indispensable foreign workers like a first world country should”.mba/st||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-reports-record-jump-in-coronavirus-infections/story-yhSkcz7Nkn9i8T1MUYn3HJ.html
16-04-2020||World||After over 13,500 deaths, 1 lakh cases, UK extends Covid-19 lockdown||As the death toll from coronavirus rose to 13,729 on Thursday, the Boris Johnson government extended the lockdown by at least three more weeks in the hope that social distancing and other restrictions will continue to have impact.Official figures show the number of people who tested positive for the virus rose to 103,093.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab announced the extension amidst signs that the curbs are having some effect. Ministers and experts said lifting the lockdown or a return to normalcy would not be feasible until the mass availability of a vaccine for the virus.Several projects across the globe are at various stages of developing a vaccine for coronavirus, with one in the University of Oxford promising that it could be available by September. Usually a vaccine is available for mass inoculation in 12 to 18 months.Raab said: “Now is not the moment to give the coronavirus a second chance…We still don’t have infection rates down as much as we need to. Any change to social distancing measures now would risk significant increase in infections.”According to health minister Nadine Dorries, “There is only one way we can ‘exit’ full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine. Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a balance between the health of the nation and our economy”.Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson of Imperial College advising the government said some level of social distancing would need to be retained, until a vaccine is available, calling for a single-minded emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing.Ferguson called for more action at the official level, noting that more preparation had been done for Brexit, including a separate department, than to deal with the pandemic.Ferguson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s a lot of discussion. I would like to see action accelerated. I don’t have a deep insight about what’s going on in government, but decisions need to be accelerated. We need to put in place an infrastructure, a command and control structure, a novel organisation”.“I’m reminded we had a department for Brexit for government. That was a major national emergency and we are faced with something even larger than Brexit. And yet I don’t quite see the evidence for that level of organisation. I’d like to see measures accelerated.”He argued that a huge infrastructure of testing and contact tracing would need to be in place in order for the lockdown to be lifted without further peaks, pointing to the model of South Korea, which has been suppressing new outbreaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-over-13-500-deaths-1-lakh-cases-uk-extends-covid-19-lockdown/story-pz4iD60JiudvNwnQ2KtPtM.html

16-04-2020||World||Putin postpones Victory Day military parade due to Covid-19||President Vladimir Putin, citing the deepening coronavirus crisis, said on Thursday Russia would postpone its May 9 celebrations including a huge military parade across Red Square to mark 75 years since the Soviet victory in World War Two.The Kremlin had hoped to mark the anniversary with particular pomp this year and that an array of world leaders would attend, but Putin said in televised comments there was now no choice but to push back the event.“The risks associated with an epidemic that has not passed its peak are extremely high. And this does not give me the right to begin preparations for the parade and other public events,” he said.The number of coronavirus cases in Russia began rising sharply this month, although it had reported far fewer infections than many western European countries in the outbreak’s early stages.Russia confirmed 3,448 new cases on Thursday, a record daily rise that brought its nationwide tally to 27,938. Officials say 232 people have died.Several war veteran organisations appealed to Putin this week to postpone the parade, saying they wanted it to be a memorable and spectacular event, something that looked unlikely with Moscow and many of Russia’s regions observing a lockdown.Speaking in comments broadcast on state television nationwide on Thursday, Putin did not say when the parade would take place, but said that it would definitely be this year.In power as president or prime minister for more than two decades, Putin oversees the May 9 military parade every year from a tribune packed with war veterans.The Soviet military campaign in World War Two has become a sensitive subject for Moscow ahead of the 75th anniversary. Putin has accused Russia’s detractors of diminishing the Soviet war effort and the country’s huge loss of life.Many western leaders shunned the May 9 event after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea pushed relations to post-Cold War lows, but this year the Kremlin had hoped many world leaders would attend again.The heads of 17 countries, including India, France, Cuba, and Venezuela, had said they would attend this year, the Kremlin said in August last year.The Kremlin had invited U.S. President Donald Trump, but Washington said it would send his national security adviser, Robert O’Brien. Trump had wanted to go, but was told by advisers not to, US officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-postpones-victory-day-military-parade-due-to-covid-19/story-eT8sJbCq2sZYdq0QQA9kSK.html
16-04-2020||World||Bangladesh coast guard rescues 396 Rohingya from drifting boat; 32 dead||At least 32 ethnic Rohingya died on a ship that drifted for weeks after it failed to reach Malaysia, Bangladesh coast guard officials said on Thursday, following the rescue of 396 starving survivors.A human rights group said it believed more boats carrying Rohingya - a Muslim minority - were adrift at sea, with coronavirus lockdowns in Malaysia and Thailand making it harder for them to find refuge.“They were at sea for about two months and were starving,” a Bangladesh coastguard official told Reuters in a message, adding that the ship was brought to shore late on Wednesday.The 396 survivors would be handed to the U.N refugee agency, said the official, who had initially said they would be sent to Myanmar. The official also revised the death toll to 32 from 24.Video images showed a crowd comprised mostly of women and children, some stick-thin and unable to stand, being helped to shore. One emaciated man lay on the sand.One refugee told a reporter the group had been turned back from Malaysia twice and a fight had broken out onboard between passengers and crew at one point.Malaysian officials did not respond to requests for comment on reports that it had turned away previous boats from its waters. ​ “We understand these men, women and children were at sea for nearly two months in harrowing conditions and that many of them are extremely malnourished and dehydrated,” the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said.The agency was offering to help the government move them to quarantine facilities and would provide medical care, it said in a statement.Media reports that the group was infected with the virus had not been substantiated, the UNHCR said.In a separate case, Malaysia’s navy on Thursday morning intercepted a boat carrying some 200 Rohingya refugees attempting to enter Malaysian waters.The boat, which was spotted by an air force surveillance plane, was escorted out of Malaysian waters by two navy ships after being provided with food supplies, the air force said in a statement.Buddhist-majority Myanmar does not recognise Rohingya as citizens and they face severe curbs on freedom of movement as well as access to healthcare and education.Myanmar denies persecuting Rohingya and says they are not an indigenous ethnic group but immigrants from South Asia, even though many Rohingya are able to trace their ancestry back centuries.More than a million live in refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, the majority having been driven from homes in Myanmar after a 2017 military crackdown the army said was a response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.Rights groups fear virus curbs across Southeast Asia could trigger a repeat of a 2015 crisis, when a crackdown by Thailand prompted smugglers to abandon their human cargo at sea on crowded, rickety boats.Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, said she believed several more boats were stranded.“Rohingya may encounter closed borders supported by a xenophobic public narrative,” she said in a message.“COVID-19 cannot be used to deny access to territory to desperate refugees in distress. Another maritime crisis in the Andaman Sea, as in 2015, is unacceptable.”For years, Rohingya from Myanmar have boarded boats organised by smugglers in the hope of finding refuge in Southeast Asia, usually making voyages during the dry season from November to March, when the waters are calm. Several boats were trying to reach Malaysian shores and monitoring had been stepped up, a police official in the northwestern state of Kedah told Reuters.A police official in southern Thailand said five boats carrying Rohingya had been spotted off the coast of Satun province late on Monday.People were smuggled out by boat and over land, said Kyaw Hla, a Rohingya from Sittwe in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, where tens of thousands of Rohingya have been confined in camps since a bout of violence in 2012.“Within these eight years, there has been no progress, only degradation,” he said by telephone. “People can’t stand it. Since we are locked up and suffocated, people try to leave, of course.”He added, “If the coronavirus breaks out here, we’ll be as good as dead.”(Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open https://tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser.)(Additional reporting by Panu Wongcha-Um and Poppy McPherson in Bangkok and Rozanna Latif and Joseph Sipalan in Kuala Lumpur; Editing by Matthew Tostevin and Angus MacSwan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-coast-guard-rescues-396-rohingya-from-drifting-boat-32-dead/story-y9EovoLJdcavwsFrbDVulO.html

Experts have found the longest-ever siphonophore in Western Australia’s underwater canyons. This particular siphonophore is estimated to be close to 150 feet or 46 metres long, making it the longest creature in the world. The gigantic Blue Whale is usually estimated to be 91 feet or over 25 metres long.String-like, UFO-shaped siphonophore is a deep water predator. Experts believe they feed with the help of their tentacles that keep floating in the ocean water, just like jellyfish.Experts at Western Australia Museum (WAM) led the expedition and said they also discovered marine species which have never been documented before such as the first giant hydroids.  Get out the tape measure!📏@wamuseum researchers have found what they believe could be the longest animal ever recorded.

16-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Touching 13,000 deaths, 1 lakh cases, UK set to extend lockdown||The Boris Johnson government was poised to announce an extension to the three-week lockdown on Thursday, as the number of deaths and cases from coronavirus approached 13,000 and 1 lakh respectively – making the UK one of the worst infected in Europe.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Johnson recovering from the virus, was due to announce the extension at the daily briefing in Downing Street on Thursday evening. Concerns grew for those infected and dying outside hospitals that are not reflected in daily figures.UK-wide figures released on Wednesday evening showed 12,868 deaths and 98,476 cases.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour would support a three-week extension but said the best way out of the lockdown is to move to a testing and contact-tracing strategy.Health secretary Matt Hancock stressed that the number of deaths is still “far too high” for any exit strategy to be set out, insisting that people must focus on staying at home. According to health minister Nadine Dorries, an exit strategy must await the mass availability of vaccine.Dorries tweeted that journalists should stop asking about an exit strategy: “There is only one way we can ‘exit’ full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine. Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a balance between the health of the nation and our economy”.Hancock told Sky News on Thursday: “I think what Nadine was saying is the idea that we’ll immediately ... we’ll just switch off all of the measures and return to some kind of ... to things exactly as they were - that is not likely in the short term…This will take time”.Meanwhile, epidemiologist Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, who is advising the government, called for more official action, and noted that more preparation had been done for Brexit, including a separate department, than to deal with the pandemic.Ferguson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s a lot of discussion.

Austria, Italy and Spain have also allowed some businesses to reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-remains-in-the-eye-of-coronavirus-storm-who/story-QvtyaOGGoHpHk9FcML6OFN.html

16-04-2020||World||US says China may have conducted low-level nuclear test blasts||China may have secretly set off low-level underground nuclear test explosions despite claiming to observe an international pact banning such blasts, the US State Department said in a report on Wednesday that could fuel US-Chinese tensions.The finding, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, may worsen ties already strained by US charges that the global COVID-19 pandemic resulted from Beijing’s mishandling of a 2019 outbreak of the coronavirus in the city of Wuhan.US concerns about Beijing’s possible breaches of a “zero yield” standard for test blasts have been prompted by activities at China’s Lop Nur nuclear test site throughout 2019, the State Department report said.Zero yield refers to a nuclear test in which there is no explosive chain reaction of the type ignited by the detonation of a nuclear warhead.“China’s possible preparation to operate its Lop Nur test site year-round, its use of explosive containment chambers, extensive excavation activities at Lop Nur and a lack of transparency on its nuclear testing activities ... raise concerns regarding its adherence to the zero yield standard,” the report said, without providing evidence of a low-yield test.Beijing’s lack of transparency included blocking data transmissions from sensors linked to a monitoring center operated by the international agency that verifies compliance with a treaty banning nuclear test explosions. The 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) allows activities designed to ensure the safety of nuclear weapons.A spokeswoman for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, which verifies compliance with the pact, told the Wall Street Journal there had been no interruptions in data transmissions from China’s five sensor stations since the end of August 2019 following an interruption that began in 2018.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing that China was committed to a moratorium on nuclear tests and said the United States was making false accusations.“China has always adopted a responsible attitude, earnestly fulfilling the international obligations and promises it has assumed,” he said. “The US criticism of China is entirely groundless, without foundation, and not worth refuting.”‘WORRYING’A senior US official said the concerns about China’s testing activities buttressed President Donald Trump’s case for getting China to join the United States and Russia in talks on an arms control accord to replace the 2010 New START treaty between Washington and Moscow that expires in February.New START restricted the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads, the lowest level in decades, and limited the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers that deliver them.“The pace and manner by which the Chinese government is modernizing its stockpile is worrying, destabilizing, and illustrates why China should be brought into the global arms control framework,” said the senior US official on condition of anonymity.China, estimated to have about 300 nuclear weapons, has repeatedly rejected Trump’s proposal, arguing its nuclear force is defensive and poses no threat.Russia, France and Britain - three of the world’s five internationally recognized nuclear powers - signed and ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which still requires ratification by 44 countries to become international law.China and the United States are among eight signatories that have not ratified it.

16-04-2020||World||Why are some South Koreans who recovered from Covid-19 testing positive again?||South Korean health officials are investigating several possible explanations for a small but growing number of recovered coronavirus patients who later test positive for the virus again.Among the main possibilities are re-infection, a relapse, or inconsistent tests, experts say.South Korea had reported 141 such cases as of Thursday, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).RE-INFECTION OR RELAPSE?Although re-infection would be the most concerning scenario because of its implications for developing immunity in a population, both the KCDC and many experts say this is unlikely.Instead, the KCDC says it is leaning toward some kind of relapse or “re-activation” in the virus.A relapse could mean that parts of the virus go into some kind of dormant state for a time, or that some patients may have certain conditions or weak immunity that makes them susceptible to the virus reviving in their system, experts said. A recent study by doctors in China and the United States suggested the new coronavirus can damage T lymphocytes, also known as T cells, which play a central role the body’s immune system and ability to battle infections.Kim Jeong-ki, a virologist at the Korea University College of Pharmacy, compared a relapse after treatment to a spring that snaps back after being pressed down.“When you press down a spring it becomes smaller, then when you take your hands off, the spring pops up,” he said.Even if the patients are found to have relapsed rather than to have been re-infected, it could signal new challenges for containing the spread of the virus.“South Korean health authorities still haven’t found cases where the ‘reactivated’ patients spread the virus to third parties, but if such infectiousness is proven, that would be a huge problem,” said Seol Dai-wu, an expert in vaccine development and a professor at Chung-Ang University.LIMITS OF TESTINGPatients in South Korea are considered clear of the virus when they have tested negative twice in a 48-hour period.While the RT-PCR tests used in South Korea are considered generally accurate, experts said that there are ways they could return false or inconsistent results for a small number of cases.“RT-PCR tests boast an accuracy of 95%. This means that there still can be 2-5% of those cases that are detected false negative or false positive cases,” Kim said.Remnants of the virus could remain at levels too low to be detected by a given test, Seol said.On the other hand, the tests may also be so sensitive that they are picking up small, potentially harmless levels of the virus, leading to new positive results even though the person has recovered, Kwon Jun-wook, deputy director of KCDC said at a briefing on Tuesday.The tests could also be compromised if the necessary samples are not collected properly, said Eom Joong-sik, professor of infectious diseases at Gachon University Gil Medical Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-are-some-south-koreans-who-recovered-from-covid-19-testing-positive-again/story-AU6T7DYDhpbgQtbgM8WReL.html

The foundation also called on world leaders to unite in a global response to Covid-19, that has infected over 2 million people worldwide, to ensure equitable access to diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines.“It is increasingly clear that the world’s response to this pandemic will not be effective unless it is also equitable,” Gates Foundation co-chair Melinda Gates said in a statement on Wednesday. “We have a responsibility to meet this global crisis with global solidarity. In addition to contributing to the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, these funds will support efforts against Covid-19 in low-and-middle-income countries, where local leaders and healthcare workers are doing heroic work to protect vulnerable communities and slow the spread of the disease.” The foundation’s new USD 150 million commitment will fund the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, as well as new efforts to provide partners in Africa and South Asia with resources to scale their COVID-19 detection, treatment, and isolation efforts, it said.The additional funding brings foundation commitment to more than $250 million to help mitigate the social and economic impacts of the virus.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, over 2 million people are infected by the virus and more than 136,000 people have died of the disease globally.“Covid-19 does not obey border laws. Even if most countries succeed in slowing the disease over the next few months, the virus could return if the pandemic remains severe enough elsewhere,” foundation co-chair Bill Gates said in the statement. “The world community must understand that so long as Covid-19 is somewhere, we need to act as if it were everywhere. Beating this pandemic will require an unprecedented level of international funding and cooperation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-does-not-obey-border-laws-says-bill-gates-donates-150-million-more/story-85rU8PESnk3uf0sObpCAwJ.html

16-04-2020||World||China, Europe show restarting coronavirus-hit economies not easy||As countries consider how to restart economies that have been halted by the coronavirus, the early experiences in China and parts of Europe show it will be no easy task.Workers back on the job are wary of spending much or going out. Shoppers are staying away from the few stores reopening. Masks and social distancing measures are not fading. And pervasive is the fear the virus could return if lockdowns meant to stop its spread are eased too much, too quickly.Still, leaders are anxious to reopen factories, schools and shops and to repair the economic damage from the pandemic that has infected more than 2 million people and claimed more than 137,000 lives.Some Chinese cities tried reassuring consumers by showing officials eating in restaurants. In the U.S., people have begun getting relief checks to help them pay the bills.Rome’s streets were largely deserted despite some stores reopening. In Vienna, clothing store owner Marie Froehlich said her staff was happy to be back after weeks cooped up at home. But dependent largely on tourism, she expects the business will take months to return to normal.“Until then, we are in crisis mode,” she said.Truck salesman Zhang Hu in Zhengzhou, China, is back at work but his income plummeted because few people are buying 20-ton rigs. “I have no idea when the situation will turn better.”In the U.S., with many factories shut down, American industrial output shriveled in March, registering its biggest decline since the nation demobilized in 1946 at the end of World War II. Retail sales fell by an unprecedented 8.7%, with April expected to be far worse.President Donald Trump said he’s prepared new guidelines for easing social distancing, even as business leaders told him more testing and personal protective equipment were essential first.Troubling data indicate the worst may still be to come in many parts of the world.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging stepped-up efforts to prepare Africa, warning that the continent “could end up suffering the greatest impacts.”Singapore’s outbreak has jumped more than 1,100 cases since Monday. It had looked to be successful in containing a first wave of infections, but the new cases are occurring among workers from poorer Asian countries who live in crowded dormitories and work in the tiny city-state’s trade-dependent economy.In Brazil, a war of words has broken out over President Jair Bolsonaro’s lackadaisical approach to the virus.“We’re fighting against the coronavirus and against the ‘Bolsonaro-virus,’” Sao Paulo state Gov. João Doria told The Associated Press in an interview, adding that he believes the president has adopted “incorrect, irresponsible positions.”The U.S. began issuing one-time payments this week to tens of millions of people as part of its $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package. But another part of the relief package, a $350 billion paycheck protection program aimed at small businesses, is running dry after being open for only a matter of days. Negotiations were accelerating in Washington over a $250 billion emergency request to help.The U.S. has recorded more than 30,000 deaths — the most in the world — and over 600,000 confirmed infections, by a Johns Hopkins University count. Still, the nightmare scenarios projecting a far greater number of deaths and hospitalizations have not come to pass, raising hopes from coast to coast and prompting stronger calls for easing of restrictions.Foreign leaders, meanwhile, rushed to the defense of the World Health Organization after Trump vowed to halt U.S. payments to the U.N. agency for not sounding the alarm over the virus sooner.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the WHO is needed now more than ever: “Only by joining forces can we overcome this crisis that knows no borders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-europe-show-restarting-coronavirus-hit-economies-not-easy/story-atGOtASq0nF3eTwmkmRstK.html

Dr Anthony Fauci was speaking to Vanity Fair magazine on the coronavirus pandemic.Dr Fauci said that he knows people are in home quarantine, and might swipe on a dating app like Tinder, but they have to decide if they want to take that risk. It’s upto that person, said Dr Fauci, to decide whether he/she wants to “sit in a roon and have a chat or wants to go a little bit intimate”.He warned of tremendous risk in terms of going for that sort of thing, because the Covid-19 infection has been spreading through asymptomatic people too.Dr Fauci has been under fire from President Donald Trump for saying in a TV interview that lives could have been saved “had the country started mitigation earlier”.Trump responded by reposting a tweet that included the line, “Time to #FireFauci,” raising alarms that Trump might consider trying to oust the 79-year-old doctor. But at Monday’s briefing, Trump insisted Fauci’s job was safe after Fauci took the podium to try to explain his comments.Trump has complained to aides and confidants about Fauci’s positive media attention and his willingness to contradict the president in interviews and from the briefing room stage, according to two Republicans close to the White House. They spoke to news agency Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss internal conversations.But Trump has told aides that he knows blowback to removing Fauci would be fierce and that - at least for now - he is stuck with the doctor. On more than one occasion, however, he has urged that Fauci be left out of task force briefings or have his speaking role curtailed, according to the Republicans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tinder-dates-during-covid-19-can-invite-them-to-homes-but-at-own-risk-says-us-expert/story-YcY7pwqFGTOr9MnKRedcCM.html

Two weeks back, 198 Tablighi Jamaat workers were quarantined in Pakpattan and nine of them have tested positive, Dawn newspaper reported.“Their test reports were received and of them, one tested positive for the virus in Pakpattan. Similarly six other preachers tested positive for coronavirus in Sahiwal and two others tested positive in Bahawalpur,” authorities were quoted as saying in the report.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, over 2 million people are infected by the virus and more than 136,000 people have died of the disease globally.Pakistan till now has reported a total of 6,506 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 123 deaths, the paper reported.Quoting sources, the report said the district police has quarantined members of Tablighi Jamaat in a mosques in Dhoore Kote near Khairpur Daha.One of them developed symptoms of coronavirus and later became the first positive case in the area, police said.The other Tablighi Jamaat activist was also transported from a mosque to the hospital.Earlier, the Tablighi Jamaat held a convention in Lahore in March, ignoring warnings by officials and later its members spread the disease across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nine-tablighi-jamaat-members-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-pakistan/story-wmfx4b0n3t74QTTnMoGTNM.html
16-04-2020||World||Asia doing better than other regions, may recover faster says IMF||Asia is doing better than other regions in the world in their fight against the deadly coronavirus and may recover faster, a top official from the International Monetary Fund has said.Chang Yong Rhee, Director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department also said that the impact of the deadly coronavirus on Asia will be severe, across the board, and unprecedented.“Asia is still doing better than other regions and may recover faster. Average growth in Asia is still higher than other regions,” Ree told PTI in an interview.“We expect growth in Asia to stall at zero per cent in 2020. This is a remarkable downgrade since Asia has not experienced zero growth in the last 60 years!” he said.This is lower than the annual average growth rates throughout the Global Financial Crisis (4.7 per cent) or the Asian Financial Crisis (1.3 per cent). The downward revisions are substantial and across the board, with the largest revisions for Australia and New Zealand (-9ppt), Japan (-5.9ppt) China(-4.8ppt), he said.But, since Asia was exposed to the virus before other countries, a recovery may begin earlier, and growth in 2021 is expected to rise to 7.6 percent, Rhee said.“But not all lost growth can be made up quickly and the impact of the global economic contraction on Asia means that the level of output can be expected to remain below the pre-pandemic level throughout 2021,” he said.Responding to a question, Rhee noted that the IMF’s forecasts are quite uncertain.“One of the difficulties in forecasting growth in Asia is the fact that Asian economies are at different stages of the pandemic. The final outcome will also depend on the effectiveness of the containment measures and whether or not there is a second wave of outbreaks. There is potential for surprises on both the upside and the downside,” he said.The balance of risks is tilted to the downside, given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asia-doing-better-than-other-regions-may-recover-faster-says-imf/story-MkZqMtgQNh79tHMH2BGqDO.html
16-04-2020||World||Did coronavirus originate from China? Trump says US investigating; Pompeo asks for full transparency||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday asked China for full transparency, as Washington stepped up its attack on Beijing on the coronavirus outbreak. China, on its part, insisted that it has been transparent and sharply criticised US officials who cast doubt on that. “The Secretary stressed the need for full transparency and information sharing to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and prevent future outbreaks,” a US State Department statement said on the call between Pompeo and China’s top diplmate Yang Jiechi.Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported that Yang told Pompeo it was crucial for Washington and Beijing to properly manage their relations during the outbreak and that he hoped the United States would meet China halfway, focus on cooperation and help to promote their relationship.ALSO WATCH | ‘If WHO knew the gravity of…’: US President Donald Trump doubles down on allegationsThis came hours after US President Donald Trump said that his government is trying to determine whether the coronavirus emanated from a lab in Wuhan in China.“We are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened,” Trump said at a White House news conference.Asked if he had raised the subject in his conversations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said: “I don’t want to discuss what I talked to him about the laboratory, I just don’t want to discuss, it’s inappropriate right now.”Pompeo, in a Fox News Channel interview after Trump’s news conference, had said, “we know this virus originated in Wuhan, China,” and that the Institute of Virology is only a handful of miles away from the wet market.“We really need the Chinese government to open up and help explain exactly how this virus spread,” said Pompeo.The source of the virus remains a mystery. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had said on Tuesday that US intelligence indicates that the coronavirus likely occurred naturally, as opposed to being created in a laboratory in China, but there is no certainty either way.Fox News reported on Wednesday that the virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory not as a bioweapon, but as part of China’s effort to demonstrate that its efforts to identify and combat viruses are equal to or greater than the capabilities of the United States.This report and others have suggested that the Wuhan lab where virology experiments take place and lax safety standards there led to someone getting infected and appearing at a nearby “wet” market, where the virus began to spread.The virus has no far infected more than two million people across the globe and killed thousands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-coronavirus-originate-from-china-trump-says-us-investigating-pompeo-asks-for-full-transparency/story-OtzH1j4Rh6aweXDKJvbGlJ.html
16-04-2020||World||Russia clashes with Europeans over Syria chemical weapons||Syria’s close ally Russia clashed with European nations in the UN Security Council on Wednesday over a report from the global chemical weapons watchdog blaming the Syrian air force for a series of attacks using sarin and chlorine on a rebel-held town in 2017.Moscow dismissed it as “baseless” and the Europeans demanded accountability for the government’s action.An investigative team of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said in a 82-page report issued April 8 that the Syrian air force dropped bombs containing either chlorine or sarin on a hospital and open farmland in the central town of Latamneh, injuring over 70 people and killing at least three — a surgeon and two others.The exchanges between Russia and the Europeans took place at the monthly meeting on Syria’s chemical weapons, which was closed. Russia, Germany, Britain and Estonia distributed the statements of their ambassadors.U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said UN disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitusu briefed the council, including on the findings of the OPCW report, and stressed that they were “deeply distressing.”Dujarric said Nakamitsu reiterated Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ position “that the use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, is intolerable and impunity for their use is equally unacceptable. It is imperative to identify and hold accountable all those who have used chemical weapons.” But Syria was not named.The investigative team concluded that “there are reasonable grounds” to believe the perpetrators in Latamneh of the use of sarin on March 24 and 30, and chlorine on March 25, 2017, were part of the Syrian Arab Air Force, OPCW coordinator Santiago Oñate-Laborde said.When the report came out, a Syrian Foreign Ministry official, quoted on state media, said “Syria condemns in the strongest terms what was stated in the report,” and “categorically denies that it used toxic gases in the town of Latamneh or in any other Syrian city or village.”Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council that all of Syria’s chemical weapons were destroyed and accused the OPCW experts of “echoing baseless accusations” by some unnamed countries, “biases,” and preparing a report “without even the slightest traces of due diligence.”Syrian authorities repeatedly refused to cooperate with the investigation, the report said.The investigation included interviews with witnesses, analyses of samples taken from the sites of the attacks, as well as review of symptoms reported by those affected and medical staff, along with examination of imagery, including satellite images.Germany’s deputy UN ambassador Jurgen Schulz told the council: “Accountability is essential and impunity for these heinous crimes is not an option.”Responding to Russia without naming it, he said, “Now is definitely not the time to repeat old and invent new, unsubstantiated claims to undermine the OPCW’s legitimacy,” or “the professionalism, objectivity, impartiality and independence” of its technical experts.Estonia’s UN Ambassador Sven Jürgenson supported the report’s findings, condemned “the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime,” and said “those responsible must be held accountable.”“Without accountability, the atrocities will continue, if not by the Syrian regime, then by others emboldened by the ability to use these horrendous weapons to hold onto power,” Jurgenson said. “We, therefore, call on the states parties of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Security Council to act decisively and in a united manner to respond to the findings of this report.”Britain’s deputy UN ambassador Jonathan Allen said the OPCW’s investigation adds to the evidence of two previous UN -mandated investigations that found the Syrian government responsible for using chemical weapons against its own people on at least four occasions.Allen said he took note of the Russian ambassador’s statement “but the problem is, one cannot just assert what one wants to be true in the face of evidence, which may well be inconvenient evidence to the contrary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-clashes-with-europeans-over-syria-chemical-weapons/story-408BsEKLhfZGl5R3KB9yIL.html
16-04-2020||World||Coronavirus lockdown lifted, Wuhan’s residence committees keep watch to curb spread||The lockdown of the Chinese city of Wuhan may have lifted, but Feng Jing keeps watching the 5,400 residents in the Tanhualin neighbourhood to see where they go and how they are feeling, guarding against the coronavirus creeping back.Feng is the head of the neighbourhood’s residential committee, among thousands tasked in late January with ensuring people in the city of 11 million stayed home to curb the spread of the virus.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageA legacy of the Mao Zedong era, residential committees are staffed mainly by members of the ruling Communist Party and have been key to supporting epidemic control efforts as they kept locked-in residents fed and supplied, carried out regular disinfection operations, and looked after vulnerable people including the elderly.While the city has reopened shopping malls and allowed companies to resume work, residential committees have been ordered to keep a careful watch on households to help prevent the complete resumption of free movement.Wuhan was the epicentre of China’s epidemic, and was where the outbreak first occurred. Haunted by what the city endured during the past few months, people have an abiding fear of a second wave of contagion, although new cases have slowed to a trickle in recent weeks.But, the prolonged vigilance and control over movement has also raised questions over how long the watch over people’s lives could last and whether the city will truly return to normal.Click here for Covid-19 updates“We still don’t let residents go out, only those who have resumed work can go out if they have a green health code,” Feng, who runs a team of 14 community workers, told reporters last week during a government-arranged tour.At that time, Tanhualin had been free of infections for 45 days. In all, the neighbourhood had counted 26 cases of the virus during the epidemic, the first one was identified in January.Asked if her committee had relaxed its management since the lockdown ended, Feng was categoric in her response.“Not at all!”, she said. “Our residents are extremely united, extremely hardworking and are fighting side by side with us. They listen to all our arrangements.”KNOW EVERYTHINGThe committees’ work during the outbreak extended to keeping detailed records of residents’ health, carrying out daily body temperature checks and making sure any slight discomfort, such as a cough or headache, is reported.They also played a key role in keeping a 24-hour watch on people trying to enter or leave their compounds, and assigning someone to accompany family members of deceased coronavirus victims on visits to lay ashes at cemeteries.Reuters reporters in Wuhan found that some compounds were more rigorously managed than others.Many residents also said they were happy to comply with the prolonged oversight, given that it had proven effective in controlling the spread of the virus. Still, some indicated they were growing weary of the intrusion.“What I really want to say is, the lifting of the lockdown is not a true one, neighbourhoods are still imposing curbs, restricting people from going out,” one resident posted on Weibo on April 13.Rising worries about asymptomatic cases and the possibility of a second wave of infections mean that the residential committees may maintain their vigilance for a while longer.Peng Jing, who runs the residential committee in the Shuianxingcheng neighbourhood, said it had immediately sprung into action after discovering an asymptomatic case on April 11, which prompted them to send the patient’s mother quickly to a quarantine centre and notify the area’s 11,000 residents.“We believe our government will notify us first thing when we can end the sealing off of the neighbourhoods,” she said on Wednesday during a small government-organised group interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-lifted-wuhan-s-residence-committees-keep-watch/story-yn3hWLy4L5alEQOHdZyFdI.html

16-04-2020||World||Coronavirus testing in the United States: What you need to know||Before lifting lockdowns imposed across the United States in March, experts say we’ll need a massive screening system in place to monitor and respond to localized coronavirus surges.Are we on track? That depends on who you ask.President Donald Trump has boasted the US has “the best testing system in the world.”Chuck Schumer, the leader of the opposition Democrats in the Senate, disagrees. “It remains clear that the country’s testing capabilities are dangerously inadequate,” he said Wednesday.Here is a guide to tests in place in the US, which had as of Wednesday more than 600,000 confirmed cases and almost 28,000 deaths from Covid-19.How many The US has carried out some 3.2 million tests as of Wednesday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The number began to soar in late March, and is currently growing by about a million per week.In absolute terms, that is far more than any other country. Italy has tested about a million, and South Korea around 500,000, according to Our World in Data.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThis website compiles data from around the globe with the important caveat that the data is somewhat imprecise.Some countries declare the total number of tests performed and others on the number of people, and these differ because a person can be tested several times. In the US, the accounting differs from state to state.But the picture looks different when you account for population. The US is a huge nation with some 330 million people, meaning that the Italians and South Koreans have tested more people per capita: 18 and 10 people per 1000, respectively, compared to nine in a 1000 in the US.Iceland, with just 364,000 people, has tested about 10 percent of its population.Early problemsTests were only carried out at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta until the end of February, with no other public or private labs around the country authorized to do the same.That changed on February 29 -- but it took time for the biggest private companies, Labcorp and Quest, to obtain the chemicals needed to get their kits into the market.At the start of April, an official at a Virginia hospital told AFP it was taking five to seven days to receive their results.But these delays have now been eliminated, said the American Clinical Laboratory Association, which said there’s considerable excess capacity.Rapid tests have also arrived on the market, using machines that are already present in clinics that deliver results within 15 minutes.One problem remains: in a number of places, for example the capital Washington, you can’t get a test unless you have symptoms -- even though we know now many carriers are asymptomatic.CostTesting is supposed to be free, following a law passed by Congress on March 18.Antibody testsMuch hope is pinned on newly approved serological tests, which can tell whether a person was previously infected long after they recovered by looking for the presence of antibodies that fought the coronavirus.In theory, these could also help decide which people can return to society because they may now be immune.New York’s governor said Wednesday the state had developed its own antibody test, and first responders and essential workers would be prioritized.But they are not yet widely available and major questions surround their reliability. The FDA has approved several recently.And right now we don’t know whether prior infection confers immunity, and if so for how long.Medical giant Abbott announced Wednesday that it will ship one million of the tests, with a total of four million by the end of April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-testing-in-the-united-states-what-you-need-to-know/story-y75394CeHwBkiV7qRYhFiK.html

He said that the time for “reflections on various institutions” will arrive once the current coronavirus crisis has been dealt with.While US President Donald Trump has halted funding to the UN health body, Washington has not put any pressure on Ottawa to follow the suit. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Trudeau said Canadian authorities will “always continue to work with experts both domestically and internationally.” However, he did not rule out an assessment of the role played by the WHO during the Covid-19 crisis in the future, as he said, “Of course in the coming months and years there will be many reflections on various institutions.” At this point, however, he said, the “focus needs to be on doing the best we can right now to protect Canadians.” Trudeau’s words came even as a chorus of criticism directed at WHO has erupted in Canada, which became sharper after a WHO expert absented himself at the last minute from a scheduled appearance before a House of Commons committee.Also read: Stranded Canadians returning home to face strict action on not following self-isolationHis statement comes at a time when Canada has recorded over 1,000 deaths from Covid-19, including a surge in numbers from long-term care homes. Given the circumstances, Trudeau warned it will be “weeks more” before any semblance of normalcy can return. “It would be terrible if we were to release restrictions too early and find out we’re suddenly back in another big wave of Covid-19,” he said.Trudeau himself has had to face criticism that he may have violated several Federal and provincial guidelines when he spent the Easter weekend holiday with his wife and children at a lakeside cottage in Quebec while he had cautioned Canadians against joining their families for the holiday and asked them to make the sacrifice and instead celebrate a family dinner remotely via Skype.

Results are still not in from a third of the tests.“Thirty one personnel are today in hospital,” it said in a statement. “More tests are being carried out.”The carrier, which had most recently been taking part in exercises with northern European navies in the Baltic Sea, arrived home in Toulon two weeks earlier than expected after about 40 crew members showed signs of Covid-19 symptoms.Sick crew members had been placed under strict medical observation on board the nuclear-powered carrier and a team equipped to carry out the first tests airlifted to the vessel.Crew from the Charles de Gaulle and the frigate Chevalier Paul were now in confinement within their naval base, while the pilots of the carrier’s warplanes and helicopters were also in quarantine. The navy chief had ordered an investigation, the ministry said.The Charles de Gaulle set sail for the eastern Mediterranean on Jan. 21 to support French military operations against Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria, before deploying to the Atlantic and then the Baltic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-spreads-on-french-aircraft-carrier-hundreds-infected/story-qZiXhJaHwdpVOOMRoWxYPL.html
16-04-2020||World||Evidence of virus’ effect on US economy grows more ominous||Evidence of the coronavirus’ devastating impact on the US economy has been steadily emerging, and the signs have grown ominous.Sales at stores and restaurants plunged in March by the largest amount on records dating back to 1992. The nation’s industrial output fell by the largest amount since the end of World War II. And the outbreak keeps ravaging the global oil market.That was just Wednesday’s news.“I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “You don’t want to look, but you know you have to.” The picture will likely worsen in the coming weeks and months. Retail sales — a primary driver of the U.S. economy — are almost surely suffering further during April because business shutdowns will have been in effect for the entire month, compared with just half of March.Sales of homes and cars will also keep declining. And economists have forecast that Thursday’s weekly report on applications for unemployment benefits will show that millions of Americans sought jobless aid last week, on top of the record-high of nearly 17 million who filed in the previous three weeks.Economists now project a record-shattering 40% annual decline in US economic output for the April-June quarter. While growth is expected to rebound in the second half of the year, economists at JPMorgan Chase have forecast that the U.S. economy will still shrink 7% for 2020 as a whole.The slowdown will be global. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday predicted that the world economy would shrink 3% this year, the worst outcome since the Great Depression.That is hammering oil prices, threatening the solvency of many oil drillers and putting many of their employees out of work. Global demand for oil will fall this year by the most ever due to economic lockdowns around the world, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday. Demand will drop an estimated 9.3 million barrels a day, which is equivalent to a decade’s worth of growth.In the U.S., consumer spending drives more than two-thirds of the economy and was one of the main pillars of support before the virus. Business investment in new plants and equipment had already pulled back in the face of the U.S.-China trade war and falling oil prices.On Wednesday, the government said U.S. retail sales plummeted 8.7% in March, an unprecedented decline, as the outbreak brought most commerce to a halt.The deterioration of sales far outpaced the previous record decline of 3.9% that took place during the depths of the Great Recession in November 2008. Auto sales dropped 25.6%, while clothing store sales collapsed, sliding 50.5%. Restaurants and bars reported a nearly 27% fall in revenue.Spending may be falling at an even faster pace than the retail sales figures suggest. Wednesday’s report did not include spending on services such as hotel stays, airline tickets or movie theaters.Also Wednesday, the U.S. reported that industrial production, which includes manufacturing, mines and utilities, posted the biggest drop in March since 1946.Manufacturing output dropped 6.3% last month, led by plunging production at auto factories that have shut down. Output dropped 3.9% at utilities and 2% at mines as oil and gas drilling plunged.And builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes has fallen off a cliff, according to an index released Wednesday by the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo. Their monthly housing market index plunged 42 points in April to a reading of 30, the largest single monthly change in the history of the index.Retail sales represent about one-third of consumer spending, with the rest consisting of services. But the damage to the sector has broader ramifications for the economy.The retail industry supports 1 out of 4 jobs in the U.S., according to some estimates. That includes millions of jobs like delivery workers, tailors, vendors who supply hangers to store fixtures, and construction workers charged with renovating or building new stores.“A lot of the economy is driven by the consumer,” said Neil Saunders, managing dierctor of GlobalData Retail, a research firm. “The consumer is the linchpin. If the consumer takes a tumble, the rest of the economy falls down.” Stockpiling of essentials is starting to wane, Saunders said, which will also lower retail sales in April, and more grocery stores are limiting the number of shoppers in their locations. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, is now allowing no more than five customers for each 1,000 square feet at a given time. That will reduce their stores’ capacity by about 80%.The pullback in spending intensifies the problems facing brick-and-mortar retailers, which were already struggling with online competition.With a nationwide shutdown of malls and most stores, the pandemic is putting many clothing retailers in peril, while increasing the dominance of big box stores that have remained open during the pandemic because they sell essentials like food and household goods.More than 250,000 stores, including Macy’s, Nordstrom and Nike, which sell nonessential merchandise, have been shuttered since mid-March. That’s 60% of overall U.S. retail square footage, Saunders said.Major retailers including J.C. Penney, Macy’s and Nordstrom have furloughed hundreds of thousands of workers, while Walmart and Amazon are on hiring sprees to try to meet the surging demand of shoppers buying online or for curbside drop-off or delivery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/evidence-of-virus-effect-on-us-economy-grows-more-ominous/story-MWkhV0vXqFrPwEkf8Cx1JK.html

16-04-2020||World||Elizabeth Warren becomes latest ex-presidential rival to back Joe Biden||Elizabeth Warren endorsed Joe Biden on Wednesday, the latest of the former vice president’s onetime White House rivals to back him as the Democratic Party moves to project unity against President Donald Trump going into the November election.“Joe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service. He knows that a government run with integrity, competence, and heart will save lives and save livelihoods,” Warren said in a nearly four-minute video announcing her decision. “And we can’t afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American.”The Massachusetts senator rose to brief front-runner status in the Democratic race last fall but suspended her campaign last month after a disappointing “Super Tuesday” that included a third-place finish her home state. Warren left the race without endorsing Biden or her fellow progressive Bernie Sanders — but the dynamics changed substantially in subsequent weeks, with campaigning forced into a hiatus amid the coronavirus outbreak.Sanders dropped out last week and endorsed Biden within days, hoping to persuade his fervent progressive supporters to warm to the more centrist Biden. Former President Barack Obama followed suit on Tuesday. Warren’s formal backing doesn’t carry the political heft it might have if she had endorsed Biden over Sanders weeks ago. Nonetheless, her announcement now could fuel speculation that Biden may choose her as a running mate.Indeed, Warren said Wednesday night on MSNBC that she would accept the vice president position if Biden offered it to her.Biden has said he soon will announce a committee to oversee his vice presidential search.Biden saluted Warren for the series of detailed policy proposals she released as a candidate and said he will count on her to help rebuild the economy once the threat of the coronavirus lifts.“She helped set a high-water mark for what our politics can be at their best — authentic and service-oriented, focused on how we can deliver the most help to the most people,” he said in a statement. “I am proud to have Senator Warren in my corner for the fight ahead — not just as we work to defeat Donald Trump in November, but in the years to come, as we push through a bold and progressive policy agenda for the American people.”Warren referred to the pandemic more directly in a tweet. “In this moment of crisis, it’s more important than ever that the next president restores Americans’ faith in good, effective government — and I’ve seen Joe Biden help our nation rebuild. Today, I’m proud to endorse @JoeBiden as President of the United States,” she said.Some of Warren’s allies note that, in the days before her endorsement, Biden embraced some of the senator’s plans to combat the coronavirus, including calls to cancel student debt and expand Social Security benefits during the crisis. He also has adopted a plan she promoted as a candidate to overhaul the nation’s bankruptcy system.In her video, Warren also referenced the pair’s sometimes rocky relationship. They clashed in 2005, when Biden was a Delaware senator and Warren was a Harvard Law School professor and bankruptcy expert, during a congressional hearing over a bankruptcy bill. It was a scene that Biden, as vice president, recalled when he swore Warren into office eight years later.“Joe Biden was there at the very moment I became a Senator,” Warren said. “And when he did, he said ‘you gave me hell! And you’re gonna do a great job.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elizabeth-warren-becomes-latest-ex-presidential-rival-to-back-joe-biden/story-eNLL8xNkRB8cQDqbYBTfeI.html
16-04-2020||World||‘A crisis like no other’: IMF facing huge demand for support amid coronavirus pandemic||The head of the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday that the lending agency is facing huge demand for support from its members during the global pandemic.An unprecedented 102 of the IMF’s 189 member countries are seeking assistance from the organization, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said. The agency is prepared to commit its full $1 trillion in lending capacity to meet the demand, she said.“It is a crisis like no other,” Georgieva told reporters, reiterating her agency’s assessment that the global economy is in its worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageGeorgieva spoke at a news conference as the Washington-based IMF and its sister lending agency, the World Bank, began its spring meetings, being held remotely this year.She and World Bank President David Malpass both praised a decision taken Wednesday by the finance ministers and central bank presidents of the Group of 20 major industrial countries to declare a suspension of debt payments for low income countries.Click here to follow Covid-19 updatesThe debt suspension from May 1 through the end of this year is aimed at allowing poor countries to keep an estimated $12 billion that they can use for meeting health care and other needs stemming from the coronavirus.In a new economic outlook prepared for this week’s discussions, the IMF forecast that the global economy will shrink by 3% this year, far greater than the 0.1% dip that occurred in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis.Georgieva said that the IMF has already doubled its emergency assistance programs from $50 billion up to $100 billion. At the same time, the agency is preparing to assist to restart economic growth as countries emerge from the crisis.“We need to think of the challenges we will face on the other side of this crisis,” she said, noting the likelihood of elevated levels of debt and rising bankruptcies in many nations.It is important that the IMF and individual governments put measures in place to deal with those issues, she said.As part of the meetings, the IMF’s policy committee will meet Thursday, with the sessions closing on Friday with a news conference by Malpass following a meeting of the World Bank’s policy panel.

16-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Donald Trump looks to ease distancing in places; CEOs urge caution||President Donald Trump said Wednesday he’s prepared to announce new guidelines allowing some states to quickly ease up on social distancing even as business leaders told him they need more coronavirus testing and personal protective equipment before people can safely go back to work.The industry executives cautioned Trump that the return to normalcy will be anything but swift.The new guidelines, expected to be announced Thursday, are aimed at clearing the way for an easing of restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, while keeping them in place in harder-hit places. The ultimate decisions will remain with governors.“We’ll be opening some states much sooner than others,” Trump said.But in a round of calls with business leaders Wednesday, Trump was warned that a dramatic increasing in testing and wider availability of protective equipment will be necessary for the safe restoration of their operations.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe new guidelines come as the federal government envisions a gradual recovery from the virus, in which disruptive mitigation measures may be needed in some places at least until a vaccine is available — a milestone unlikely to be reached until sometime next year.Trump said at his daily briefing that data indicates the U.S. is “past the peak” of the COVID-19 epidemic, clearing the way for his plans to roll out guidelines to begin to “reopen” the country.He called the latest data “encouraging,” saying the numbers have “put us in a very strong position to finalize guidelines for states on reopening the country.” Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, added that data from across the country showed the nation “improving,” but that Americans had to recommit to social distancing to keep up the positive momentum.She said nine states have fewer than 1,000 cases and just a few dozen new cases per day. She said those would likely be the first to see a lifting in social distancing restrictions at the direction of their governors under the guidelines set to be released Thursday.Birx said the White House was particularly concerned about Rhode Island, noting it is now seeing a surge in cases from the Boston metro area after seeing a spike several weeks ago from cases from New York.Trump consulted dozens of high-profile CEOs, union officials and other executives via conference calls Wednesday.He received a mixed message from the industry leaders. They, too, said they want to get the economy going but had worries about how to safely do so.In a tweet midway through Trump’s round of conference calls with the executives, the president said the participants were “all-in on getting America back to work, and soon.” But participants in a morning call that included dozens of leading American companies raised concerns about the testing issue, according to one participant who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private discussion.Another person who participated in Wednesday’s calls said it was stressed to Trump that expansion of testing and contact tracing was crucial, as well as guidelines for best practices on reopening businesses in phases or in one fell swoop.The participant said those on the call noted to the administration that there was about to be a massive rush on personal protective equipment. Many businesses that are now shuttered will need the protective equipment to keep their employees and customers safe.Trump was told “the economy will look very different and operations will look very different,” one participant said.Mark Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, was among several representatives from major sports leagues to speak with Trump. During a Fox News interview ahead of the calls, he credited the president with gathering some of the “best of the best” to help shape his approach on reopening the economy. Still, Cuban did not embrace Trump’s push to reopen parts of the economy May 1.“This is such a moving target that I think the biggest mistake we can make is rush to a decision,” said Cuban, who previously had been critical of Trump’s response to the pandemic. “But I’m going to help him in every way I can, whatever he needs me to do.” The panel, which Trump dubbed the new Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups, also could help give Trump a measure of cover. If cases surge once restrictions are lifted, as many experts have warned, Trump will be able to tell the public he didn’t act alone and the nation’s top minds — from manufacturing to defense to technology — helped shape the plan.Rich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association, who participated in one of the calls with Trump, said there was also discussion about tax relief as well as “making sure that people are optimistic about the economy and they feel safe coming back to work.” “I think you’ll see steps to reopen the country at different rates in different states in the not too distant future,” Nolan said.The launch of the council was not without hiccups.AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka didn’t know until he heard his name announced in the Rose Garden on Tuesday that he would be part of the advisory group, according to Carolyn Bobb, a spokeswoman for the union.“We were not asked,” Bobb said in an email. It was “just announced.” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Trump has appointed some “smart people” to his task force who could offer state leaders helpful guidelines as they negotiate the way forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-donald-trump-looks-to-ease-distancing-in-places-ceos-urge-caution/story-IYuHoxZukHYZ3jRqSL4SBK.html
16-04-2020||World||Covid-19: New York to require face coverings in busy public places||Even as politicians talk about “reopening” the country, New York is still intensifying restrictions intended to stop the coronavirus from spreading.Face coverings will be now be required in any place where people can’t stay at least six feet away from other people. While other isolation measures seem to have worked in keeping new infections down, New Yorkers continue to die by the hundreds every day. Meanwhile, New York City officials said they would create an emergency food reserve and take other steps to fight hunger in a city where huge numbers of people have been thrown out of work.Here are the latest coronavirus developments in New York:FACE COVERINGSNew York residents will be required to wear face coverings anytime they come into close contact with other people outside their homes, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday.The mandate will require a mask or face covering, like a bandanna, on busy streets, public transit, or any situation where people cannot maintain 6 feet of social distancing, even if it is passing a person briefly on a wooded trail. The order takes effect Friday.“Stopping the spread is everything. How can you not wear a mask when you’re going to come close to a person?” Cuomo said at his daily briefing. “On what theory would you not do that?”The governor, who has himself eschewed masks during his daily news briefings, though he comes within six feet of his staff, said there will initially be no civil penalties for noncompliance, but he’s urging merchants to enforce it among customers.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThough hospitalizations from the outbreak have leveled off, New York officials are still trying to reduce the rising death toll. New York recorded 752 deaths Tuesday, for a total of nearly 11,600 since the outbreak began.Those figures don’t include roughly 4,000 more deaths in New York City that city officials say were probably caused by the virus, but haven’t been confirmed by a lab test.Cuomo’s announcement came hours after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called for stores to make customers wear face coverings in order to protect workers against exposure. De Blasio had previously recommended face coverings in public in the city.The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.FOOD PLANIn a city where 1.2 million residents — including one in five children — struggle at times to feed themselves, the number is expected to grow as an estimated half-million New Yorkers have lost or are likely to lose their jobs soon.“We will make sure everyone gets the food they need,” de Blasio said in unveiling a $170 million plan to help.The city already is handing out 250,000 free meals a day at schools and delivering 25,000 a day to senior citizens. Officials expect to provide 10 million free meals in April and expect the need to grow to as much as 15 million in May.Meanwhile, the city has contacted some 11,000 taxi and livery drivers — whose livelihoods have been shattered as people stay home — to hire them to deliver meals to those who can’t leave home.While officials said the city food supply is stable, they also plan to create a $50 million reserve of as many as 18 million shelf-stable meals.NURSING HOMESThe virus has been unmerciful on nursing homes, killing 2,500 patients in just a few weeks, but so far New York state has refused to disclose the names of facilities where people have died.State officials took one step toward transparency Wednesday, saying they will now require facilities to tell residents and their families within 24 hours if another patient at the home has contracted the virus or died. The upcoming executive order also will include adult homes, where more than 580 people have died.But the state will continue to withhold the names of nursing homes that have experienced severe outbreaks from others, saying patients deserve privacy.The change was intended to help people like Cindy Coughlin, who told The Associated Press she’s struggled to get information about whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak at the nursing home in Johnson City where her 83-year-old father in-law resides.Coughlin said she’s at a loss to understand how the public release of information would endanger anyone’s privacy.“I wish they would do that,” Coughlin said. “I don’t’ know if it would make you feel worse or better, but I think I’d feel a lot better knowing there was only 5 cases there instead of 25. I guess that’s one thing I can’t understand.”THE ECONOMIC EQUATIONCuomo said getting people back to work safely before a vaccine is developed will require not only large-scale testing, but tracing the personal contacts of people who test positive and isolating infected people.But testing and tracing people in a state of 19 million is not possible without federal help, he said.“That is a massive undertaking,” he said. “It’s intelligent but it’s massive.”In the meantime, New York will begin testing 2,000 people a day for virus antibodies this week via a newly developed finger-prick test. Priority will be given to nurses, New York City police and other first responders, so they can know if they’ve been infected.Both Cuomo and de Blasio said leaders need to be deliberative about trying to rev up the economy without creating an opportunity for the coronavirus to come roaring back.“I want to restart the economy desperately ... but the best way to do it is to be careful,” de Blasio said.Cuomo said the state could consider lifting restrictions first for businesses that pose a lesser risk of infection and are considered more “essential.”OUT OF PRISONFormer New York state Senate leader Dean Skelos was expected to be released soon from prison to home confinement after testing positive for the coronavirus.Skelos has been serving a four-year and three-month prison term after he was convicted of extortion, wire fraud and bribery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-to-require-face-coverings-in-busy-public-places/story-QgmY1CblCqHuQhOSMWjINM.html
16-04-2020||World||IMF backs India’s ‘proactive’ Covid-19 response||The International Monetary Fund Wednesday said that it supports India’s proactive decision of a imposing a nationwide lockdown in its fight against coronavirus.A day earlier, the IMF in its World Economic Outlook had forecast India’s growth rate to be 1.9 per cent in 2020.“India entered the pandemic turmoil in the midst of a credit crunch-induced slowdown and its recovery prospect becomes more uncertain,” Chang Yong Rhee, the Director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department, told reporters during a news conference here.“Despite the economic slowdown, the government implemented a nationwide lockdown and we support India’s proactive decision,” Rhee said. On March 25, India entered a three-week lockdown, which was slated to end on April 14. The lockdown was extended till May 3.The impact of the coronavirus on the Asia-Pacific region will be severe, across the board, and unprecedented, he said, adding that Asia’s growth in 2020 will come to a standstill.This is worse than the annual average growth rates throughout the Global Financial Crisis (4.7 percent) or the Asian Financial Crisis (1.3 percent). Actually, Asia has not experienced zero growth in the last 60 years, he said. “That said, Asia’s growth still fares better than other regions.” For 2021, he said, there is hope. If containment policies succeed there could be a rebound in growth, he said. However, it is highly uncertain how this year will progress, he added.Noting that this is not a time for business as usual, Rhee said that Asian countries need to use all policy instruments in their toolkits. In doing so, policy tradeoffs will be inevitable and will depend on policy space, he added.China is expected to grow by 1.2 percent in 2020. The revisions to growth reflect both losses of domestic activity due to the social distancing measures, as well as loss of external demand.“We expect a rebound in economic activity later this year. This is because China is emerging from the outbreak first. Nonetheless, there are clear risks: the virus could come back and normalization could take longer,” Rhee said.Japan’s economic outlook for 2020 has deteriorated significantly, he said. Real GDP in Japan is expected to decline by 5.2 percent, caused by the coronavirus impact, and a sharp deterioration of external demand, he said, adding South Korea’s growth in 2020 is anticipate to be at -1.2 percent, he said.Spelling out a set of recommendations for the countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Rhee said the first priority is to support and protect the health sector to contain the virus and introduce measures that slow contagion.“If there is not enough fiscal space, countries will need to re-prioritize from other expenditures,” he said.Noting that containment measures are severely affecting economies, he said targeted support to hardest-hit households and firms is needed. This is a real economic shock unlike the Global Financial Crisis. Protect people, jobs and industries directly, not just through financial institutions, he said.Observing that the pandemic is also affecting the financial market functioning, he urged countries to use monetary and macroprudential regulations flexibly to provide ample liquidity, ease financial stress of industries and SMEs.“For emerging markets with limited fiscal space, they might need to consider how to use central bank balance sheets flexibly to help SMEs through risk sharing with the government,” he said.Asserting that external pressures need to be contained, he said that countries should seek and utilize bilateral and multilateral swap lines and financial support from the multilateral institutions.“There can be a role for capital flow measures to secure external sector stability as a prerequisite to use more aggressive domestic policies to prevent lasting social and economic distress,” he said. “Targeted support combined with domestic demand stimulus in a recovery will help to reduce scarring, but it needs to reach people and smaller firms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-backs-india-s-proactive-covid-19-response/story-4keOouBa2enFImE245aF0H.html

16-04-2020||World||Only a Covid-19 vaccine will allow return to ‘normalcy’, says UN chief||A Covid-19 vaccine may be the only thing that can bring back “normalcy,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday, hoping for just that before the end of the year. “A safe and effective vaccine may be the only tool that can return the world to a sense of ‘normalcy,’ saving millions of lives and countless trillions of dollars,” he added during a video conference with the 50 or so African countries that are members of the United Nations.He called for its accelerated development and accessibility to all, adding it must have a “universal global benefit” and “allow us to control the pandemic.” “We need an ambitious effort to ensure that international stakeholders operate through a harmonized, integrated and leveraged approach to maximize the speed and scale needed for the universal deployment of such a vaccine by the end of 2020,” he insisted. Guterres said his appeal on March 25 for $2 billion in donations for a comprehensive UN humanitarian response to the pandemic had so far raised about 20 percent of that amount. Through the World Health Organization, the United Nations has been able to equip 47 African countries with Covid-19 tests, he said. The UN chief also praised the efforts of several African governments to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic.He cited Uganda, which has given businesses more time to file their tax returns; Namibia, which provides emergency income for workers who have lost their jobs; Cape Verde, which provides food aid; and Egypt, which has reduced taxation on industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/only-a-covid-19-vaccine-will-allow-return-to-normalcy-says-un-chief/story-evGk0EvKnJDYiwIF9p9ahI.html
16-04-2020||World||South Korea’s ruling party wins general elections amid Covid-19 pandemic||South Korea’s left-leaning ruling party won a landslide victory in Wednesday’s general election, partial results showed, after the coronavirus pandemic turned the political tide in President Moon Jae-in’s favour.The country uses a mix of first-past-the-post seats and proportional representation, but even before all the individual constituencies were decided, Moon’s Democratic party had taken 163 seats in the 300-member National Assembly, an absolute majority.Its sister party was expected to win another 17 proportional representation seats -- due to be declared later Thursday -- for a total of 180.The main conservative opposition United Future Party (UFP) and its satellite party were forecast to secure a total of 97 seats.Turnout was 66.2 percent, higher than any parliamentary elections held in the South since 1992.Just a few months ago scandals over power abuse and sluggish economic growth threatened the left-leaning president, with critics calling his dovish approach towards North Korea -- despite Pyongyang’s abandonment of its nuclear and ballistic missile test moratoriums -- unrealistic.But the South’s relatively quick and effective handling of the epidemic -- it has also exported test kits to at least 20 countries -- has been a boon for Moon ahead of the parliamentary elections, largely seen as a referendum on his performance.And his so-called “coronavirus diplomacy” -- such as recent publicity on his bilateral phone calls with at least 20 state leaders regarding epidemic response -- boosted Koreans’ confidence in his administration, said Minseon Ku, a politics scholar at Ohio State University in the United States.She added that the leader has been successfully framing the pandemic as an “opportunity for South Korea to restructure its economy -- capitalizing on industries like AI and biopharma” and this “coupled with South Korea’s global recognition” for its handling of the outbreak sat well with the voters.South Korea was among the first countries to hold a national election during the pandemic, with citizens still being asked to maintain social distancing after enduring one of the worst early outbreaks of the virus.All voters were required to wear protective masks, clean their hands with sanitiser and don plastic gloves, and undergo temperature checks on arrival at the polling station.Those found to have fevers cast their ballots in separate booths that were disinfected after each user.The absolute majority win means Moon is likely to be less of a lame duck than previous presidents toward the end of their single five-year term.“It should give his administration greater momentum,” said Andrew Yeo, a politics professor at the Catholic University of America.Meanwhile UFP heavyweights former prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and ex-parliamentary floor leader Na Kyung-won failed to be re-elected.The conservative party had “failed to rebrand” itself after the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye, which “limited the boundary of support to older generations and core support regions”, Ji Yeon Hong, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told AFP.But while the pandemic took public attention away from the opposition’s criticisms, it would be “dangerous” if Moon interprets the election as “vindicating foreign policies that aren’t working”, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.“Seoul’s engagement of Pyongyang has been met with diplomatic insults and missile tests. Placating China has yielded little benefit,” he told AFP.“Talking tough on Japan has not advanced South Korean interests. And progressives want to accelerate military command reforms and resist cost-sharing pressures in Seoul’s alliance with Washington.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-ruling-party-wins-general-elections-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-CDjw57eFJMQBrODVgrCucI.html
16-04-2020||World||War veteran, 99, raises £10 million in outbreak of altruism||A humble attempt by a 99-year-old war veteran to raise £1,000 as a tribute to doctors and nurses has blown into an outbreak of altruism as people in the UK and around the globe hunkered down in lockdowns showered £10 million by Wednesday evening that went beyond his ‘wildest dreams’.Yorkshire-based Captain Tom Moore, who saw action in India during World War II, promised to walk 10 laps of his garden with a walking aid, hoping to raise £1,000 as a way to reward doctors and nurses who helped him recover from skin cancer and him replacement.The target was passed within hours of Moore launching his effort on April 8, and on Wednesday morning it touched £5 million live on BBC television. By the evening, millions more poured in, reaching £10 million, donated by over 5 lakh people online.Moore is walking 10 laps of the garden a day and had hoped to hit 100 laps in time for his 100th birthday on April 30. Health secretary Matt Hancock paid him tributes: “Captain Tom, you’re an inspiration to us all, and we thank you.”Blown away by the millions, Moore said: “I think that’s absolutely enormous. At no time when we started off with this exercise did we anticipate we’d get anything near that sort of money…Our brave nurses and doctors are frontline in this case”.“This time our army are in doctors and nurses uniforms and they’re doing a marvellous job. It just shows that people have such high regard for matters of our NHS and it’s really amazing that people have paid so much money. It’s almost unbelievable isn’t it,” he said from his home in Keighley.The money raised will be donated to NHS Charities Together, a group representing various charity organisations linked to the NHS.Moore’s daughter, Hannah, said her father was overwhelmed when the figure reached the first £1 million, but he responded with a determination to walk more: “He’s a typical Yorkshireman, so he’s very stoic, very controlled and takes everything in his stride.”“We always knew that he was this incredible gem of a man, but we never had any idea that his story would capture the hearts of the nation. We thought we could give people a little bit of happy and we wanted to share a little bit about him, and it has just gone beyond even our wildest, wildest dreams.”As the death toll in the UK approached 13,000 and 1 lakh cases, there is an outpouring of gratitude and concern for NHS staff dealing with growing numbers of people stricken with coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/war-veteran-99-raises-10-million-in-outbreak-of-altruism/story-ogCNH0KKDOGu1kpz8WYllI.html
16-04-2020||World||Covid-19 outbreak: Deadliest day for America||Coronavirus deaths in the US rose by at least 2,228 on Tuesday, a single-day record, to top 27,000 as officials debated how to reopen the economy without reigniting the outbreak. The previous single-day record was 2,069, set last Friday.The US, with the world’s third-largest population, passed a second milestone on Tuesday with over 600,000 reported cases, three times more than any other country. New York City’s health department, meanwhile, said the death toll is now over 10,000, including the 3,700 deaths added on Tuesday. Health officials have cautioned that deaths are a “lagging indicator” and do not mean that the sweeping stay-at-home restrictions are a failure. New York state and some other hard-hit areas continue to report sharp decreases in hospitalisations and patients on ventilators. Health experts had forecast deaths would peak this week but there had been hopes the worst was behind the US when new deaths reported on Sunday and Monday were about 1,500 per day, far below last week’s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours, according to a Reuters tally. With schools and many businesses shuttered, the measures to slow the spread of the illness have taken a painful toll on the economy. The shutdown is costing the US economy perhaps $25 billion a day in lost output, St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said.In NYC, the 60% spike in reported deaths underscored the enormous losses endured in the nation’s most populous city, where the sounds of wailing sirens have echoed almost non-stop through largely empty streets for weeks.The city’s revised count, 10,367 in all, took the number of coronavirus deaths nationwide towards 30,000 - New York accounting for the biggest share of deaths.New York City’s health department said it will now also count any fatality deemed a “probable” coronavirus death, defined as a victim whose “death certificate lists as a cause of death ‘Covid-19’ or an equivalent.”March 11 was used as the starting point because that was the date of the first confirmed coronavirus death, the city said.“Behind every death is a friend, a family member, a loved on,” said health commissioner Oxiris Barbot. “We are focused on ensuring that every New Yorker who died because of Covid-19 gets counted.”The new approach in NYC could pave the way for similar policies across the country, possibly leading to a surge in reported US coronavirus fatalities.Louisiana, another hot spot, and California also reported record daily spikes in deaths on Tuesday, despite signs across the country in recent days the outbreak was beginning to ebb.New York governor Mario Cuomo, whose state’s health care network was strained to breaking point by a wave of Covid-19 hospitalisations, had said on Monday it appeared “the worst is over”. New York state and some other hard-hit areas continue to report sharp decreases in hospitalisations and numbers of patients on ventilators, although front-line healthcare workers and resources remained under extraordinary stress.Meanwhile, the US government has been pushing for reopening the country and the economy and President Donald Trump unveiled on Tuesday bipartisan groups of advisers he will be consulting to determine the way forward. The decision to end or continue social-distancing and other mitigation efforts would rest ultimately with state governors. Trump acknowledged as much on Tuesday, dialling down a feud with governors, some of whom have pushed back against his claims of “total” authority in deciding when to end the curbs, and threatened to defy him if he persisted.In another development, The Washington Post reported that Trump’s name will be printed on checks the US treasury will send out to American families as part of a $2.2tn stimulus package.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-outbreak-deadliest-day-for-america/story-Od7puTnAsvelgfI3OgaWTO.html
