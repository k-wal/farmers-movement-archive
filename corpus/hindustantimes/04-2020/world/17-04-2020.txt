General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Tuesday that US intelligence indicates that the coronavirus likely occurred naturally, as opposed to being created in a laboratory in China, but there is no certainty either way.The Washington Post said this week that national security officials in the Trump administration have long suspected research facilities in Wuhan to be the source of the novel coronavirus outbreak.As far back as February, the Chinese state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology dismissed rumours that the virus may have been artificially synthesized at one of its laboratories or perhaps escaped from such a facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-says-no-evidence-covid-19-linked-to-wuhan-research-lab/story-M0v5k5x6xOSHzkK30cI4dN.html

Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will be the first to fly on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft as part of what’s known as the Demo-2 mission.Musk, the chief executive officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., founded the company in 2002 with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets, but the company has never flown humans before.The historic flight, from launch complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, is the final test for SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon spacecraft to be certified by the space agency to conduct regular flights to the station with crew on board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-sets-date-for-first-ever-astronaut-flight-on-spacex-rocket/story-I3xtKRboitSZdv2VQGjodK.html
17-04-2020||World||New York governor says Trump ‘passing buck’ on reopening amid pandemic||New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday he needed federal government help to ramp up testing for the novel coronavirus and reopen his state’s economy, and accused President Donald Trump’s administration of failing to provide funding to states.“Is there any funding so I can do these things that you want us to do? ‘No,’“ Cuomo told a daily briefing on the coronavirus. “That is passing the buck without passing the bucks.”The broadside came one day after Trump outlined guidelines for a phased reopening of the devastated U.S. economy, an effort that is expected to require mass testing for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus.Cuomo said New York, the epicenter of the country’s crisis, would need federal funding to significantly ramp up testing capacity and to fill a $10-$15 billion budget shortfall that is hampering the state’s ability to fund such efforts on its own.“The federal government has passed three bills to address this crisis. Of those three bills the state governments have gotten precisely zero, zilch, nada in unrestricted aid,” Cuomo said.“Okay, it’s up to the states, but then don’t ask the states, don’t give them this massive undertaking that has never been done before and then not give them any resources to do it.”He said Trump should pay as much attention to the states as “your big businesses and your airlines.”Responding to criticism from Trump about state requests for federal aid, Cuomo said: “If he is sitting home watching TV maybe he should get up and go to work.”On Thursday, Cuomo extended the closure of businesses and schools in his state until at least May 15, but he has started to plan on a phased reopening that would hinge on keeping hospitalizations and other key metrics on a downward trend.Cuomo said on Friday that a total of 17,316 people were hospitalized across New York because of COVID-19, down from 17,735 a day earlier and the lowest since April 5. Intubations and admissions to intensive care units also fell, he said.Cuomo said that about 2,000 infected people were newly admitted to hospitals on Thursday, hovering at a high level, while the state recorded an additional 630 deaths, up from 606 deaths the previous day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-says-trump-passing-buck-on-reopening-amid-pandemic/story-WAkAHxwwHBfnKNDIKwr9wJ.html
17-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: After over 14,500 deaths, UK cases show ‘gradual decline’||Britain’s health officials on Friday reported a ‘gradual decline’ in the number of cases in the hotspot of London, after national figures showed the number of dead rising to 14,576 and the number of cases to 108,692.Business secretary Alok Sharma announced a new taskforce on vaccines and multi-million pound funding to several projects to accelerate the development and production of a vaccine for coronavirus. Some pre-clinical trials have begun in the University of Oxford.Chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance reported a gradual decrease in the number of people in hospital beds in London, and a flattening and decrease in some areas: “That is exactly what you’d expect from the social distancing measures that we’ve all taken beginning to feed through”.On the taskforce, Sharma said at the Downing Street briefing: “UK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people’s lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts”.“The Vaccine Taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible”.One new project led by the University of Oxford will trial an anti-malarial drug believed to have anti-inflammatory properties to determine whether it could diminish the effects of Covid-19 on people in high risk groups.Other projects include Imperial College London testing a vaccine against coronavirus that aims for the body to produce more protective antibodies; and Public Health England developing a new antibody that could offer protection against infection and disease progression of coronavirus.Health secretary Matt Hancock added: “We’re doing everything possible to save lives and beat this disease, and that includes working flat out with businesses, researchers and industry to find a vaccine as quickly as possible”.“The UK is world-leading in developing vaccines. We are the biggest contributor to the global effort - and preparing to ensure we can manufacture vaccines here at home as soon as practically possible”.Reports continued from parts of the UK of shortage of personal protection equipment for medical staff. Britain is also planning to restart tracing the contacts of people who have had coronavirus symptoms, Hancock told a parliamentary committee on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-after-over-14-500-deaths-uk-cases-show-gradual-decline/story-M0XRe5R7xEhGYhDQ7A2T1I.html
17-04-2020||World||Record one-day spike in Covid-19 deaths, Donald Trump unveils reopening guidelines||The number of deaths from the novel coronavirus spiked to a new one-day high of 4,591 on Friday, nearly double the previous record, as President Donald Trump issued guidelines for reopening the country but left it to the states to decide; some of whom announced extended restrictions instead.The 24 hours ending late Thursday the number of new fatalities went up to 4,591, overtaking by a wide margin the previous high of 2, 494 on Wednesday, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker (other tallies may be higher or lower; the previous record was put at 2,569 by one them).The US toll so far was up, thus, to 33,286, and the number of confirmed cases went up by 31,451 over the same 24-hour period to 671,493.The number of cases increased in New York state, the epicenter of the American epidemic, to 223,691 thus far; with 14,832 fatalities, most of them in New York City, at 11,477.Despite these growing numbers, public health officials have expressed optimism that the United States is past the peak in new cases — 30% of US counties had not reported new cases in the last seven days, for instance. A drop in hospitalization and flattening of the curve on other metrics are the other signs giving them hope.“We’re starting our life again,” President Trump told reporters at theWhite House daily briefing Thursday, as he unveiled the new federal guidelines citing those signs of improvement. “We’re starting rejuvenation of our economy again in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion.”States were expected to announce their own reopening plans under guidelines but there no prescriptive timelines; governors will decide. Some states, in fact, chose to extend their restrictions instead. New York, for instance, extended its shutdown to May 15; Michigan and Missouri had also extended their stay-at-home orders. Trump said there are 29 states (of the total of 50) that can start soon and some of whom can get on to it right away. The White House task force has spoken of nine states that have reported less than 1,000 coronavirus cases each, with less than 30 new cases a day. But no specifics were forthcoming once again.The guidelines provide the reopening to be spread over three phases and laid down “gatekeeping” criteria for progressing from one phase to another. A state could decide to start phase for the entire state or parts of it based on 14 days of declining confirmed cases and testing, the ability of its hospitals to be able to deal with the the load without going into crisis mode; and provide robust and full testing for health workers.In the first phase, movie theaters, gyms, restaurants, places of worship and others could open if they are able to abide by strict social distancing rules of six-feet apart at the least. Employers could bring back workers if teleworking was not working out for them, but only in batches of 20% of 25%. All non-essential travel for employees could resume. Schools will remain closed and visits to senior living facilities and homes will remain prohibited. Stay-at-home orders will remain in force for vulnerable people, the elderly and those with underlying conditions.Schools, day care centers and camps could reopen in the second phase, elective surgeries could resume. Large venues may be allowed to reopen, but with moderate social distancing. Visits to senior living facilities will remain prohibited.All restrictions on workplaces will go in the third phase, ushering in the “new normal”, as Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House task force, put it. People will be expected to continue good hygiene practices and respect some amount of social distancing as “we still have an issue with asymptomatic spread”, she added.The mitigation efforts now in force in most parts of the United States have shut down businesses causing large-scale layoff — close to 22 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the last four weeks — and brought to the country to edge of the worst slowdown in US history, comparisons are being drawn to the Great Depression of 1929.Protests have broken out across the country with marchers demanding the reopening of the country — in Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, Utah and Wyoming. And more are expected over the next few days.President Trump has been just as keen as the protestors to reopen the economy and when asked about them, he told reporters, “They all want to open. Nobody wants to stay shut but they want to open safely. So do I.”But there is growing popular disapproval of his handling of the outbreak, which has come under growing criticism for being delayed and “botched”. Majority of Americans disapprove of the president’s response, according to two new polls. A CNN poll out Wednesday showed 52% disapproved of his response, up from 48% in March. In another poll, by Monmouth University, 49% of the respondents said he was doing a bod job, compared to 46% who approved. In March, half of the respondents had said he was doing a good job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-one-day-spike-in-covid-19-deaths-donald-trump-unveils-reopening-guidelines/story-bgIToJ4ivkLAvUoI7g340N.html
17-04-2020||World||Trump kicks toughest decisions to states with his reopening plan||Days after insisting he had absolute authority to steer the country’s economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak, President Donald Trump instead handed over the keys to governors and businesses.Trump issued guidelines on Thursday for states to consider as they decide whether to relax stay-at-home orders and other social-distancing measures enacted to curb the spread of the virus. The brief document lays out a three-stage process and leaves many difficult decisions to statehouses.The president set no deadlines, demanded no particular action and offered little federal assistance. One page of the document says that states undertaking a resumption of normal life should plan to “independently” secure protective gear and medical equipment for their hospitals. Businesses are advised to come up with their own protocols for temperature checks, protective gear, sanitation and testing.“A national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution,” Trump said Thursday at his daily White House news conference. “Now that we have passed the peak in new cases, we’re starting our life again.”US equity futures climbed Friday on optimism about an economic restart. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may be heading toward the first back-to-back weekly advance since before the market turmoil began in February.Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence plans a 1 p.m. call Friday with Senate Democrats on cthe federal oronavirus response, according to the White House. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on MSNBC Friday morning that negotiations with the Trump administration for additional funds for a small business program that ran out of money Thursday are making progress.Trump said Thursday that 29 of the 50 states qualified to begin the reopening process his administration laid out or would be ready soon, naming Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming. He agreed with a questioner who suggested Hawaii.In the best case, a state could abandon all but minimal social distancing practices within a month, under the plan. Yet it’s not clear whether most governors, business owners and workers share the president’s optimism that it will soon be safe to risk easing measures that only now appear to be slowing the virus’s spread in some hot spots, while cases and deaths continue to rise across the country.In North Dakota and Wyoming, the number of cases are still rising, which may disqualify those states from attempting to reopen under Trump’s guidelines. Hawaii Governor David Ige, a Democrat, is “working with his cabinet and others to determine what specific milestones will be needed for Hawaii to begin a phased reopening,” spokeswoman Cindy McMillan said.McMillan said the state does not yet believe it meets the federal criteria.A spokesman for Montana Governor Steve Bullock, a Democrat, didn’t respond to a request for comment on Trump’s guidelines.Testing WeaknessThe overarching weakness of Trump’s plan is that the US still lacks sufficient testing capacity to know with much precision where the virus is spreading. Tests continue to be rationed for priority groups and the country does not yet have a widely available antibody test, which can identify people who were infected and recovered without experiencing symptoms.Business leaders told Trump Wednesday that widespread testing was key to reopening.“Without sufficient testing -- and they’re talking millions of tests per week -- you cannot accurately predict what the actual rate of infection is,” said Paul Meechan, a bio-risk consultant who until last September was director of the Office of Safety, Health and Environment at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“Until we get those baselines, and we can have a discussion about what it means to be going down, you’re basically opening the door for making it a wild guess,” he said. “And that’s not good public policy. It’s not good science.”Deborah Birx, the State Department immunologist who is one of Trump’s top medical advisers, said Thursday the country has enough testing capacity for people with symptoms and those who have been in contact with confirmed cases, and can conduct “surveillance” testing that is crucial to stave off future outbreaks. The administration is trying to take advantage of an “amazing array” of capacity for “a million more” tests per week, Birx said, though that may not be enough.Micha Benoliel, an entrepreneur who led the development of a contact-tracing app called Coalition that’s expected to be used in the city of Berkeley, said “there is urgency to end the total lockdown as soon as possible if we want to avoid killing the economy” but that “we need to put science first in our decision.”“Much more access to testing is needed for us to begin a progressive approach in getting back to normal economic activity,” he said.Frustrated PresidentTrump has long made plain his frustration with social distancing, the isolation behaviors that Americans adopted to protect themselves from the virus even before he endorsed them March 16. The practices have crushed the U.S. economy, which less than two months ago was the president’s strongest argument for re-election.Gallup said Thursday that Trump’s approval rating fell six percentage points since mid-March, when he reached a personal best of 49%.“The current health and economic crisis is undoubtedly the greatest challenge of his presidency so far -- and could imperil his standing in the final year of his first term as he seeks re-election,” the polling service said.Trump’s new guidelines are as deferential to governors as they are flexible. The metrics are vague, and much is left to the discretion of states.The plan, called “Opening Up America Again,” outlines three phases of recovery from the outbreak in which social distancing restrictions are lifted step-by-step. In the third and final phase, employers can “resume unrestricted staffing” of workplaces, while restaurants, theaters, stadiums and other gathering places can operate with “limited physical distancing protocols.”“A new normal,” Birx called it.To move into the first phase, and then again into subsequent phases, the plan recommends that states document a decline in cases of coronavirus and flu-like illnesses for two weeks.‘Literally Tomorrow’Some states could enter phase one and begin lifting restrictions immediately -- “literally tomorrow,” Trump said. Barring a resurgence of infections, they could reach phase three in four weeks. It isn’t clear whether any governors will seek to move that quickly, risking a political backlash if the outbreak surges.“We have large sections of the country that, right now, they can start thinking about opening,” Trump said. “I call it a beautiful puzzle -- you have 50 pieces, all very different.”Trump’s guidelines also give states -- particularly the worst-hit ones -- license to do what they were already doing.California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has joined with governors in Washington and Oregon to set common policies for an eventual reopening. He said at a news conference that Trump understood the need for extensive testing, and expressed appreciation the president wasn’t trying to impose his preferences on states.Trump recognized “the need for a phased approach, a thoughtful and judicious approach,” Newsom said.Governors in the Midwest and the Northeast have formed similar regional partnerships. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer -- a potential running mate for Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, who has faced anti-shutdown protests led by Trump surrogates -- cited her own requirements to consider reopening her state: a declining rate of new infections, testing and tracing for sick people, health care capacity, and workplace social distancing.Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who is part of the Midwest coalition with Whitmer, said in a statement on Thursday that the regional economies would not reopen until “the time is right.” The state saw a 10-day-old child diagnosed with the virus on Thursday.Corporate UneaseCompanies are also likely to be uneasy with the steps proposed by the guidance -- or unable to function even under the limited social distancing that’s still envisioned in phase three, said Scott Ream, chairman of the Association of Continuity Professionals, a 1,700-member organization of business professionals that advises companies on how to operate in a time of crisis.“Corporations in particular are going to be very challenged by this in the absence of the federal government or some entity, or maybe through some other precedents that corporations wouldn’t be held liable for someone’s death,” Ream said.Any return to normal will require extensive testing, rapid identification of cases and tracing and testing of contacts of infected people, said Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and dean of the Boston University School of Public Health.“I’m not convinced we have those resources available,” Galea said. “We need to re-emerge. And to re-emerge, we need to plan for how to mitigate the risk of every case becoming again an outbreak, and every outbreak becoming an epidemic. I don’t think we’ll be ready tomorrow.”June is likelier, he said.But the guidelines largely leave to governors and businesses the choice whether to attempt reopening -- and therefore the consequences of moving too soon.“It’s going to be very dependent on the governor,” Trump said.Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged the risk of the approach.“This is uncharted water,” he said at the White House news conference. “There may be some setbacks. We may have to pull back a little, and then go forward.But he said, “I do see us getting more towards normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-kicks-toughest-decisions-to-states-with-his-reopening-plan/story-CUDkTouzNGLU8zhI1HZBwJ.html

Andrew Cuomo, everyone must wear a mask or face covering when in a public place and unable to maintain appropriate distance from others. Children younger than 2 and people with a medical reason why they can’t tolerate a mask are exempt from the rule, which takes effect at 8 p.m.Cuomo announced Thursday that the state’s stay-at-home restrictions that have been in place since March 22 will last at least until May 15. He said the extension was made in consultation with officials from other Northeast states and will be reevaluated next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-york-extends-stay-home-order-till-may-15-face-covering-rule-on/story-Aq9352B76yx2i6ozb2CBIM.html
17-04-2020||World||China’s virus death toll revised up sharply after review||China’s official death toll from the coronavirus pandemic jumped sharply Friday as the hardest-hit city of Wuhan announced a major revision that added nearly 1,300 fatalities.The new figures resulted from an in-depth review of deaths during a response that was chaotic in the early days. They raised the official toll in Wuhan by 50% to 3,869 deaths. While China has yet to update its national totals, the revised numbers push up China’s total to 4,632 deaths from a previously reported 3,342.The higher numbers are not a surprise — it is virtually impossible to get an accurate count when health systems are overwhelmed at the height of a crisis — and they confirm suspicions that many more people died than the official figures had showed.The undercount stemmed from several factors, according to a notification issued by Wuhan’s coronavirus response headquarters and published by the official Xinhua News Agency.The reasons included the deaths of people at home because overwhelmed hospitals had no room for them, mistaken reporting by medical staff focused on saving lives, and deaths at a few medical institutions that weren’t linked to the epidemic information network, it said.“As a result, belated, missed and mistaken reporting occurred,” Xinhua quoted an unidentified official from the city’s response headquarters as saying.Deaths outside hospitals were not registered previously and some medical institutions reported cases late or not at all, the official said.A group to review the numbers was established in late March. It looked at data from multiple sources including the city’s hospital and funeral service systems and collected information from fever clinics, temporary hospitals, quarantine sites, prisons and elderly care centers.The review found 1,454 additional deaths, as well as 164 that had been double-counted or misclassified as coronavirus cases, resulting in a net increase of 1,290. The number of confirmed cases in the city of 11 million people was revised up slightly to 50,333.Questions have long swirled around the accuracy of China’s case reporting, with Wuhan in particular going several days in January without reporting new cases or deaths. That has led to accusations that Chinese officials were seeking to minimize the impact of the outbreak and could have brought it under control sooner.A group of eight medical workers, including a doctor who later died from the virus, were even reprimanded and threatened by police after they tried to alert others about the disease over social media.Chinese officials have denied covering up cases, saying their reports were accurate and timely.“The data released by Wuhan reflects openness and transparency and an attitude of seeking truth from facts,” foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Friday.The U.N.’s World Health Organization has come under criticism for defending China’s handling of the outbreak and U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended funding to WHO over what he alleges is its pro-China bias.Trump’s blaming of China came after he initially showered praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping for the country’s response, while largely dismissing the risk it posed to the U.S.At the start of the outbreak, China proceeded cautiously and largely in secret, emphasizing political stability. Experts estimate more than 3,000 people were infected before China’s government told the public about the gravity of the situation, which officials had discussed privately six days earlier.The risk of sustained human-to-human transmission was also downplayed, even while infected people entered hospitals across the country and the first case outside China was found, in Thailand.As Trump and other U.S. officials and lawmakers started blaming China for the outbreak, Chinese officials pushed back. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Zhao tweeted in March, picking up on an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-virus-death-toll-revised-up-sharply-after-review/story-Ohh5vyMrAapWj6UawUrDmI.html
17-04-2020||World||Bolsonaro fires Brazil’s health minister, calls to reopen economy||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro fired his health minister on Thursday after clashing with him over how to fight the new coronavirus, and again called for states to end stay-at-home orders that he said were hurting the economy.Few global leaders have done more than Bolsonaro to play down the pandemic, which has killed nearly 2,000 Brazilians. He has called the virus “a little flu” and criticized state governors for imposing restrictions supported by health experts and the popular outgoing minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta.In televised remarks met with pot-banging protests in several major cities, Bolsonaro said Mandetta did not fully appreciate the need to protect jobs and he called again for a resumption of business in Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy.“We need to return to normal, not as fast as possible, but we need to start having some flexibility,” Bolsonaro said. The government cannot afford emergency aid to the poor for much longer, he said.The dispute at the highest reaches of Brazilian politics coincides with several countries debating when and how life should start returning to normal after coronavirus lockdowns, which are predicted to drive the global economy into recession.Governors in the United States have formed regional coalitions to begin considering plans for reopening their economies, stoking friction with U.S. President Donald Trump, an ally of Bolsonaro’s, who wants to see lockdowns lifted faster. But while there are signs that the outbreak has peaked in the United States, medical experts agree that a peak in Brazil is still weeks away and it is too early to end social distancing.“Do not think we are past a peak in growth of the virus. The health system is still not prepared for an acceleration,” Mandetta warned in his parting comments at the ministry.NEW MINISTER PROMISES NO SUDDEN CHANGE While Bolsonaro sharply criticized the shutdowns, the Health Ministry under Mandetta provided guidance supportive of the social distancing measures. Mandetta’s daily briefings had also contradicted Bolsonaro’s praise for unproven drugs.[nL1N2BP1K0]Incoming minister Nelson Teich, asked at a news conference about the ministry’s position now that he was in charge, said there will not be any “sudden changes” in policy.However, he added: “There is a complete alignment between me and the president.”Teich, who founded an oncology group sold to United Healthcare in 2015, lacks the political experience of his predecessor, a former lawmaker who had begun to upstage Bolsonaro.Boslonaro’s popularity has slid and he faces nightly protests from Brazilians banging pots from their windows over his handling of the outbreak. In addition to the daily 8:30 p.m. protest on Thursday, people also spontaneously began striking cookware when Bolsonaro announced Mandetta’s firing.The Health Ministry’s response to the epidemic was rated “good” or “great” by 76% of Brazilians surveyed by pollster Datafolha. Just 33% of those surveyed gave Bolsonaro the same ratings. Senator Major Olimpio, Bolsonaro’s former right-hand man in Congress, praised Mandetta for sticking to scientific principles in the public health crisis and urged the new minister to defend the need for isolation measures.“Teich has defended social distancing. If he persists in this, he will have serious problems with President Bolsonaro and won’t last 30 days in office, or he will have to tear up his degree and contradict the entire global scientific community,” the right-wing senator said in a video posted on social media.The spread of the coronavirus in Brazil has accelerated to 30,425 confirmed cases, with some 200 fatalities per day bringing the death toll to 1,924 on Thursday, according to Health Ministry data, the highest in Latin America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-fires-brazil-s-health-minister-calls-to-reopen-economy/story-aaQmWl9rExttfdvHOiHoOL.html
17-04-2020||World||Kim Jong Un’s absence from anniversary event fuels speculation over health||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s absence from an important anniversary event this week rekindled speculation over his potential health problems, analysts said on Friday. North Korea on Wednesday marked the anniversary of the birthday of its national founder and Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, as a national holiday known as the Day of the Sun.Senior officials paid tribute to the embalmed body of Kim Il Sung enshrined in the Kumsusan Palace of Sun, state media KCNA said on Thursday. But did not mention Kim as part of the delegation, unlike the past. He was also absent from photos released by party mouthpiece Rodong Sinmun. His purported absence triggered speculation among experts that Kim, who is aged 36 and overweight, might be having health problems. A spokeswoman at Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which handles North Korea affairs, said on Thursday it was aware that state media has not reported on Kim’s visit but declined to provide any analysis. Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at South Korea’s Sejong Institute, said it was the first time in decades Kim’s visit to the palace on that holiday was not reported state media since he took power in late December. “He has been going there on the birthdays of his grandfather and father to flaunt his royalty to them and sacred bloodline,” Cheong said. “It is possible that there was a problem with his health or safety even if temporary, though it is difficult to assess how the situation might be.” Pyongyang fired multiple short-range missiles on Tuesday which Seoul officials said was part of the celebration. Such military events would usually be observed by Kim, but there was no KCNA report on the test at all. Kim was last publicly seen presiding over a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s politburo last Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-absence-from-anniversary-event-fuels-speculation-over-health/story-CW80hUBxKtvEXJzaOnQYSN.html
17-04-2020||World||Coronavirus vaccine may be ready for mass production by Autumn: Oxford Professor||A coronavirus vaccine trial by University of Oxford researchers aims to get efficacy results by September, and manufacturing is already underway.A team led by Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology, has recruited 500 volunteers from the ages of 18 to 55 for the early- and mid-stage randomized controlled trial. It will be extended to older adults and then to a final stage trial of 5,000 people. Gilbert said that the timing is ambitious but achievable.“We would hope to have at least some doses that are ready to be used by September,” she said in an interview. “There won’t be enough for everywhere by then, but the more manufacturing we can do starting from now, then the more doses there will be.”Volunteers to take part in the trial have been abundant, she said, and it’s no longer accepting new subjects.Gilbert, whose research on vaccines began at the University of Oxford in 1994, was awarded a 2.2 million pound ($2.8 million) grant from the U.K.’s National Institute for Health Research and U.K. Research and Innovation in March to scale up her team’s efforts to move into Covid-19 vaccine research.The group’s experimental immunization is among the first to enter clinical trials. The World Health Organization counts 70 vaccine candidates in development, with three others in human testing. They are from CanSino Biological Inc. and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology; Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.; and Moderna Inc. along with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Gilbert’s trial divides 510 participants into five groups that will be observed for about six months with the option for a follow-up visit about a year after entering the trial. One group will receive a second intramuscular shot of the vaccine four weeks after the initial immunization.The research aims to determine the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine, named ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. A vaccine against meningococcal disease will be given to participants who will be randomly chosen for control purposes.Overseas Partners?ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is a so-called recombinant viral vector vaccine. It’s made from a harmless virus that’s been altered to produce the surface spike protein of the pandemic-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus.The vaccine acts by priming the immune system to recognize and attack the coronavirus, stimulating a T-cell response. It uses the same technology as a shot Gilbert’s team previously developed for the related MERS coronavirus. That vaccine appeared to be safe in animal and early-stage human testing, giving confidence for the coronavirus version.“We’re doing safety testing,” Gilbert said, “but we’re not concerned.”Gilbert’s team has used the same technology for about 10 different vaccines, she said. The challenge that now arises is testing the vaccine even as virus infection rates vary.“It’s going to be complicated trying to determine vaccine efficacy when the virus transmission in different places is going up and then going down again,” she said. “The trial has to be set up in the right place at the right time and that’s very hard to predict. That’s why we’re planning to do multiple trials in multiple countries.”Another hurdle is money“We have some funding but we don’t have all of it yet,” she said. “You can’t just go and start manufacturing at large scale. You have to put a lot of things in place and that’s what we’re trying to do at the moment. It’s in the order of tens of millions of pounds.”The WHO is creating a forum for everyone developing Covid-19 vaccines to share their plans and initial findings, according to Gilbert.“Work is continuing at a very fast pace,” she told the Lancet medical journal, “and I am in no doubt that we will see an unprecedented spirit of collaboration and cooperation, convened by WHO, as we move towards a shared global goal of Covid-19 prevention through vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-vaccine-may-be-ready-for-mass-production-by-autumn-oxford-professor/story-yY96TJ95p1rwVBInbQMD7O.html
17-04-2020||World||Coronavirus could complicate US President Trump’s path to reelection||The coronavirus is poised to reshape the political map, pummeling battleground states and alarming Republicans who see early signs of an election that could be a referendum on President Donald Trump’s management of the crisis.The pandemic, which has killed more than 30,000 Americans and left millions out of work, has eviscerated Trump’s hope to run for reelection on a strong economy. A series of states he won in 2016 could tilt toward Democrats.In Florida, a Republican governor closely aligned with Trump has come under scrutiny for being slow to close the state. In Wisconsin, the Democratic victor in last week’s Supreme Court race captured 28 counties, up from the 12 that Hillary Clinton won four years ago. In Michigan, a Democratic governor has seen her approval rating rise against the backdrop of a fight with Trump. And in Arizona, low marks for Trump could be enough to turn the formerly Republican stronghold into a tossup.“It makes me wonder if there’s something brewing in the weaker elements of the Trump base,” said Paul Maslin, a Wisconsin-based Democratic pollster. “Is the pandemic fight the final straw that’s going to cause some of this small slice of votes he needs to win these states to back away?”Trump’s public approval rating has remained consistent nationally throughout his presidency, and some polls even suggested an uptick at the onset of the pandemic. And his unique brand of politics rooted in cultural grievances could once again overcome hurdles that would sink other presidents seeking reelection, especially if the pandemic wanes or the economy rebounds.But Trump’s campaign is concerned about losing support in several key swing states, particularly Florida and Wisconsin, according to five current and former campaign staffers who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about internal strategy. There are also growing worries about Arizona and Pennsylvania.There is no better example of the altered map confronting Trump than Michigan, which he captured in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes.The mounting deaths in heavily African American Detroit and the politically dynamic suburban counties have been the backdrop for the tiff between Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Trump. Though her handling of the virus outbreak has prompted some public protests, Whitmer’s poll numbers have gone up and her criticism of the federal response prompted Trump to obliquely dismiss the governor, telling virus task force members “Don’t call the woman in Michigan.”In a sign of enthusiasm, participation in Democrats’ March primary was up 32% over 2016 as the party rallied around its likely nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden. The Trump campaign already had a light footprint in Michigan — it does not have a single field office — and advisers privately concede it could be the toughest battleground state to hold.Many pollsters believe Wisconsin could be the tipping point this November for either candidate to reach the needed 270 electoral votes. The state has long been considered the Rust Belt prize Trump was likeliest to keep, but poignant images of mask-wearing voters lining up outside Milwaukee’s few open polling places last week signaled Democratic enthusiasm.“We are starting to see more evidence that suburban voters disapprove of the way Trump is handling the coronavirus pandemic,” said Democratic strategist Adrienne Elrod, who notes that counties outside Philadelphia and Phoenix “have a similar electorate to the suburban areas that delivered a huge win for Democrats in Wisconsin.”Although the state Supreme Court race received national attention, Republicans were quick to dismiss it since only Democrats held a competitive presidential primary, boosting that party’s turnout. Wisconsin’s spring Supreme Court contests have been a shaky predictor of presidential elections, which usually feature twice as many voters.“President Trump has been clear — through actions and words — that what matters most is the health and safety of every American. This crisis is hitting Americans — not Democrats or Republicans,” said Trump campaign spokeswoman Erin Perrine. “To try and politicize this crisis in terms of the election is ludicrous.”Although Arizona hasn’t yet seen a spike in infections, Biden’s promise of pragmatic, experienced management may play well in a state that has turned purple. A Biden victory there would build pressure on Trump to hold two of the trio of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.The pandemic has hamstrung the Trump campaign’s effort to build momentum. Though its digital outreach has ramped up, the campaign has been unable to wield its financial advantage over Biden and can’t hold its signature rallies to bolster enthusiasm and collect valuable voter data.“We can’t wait to get back out there and do things the old-fashioned way,” said Lara Trump, a senior campaign official and the president’s daughter-in-law.Employment has cratered in many of the states key to Trump’s reelection.The economy shed 22 million jobs in the past four weeks, according to requests for unemployment benefits. And while some of those jobs will return as the lockdown gets lifted, it’s unclear how quickly workers will be needed at hotels in Florida, auto plants in Michigan and stores and offices that fill Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.Both Michigan and Pennsylvania have lost more than 1 million jobs since the outbreak, which implies unemployment rates of more than 20% in both states, according to Labor Department figures. Unemployment filings suggest Florida employers have let go of roughly 6% of its jobs, but declines there could worsen as applicants have struggled to access unemployment benefits.Without Florida, Trump’s path to victory becomes nearly impossible. Its Trump-friendly governor, Ron DeSantis, took heat for allowing beaches to stay open despite the risk of spread to his state’s massive population of vulnerable senior citizens.“They thought they were going to be running for reelection with a very popular governor, but DeSantis has taken some real hits over his handling of this,” said Republican strategist Alex Conant, who worked for Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign. “The image of spring breakers spreading coronavirus is going to be replayed in October.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-could-complicate-us-president-trump-s-path-to-reelection/story-m4KXzllEGsEjIn399LrNII.html

It had earlier announced 21 charter flights from several cities.The 17 additional charter flights to London will be operated from Ahmedabad (on April 20, 22, 24 and 26), from Amritsar (on April 21, 23, 25 and 27), from Bangalore via Ahmedabad (on April 23), from Delhi (on April 21, 23, 25 and 27), from Goa (on April 20, 22 and 24) and from Mumbai (on 26 April).“People who are most vulnerable will be prioritised for seats on these flights which will bring the total number of chartered flights run by the UK government from India to 38,” said a statement from the British high commission.“Given the number of people who have already registered for a flight, the majority of seats are likely to be allocated to people who are already on waitlists…,” the statement added.The UK minister of state for South Asia, Lord Tariq Ahmad, said: “We know this is a difficult time for British travellers and there is great demand for these flights. This is a huge and logistically complex operation, and we are working tirelessly with the Indian government and state authorities to help more British travellers get home.” Jan Thompson, the acting high commissioner to India, said: “We are working around the clock to arrange additional flights from locations where we know large numbers are still stranded and are extremely grateful for the support we are receiving from the government of India and local authorities.”The 21 charter flights announced previously are operating during April 8-20 and are expected to help more than 5,000 British nationals return home.The charter flights are for UK travellers who normally reside in Britain and their direct dependants. A number of seats will be reserved for those deemed vulnerable.The charter flights are expected to cost between £537 and £591.India has so far facilitated the repatriation of some 35,000 nationals of 48 countries who were stranded in the country because of the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-to-operate-17-more-flights-for-stranded-brits-in-india/story-MekXDtvDwhTrAEMc1Q4CLN.html

There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.”Frictions between China and France came to light earlier this week when the Chinese ambassador was summoned by the foreign minister after his embassy posted on its website what French lawmakers called “fake news”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-says-naive-to-say-china-handled-covid-19-better-than-west-report/story-MpdBjHrFaSx5IcCuowXvJP.html

17-04-2020||World||‘Coronavirus under control in Germany’: Health minister||The coronavirus pandemic in Germany is “under control” thanks to measures imposed after an early surge in cases, Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Friday.Imposing restrictions to keep people home from mid-March had been successful, Spahn told reporters in Berlin, as the country prepares to ease the measures and ramp up production of protective masks.“The infection numbers have sunk significantly, especially the relative day-by-day increase. The outbreak is today again under control.”On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that smaller shops would open from next week and schools reopen to some pupils from May 4.But other elements of the wide-ranging restrictions will remain in effect, including a ban on gatherings of more than two people in public and on large public events.On Thursday, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for disease control released data showing each disease carrier in Germany was infecting fewer than one other person -- the person-to-person rate dropping to 0.7.The figures justified a first easing of the lockdown with a review after two or three weeks, Merkel said, while warning that there was “little margin for error” and that “caution should be the watchword, not over-confidence”.As Germany prepares to allow public life to resume, Spahn said the country would produce up to 50 million masks a week from August.Some 40 million would be surgical masks and 10 million would be FFP2 masks, which offer more protection.But so far Germany has not aped neighbouring Austria by introducing a nationwide requirement for people to wear masks in public, issuing only a “strong recommendation”.Defending the decision to hold off a mask requirement, Spahn said people had been “very responsible” so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-under-control-in-germany-health-minister/story-Ab1TTwgiPWCopSf9UQmqbP.html
17-04-2020||World||US space force is arming to jam Russian, Chinese satellites||The new US Space Force is building an arsenal of as many as 48 ground-based weapons over the next seven years designed to temporarily jam Russian or Chinese communications satellite signals in the opening hours of a conflict.The first system, made by L3Harris Technologies Inc., was declared operational last month after years of development, and the Space Force has taken delivery of 16 of them. The service is also developing a new system, known as Meadowland, that’s lighter-weight, capable of adding updated software and able to jam more frequencies.Since its formation last year as the sixth branch of the US military, attention has focused on the Space Force’s defensive duty in safeguarding US satellites and on organizational questions about its budget and its relationship with the Air Force. Less has been disclosed about its offensive role, which centers on Meadowland.“Nothing else we’re doing in Space Force is offensive in nature, where we are actually going after an adversary,” said Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Brogan, a unit head in the combat systems branch of the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, which is managing development and procurement.L3Harris, based in Melbourne, Florida, is already developing four Meadowland systems projected for delivery around October 2022. By this December, the Space Force plans to open a competition for 28 more, with funding starting in fiscal 2021 and systems projected for delivery from late 2023 to early 2027.As of now, Brogan said in an interview, the jamming systems are designed to interfere with communications satellites and not those for data relay or taking photos.Weaponizing SpaceUS defense officials long spoke against turning space into a battlefield, much less fielding weapons that could demolish targets and add more hazardous space debris.The Space Force said in a statement that “China and Russia have weaponized space with the intent to hold American space capabilities at risk,” and the U.S. has the inherent right of self-defense.Russia’s test launch on Wednesday of an anti-satellite missile is “further proof of Russia’s hypocritical advocacy of outer space arms control proposals designed to restrict the capabilities of the United States while clearly having no intention of halting their counterspace weapons programs,” the Space Force said in a separate statement.The new jamming system can be used early in a conflict and won’t create “space junk” because it emits energy designed to cause temporary, “reversible” interference, Brogan said.The Air Force said in a separate statement that the jamming can prevent an adversary’s “ability to accomplish command and control, early warning and propaganda” across “multiple frequency bands.”Advocates of preserving space as a weapons-free domain say the new U.S. jamming system risks escalation, even if it’s not designed to destroy satellites.“There are going to be those -- let’s call them ‘U.S. competitors’ -- who will find the development of any explicit counterspace system to be inflammatory and provocative, whether it is reversible or not,” said Victoria Samson, the Washington director of the Secure World Foundation, which publishes an annual overview of military space activities.“Competitors who have their space assets interfered with at times of crisis don’t know if/when it will stop; it is possible that they will have to assume that it’s irreversible and go from there,” she said. “Are we signaling that we are OK with officially targeting space assets?”China, RussiaAccording to the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, China and Russia rank behind the U.S. in the number of orbiting satellites. As of late 2016, Russia had about 40 communications satellites in orbit.“Over the next several years, Russia will prioritize the modernization of its existing communications, navigation, and earth observation systems, while continuing to rebuild its electronic intelligence and early warning system constellations,” according to the DIA.China is pursuing parallel programs for military and commercial communications satellites and owns and operates about 30 of those for civil, commercial, and military satellite communications, the DIA said last year. Beijing also operates a small number of dedicated military communications satellites.The new Meadowland system has two racks of equipment instead of the 14 on the one deployed last month, saving 10,000 square feet of storage space and making the systems more compact and easier to deploy, Brogan said.Unlike the current model, Meadowland will use more open architecture software for updates that allow for a “additional capability to go after more satellites, using more techniques as they are developed,” Brogan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-space-force-is-arming-to-jam-russian-chinese-satellites/story-0HOfrVnE8Crr3r0LHZH3NJ.html
17-04-2020||World||Chinese economy takes massive Covid-19 hit, shrinks first time in decades||China’s economy shrank by 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2020, government data showed on Friday, confirming the damage done to the second largest economy in the world by the coronavirus pandemic.China’s gross domestic product stood at 20.65 trillion yuan (about $ 2.91 trillion) in the first quarter of 2020, down 6.8 percent year on year, data from the national bureau of statistics (NBS) showed Friday.Reports said it was the first time that the Chinese economy had contracted since the Cultural Revolution, which ended in 1976.State media reports said the 6.8-percent contraction translated to an economic loss of about 1.44 trillion yuan ($203.4 billion), which is equivalent to the GDP of New Zealand.The coronavirus first emerged China late last year, forcing the government to opt for an extensive countrywide shutdown of factories and businesses to contain the spread of the pathogen.The Communist Party of China (CPC)-ruled government has restarted manufacturing across provinces but the raging pandemic has severely disrupted the supply chain in the first three months, impacting demand globally.The impact of the pandemic on China’s foreign trade is expected to show in the second quarter with demand for goods from China – the world’s manufacturing hub – expected to plummet across the world.The pandemic has infected more than 2 million globally and killed more than 130,000; China has reported more than 4000 deaths although new infections have dropped significantly from their peak in February.“A breakdown of the data showed output of the service sector, which accounted for nearly 60 percent of the total GDP, dropped by 5.2 percent, while primary industry and the secondary industry saw a decline of 3.2 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively,” official news agency, Xinhua, said in a report.Liu Xuezhi, an economist at the Bank of Communications, told the tabloid Global Times on Friday that though the March figures showed signs of easing, the rebound in March was also a bit “less than expected,” mainly because of the worsened pandemic situation globally.“If the global COVID-19 situation continues to intensify, in the worst-case scenario, China’s second-quarter GDP may contract again or only show a slight increase of 1 to 2 percent,” Liu said.“We expect (China’s) GDP growth to plunge in Q1 and stay negative in Q2; Beijing’s real stimulus package may be announced soon,” Nomura, a leading Japanese financial company, said.“However, unlike previous easing cycles, when most of the new credit went to finance spending on infrastructure, property and consumer durable goods, this time we expect most of the new credit to be used on financial relief to help enterprises, banks and households survive the COVID-19 crisis,” Nomura experts said in a note, quoted by Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-economy-takes-massive-covid-19-hit-shrinks-first-time-in-decades/story-7aXs8AyEjr0sgu3IOkjZIL.html

17-04-2020||World||US-Russian space crew lands in Kazakhstan amid Covid-19 pandemic||A US -Russian space crew landed safely Friday in the steppes of Kazakhstan, greeted with extra precautions amid the coronavirus pandemic.Following a stint on the International Space Station, NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan and Russian Oleg Skripochka touched down as scheduled at 11:16 a.m. (0516 GMT) Friday. Their Soyuz landing capsule landed under a striped orange-and-white parachute about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Dzhezkazgan in central Kazakhstan.Russian officials said they took stringent measures to protect the crew amid the pandemic. The recovery team and medical personnel assigned to help the crew out of the capsule and for post-flight checks had been under close medical observation for nearly a month, including tests for the coronavirus.The space crew smiled as they talked to medical experts wearing masks. Following a quick checkup, the crew will be flown by helicopters to Baikonur, from where Skripochka will be taken to Moscow, said Vyacheslav Rogozhnikov, a Russian medical official who oversaw the crew’s return.Morgan and Meir will have to be driven from Baikonur to Kyzyl-Orda, 300 kilometers (190 miles) away, to board a flight to the US — a strenuous journey made necessary by Kazakhstan’s quarantine measures.On Thursday, the Russian government coronavirus headquarters reported the first contagion at the Star City, which serves as the main hub for pre-flight training of U.S., Russian and other international crew members of the International Space Station. The Star City also has residential quarters for cosmonauts and support staff.Roscosmos Director Dmitry Rogozin said Wednesday that the Russian space corporation had 30 coronavirus cases.The crew returned to Earth exactly 50 years after the Apollo 13 astronauts splashed down in the Pacific after an oxygen tank explosion aborted the moon-landing mission.Morgan wrapped up a 272-day mission on his first flight into space. He conducted seven space walks, four of which were to improve and extend the life of the station’s Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, which looks for evidence of dark matter in the universe.Meir and Skripochka spent 205 days in space, with Meir carrying out the first three all-women spacewalks with her crewmate Christina Koch, who returned from space in February.Speaking from the orbiting outpost before the return to Earth, the crew said that coming back to the world drastically changed by the pandemic will be challenging. Morgan said the crew has tried to keep atop the coronavirus news, but added that it’s hard to comprehend what’s really going on.“It is quite surreal for us to see this whole situation unfolding on the planet below,” said Meir. “We can tell you that the Earth still looks just as stunning as always from up here, so it’s difficult to believe all the changes that have taken place since both of us have been up here.”A new crew comprising NASA’s Chris Cassidy and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner arrived at the station on April 9. They said before blastoff that they had been under a very strict quarantine for a month before the flight and were feeling good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-russian-space-crew-lands-in-kazakhstan-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-sjq1ZMRszLMUQx90u1MSUL.html
17-04-2020||World||China’s Covid-19 death toll crosses 4,600 after adding 1,290 new fatalities from virus-epicentre Wuhan||China has revised its official count of deaths from the coronavirus, adding some 1,290 deaths in Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged last December.The addition, reported by state media on Friday, brings the nationwide death toll to 4,636, the majority coming from Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The additional deaths were all counted in Wuhan and the late reporting of deaths are due to several reasons, said the report. The first is that some patients died at home without seeing a doctor or being tested for the virus as hospitals were overwhelmed during the epidemic’s peak.Secondly, there was late and incomplete reporting due to medical workers and institutions being occupied by treating patients during epidemic. Another factor was that designated hospitals to treat patients were expanded to institutions at the municipal and district level, including private hospitals, and not all were connected to and feeding timely information to the central epidemic network, Xinhua reported.Also read: China under mounting pressure over virus originsA similar revision up in death toll occurred in New York City a few days ago, adding over 3,700 people who died at home before being tested. Still, China’s move is likely to fuel speculation about the accuracy of its data, which has been questioned by US President Donald Trump. American intelligence officials have concluded that China concealed the extent of its outbreak and under-reported number of cases and deaths.Last month, pictures of thousands of ash urns being ferried to funeral homes in Wuhan circulated on Chinese social media platforms, raising concern that the real number of deaths in the city where the virus first emerged is higher than officially acknowledged.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage China has refuted charges that it intentionally under-reported its numbers, saying that it shares what information it has transparently. But its repeated revisions of data throughout the crisis -- including a one-day addition of nearly 15,000 cases diagnosed through a different clinical method in February -- has fueled mistrust.While the revision marks a substantial surge, China’s new official death toll is still low compared to the U.S. where reported deaths have climbed past 30,000. In Italy and Spain, deaths number around 20,000 in each country.Also read: Your risk of getting sick from Covid-19 may lie in your genes||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-4-600-after-adding-1-290-new-fatalities-from-virus-epicentre-wuhan/story-oW3AMhoO6vZlfkcb2Rr8dM.html
17-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Trump announces federal guidelines for reopening US economy||President Donald Trump on Thursday announced federal guidelines for reopening the United States in a “science-based” phased manner but left it wholly to governors to determine the timeline and extent of the easing of restrictions in their states hacking out of a spiraling showdown.“We’re starting our life again. We’re starting rejuvenation of our economy again in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion,” Trump told reporters at the daily briefing of the White House task force on coronavirus.The reopening announcement came amidst growing optimism among public health officials and experts that the United States is past the peak in reported new cases and is seeing flattening of the curve on other important indices such as hospitalization even as cases and fatalities continued to grown: the number of confirmed cases went up to 667,801 and deaths to 32,917.Trump’s announcement of the new guidelines were more recommendations than rules to be followed. Unlike the lockdown in India that was ordered by the Central government and enforced by states without any discretion in the extent of the rollout and timeline, US restrictions were guidelines that were recommended by the federal government and were enforced by states partially or in full depending on their determination of the severity of the outbreak.States will announce their own reopening plans as New York did later Thursday. But there were no indications of timelines or specifics states that will follow the guidelines.Trump said there are 29 states (of the total of 50) that can start soon and some of whom can get on to it right away. The White House task force has spoken of nine states that have reported less than 1,000 coronavirus cases each, with less than 30 new cases a day. But no specifics were forthcoming once again.The guidelines are split into three phases that are recommended to kick off only after a downward slide in cases and are contingent on protecting the most vulnerable populations, the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-trump-announces-federal-guidelines-for-reopening-us-economy/story-0qyicdJ1tR4nafR7Lsqt2J.html
17-04-2020||World||This country says it’s on course to wipe out Covid-19||When historians assess how countries approached the coronavirus pandemic, New Zealand is sure to stand out.The South Pacific nation is alone among its western peers in explicitly attempting to eradicate the virus. It adopted one of the strictest lockdowns in the world before a single death was reported, and has isolated infections to keep the disease from spreading out of control.The early signs are promising. The rate of new infections has dwindled to the lowest in weeks, and the death toll -- at 11 -- is one of the lowest among developed nations. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will decide on Monday whether to start easing a quarantine that requires everyone but essential workers to stay at home.“We have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved -- elimination of the virus,” Ardern told reporters Thursday in Wellington, as she cautioned against relaxing restrictions too quickly.The island nation’s lofty goal of elimination is not without critics, who say it’s unrealistic and comes at a devastating economic cost. Even if New Zealand succeeds, its borders will have to remain closed to much of the world for a considerable period to keep the virus out. That will decimate the tourism industry, its largest source of foreign exchange earnings.Central to New Zealand’s approach is a scientific fact that most western leaders appear to have ignored, according to Michael Baker, a professor at the University of Otago’s Department of Public Health in Wellington who sits on the government’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Group. That is that the virus usually has an incubation period of five to six days, twice as long as influenza.“That means that when someone gets sick, if you isolate them quickly and round up their contacts, you can quarantine those people and interrupt that chain of transmission,” said Baker. “With influenza you can’t really do that because by the time you’ve found their contacts it’s too late, they’ve infected other people.”And yet most countries treated Covid-19 as if it were influenza, he said, trying to slow its advance rather than eradicate it. Nations including the U.K. and the U.S. opted for such mitigation and suppression efforts after they found themselves overwhelmed by cases.Changing TacticsNew Zealand’s initial response took that approach too. In the early stages of the outbreak, Ardern spoke of “flattening the curve” of the virus’s spread to ensure the health system could cope.That all changed on March 23, when she announced a four-week nationwide lockdown would commence two days later, saying modeling showed that without the measures “tens of thousands of New Zealanders could die.”Industries were shuttered, schools were closed, and the only shops allowed to stay open were supermarkets, some corner stores and pharmacies. At that stage, New Zealand had only 102 cases and no deaths. Most countries resorted to such measures only after fatalities soared. When the U.K. announced its lockdown, also on March 23, it had 6,650 Covid-19 cases and 335 people had already died.Exit StrategyThe theory is that imposing tough restrictions early halts the spread of the pathogen and eventually allows an exit strategy to crystallize. The economic hit may be worse upfront, but activity can resume sooner. The alternatives of mitigation or suppression may require restrictions to stay in place for many months, prolonging the economic pain.New Zealand’s strategy, which requires extensive testing and contact-tracing capabilities, is supported by the statistics. While total cases have risen to 1,409, it has avoided the exponential growth seen in Europe and the U.S. Just eight new infections were reported Friday, the lowest number in four weeks.The island nation, with 5 million residents, has a similar population to Ireland, which has seen more than 13,000 infections and almost 500 deaths. And while New Zealand’s 11 fatalities compare with 10 in Singapore, that Southeast Asian country is now struggling with a wave of infections from dormitories housing low-wage foreign workers.A comparison with neighboring Australia is more complicated. Australia has far more cases, at 6,468, and deaths have climbed to 63. But the infection rate comes out to 254 per million people, less than New Zealand’s 292 per million.Australia’s ApproachAustralia’s results have come despite less stringent restrictions. It has allowed more industries to continue operating, such as construction, and consumers can still get a haircut or buy a takeaway meal, keeping many workers on lower incomes employed.“Australia is doing better than New Zealand without going to that extreme,” said Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician at Canberra Hospital who advises the Australian government.Collignon questions whether New Zealand’s eradication strategy is realistic.“The reality is this virus is everywhere, it’s all around the world,” he said. “So even if you’re successful for a short period of time, how long do you do this for? Six months? Two years? Invariably, you’re going to get the virus re-introduced.”One concern is the phenomenon of asymptomatic transmission. The possibility that people can pass along the disease even though they show no symptoms underscores the challenge of containing the pandemic.‘Nirvana’ ScenarioBrendan Murphy, Australia’s chief medical officer, told a New Zealand parliamentary committee April 14 that eradicating the virus is a “nirvana” scenario.“We are pursuing a very aggressive suppression strategy,” he said. “Obviously we would like to achieve elimination (but) we’re pretty doubtful that could be maintained for the long-term given the incredible border measures you would need to have.”For Baker, there are benefits in trying to eliminate the virus, as well as evidence it can be done -- China, for example, appears to have succeeded in stopping the Wuhan epidemic and preventing wider transmission within its borders.He believes more countries, including Australia, could yet adopt elimination strategies and eventually form an “eastern hemisphere bloc” with nations like China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea within which travel will be possible.“Maybe it’s a bit optimistic, but at least we have an exit strategy and a plan,” Baker said. “That seems a lot more appealing than the mess that Europe and North America are going to be in for the foreseeable future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-country-says-it-s-on-course-to-wipe-out-covid-19/story-kmqT1wxUTKlZVcaHTUzDHI.html
17-04-2020||World||Prince Harry and Meghan hand out meals in Los Angeles||Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan handed out meals to sick people in Los Angeles, in their first known public activity since moving to California at the start of the state’s coronavirus lockdown.The pair, who have formally stepped down as senior members of the British royal family, first volunteered with Project Angel Food on Sunday, delivering food to people living with chronic illnesses.“They were here Easter Sunday, and then they surprised us on Wednesday,” said communications manager Anne-Marie Williams.“They handed out to 20 of our clients, and they rocked their worlds.”The Duke and Duchess of Sussex relocated to California last month after announcing in January that they intended to quit royal life and “work to become financially independent.”They have kept a low profile, with even their location unknown amid unconfirmed reports that the pair are living in Malibu.It emerged last week that they are planning to launch a wide-ranging non-profit organization in the United States named Archewell, focusing on mental health, education and wellbeing.They said they wanted “to do something of meaning, to do something that matters,” but have delayed releasing full details because of the pandemic and will make an announcement “when the time is right.”Los Angeles nonprofit Project Angel Food, which delivers medically tailored food to chronically ill people, appears to be the first charity publicly supported by the pair since their secretive move.“We kept the conversation very casual, all I know is that they’re very intent on being of service, and that they want to see Los Angeles through the lens of Project Angel Food and through the lens of philanthropy,” Richard Ayoub, the organization’s CEO, told AFP.The pair learnt of the charity through Meghan’s mother, who lives in Los Angeles and had heard that the organization needed extra help during the pandemic.Upon their departure from the frontline of the British monarchy, the couple agreed to relinquish their “Royal Highness” titles.“They’re very down to earth people -- very sweet and genuine and don’t stand on ceremony at all. They insisted we call them Harry and Meghan,” said Ayoub.Many of Project Angel Food’s clients are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus, and Ayoub said he hoped the couple’s attention would help drive donations to www.angelfood.org/covid19.He added: “I’m keeping my fingers crossed, hoping they’ll come back. With all this publicity, we don’t know. But we’re hoping that they do come back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-harry-and-meghan-hand-out-meals-in-los-angeles/story-MkfVozXlNXAtyS88yE17qI.html
17-04-2020||World||After WHO row, US is probing China lab link||US President Donald Trump’s administration is urging an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, saying that the US doesn’t rule out that it came from a laboratory researching bats in Wuhan. China’s foreign ministry hit back saying the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there is no evidence that the coronavirus was made in a lab.The fresh row erupted a day after Trump announced a hold on US funding for the WHO as it had failed in its duties, after which China said it would make up for the lack of American financing to the global health body.Trump, asked about the laboratory theory on Wednesday, said that “more and more, we’re hearing the story” and that the US was “doing a very thorough investigation”. Trump has repeatedly blamed China and the WHO.Beijing has said that the virus was likely transmitted to humans late last year at a Wuhan “wet market” that butchered exotic animals .But The Washington Post and Fox News quoted anonymous sources who voiced concern that SARS-CoV-2 may have come accidentally from a sensitive bioresearch centre in the metropolis.“We’re doing a full investigation of everything we can to learn how it is the case that this virus got away, got out into the world and now has created so much tragedy, so much death, here in the United States and all around the world,” US secretary of state Mike Pompeo told Fox News.He did not reject the reports and said that the US knew that the Wuhan laboratory “contained highly contagious materials”.“In countries that are open and transparent, they have the ability to control and keep them safe and they allow outside observers in to make sure all the processes and procedures are right,” Pompeo said. “I only wish that had happened in this place.”The origin of the virus is a popular topic on social media, with conspiracy theorists suggesting it is a Chinese bioweapon and a Chinese official saying US troops may have brought it to Wuhan.Neither Fox News nor The Washington Post said the virus was spread deliberately or that the laboratory was definitively determined as the source.A column by Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin said that US embassy officials visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology two years before the pandemic and warned of inadequate safety at the laboratory.Fox News said that “patient zero” may have been infected by a bat at the laboratory and gone into the population in Wuhan.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian insisted that the WHO’s officials “have said multiple times there is no evidence the new coronavirus was created in a laboratory”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-who-row-us-is-probing-china-lab-link/story-uRNpsa9EHdMR8idPntad6J.html

17-04-2020||World||‘Some states could reopen literally tomorrow’: Donald Trump gives 3-phase plan to governors||President Donald Trump gave governors a road map Thursday for recovering from the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic, laying out “a phased and deliberate approach” to restoring normal activity in places that have strong testing and are seeing a decrease in Covid-19 cases.“We’re starting our life again,” Trump said during his daily press briefing. “We’re starting rejuvenation of our economy again.”He added, “This is a gradual process.”Follow latest coronavirus updates here The new guidelines are aimed at easing restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, while holding the line in harder-hit locations. They make clear that the return to normalcy will be a far longer process than Trump initially envisioned, with federal officials warning that some social distancing measures may need to remain in place through the end of the year to prevent a new outbreak. And they largely reinforce plans already in the works by governors, who have primary responsibility for public health in their states.“You’re going to call your own shots,” Trump told the governors Thursday afternoon in a conference call, according to an audio recording obtained by The Associated Press. “We’re going to be standing alongside of you.”Places with declining infections and strong testing would begin a three-phase gradual reopening of businesses and schools.In phase one, for instance, the plan recommends strict social distancing for all people in public. Gatherings larger than 10 people are to be avoided and nonessential travel is discouraged.In phase two, people are encouraged to maximize social distancing and limit gatherings to no more than 50 people unless precautionary measures are taken. Travel could resume.Phase three envisions a return to normalcy for most Americans, with a focus on identification and isolation of any new infections.Trump said recent trends in some states were so positive that they could almost immediately begin taking the steps laid out in phase one.“They will be able to go literally tomorrow,” Trump said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The guidelines recommend that states pass checkpoints that look at new cases, testing and surveillance data over the prior 14 days before advancing from one phase to another.Governors of both parties made clear they will move at their own pace.Delaware Gov. John Carney, a Democrat, said the guidelines “seem to make sense.”“We’re days, maybe weeks away from the starting line and then you have to have 14 days of declining cases, of declining symptoms and hospital capacity that exists in case you have a rebound,” he said.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Trump ally, cautiously floated the idea of reopening parts of the state, but said testing capacity and contact tracing would need to be considerably ramped up before restrictions could be safely lifted.“All would be forgotten very quickly if we moved into a stage quicker than we should, and then we got into a situation where we had people dying like flies,” Justice told reporters.At the earliest, the guidelines suggest, some parts of the country could see a resumption in normal commerce and social gatherings after a month of evaluating whether easing up on restrictions has led to a resurgence in virus cases. In other parts of the country, or if virus cases pick up, it could be substantially longer.In briefing governors on the plan, Trump said they were going to be responsible for deciding when it is safe to lift restrictions in their states. Just days before, he had drawn swift pushback for claiming he had absolute authority to determine how and when states reopen.“We have a very large number of states that want to get going and they’re in very good shape,” Trump said. “That’s good with us, frankly.”The guidelines also include general recommendations to businesses as they plan for potential reopenings, suggesting temperature-taking, rapid Covid-19 testing and widespread disinfection efforts in workplaces.Those most susceptible to the respiratory disease are advised to remain sheltered in place until their area enters the final phase — and even then are encouraged to take precautions to avoid close contact with other people.Governors, for their part, have been moving ahead with their own plans for how to safely revive normal activity. Seven Midwestern governors announced Thursday they will coordinate on reopening their economies. Similar pacts were announced earlier in the week in the West and Northeast.Two in three Americans expressed concerns that restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus would be eased too quickly, according to a Pew Research Center survey released Thursday. More than 30,000 people in the United States have died from the virus.Trump also held conference calls Thursday with lawmakers he named to a new congressional advisory task force on reviving the economy. The economic costs were clear in new federal data showing that at least 22 million Americans have been thrown out of work in the last month. But the legislators repeatedly urged the president not to sacrifice public health by moving too quickly.“My highest priority on this task force will be to ensure the federal government’s efforts to reopen our economy are bipartisan, data-driven, and based on the expertise of public health professionals,” said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.The federal government envisions a gradual recovery from the virus, in which disruptive mitigation measures may be needed in some places at least until a vaccine is available — a milestone unlikely to be reached until sometime next year.“It’s not going to immediately be a situation where we have stadiums full of people,” said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson on Thursday. “We’re Americans. We will adapt,” he added.Trump on Thursday claimed the US has “built the most advanced and robust testing anywhere in the world.” But even people close to him warned more would be necessary.“We are struggling with testing at a large scale,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told ABC’s “The View.” “You really can’t go back to work until we have more tests.”There was also concern that the White House was taking too rosy a view on trends in the US.“I would not declare a peak almost anywhere in the US. yet,” said Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard epidemiology professor who is director of the university’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. He recommended “working to enhance surveillance and testing so if we do hit a peak, it will be possible to identify it with greater certainty.”But some of Trump’s conservative allies, like economist Stephen Moore, have encouraged him to act swiftly, warning of “a mini Great Depression if we keep the economy shut down.”“That is a catastrophic outcome for our country. Period,” Moore said he advised the president.A big testing ground for Trump’s road map could be Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has stuck close to federal guidance throughout the crisis, will lay out his reopening plan Friday. Abbott has said the process will be gradual, but he is facing pressure from conservative lawmakers to get Texas back to work.The White House proposal presented Thursday is different from what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended last week, according to a draft of the recommendation obtained by The Associated Press. The CDC talked about using more specific criteria and in many cases looking for improvement over longer periods of time before easing restrictions in high-transmission areas. Examples include wanting to see sustained reductions over 30 days in positive tests for coronavirus, and sustained reductions over 15 days in numbers of coronavirus deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-states-could-reopen-literally-tomorrow-donald-gives-trump-s-3-phase-plan-to-governors/story-QTZn6eDp8eV12uoFPWMd8M.html

There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.” The United States and Britain took a tougher line on China, where the coronavirus outbreak emerged in December.“We’ll have to ask the hard questions about how it came about and how it couldn’t have been stopped earlier,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said at a press conference Friday when asked about future relations with Beijing.Raab is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson who is recovering from Covid-19.US President Donald Trump’s administration is investigating the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, saying it does not rule out that it came from a laboratory researching bats in Wuhan, China.Chinese scientists have said the virus, which has killed more than 140,000 people worldwide, was likely transmitted to humans late last year at a Wuhan “wet market” that slaughtered exotic animals -- a longtime focus of concern for public health experts.But The Washington Post and Fox News both quoted anonymous sources who voiced concern that the virus may have come -- accidentally -- from a sensitive bioresearch centre in the city.Trump, asked about the laboratory theory at a news conference on Wednesday, said that “more and more, we’re hearing the story” and that the United States was “doing a very thorough investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-says-things-happened-we-don-t-know-about-in-china-covid-19-handling/story-2BFIXyuoluhtVWOlKEb7cP.html

This is in addition to the USD 6 billion bailout package that Islamabad signed with the IMF in July last year to stave off a balance of payment crisis.“The outbreak of Covid-19 is having a significant impact on the Pakistani economy,” said Geoffrey Okamoto, the IMF’s First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair.The domestic containment measures coupled with the global downturn are severely affecting growth and straining external financing which has created an urgent balance of payments need, he said.“As the crisis abates, the authorities’ renewed commitment to the reforms in the existing Extended Fund Facility -- in particular those related to fiscal consolidation strategy, energy sector, governance, and remaining AML/CFT deficiencies -- will be crucial to entrench resilience, boost Pakistan’s growth potential, and deliver broad based benefits for all Pakistanis,” Okamoto said.Expeditious donor support is needed to close the remaining balance of payments gap and ease the adjustment burden, he added.Okamoto said that in response to the crisis, the government of Pakistan has taken swift action to halt the community spread of the virus and introduced an economic stimulus package aimed at accommodating the spending needed to tackle the health emergency and supporting economic activity.“Crucially, the authorities are increasing public health spending and strengthening social safety net programs to provide immediate relief to the most vulnerable,” he said.“Similarly, the State Bank of Pakistan has adopted a timely set of measures, including a lowering of the policy rate and new refinancing facilities, to support liquidity and credit conditions and safeguard financial stability. In this context, the authorities’ policies should be targeted and temporary,” Okamoto said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-imf-approves-nearly-1-4-billion-to-pakistan-as-financial-aid/story-29ZloyozId3nlJu4AckLRN.html

Ministers and experts said lifting the lockdown or a return to normalcy would not be feasible until the mass availability of a vaccine for the virus.Several projects across the globe are at various stages of developing a vaccine for the coronavirus, with one in the University of Oxford promising that it could be available by September. Raab said, “Now is not the moment to give the coronavirus a second chance… We still don’t have infection rates down as much as we need to. Any change to social distancing measures now would risk a significant increase in infections.”Health minister Nadine Dorries said, “There is only one way we can exit a full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine. Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a balance between the health of the nation and our economy.”Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, who is advising the government, said some level of social distancing would need to be retained, until a vaccine is available, calling for an emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing. He called for more action at the official level, noting that more preparation had been done for Brexit than to deal with the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-remain-locked-down-for-at-least-3-more-weeks/story-IsY7ivqwictqO0WU6dkARJ.html

Nearly 22 million people have now been left jobless by the four weeks of mitigation efforts in place to combat the outbreak.“The battle continues,” Trump said at a briefing of the White House task force on coronavirus. “Data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases.”The US death toll went up by 2,494 in the last 24 hours, with the total number of fatalities nearing 33,000 and countrywide cases crossing 654,000.Meanwhile, New York governor Andrew Cuomo extended the state’s shutdown order on Thursday until May 15, citing data showing conditions were improving but insisting on the need to maintain vigilance.“I would like to see that infection rate get down even more,” Cuomo said at his daily briefing, reporting that 606 more people had died in the US Covid-19 epicentre.In a hopeful sign, Cuomo said New York state - where at least 11,586 people have died from Covid-19 and well over half a million have tested positive, this was the lowest daily toll in 10 days. “I don’t want to project beyond that period,” he said. “One month is a long time.”The announcement came on the eve of the implementation of a directive forcing New Yorkers to wear face coverings in public places where they cannot stay six feet apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-upbeat-despite-2-494-deaths-in-us-in-a-day/story-yV0GblckVyYzaRcB3gMOzL.html

17-04-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine likely by September: Oxford expert||As nearly 30 projects across the globe strive to produce a vaccine for Covid-19 soon, Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, believes that it could be available by September, calling for large-scale production facilities to be in place soon.Gilbert, who reiterated the projected availability by September on Monday, said clinical trials at the university would start “quite soon”. It is important to set in motion production processes so that it can be made available widely soon, she added.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We need to start manufacturing large amounts of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for companies to start manufacturing a new vaccine before they really know for certain it works”, she told BBC Radio on Monday morning.“No-one wants to be in a position where you have a vaccine which you have shown does work and then not have any of the vaccine to use. The sooner we start the quicker we’re going to get to the billion dose scale. That probably won’t be this year but if we don’t start we’re not going to get there next year either,” she added.The university said researchers are working “at an unprecedented rate” to make the vaccine available, pushing ahead with the process to screen 510 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 to test a new one called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The trial has been approved by UK regulators and ethical reviewers.Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, said: “The Oxford team had exceptional experience of a rapid vaccine response, such as to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. This is an even greater challenge”.“Vaccines are being designed from scratch and progressed at an unprecedented rate. The upcoming trial will be critical for assessing the feasibility of vaccination against COVID-19 and could lead to early deployment.”Gilbert told The Times last week that she is “80%” confident of its success, “based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine”. However, many industry experts believe the vaccine could take as long as 18 months to be developed and distributed globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-likely-by-september-oxford-expert/story-VlYRiSsSgyb7m2dmMm7WaI.html
