These drugs should be used only under the supervision of a physician,” Canada’s public health agency said in a note posted Saturday on its website.“Health Canada is concerned that some people may be directly buying and using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat COVID-19,” it said, noting they can cause “serious heart rhythm problems.”The European Medicines Agency on Thursday issued a similar warning about the drugs, whose promise as a coronavirus treatment has been touted by US President Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-have-serious-side-effects-canada-warns-hydroxychloroquine-use-against-covid-19/story-PI9kobMMhAP4ZI6eww7JKK.html

They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!,” he wrote on twitter.It was no immediately clear if he will not hold these briefings at all, or lead them as he has been for weeks.The president’s aides and allies have for some time felt that these briefings in which he has torn into reporters and political rivals and touted an untested treatment as a “game-changer” were being counterproductive. And Republicans fear increasingly that his handling of the crisis could cost them dearly in the November elections, according to news reports.Questions have continued to be raised about the administration’s response and failure to prepare for the epidemic that had till Sunday morning claimed 53,934 lives, up by 1,806 in the last 24 hours, and infected 939,249 people, with 32,796 new cases. The United States has suffered the most from this pandemic.As Trump used the briefings to update the country on the state of the epidemic and measures and guidelines in place to combat it he was also seen by critics as turning them into a version of his political rallies which he could not hold because of the social distancing guidelines anymore.And, in which he often strayed into questionable territory, such as his robust endorsement of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which is proving to be more harmful than beneficial, according to a growing number of studies, and his suggestion last Thursday to try disinfectants.Trump has said he said it as a “sarcastic question”.Public health officials and experts condemned it and even his own top officials were horrified. “I certainly wouldn’t recommend the internal ingestion of a disinfectant,” Food and Drug Administration commissioner Stephen Hahn, who is also a member of the White House task force., told CNN.But some people, scared and concerned, did not heed the warning. City officials in New York reported receiving an unusually high number of calls from people who feared having ingested disinfectants in the 18 hours after Trump’s remarks, according to reports in US media.The Poison Control Center, a department of the New York city’s health department managed a total of 30 cases of possible exposure to disinfectants between 9 p.m. Thursday and 3 p.m. Friday, a spokesman said told the Daily News, a local news publication.Nine were exposed to Lysol, 10 to bleach and 11 about household cleaners in general, according to the spokesman. No one died or required hospitalization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hit-by-disinfectant-blowback-donald-trump-skips-daily-briefing/story-INBhkkSGohNi3AKIoFHkrO.html

The vast majority of the news cases are work permit holders residing in dormitories for foreign workers, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its preliminary release of figures.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage Foreign workers’ dormitories have been locked down as the government struggles to curb the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak. Fifteen of the new cases confirmed on Sunday are Singaporeans or permanent residents being foreigners. The total number of coronavirus cases is 13,624 as of Sunday noon. “We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight,” the ministry said. Meanwhile, five weeks from now, if the number of daily Covid-19 cases in the community falls to single digits and the situation in the foreign worker dormitories improves, “circuit breaker” measures in Singapore may ease gradually, reported Channel News Asia, citing experts. Key indicators of whether Singapore is in a position to consider such a move include the number of new community cases falling to single digits per day and a “very clear decline” in new cases in the dormitories, said Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health dean Teo Yik Ying. Besides a fall in the total number of cases, the number of unlinked cases should go down to near zero, added Professor Paul Tambyah of the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore. Another indicator of community transmission of the coronavirus would be the numbers from the Health Ministry’s surveillance programmes. Such random testing of flu-like illnesses in the community aims to pick up cases that otherwise would not have not been detected. “The key is to look at the sentinel surveillance data – from the influenza-like illness surveillance done in polyclinics and general practitioner clinics – to see how much coronavirus is circulating in the community, as well as pneumonia surveillance in hospitals,” said Prof Tambyah. Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Thursday the sentinel programme is an example of how authorities are trying to “pre-empt the situation going forward”. “For example at this point in time, while the numbers are coming down, we are also making sure that we have background sentinel checks to make sure that we are not caught blindsided by some other hidden cases in the community,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-cases-cross-3-000-mark-in-singapore-foreign-workers-worst-affected/story-HYFLOSHeTEOfBzCbEWS4DL.html
26-04-2020||World||Covid-recovered PM Boris Johnson to resume work from Monday, says ‘raring to go’||Recovered after being stricken by coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepared to lead the government response to the pandemic challenge again from Monday, as pressure grew from various quarters to announce steps to ease the lockdown.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab told Sunday television that a vaccine against the virus is “not likely to come to fruition this year”. Human trials for a vaccine have begun in Oxford, with experts hoping for positive results by September, but others have tempered expectations.Downing Street said Johnson, who has been recuperating in a country retreat after leaving hospital, will resume duty on Monday, at a time when a new opinion poll suggested dwindling public trust in his government’s ability to deal with the pandemic.According to Raab, who is deputising for Johnson, the prime minister is ‘raring to go’.Johnson, who studied Classics at Oxford, is reported to have quoted iconic Roman statesman Cicero’s words to his aides: ‘Salus populi suprema lex esto’ (The health of the people should be the supreme law), which has been interpreted as his reluctance to ease the lockdown.Raab said without the lockdown the death toll would have been worse than the over 20,000 figure as of Saturday, adding that social distancing measures would be in place at least “for some time”. He refused to set a timetable when the lockdown would be eased.Pressure on easing the lockdown grew after the governments in Scotland and Wales set out conditions needed before a review could be held. Raab has previously set a five-point test before easing the curbs could be considered.The test includes: protecting the National Health Service’s ability to cope; a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates; reliable data showing the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels; the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand; and that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-recovered-pm-boris-johnson-to-resume-work-from-monday-says-raring-to-go/story-bCDUj2umvX4PQfjhQZUYPN.html
26-04-2020||World||Clock is ticking, as Covid-19 puts Brexit on back-burner||The United Kingdom and the European Union were supposed to be at an advanced stage of trade talks now, but the coronavirus pandemic has pushed Brexit into the background, with latest talks by video-link on Friday described as ‘disappointing’.The UK symbolically left the EU in January and entered into a ‘transition’ phase until December 31, by when both sides are expected to finalise post-Brexit trade and other arrangements. Until the date, the UK remains a full member of the EU.The key aspect is whether the Boris Johnson government will ask for an extension of the December 31 deadline, which it has so far insisted will not do. As EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said after the Friday talks, “the clock is ticking”.Major areas of disagreement remain, particularly on the issue of justice (EU wants the UK to stay under jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice), trade (goods and services), fisheries and a level playing field (the UK’s access to the EU single market after December 31).Barnier said genuine progress and a decision on the deadline’s extension needed to be made by June. Two rounds of technical talks are scheduled in May but without political involvement, the impasse is unlikely to be resolved.Barnier said: “The UK did not wish to commit seriously on a number of fundamental points…The UK cannot refuse to extend transition and at the same time slow down discussions on important areas…the clock is ticking”.In London, a government spokesperson said: “We do not recognise the suggestion that we have not engaged seriously with the EU in any area...We now need to move forward in a constructive fashion. The UK remains committed to a deal with a Free Trade Agreement at its core”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clock-is-ticking-as-covid-19-puts-brexit-on-back-burner/story-SyRl8LF9784uT1ndoqqASK.html
26-04-2020||World||First pandemic epicentre Wuhan discharges its last Covid patient from hospital||The central Chinese city of Wuhan, the first Covid-19 pandemic epicentre where the virus emerged late last year, has no remaining cases in hospitals, China announced Sunday.The novel coronavirus is believed to have originated in a wet seafood and meat market in Wuhan before spreading across China and then globally.Early cases of Covid-19 were discovered among Wuhan residents in December.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageMore than 2.8 million people have since been sickened by the rapidly spreading virus and nearly 200000 have died globally.“The latest news is that by April 26, the number of new coronavirus patients in Wuhan was at zero, thanks to the joint efforts of Wuhan and medical staff from around the country,” national health commission (NHC) spokesperson Mi Feng said at a briefing in Beijing on Sunday.The last patient in serious condition in Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, was cured on Friday, reducing the number of these patients in the city to zero, Mi said.Wuhan, however, recorded 20 new silent carriers of the virus on Friday, with 535 suspected patients under medical observation.The city of around 11 million people was put under a total lockdown for 76 days starting January 23 but still saw the highest number of cases and fatalities in China.According to the Chinese government’s revised estimates released earlier this month, the total confirmed infections in the city were 50,333 while there were 1290 more deaths, pushing the total number of fatalities to 3,869.The focus in China now is on imported cases.The NHC authorities said Sunday that it received reports of 11 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland Saturday, of which five were imported.The other six new cases were domestically transmitted, the NHC said in its daily report, noting that five cases were reported in Heilongjiang province in northeastern China and one in the southern province of Guangdong.No deaths nor suspected cases were reported Saturday on the mainland.The health authorities are also focusing on Beijing, which now has the only high-risk zone for Covid-19 in the country.On Sunday, the Beijing government made public new regulations aimed at better public hygiene, banning “uncivilised” behaviour of citizens.The rules include the banning of “uncivilised” behavior such as not covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.The regulations include a renewed emphasis on “dressing neatly” and not going shirtless in public, in a reference to the so-called “Beijing bikini” practice where men roll T-shirts and shirts up to expose their stomachs in summer.Beijing already discourages a range of “uncivilized” behaviours including public spitting, littering, walking dogs unleashed, throwing things from high buildings, public defecation and smoking in places where it is prohibited.“But the latest rules -- passed on Friday -- outline new specific punishments.Fines for littering, spitting and defecation in public were upped to a maximum of 200 yuan ($28), from a previous upper limit of 50 yuan,” news ageny, AFP said in a report Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-pandemic-epicentre-wuhan-discharges-its-last-covid-patient-from-hospital/story-xRNgzwDzdbdhIW7K3X87lO.html
26-04-2020||World||US calls on Afghans to set aside disputes, focus on coronavirus pandemic||The US peace envoy to Afghanistan on Sunday called on the country’s feuding leaders to set their differences aside to combat the coronavirus pandemic and advance a stalled peace agreement signed with the Taliban earlier this year.“The well-being of the Afghan people and the country itself depend on all parties devoting their full energies to fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, the shared enemy of all,” Zalmay Khalilzad tweeted early Sunday.He said Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah, who each declared himself the victor in September’s election, should “put the interest of the country ahead of their own” during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began last week.He urged the government and the Taliban to carry out a prisoner exchange that was part of the US-Taliban peace agreement signed in February. The agreement had called for the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 government personnel held by the insurgents.To date, Ghani has released 550 detainees based on age, vulnerability to the virus and time served. The Taliban have not said if those are among the prisoners referred to in the agreement. The Taliban have freed 60 prisoners.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said in a statement Sunday that the insurgent group was living up to its side of the agreement, and that it was willing to negotiate a countrywide cease-fire in intra-Afghan talks. Those negotiations were supposed to have begun within 10 days of the Feb. 29 deal but are still on hold because of the political bickering in Kabul.The Taliban are continuing to attack security outposts, even as the US and NATO proceed with a full troop withdrawal that is set to be completed next year.The Taliban have carried out 2,804 attacks since the agreement was signed, Jawed Faisal, spokesman for the National Security Adviser’s office, said Saturday. However, the Taliban have not attacked U.S. or NATO troops, who say they will continue to aid Afghan forces.Afghanistan has meanwhile reported 1,463 infections and 47 deaths from the new coronavirus.The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying health problems.Afghanistan’s health care system has been heavily degraded by decades of war and would be ill-equipped to contain a major outbreak. Testing has been sporadic, in part because of local stigma surrounding the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-on-afghans-to-set-aside-disputes-focus-on-coronavirus-pandemic/story-uEXnKM8iWSISXrpDWLYvRO.html

Bangladesh has reported nearly 5,000 COVID-19 cases and 140 deaths due to the disease. “As many as 31 members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) ashram located in Swamibag area have tested positive for the novel coronavirus,” Gendaria police station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Saju Miah was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune.  “The infected have been isolated and are undergoing treatment...We have totally locked down the road of the area to prevent the virus from spreading,” he said.The temple, which was closed for visitors since the first COVID-19 case was reported in Bangladesh on March 8, was locked down on Saturday. According to bdnews24, over 100 people, including priests, officials and devotees, reside in the temple. The report said the infections have baffled the authorities as to how the members of the temple, which was closed for outsiders, contracted the deadly virus.“No one was allowed into the temple. I don’t understand how so many people have been infected given so much care was taken,” Miah told bdnews24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/31-iskcon-members-in-bangladesh-tested-covid-19-positive/story-57K7kXd5y7Ug1Pg5qvoEaI.html

On Saturday the health ministry said deaths from the respiratory illness had risen to 136, while confirmed infections rose to 16,299 with 2,215 people reported to have recovered from the illness. Last month, Saudi Arabia suspended the year-round “umrah” pilgrimage over fears of the coronavirus pandemic spreading in Islam’s holiest cities.Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year’s hajj, scheduled for the end of July, but they have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage.Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from across the world to participate in the hajj, which Muslims are obliged to perform at least once in their lives if able.The Arab world’s biggest economy has also closed cinemas, malls and restaurants and halted flights as it attempts to contain the virus.King Salman has warned of a “more difficult” fight ahead against the virus, as the kingdom faces the economic impact of virus-led shutdowns and crashing oil prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ramadan-except-in-hotspot-mecca-saudi-relaxes-coronavirus-lockdown/story-64OXGGsHGugOgbFbzxPxEN.html

Last week, the couple volunteered to donate their ‘blood and plasma’ for coronavirus research.“A lot of the questions [are] what do we do now? Is there something we can do? And, in fact, we just found out that we do carry the antibodies,” Variety quoted Hanks as saying for a podcast.The 63-year-old also added: “We have not only been approached, but we have also said, ‘Do you want our blood? Can we give plasma?’“The actor with much humour sense, also jokingly mentioned the name he would like to give if a vaccine for coronavirus is made from his blood donation.“In fact, we will be giving it now to the places that hope to work on what I would like to call the ‘Hank-ccine,” the Academy Award winner added.Earlier, Wilson confirmed that while she and Hanks still do not know for sure where or from whom they contracted the virus, they’ve learned they were both exposed to it “at the same time.”The ‘New Girl’ songstress and Hanks were in Australia when their tests for the novel virus came back positive.Hanks had been in the land down under filming an upcoming Elvis biopic before director Baz Luhrmann suspended filming.Recently, the ‘Forrest Gump’ actor detailed on how different the symptoms were for the couple and said his wife went through a tougher time than he did.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-donate-blood-to-help-develop-coronavirus-vaccine/story-YDEUT3yEDXP6nURK1dxBQI.html
26-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: China seizes over 89 million shoddy face masks||China has confiscated over 89 million poor quality face masks, a government official said Sunday, as Beijing faces a slew of complaints about faulty protective gear exported worldwide.Demand for protective equipment has soared as nations across the globe battle the deadly coronavirus, which has infected around 2.9 million people.But a number of countries have complained about faulty masks and other products exported by China, mostly for use by medical workers and vulnerable groups.China’s market regulators had inspected nearly 16 million businesses and seized over 89 million masks and 418,000 pieces of protective gear as of Friday, said Gan Lin, deputy director of the State Administration of Market Regulation, at a press conference.Regulators had also seized ineffective disinfectants worth over 7.6 million yuan ($1.1 million), she said.It is unclear how much of the confiscated goods were destined for markets abroad.In a bid to eliminate poor-quality products, China released new rules Saturday saying even non-medical masks must meet both national and international quality standards.Exporters must file a written declaration that their medical products meet the safety requirements of the destination country, the ministry of commerce said in a statement.The tighter rules come after several countries including Spain, the Netherlands, Czech Republic and Turkey were forced to recall hundreds of thousands of shoddy masks and pieces of protective gear imported from China.The Canadian government last week said that about one million face masks purchased from China failed to meet proper standards for healthcare professionals.Dutch health officials last month recalled over half a million Chinese masks -- which had already been sent to hospitals -- after complaints that they did not close over the face properly, or had defective filters.China is producing more than 116 million masks per day, according to official figures.It has exported more than one billion masks this year so far, commerce ministry official Li Xingqian told reporters.China has also signed contracts to export medical materials worth $1.41 billion to 74 countries and six international organisations, he added.In the first two months of the year, a staggering 8,950 new manufacturers started producing masks in China, according to business data platform Tianyancha.Despite the nationwide crackdown, businesses were continuing with illicit production of medical equipment since it was a way to earn “quick money”, Chinese customs official Jin Hai said earlier this month.Over 31.6 million faulty masks and 509,000 protective suits destined for export had been confiscated by port officials as of mid-April, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seizes-over-89-million-shoddy-face-masks/story-bA6uSaW0Rey1sn2TiB1nzH.html

According to the Ministry of National Health Services, at least 15 people have died in the last 24 hours, pushing the death toll up to 269, PTI further reported.Punjab reported 5,378 cases, Sindh 4,232, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 1,793, Balochistan 722, Gilgit-Baltistan 308, Islamabad 235 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 55 cases.With the infections spreading rapidly, Pakistan Medical Association and Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (PIMA) have urged people to offer prayers at homes and not in mosques.PIMA President Dr Iftikhar Burney warned on Saturday that mosques were becoming a major source of virus transmission.“Around 6,000 cases for coronavirus surfaced in a month... but the same doubled in the last six days,” he said, warning that the infection would further go up in the coming months of May and June.President Arif Alvi has written a letter to the imams of mosques urging them to ask worshippers above the age of 50 to pray at home. The federal government has, however, still not imposed a nationwide lockdown. It has been done only in some provinces, that too, by local governments.“We sought a total lockdown without thinking about the consequences for the daily wage earners, the street vendors, the labourers, all of whom face poverty & hunger for themselves & their families. May Allah forgive us our sin of neglecting our dispossessed & poor citizens,” Prime Minister Imran Khan had tweeted on his decision to not impose a total lockdown. Meanwhile, the partial lockdown has been extended till May 9.There were reports of violation of lockdown from different cities. The police arrested 78 people and sealed 107 shops on Saturday in Quetta, capital of Balochistan, for violating the lockdown, Balochistan government spokesperson Liaquat Shahwani said.He said that a total of 2,707 shops had been sealed so far.In Punjab, the government announced that lockdown would not apply to pushcart street vendors, selling fruit, vegetables and other products.Due to lack of observance of lockdown, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) criticised the partial lockdown policy and asked the government either impose total lockdown or withdraw it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-doubled-in-6-days-say-pakistan-doctors-urge-people-to-avoid-going-to-mosques-in-ramzan/story-UTbQPxguwGYFHgTNjZ75TP.html
26-04-2020||World||Focus turns to Kim Yo Jong as mystery intensifies over Kim Jong Un’s health||North Korea has never publicised who would follow leader Kim Jong Un in the event he is incapacitated, and with no details known about his young children, analysts say his sister and loyalists could form a regency until a successor is old enough to take over.South Korean and Chinese officials on Tuesday cast doubt on reports that Kim was gravely ill following a cardiovascular procedure, after his absence from a key state anniversary event triggered speculation about his health.But the media reports sparked questions about who would be in place to take over if the 36-year-old Kim, a third-generation hereditary leader, fell seriously ill or died. He became leader when his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack.Also Read: Train belonging to Kim Jong Un spotted as health rumours persistEach change of leadership in North Korea has raised the prospect of a leadership vacuum or collapse of the Kim dynasty, which has ruled the country since its founding in 1948.Also Watch l North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in critical condition? Watch China’s reactionSo far, each of the three Kims to rule North Korea has defied expectations, holding on to power with an iron grip. But under Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles has grown substantially, raising concerns over who would control those weapons.The following are key figures in the North Korean leadership circle and what role they may play in any future transition.KIM YO JONG Kim’s younger sister has been the most visible presence around the leader in the past two years, while serving formally as a vice director of the ruling Workers’ Party’s powerful Central Committee but unofficially as her brother’s chief of staff. She was named an alternate member of the ruling Workers’ Party’s powerful Central Committee Politburo earlier this month, continuing her climb through the leadership hierarchy.Kim, who is believed to be 31, has a firm control of key party functions, setting herself to be the main source of power behind a collective leadership.“Kim Yo Jong will be for the time being the main power base with control of the organisation and guidance department, the judiciary and public security,” Cho Han-bum of the Korea Institute for National Unification said.THE PARTY ELDERS Choe Ryong Hae rose to be the North’s nominal head of state last year becoming the president of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly. Also Read: China checks on Kim Jong Un’s health, sends a team to North KoreaIt capped decades of service with the party for the ruling Kim family, previously serving as the influential political head of the North’s military under the young leader.He and Pak Pong Ju, a fellow politburo member and former state premier who oversaw the North’s push to introduce more free market functions to revive its economy, are likely to be the figureheads leading a collective leadership.Kim Yong Chol, a party vice chairman and former top nuclear envoy, and Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon could be tasked with handling diplomatic issues including stalled denuclearisation talks with North Korea as they played a key role in summits with U.S. President Donald Trump. ESTRANGED BROTHERS, AUNTKim Jong Chol is the leader’s older brother but has not been part of the North’s leadership, instead leading a quiet life playing music, according to Thae Yong Ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London who defected to the South.He is believed to be disinterested in public life and is unlikely to emerge as a major presence, though some analysts say he maintains ties with siblings and could play a more public role in a contingency. Kim Kyong Hui was once a powerful figure in the leadership circle when her brother Kim Jong Il ruled the country. She had not been seen since her husband, Jang Song Thaek, once regarded as the second most powerful man in the country, was executed in 2013 by Kim Jong Un. She has long been ill but briefly appeared early this year at a gala performance alongside her nephew. FOURTH GENERATIONKim Jong Un is believed to have three children with Ri Sol Ju, the youngest born in 2017, according to the South’s National Intelligence Service.The oldest is a 10-year-old son, meaning any of the three would need the assistance of their relatives or political guardians if they were to become a fourth-generation hereditary leader. Kim Jong Il had been groomed for 20 years to lead the country, while Kim Jong Un only had just over a year due to his father’s sudden death from a stroke. “Kim Yo Jong is unlikely to take over the helm but could help build a caretaker regime as a power broker until the kids grow up, and Kim Jong Chol might return to help for a while,” said Go Myong-hyun, a research fellow at the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/focus-turns-to-kim-yo-jong-as-mystery-intensifies-over-kim-jong-un-s-health/story-Jn6OKliLN8z9nkjdKd918M.html
26-04-2020||World||With record 931 new Covid-19 cases in a day, Singapore emerges as Asia’s hotspot||Singapore on Sunday reported 931 new cases of coronavirus disease Covid-19 which took its total to 13,624. Most of the new infections are from foreign workers’ dormitories, which have been locked down as the government struggles to curb the outbreak.Fifteen of the new cases are permanent residents, the health ministry said in the statement.The number of new cases rose from 618 reported on Saturday.The tiny country of 5.7 million people now has one of the highest infection rates in Asia, according to official figures, due to outbreaks in cramped dormitories housing over 3,00,000 mainly South Asian workers. The city-state is rapidly building bed space for coronavirus patients in cavernous exhibition halls and other temporary facilities as it faces a surge in cases, mainly among its large community of low-paid migrant workers.One such facility at Changi Exhibition Centre - home to the Singapore Airshow, Asia’s biggest aerospace gathering - could eventually house over 4,000 patients recovering from the disease and those with mild symptoms.Singapore trails only China, India, Japan and Pakistan in Asia for the number of coronavirus infections. More than 10,000 of those infected, some 80 per cent of its total, are foreign workers, many of whom have been placed in “isolation facilities” for people with mild symptoms such as the conference centres.Despite the high total of cases, Singapore has reported 12 deaths and 24 people are in intensive care.At the new Changi isolation centre, each room has blood-pressure monitors and other medical equipment for patients to conduct their own health checks three times daily, while remote-controlled robots provide meals and teleconferencing services to reduce contact.Rows of white huts are also being hurriedly assembled at the Tanjong Pagar shipping-container port. The facility could house up to 15,000 foreign workers, local media reported, but authorities have yet to decide how it will be used.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-record-931-new-covid-19-cases-in-a-day-singapore-emerges-as-asia-s-hotspot/story-QdpyK7YsHJ4mmWy8xP90pL.html
26-04-2020||World||As virus lockdown eases, Italy ponders what went wrong||As Italy prepares to emerge from the West’s first and most extensive coronavirus lockdown, it is increasingly clear that something went terribly wrong in Lombardy, the hardest-hit region in Europe’s hardest-hit country.Italy had the bad luck of being the first Western country to be slammed by the outbreak, and its total of 26,000 fatalities lags behind only the US in the global death toll. Italy’s first homegrown case was recorded Feb. 21, at a time when the World Health Organization was still insisting the virus was “containable” and not nearly as infectious as the flu.But there’s also evidence that demographics and health care deficiencies combined with political and business interests to expose Lombardy’s 10 million people in ways unseen anywhere else, particularly the most vulnerable in nursing homes.Virologists and epidemiologists say what went wrong there will be studied for years, given how the outbreak overwhelmed a medical system considered one of Europe’s best. In neighboring Veneto, the impact was significantly more controlled.Prosecutors are deciding whether to lay any criminal blame for the hundreds of dead in nursing homes, many of whom aren’t even counted in Lombardy’s official death toll of 13,269.By contrast, Lombardy’s front-line doctors and nurses are being hailed as heroes for risking their lives to treat the sick under extraordinary levels of stress, exhaustion, isolation and fear.Even after Italy registered its first homegrown case, doctors didn’t understand the unusual way Covid-19 could present itself, with some patients experiencing a rapid decline in their ability to breathe.“This was clinical information we didn’t have,” said Dr. Maurizio Marvisi, a pneumologist at the San Camillo private clinic in hard-hit Cremona.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicBecause Lombardy’s intensive care units were filling up within days of Italy’s first cases, many primary care physicians tried to treat and monitor their patients at home, even putting them on supplemental oxygen. That strategy proved deadly, since many people died at home or soon after being hospitalized, having waited too long to call an ambulance.Italy was forced to rely on home care in part because of its low ICU capacity: After years of budget cuts, Italy went into the emergency with 8.6 ICU beds per 100,000 people, below the average of 15.9 within the developed countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakAs a result, Italy’s primary care physicians became the front-line filter of Covid-19 patients, an army of mostly self-employed general practitioners who work outside the public hospital system.Since only those showing strong symptoms were being tested because Lombardy’s labs couldn’t process any more, these family doctors didn’t know if they themselves were positive, much less their patients.The doctors also had no guidelines on when to admit the sick or refer them to specialists. And being outside the hospital system, they didn’t have the same access to protective equipment.Some 20,000 Italian medical personnel have been infected and 150 doctors have died.Two days after Italy registered its first case in the Lombardy province of Lodi, sparking a quarantine in 10 towns, another positive case was registered more than an hour’s drive away in Alzano in the province of Bergamo.By March 2, the Superior Institute of Health recommended Alzano and nearby Nembro be sealed off like the Lodi towns. But political authorities never implemented that recommendation, allowing the infection to spread for a second week until all of Lombardy was locked down March 7.Asked why he didn’t seal off Bergamo sooner, Premier Giuseppe Conte argued that Lombardy’s regional government could have done so on its own. Lombardy’s governor, Atillio Fontana, said if there was a mistake, ‘’it was made by both. I don’t think that there was blame in this situation.’’Lombardy has one-sixth of Italy’s 60 million people and is the most densely populated region, home to the business capital in Milan and the country’s industrial heartland. Lombardy also has more people over 65 than any other region, as well as 20% of Italy’s nursing homes, a demographic time bomb for Covid-19 infections.“Clearly, with the benefit of hindsight, we should have done a total shutdown in Lombardy, everyone at home and no one moves,” said Andrea Crisanti, a microbiologist and virologist advising Veneto’s regional government. But he acknowledged how hard that was, given Lombardy’s outsize role in Italy’s economy, which even before the pandemic was heading toward recession.“Probably for political reasons, it wasn’t done,” he told reporters.Unions and mayors of some of Lombardy’s hardest hit cities now say the country’s main industrial lobby group, Confindustria, put enormous pressure on authorities to resist production shutdowns on the grounds that the economic cost would be too great in a region responsible for 21% of Italy’s GDP.On Feb. 28, a week into Italy’s outbreak and well after more than 100 cases had been registered in Bergamo, the province’s branch of Confindustria launched a social media campaign aimed at reassuring skittish investors. It insisted the outbreak was no worse than elsewhere and that production in provincial steel mills and other industries were unaffected. The lobbying group also launched its own campaign in the larger Lombard region.Even after the national government locked down all of Lombardy March 7, it allowed factories to stay open, sparking strikes from workers worried that their health was being sacrificed.“It was a huge error. They should have taken the example where the first cluster was found,” said Giambattista Morali of the metalworkers’ union in the Bergamo town of Dalmine.While the regional government focused on finding new ICU beds, its testing capacity lagged and Lombardy’s nursing homes were in many ways left to fend for themselves.Of particular attention to Milan prosecutors investigating deaths in care facilities was the March 8 decision by the regional government to allow recovering Covid-19 patients to be housed in nursing homes to free up hospital beds.Another regional decree March 30 told nursing home directors to not hospitalize sick residents over 75 if they had other health problems and avoid further risking their health during transport or a wait in the ER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-virus-lockdown-eases-italy-ponders-what-went-wrong/story-LOnBRHrAjANYOjkNemeWEM.html
26-04-2020||World||Yemen crisis deepens as separatists declare self-governance||Yemeni separatists early Sunday declared self-rule of the country’s south as a peace deal with the government crumbled, complicating a long and separate conflict with Huthi rebels who control much of the north.The Southern Transitional Council (STC) accused the government of failing to perform its duties and of “conspiring” against the southern cause, and said self-governance had begun at midnight. The government condemned the move and said the separatists -- who have long agitated for independence in the south -- would be responsible for the “catastrophic and dangerous” outcome.The breakdown between the one-time allies comes as a Saudi-led coalition, which backs the internationally recognised government in a battle against the Iran-backed Huthi rebels, has extended a unilateral ceasefire aimed at fending off the coronavirus pandemic -- a move rejected by the Huthis.Yemen’s separatists signed a power-sharing deal in Riyadh last November that quelled a battle -- dubbed a “civil war within a civil war” -- for the south that had in August seen them seize control of the second city of Aden.The Riyadh pact quickly became defunct, failing to meet deadlines for key measures including the formation of a new cabinet with equal representation for southerners, and the reorganisation of military forces. The STC announced in its statement that it was declaring “self-governance in the south starting midnight on Saturday April 25th, 2020.“A self governing committee will start its work according to a list of tasks assigned by the council’s presidency,” it said.Aden residents reported heavy deployments of STC forces in the city and a separatist source told AFP they had set up checkpoints “at all government facilities, including the central bank and port of Aden”.Military vehicles drove through the city with STC flags flying aloft.The political landscape in the south is complex, and despite the STC’s declaration some southern cities said they did not recognise the call to self-rule and would remain aligned with the central government.Yemen’s Foreign Minister Mohammad al-Hadhrami said the STC move was “a continuation of the armed rebellion last August and a declaration of rejection” of the Riyadh agreement.Deep divisionsTens of thousands of civilians have been killed over the past five years in the war between the government and the Huthi rebels.Earlier this month, Yemen reported its first case of coronavirus in Hadramawt, a southern government-controlled province, raising fears of an outbreak.Compounding the country’s troubles, at least 21 people were killed in flash flooding this month, with Aden’s streets submerged and homes destroyed.The UAE, like the STC, has a zero tolerance policy towards the Muslim Brotherhood and Yemen’s Brotherhood-influenced Al-Islah party, which has representatives in the internationally recognised government.Last August, deadly clashes broke out between the government and STC forces who seized control of Aden, ousting unionist forces who had set up base there when President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi fled the Huthi-held capital Sanaa in February 2015.The tussle for control of the south exposed divisions between the coalition partners -- Saudi Arabia, which backs the government, and the United Arab Emirates, a backer and funder of the STC.The Riyadh agreement had been welcomed as preventing the complete break-up of Yemen, and hailed as a possible stepping stone towards ending the wider conflict in Yemen.But the cracks soon emerged, with complaints over food shortages in the south, a sharp depreciation of the currency, and a lack of funds to pay public sector employees. The STC’s statement Sunday said there had been a marked deterioration of public services, which “was clearly reflected in the latest torrential rains that caused the people in Aden deep suffering”.The government was using its powers as “a weapon to bring the southerners to kneel,” it said.While the government and the STC are technically allies in the long war against the Huthis, the secessionists believe the south should be an independent state -- as it was before unification in 1990.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yemen-crisis-deepens-as-separatists-declare-self-governance/story-lL1YxKvn2CVw62zVSsWUMP.html

After the first death linked to the disease was reported on January 10 in Wuhan, global fatalities linked to the virus passed 200,000 on Saturday, more than one-quarter of them in the United States.It took 91 days for the death toll to pass 100,000 and a further 16 days to reach 200,000, according to the Reuters tally of official reports from governments.India has reported that 26,496 people have been infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes the respiratory disease, and 824 fatalities.Here are the 10 worst-affected countries across the world:US: The country has reported 939,053 cases and 53,816 deaths as of Sunday and pockets sought to restart their economies following a month of government-ordered lockdowns.This reopening has come despite warnings of many public health experts, who say the increased human interaction could spark a new wave of cases of Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the highly contagious virus.Also read: UN Security Council nears virus resolution, and perhaps a new pathSpain: There were 223,759 cases and 22,902 deaths in Spain, where residents will be allowed out for exercise and to take walks from next weekend.Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also said on Saturday, in the latest move to ease one of the world’s tightest coronavirus lockdowns, the government will on Tuesday unveil its broader lockdown exit plan that will likely be put into action in the second half of May.Unlike most other countries in the world, since imposing a lockdown on March 14, Spain has not allowed anyone out for walks, jogs or bike rides, allowing them to leave home only to buy food or medicine or to briefly walk the dog, other than for a medical emergency. Spain’s state of emergency was extended this week until midnight on May 9.Italy: The European country has 195,351 cases and 26,384 deaths, the toll dropped to its lowest level since March 17 but is highest after the US.The Lombardy region registers the most cases in Italy, adding some 700 on Saturday for a total of nearly 72,000 infected persons there since Italy’s first case in that northern region on February 20. Much of Italy’s south has been spared the brunt of the outbreak.France: France has 161,644 cases and 22,614 deaths linked to coronavirus, with 14,050 occurring in hospitals.France recorded another 369 deaths due to Covid-19 but has continued to experience a steady decline in the number of patients in hospital or in need of intensive care beds due to the virus.

26-04-2020||World||China health officials notice rise in imported cases, fear resurgence of Covid-19||China confirmed 11 new coronavirus cases, including six locally transmitted infections, taking the total count to 82,827, while a senior health official has warned of domestic resurgence of COVID-19 due to the rise in imported cases.Death toll in China remained at 4,632 for the past 10 days, according to data released by the National Health Commission (NHC) on Sunday.The 11 new confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported on Saturday. Of them, five were imported from overseas, while six were locally transmitted infections, it said.Five of the new cases were in Heilongjiang province bordering Russia and another was in Guangdong province. As many as 30 new asymptomatic cases, including seven imported, were also reported, taking the total number of such cases to 1,000, the NHC said. Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested COVID-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others. China has so far registered total 82,827 COVID-19 cases, including 77,394 recoveries. While China contained the pandemic at Wuhan where the novel coronavirus first emerged in December last year, the growing numbers of imported cases as well as asymptomatic cases remained a cause of concern for health officials. As of Saturday, the number of imported cases climbed to 1,634, including 22 in critical condition, the NHC said.Also, the 1,000 suspected asymptomatic cases includes 151 from abroad. All such patients are still under medical observation.NHC spokesperson Mi Feng has warned that China still faces a tough task to prevent a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic due to imported cases.The number of countries as sources of imported cases reported on the Chinese mainland rose to 50 on Friday, he told a media briefing on Saturday.Seven provincial-level regions reported newly imported cases or suspected cases on Friday, Mi noted, calling for targeted epidemic prevention and control measures as well as consistent personal protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-health-officials-notice-rise-in-imported-cases-fear-resurgence-of-covid-19/story-VBEExPOcfG6lPgBGGfPhzL.html

But the latest rules -- passed on Friday -- outline new specific punishments.Fines for littering, spitting and defecation in public were upped to a maximum of 200 yuan ($28), from a previous upper limit of 50 yuan.In the past, these regulations were enforced in a patchy way and the habits have not been stamped out completely. Those who do not sort their rubbish correctly can be fined up to 200 yuan, and residents responsible for noise pollution in public spaces and who walk their dogs unleashed can be fined up to 500 yuan. The laws also encourage police to report serious offences, which may affect a person’s social credit score -- a fledgling system which aims to assess individual actions across society -- though it did not provide more specifics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-bans-uncivilised-behaviour-to-improve-public-hygiene-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-bAwjNxERu69GQTRjYJdXVN.html

The World Health Organization said earlier that there was “no evidence” that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.“I don’t believe there are any plans that hinge on certain people being immune to Covid-19,” Trudeau said in his daily briefing in Ottawa, adding that provincial plans focus on preventing the spread through social distancing and protective equipment in workplaces.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“(Immunity) is something we need to get clearer answers to and until we have those clear answers, we need to err on the side of more caution.”In a scientific brief, the United Nations agency warned governments against issuing “immunity passports” or “risk-free certificates” to people who have been infected as their accuracy could not be guaranteed.New Brunswick is the first Canadian province to begin reopening parts of its economy and Saskatchewan has outlined a plan to start reopening in May.Trudeau met with provincial premiers on Friday to discuss their restart plans. Measures will differ as infection rates vary among provinces, but require national coordination, he said.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakCanada’s death toll from Covid-19 rose 7% to 2,350 from a day earlier. Cases reached more than 44,000.Some 80% of Canada’s cases are in Quebec and Ontario, where there are numerous outbreaks in nursing homes.Even so, a small protest outside the Ontario legislature on Saturday demanded the easing of public health measures.“It’s irresponsible, reckless and it’s selfish,” Premier Doug Ford said of the call to loosen restrictions, speaking at a briefing. “It burns me up.” Such protests have been smaller in Canada than in the United States, where Republican politicians and individuals affiliated with President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign are organizing or promoting anti-lockdown protests.Also Saturday, Trudeau announced funding for the country’s fish and seafood processors whose businesses were harmed by the coronavirus pandemic.The government will provide C$62.5 million ($44.32 million) in financing to buy protective equipment for workers or storage space for products to sell them later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/plans-to-restart-canadian-economy-do-not-hinge-on-coronavirus-immunity-levels-trudeau/story-BFLmGtI6bSdyAcTxop6pUI.html
26-04-2020||World||Trump and Putin issue rare joint statement promoting cooperation||US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin issued a rare joint statement on Saturday commemorating a 1945 World War Two link-up of US and Soviet troops on their way to defeat Nazi Germany as an example of how their countries can cooperate.The statement by Trump and Putin comes amid deep strains in US-Russian ties over a raft of issues, from arms control and Russia’s intervention in Ukraine and Syria to US charges that Russia has spread disinformation about the novel coronavirus pandemic and interfered in US election campaigns.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Wall Street Journal reported that the decision to issue the statement sparked debate within the Trump administration, with some officials worried it could undercut stern US messages to Moscow.The joint statement marked the anniversary of the April 25, 1945 meeting on a bridge over the Elbe River in Germany of Soviet soldiers advancing from the east and American troops moving from the West.“This event heralded the decisive defeat of the Nazi regime,” the statement said. “The ‘Spirit of the Elbe’ is an example of how our countries can put aside differences, build trust, and cooperate in pursuit of a greater cause.”The Journal said the last joint statement marking the Elbe River bridge link-up was issued in 2010, when the Obama administration was seeking improved relations with Moscow.Trump had hoped to travel to Moscow to mark the anniversary. He has been complimentary of Putin, promoted cooperation with Moscow, and said he believed the Russian leader’s denials of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Senior administration officials and lawmakers, in contrast, have been fiercely critical of Russia, with relations between the nuclear-armed nations at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday issued a bipartisan report concurring with a 2017 US intelligence assessment that Russia pursued an influence campaign of misinformation and cyber hacking aimed at swinging the vote to Trump over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.US intelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Moscow is meddling in the 2020 presidential election campaign, which Russia denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-and-putin-issue-rare-joint-statement-promoting-cooperation/story-lpybb8XqWuMcKr1VzkH0bI.html

People living together will be permitted to take short walks together.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicHe also laid out the government’s wider plan to loosen the lockdown at different speeds across different regions, depending on whether they meet with criteria established by the World Health Organization. “We will not suddenly recover activity across all sectors,” he said. “The deescalation has to be gradual and asymmetric... We won’t all advance at the same pace but we will follow the same rules.”Sanchez said the plan, which the government has been preparing with experts for three weeks, will be rolled out through May and “we will see what happens” in June. He said he will hold a virtual meeting with regional leaders on Sunday to discuss the plans, which the cabinet is set to approve on Tuesday.His government’s handling of the crisis has met with fierce criticism and on Saturday residents across Madrid came to their balconies to bang pots and pans in protest. Similar protests earlier in the week prompted the government to reverse an earlier decision and let under 14s leave their homes for the first time since the state of emergency was declared on March 14.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakFrom Sunday they will be allowed one hour of supervised outdoor activity per day between 9am and 9pm, staying within one kilometre of their home. Adults can accompany up to three children, who will not be allowed to use playparks and must adhere to social distancing guidelines, remaining at least two metres from other people.Sanchez urged parents be responsible and follow the guidelines with the “maximum safety precautions”, while top police officials cautioned that children must stick to the rules. Spain’s Health Ministry said 378 more people had died after being diagnosed with the coronavirus, up slightly on Friday’s 367, the lowest in the past month, but well down on the high of 950 seen on April 2. Cumulative deaths rose to 22,902 while the overall number of cases rose to 223,759 from 219,764 the day before.On April 13 sectors including construction and manufacturing were allowed to reopen, but with most people still confined to their homes except for essential reasons, shops, bars and public spaces remain closed.DECONFINEMENT PLANCatalan Regional President Quim Torra announced the region’s own plan to ease lockdown measures, including stipulating specific hours when children of different ages could go outside. Defending his measures, which ignore Health Ministry guidelines and highlight a rumbling discontent in some regions with the national response, Torra said: “We have the right to have our own deconfinement plan”. In Pineda de Mar, northeast Spain, volunteer seamstresses were hard at work making face masks for children ahead of the deconfinement measure.“More than 100 people are making protective equipment,” the town’s mayor Xavier Amor told Reuters. “We started with masks and then we followed the demand of hospitals, health centres, and nursing homes.” As bars and restaurants eye a gradual reopening one company is devising safety measures to encourage wary clients to return.Leganes-based LlenaTuBar, whose name translates as fill up your bar, is fitting dining tables with clear plastic screens to protect customers and installing thermal cameras to detect any patrons with a fever.The Health Ministry on Friday changed the methodology for logging cases of the virus. It will no longer count antibody tests and will only include positive results from PCR tests. Discounting antibody tests puts Saturday’s total number of cases at 205,905 and Friday’s at 202,990.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-to-allow-outdoor-exercise-as-kids-prepare-for-taste-of-freedom/story-bUgmZhVGqV96zJIx58dpBO.html

Gandhi once said that being late can itself be an “act of violence,” one ambassador recalled, speaking on grounds of anonymity to express impatience with the UN’s top body for its embarrassing silence in the face of the worst global crisis since World War II. The Security Council has conferred only once on the pandemic, and that was in virtual session -- a videoconference held April 9 at the initiative of Germany and Estonia.The current resolution, jointly proposed by Tunisia and France, calls for “enhanced coordination among all countries,” a “cessation of hostilities” and a “humanitarian pause” in countries in conflict. The resolution aims to support the efforts of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and of several UN agencies struggling to contain the devastating political, economic and social consequences of the deadly virus. Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe text is partly “a face-saving device that allows the Security Council to claim that it has not been entirely inactive,” said Richard Gowan, UN director of the International Crisis Group, a center for analysis. “But it does have some substantive benefits too.”Might the benefits of a resolution binding on all UN members be seen in crisis zones in Syria, Yemen or elsewhere in the Middle East? In Afghanistan, Colombia or Africa?“A global ceasefire is very laudable, but the challenge is how you translate that into actions in individual country context,” another ambassador said.A P5 videoconferenceThe French-Tunisian text merges two proposals negotiated in parallel over several weeks, one under Tunis’s leadership among the 10 non-permanent members of the Security Council (the “E10”) and the other by France among the five permanent members (the “P5”).But while the two texts share the goal of improved cooperation and support for widespread cease-fires, neither achieved complete unity in its Security Council bloc, diplomats said.The joint text is likely to undergo several amendments before being put to a vote at a date as yet uncertain. But several diplomats described it as “decisive,” and insisted it will be voted on this week.A principal obstacle to unity remains how the text, a copy of which was obtained by AFP, will ultimately refer to the World Health Organization.The WHO’s role in dealing with the pandemic has been vilified by US President Donald Trump, who complained it had not been transparent about the coronavirus and suspended US funding. China responded by offering additional funding. And Russia, in talks early this month, wanted to insert language calling for an end to protectionism and trade wars and a lifting of unilateral sanctions.One diplomat said only a high-level video arbitration between P5 members -- possibly even consultation involving national leaders -- could resolve such thorny disputes. Yet might the permanent members take advantage of this virtual get-together to design a new post-pandemic world order -- even placing the UN on a new path?For one ambassador, such an initiative should be led by Guterres, standing above the melee and able to help sketch out a “war-fighting plan.”“Never have the world’s seven and a half billion humans felt more strongly such an urgent need for global policy,” said Bertrand Badie, a professor at the Paris Institute of Political Studies (“Science Po”). “At the same time, nationalism has never been as active in the world.”What remains to be seen, he added, is how those two countervailing forces sort themselves out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-nears-virus-resolution-and-perhaps-a-new-path/story-PU3cPR3vvQjHKPb9ttevfK.html
26-04-2020||World||WHO warns against ‘immunity passports’ as nations look for ways to exit lockdowns||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Saturday warned governments against issuing “immunity passports” or “risk-free certificates” to people who have recovered to enable travel or return to work because there is no evidence that people who have recovered are protected from a second infection.Chile said it would start issuing immunity cards to people who have recovered from Covid-19, and the US , Germany and Italy are considering it as a way to exit their lockdowns. The assumption is that a person who has been infected and has recovered can safely interact with people without getting reinfected or infecting others.The WHO’s scientific paper warns that the assumption that those who have recovered are protected from reinfection could fuel continued spread of Covid-19 as people with certificates may stop taking standard precautions, such as wearing masks and washing hands.“Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 could serve as the basis for an ‘immunity passport’ or ‘risk-free certificate’ that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against reinfection. There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,” the scientific brief said.The WHO does not have a position on this approach and the scientific brief will be updated as new evidence emerges, so countries must tread with caution, said the global health agency’s South East Asia regional director.“Right now, we have no evidence that a serological test can show that an individual is immune to Covid-19. Also, we need to be sure what test will be used to establish the status of an individual. Preliminary information received suggests that a very low proportion of the population has developed antibody response to Covid-19. So this approach may not solve the problem governments are trying to address,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO regional director, South East Asia Region.A rising concern is the unreliability of antibody tests, which can throw up false positive and false negative results. “Antibody tests, while suggestive of a person’s exposure to the Covid19 virus, do not provide proof of full immunity, which is protective to that person or impunity from being regarded as infective to others. If applied on a large scale at the population level, false positives tend to get magnified,” said Dr Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.While people who have recovered from the infection have antibodies against the virus, some of them have very low levels of neutralising antibodies in their blood, “suggesting that cellular immunity may also be critical for recovery”, the WHO paper says.The development of immunity to a virus through natural infection is a multi-step process that takes place over one to two weeks. The body responds to a viral infection immediately with a non-specific innate response in which macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells slow the progress of the virus and may even prevent it from causing symptoms. This non-specific response is followed by an adaptive response, where the body makes antibodies called immunoglobulins that specifically bind to the virus.The body also develops cellular immunity by making T-cells to eliminate other cells infected with the virus. This (cellular immunity) combined adaptive response may clear the virus from the body, and if the response is strong enough, may prevent progression to severe illness or reinfection by the same virus. This process is often measured by the presence of antibodies in blood. “As of April 24, no study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans,” said the WHO paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-against-immunity-passports-as-nations-look-for-ways-to-exit-lockdowns/story-IT8r1V2OXJtXVWkCPIIZqJ.html

Advisor on Health Zafar Mirza in his daily media briefing said that currently there was no coronavirus vaccine in Pakistan and no work of any kind was going on for its development.“Let me clarify that while there are several initiatives to develop vaccines across the world, there is no such initiative in Pakistan at the moment,” he said.But he said that a Chinese company developing a vaccine contacted Pakistan and offered it to become a part of clinical trials.“We have asked for more information from them,” Mirza said.He said that a similar offer was made by a company in Japan and Pakistan asked for specific details.Mirza said that 79 per cent of the all coronavirus cases in Pakistan were locally transmitted.“It is now fair to say that our outbreak is now mostly of local transmission,” he said.As part of efforts to reach out to the people, the government launched a telemedicine portal where doctors, both local and abroad, can give advice to patients about the coronavirus, according to Dr Mirza.The Ministry of National Health Services reported that Pakistan’s coronavirus tally touched 12,644, as government asked people to follow official guidelines while visiting mosques in Ramadan.It said that three patients died on Saturday, taking the total death toll to 256. Another 2,755 recovered from the disease.The largest province of Punjab reported 5,378 cases, Sindh 4,232, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 1,793, Balochistan 656, Gilgit-Baltistan 307, Islamabad 223 and Kashmir 55 cases.So far 138,147 tests were done including 6,780 during the last 24 hours, according to the data issued by the ministry.It also said that 785 patients were diagnosed during the last 24 hours.China has sent more medical supplies including polymerase chain reaction testing kits, surgical masks, protective cover all suits, N95 masks and ventilators, according to a statement by the Army.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Earlier, a Chinese medical team of specialists headed by Major General Huang Qingzhen arrived on Friday. The specialists will stay in Pakistan for two months to provide their guidance.The government on Friday extended the lockdown till May 9.However, Prime Minister Imran Khan, as previously, opposed total lockdown.“When we sought a total lockdown without thinking about the consequences for the daily wage earners, the street vendors, the labourers, all of whom face poverty & hunger for themselves & their families. May Allah forgive us our sin of neglecting our dispossessed & poor citizens,” he tweeted.At the start of Ramzan, President Arif Alvi and Minister for Religious Affairs Noorul Haq Qadri visited different mosques in Islamabad to review the precautionary measures taken for the special Taraweeh prayers. As per the governent’s decision, the suspension of International flight operations has been extended upto May 15. Remaining provisions as applicable to the suspension of International flights reflected in the previous orders remain unchanged, it said in a statement.Meanwhile, after several weeks of warnings, the government finally decided to stop all outsiders from going to Lal Masjid for payers on Friday.Dawn reported that a large number of female students belonging to Jamia Hafsa were called a day earlier to stay at the mosque to counter any police action.Maulana Abdul Aziz, a cleric, had been openly challenging the precautionary directives and denounced the government’s advice for social distancing.Several cases have been filed against him and his bodyguards for displaying weapons during the past four weeks.Meanwhile, the Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) asked people to follow preventive measures of social distancing during Taraweeh. “While we have to take the medical advice seriously and avoid going to the mosques as much as possible, but it is preferred to observe Taraweeh at home,” PUC chairman Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-not-developing-covid-19-vaccine-clarifies-pakistan-over-12-000-infected/story-K67fo1oDJKks0t2HP7IhiM.html

She lost consciousness for three weeks and was declared dead on March 27, relatives said.A week later, her family was shown a corpse in the hospital morgue, but for fear of coronavirus contagion did not get close to it. The body was on its side, with the back showing, not the face.Maruri’s nephew Jaime Morla said he thought it was his aunt and told hospital officials it was. “I was afraid to see her face,” he told AFP. “I was a metre and a half away. She had the same hair, the same skin tone. She even had a wound like one my aunt had recently,” Morla said.That body was taken to a funeral home and cremated.Maruri regained consciousness Thursday and told doctors who she was and had them call her sister Aura. “The doctors went to my aunt’s house to corroborate and inform them of the mistake,” said another nephew, Juan Carlos Ramirez. “They still do not know whose ashes they have in their house,” he added.The family plans to sue the hospital to recover the cremation fee they paid and for the distress caused by the mix-up.The sister told news outlets that hospital officials visited her on Friday and told her that her sister was well and about to be released. “It is a miracle. For nearly a month, we thought she was dead. And I have someone else’s ashes,” said Aura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ecuador-woman-back-from-the-dead-after-hospital-mix-up/story-MByRySEUyjChiVoJ82F0sN.html

Kim has been out of the public eye for a few weeks, and was reported to be in critical condition after undergoing cardiovascular surgery.US officials said Monday they were told of Kim’s condition after the surgery, though they were unsure of his current health.

One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?

The country’s death toll, from hospitals only, has topped 20,000, the fifth highest in the world, and business has slowed to a crawl.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, in an editorial to the mass-circulation Sun newspaper on Saturday, sought to explain how the central bank was supporting the economy.There’s some evidence that Johnson’s experience in St. Thomas’ Hospital -- he was admitted to the intensive care unit, and credited the staff there with saving his life -- has made him less gung-ho in his attitude to the virus.When some European countries were beginning lockdown procedures in mid-March, Johnson said at the time that such a reaction was unnecessary.Fast forward a few weeks, and he’s said to be particularly cautious about whether lifting social-distancing measures would risk a second wave of the virus at a time daily cases have leveled off and deaths have started to decline.According to the Telegraph newspaper, travelers arriving in Britain will be placed in quarantine for up to two weeks under a plan being overseen by Home Secretary Priti Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-will-be-back-at-work-on-monday-report/story-oDeI7t1kZot0LlaacVYl9I.html

He himself tried to walk it back as a “sarcastic question” for reporters, which it was not.Though the spread of the virus has slowed with a drop in new cases, hospitalization, the number of infections and deaths continued to climb. Reported confirmed infections went up to 905,364 with 36,188 more over the past 24 hours and fatalities to 51,956 with 1,995 more, which is the lowest in weeks.As the situation has improved frustration has grown about the lockdowns and states are under increasing pressure to begin removing restrictions, either partially or fully. And calls growing more intense as the lockdown or variations of it are set to expire end of the month, on or around April 30.Georgia, Alaska and Oklahoma allowed the resumption of some business activities Friday, under strict obligation to abide by social-distancing rules. South Carolina reopened department stores and flea markets earlier in the week, and, Tennessee has announced it doe they do not plan to extend the lockdown.Hair and nail salons, spa, bowling alleys, gyms and tattoo parlors were allowed to reopen Friday and restaurants are set to reopen for in-dining next week in Georgia. Oklahoma has allowed salons, barbers and pet groomers. And Alaska has eased restriction on restaurants, retail stores and nonessential businesses, including hair and nail salons.Georgia is being seen as a test case by many other states who are eager to open too but are being careful to not trigger a resurgence. Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, is being seen as rash and was publicly scolded by Trump for rushing into it, in defiance of the three-phase federal reopening guidelines.New York, the epicenter of the American epidemic, California and Illinois remain under strict lockdown orders with their governors saying they intend to keep them in place.New York is improving. Governor Andrew Cuomo has said deaths have declined, with 422 of single-day toll on Friday being the lowest since the start of the month. Toll for the state rose to 21,411 Saturday; with 16,646 in New York city alone.Citing new research, the governor said Friday that the virus came to New York from Italy, which runs counter to President Trump and his administration’s efforts to blame China for the epidemic and that he may have prevented a larger spread in the US by banning travelers from China in early February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-lift-covid-19-restrictions-donald-trump-defends-walks-back-disinfectant-remarks/story-93p6tMfvJJvpAMNXtdoaGM.html

Kim believed that a hospital in the area would have saved him, the news outlet reported.It also said that there is one more reason to build a hospital away from capital Pyongyang: To keep the leader and his family away from any kind of surveillance.Daily NK further reported that the doctor who conducted Kim’s surgery is an expert in cardiovascular-related diseases and has even received training abroad. The doctor too is kept under tight security and moves around with his own guard, the news outlet reported.The medical equipment at the hospital is imported from Germany and Japan, reported Daily NK, which is run mostly by North Korean defectors.Daily NK had earlier reported thar Kim had undergone a cardiovascular procedure earlier this month triggered by heavy smoking, obesity and fatigue.CNN also quoted a US official as saying Kim was in “grave danger” after surgery.Speculation about Kim’s whereabouts started after he apparently skipped an annual visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun last Wednesday on the occasion of the 108th birthday of his late grandfather and state founder, Kim Il Sung.Kim was last seen on April 11 in state media reports about his presiding over a political bureau meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party, where he called for “strict national countermeasures to thoroughly check the infiltration of the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-heart-care-centre-has-imported-machines-doctors-trained-abroad-report/story-YtH2C1SCmjUx7oV5pt4wzL.html

We’ve got to do so in a way that we can verify. That’s true no matter who is leading North Korea,” he said.Pompeo flew to North Korea four times in 2018 as he arranged historic summits between Trump and Kim after more than a half century of enmity between the two countries.But hopes for a breakthrough before US elections in November have dimmed, with North Korea firing off rockets and the United States refusing Pyongyang’s demands for sanctions relief before full denuclearization.Daily NK, an online media outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, said Kim had undergone a cardiovascular procedure earlier this month triggered by heavy smoking, obesity and fatigue.CNN also quoted a US official as saying Kim was in “grave danger” after surgery.But South Korea, which is technically still at war with the North, said it had detected no unusual movements in its neighbor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-exit-wouldn-t-change-us-goals-mike-pompeo/story-sLrdxUFkrUpieatVGqufIK.html
