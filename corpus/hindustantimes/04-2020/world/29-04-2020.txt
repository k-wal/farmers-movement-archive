It charged that Moscow in particular was pondering the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons as a way of coercion in a limited conflict — an assertion that Russia has repeatedly denied.The State Department noted that the new supplemental warhead “reduces the risk of nuclear war by reinforcing extended deterrence and assurance.”The Russian Foreign Ministry sees it otherwise.The ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, commented on the State Department’s paper at a briefing on Wednesday, emphasizing that the U.S. shouldn’t view its new low-yield warheads as a flexible tool that could help avert an all-out nuclear conflict with Russia.“Any attack involving a U.S. submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), regardless of its weapon specifications, would be perceived as a nuclear aggression,” Zakharova said. “Those who like to theorize about the flexibility of American nuclear potential must understand that in line with the Russian military doctrine such actions are seen as warranting retaliatory use of nuclear weapons by Russia.”Zakharova cast the U.S. deployment of low-yield warheads as a destabilizing move that would result in “lowering the nuclear threshold.”U.S.-Russian differences on nuclear arms issues come as relations between Moscow and Washington are at post-Cold War lows over the Ukrainian crisis and the accusations of Russian meddling in the U.S. 2016 presidential election.Last year, both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.The only U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control agreement still standing is the New START treaty, which was signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify the compliance.Russia has offered to extend the New START that expires in February 2021, while the Trump administration has pushed for a new arms control pact that would also include China. Moscow has described that idea as unfeasible, pointing at Beijing’s refusal to negotiate any deal that would reduce its much smaller nuclear arsenal.In a statement Wednesday marking the 10th anniversary of signing the New START, the Russian Foreign Ministry hailed the treaty as an instrument that helps ensure predictability in the nuclear sphere and reaffirmed Moscow’s offer to extend it without any preconditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-slams-us-arguments-for-low-yield-nukes/story-nlwMwZZLJ9PFeiQPyBpodL.html
29-04-2020||World||Remdesivir shows ‘clear-cut’ effect in treating coronavirus: Anthony Fauci||A major new study proves that the antiviral drug remdesivir is effective in saving people with serious cases of COVID-19, top US doctor Anthony Fauci said Wednesday.Fauci, speaking at the White House, said “the data shows remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery.”This proves “that a drug can block this virus,” he said, comparing the discovery to the fight for AIDS therapies four decades ago.Fauci said a smaller Chinese study released separately on Wednesday showing no benefits from remdesivir was “not an adequate study.” Full NIAID statement on remdesivir trial results: pic.twitter.com/bsnDQGVnPaFauci, the top US scientist for infectious diseases and a key advisor on President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force, said US pharmaceutical giant Gilead was in talks with the government to get an early release of remdesivir for the neediest cases.That would mean seriously ill patients, because the study only examined people already hospitalized, rather than those with mild or early symptoms, he said.As a veteran of the race to find therapies during the HIV/AIDS crisis starting in the 1980s, Fauci said the results reminded him of early breakthroughs during that era.“It was reminiscent of 34 years ago in 1986 when we were struggling for drugs for HIV and we had nothing,” he said.“It’s opening the door to the fact that we now have the capability of treating” patients.Fauci stressed that the US study is reliable, unlike the “underpowered” version published in The Lancet after research in Wuhan, China.“It is the first truly high-powered, randomized placebo control trial,” Fauci said.He said the Food and Drug Administration would begin by making remdesivir “easily available to those who need it,” but a mass market release would need more complex approval.“The FDA, literally as we speak, is working with Gilead to figure out mechanisms to make this easily available to those who need it,” he said.The FDA will work “very expeditiously” on wider approval.Trump called the study “a beginning” and “a very positive event.”The study by China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in China, published earlier in The Lancet, found that remdesivir “did not provide significant benefits over placebo.”The Wuhan study was conducted in 237 COVID-19 patients, half of whom were given remdesivir. The other half were treated as a control group and given standard antibiotics. The mortality rate was the same in both groups, around 14 percent of each.“I don’t like to pooh-pooh other studies, but that’s not an adequate study and everybody in the field feels that,” Fauci said.sms/ft||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remdesivir-shows-clear-cut-effect-in-treating-coronavirus-anthony-fauci/story-deJLJLTQMTyJyorClcAT5L.html
29-04-2020||World||Data on Gilead drug raises hopes in pandemic fight, Fauci calls it ‘highly significant’||A top U.S. health official said Gilead Sciences Inc’s experimental antiviral drug remdesivir is likely to become the standard of care for COVID-19 after early results from a key clinical trial on Wednesday showed it helped certain patients recover more quickly from the illness caused by the coronavirus.Preliminary results from a U.S. government trial show that patients given remdesivir had a 31% faster recovery time than those who received a placebo, results hailed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, as “highly significant.”Gilead earlier on Wednesday said remdesivir helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19 in the government-run trial, and provided additional data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of illness, sending its shares up more than 7%.“The data shows that remdesivir has a clear cut significant positive effect in diminishing the time to recover. This is really quite important,” Fauci told reporters at the White House, likening it to a moment in 1986 “when we were struggling for drugs for HIV and we had nothing.”“This will be the standard of care,” Fauci predicted, adding, “The FDA, literally as we speak, is working with Gilead to figure out mechanisms to make this easily available to those who need it.”The closely watched drug has moved markets in the past few weeks following the release of several studies that painted a mixed picture of its effectiveness, and Fauci cautioned that the full data still needs to be analyzed.President Donald Trump during a White House meeting greeted Gilead’s reports as good news.Interest in Gilead’s drug has been high as there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19, and doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in severe cases, until a preventive vaccine emerges.“There’s now enough data to support consideration of access under an emergency use authorization by FDA,” former U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Twitter.Gilead provided information on two clinical trials. The study conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, met its main goal of helping patients with a range of severity of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Those results have been highly anticipated because it compares how patients who received remdesivir fared versus those given a placebo, meaning it should definitively demonstrate whether the drug provides benefit.“It is the first truly high-powered randomized placebo-controlled trial,” Fauci said.The trial’s lead researcher told Reuters on Friday that full results could come by mid-May.‘GLIMMER OF HOPE’Despite the excitement, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, global fellow at The Wilson Center in Washington, DC, said more information is needed.“While a new study offers a glimmer of hope that ... remdesivir has an effect against COVID-19, determination of its benefit for the general population must await release of pertinent details to evaluate the study’s findings and scientific analysis comparing them to other studies of the drug that have shown mixed results,” he said in a statement.Gilead also provided data on a study in severe COVID-19 patients it has conducted in dozens of medical centers, which does not have a placebo comparison but tested the drug given by intravenous infusion under five-day and 10-day regimens.In that 397-patient trial, Gilead said 62% of patients treated early with remdesivir were discharged from the hospital, compared with 49% of patients who were treated later in the course of the infection.Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey in a statement said a five-day regimen, “could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir.”Also on Wednesday, results were published by the Lancet medical journal of a trial conducted in China that concluded remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. Gilead said previously that those findings, released inadvertently by the World Health Organization last week, were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day earlier this month said the company was prepared to donate 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to hospitals dealing with severely ill patients. Regulatory approval of the drug would also clear the way for commercial sales.Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.The company is also studying the drug in patients with less severe COVID-19, but those results are not expected until later next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/data-on-gilead-drug-raises-hopes-in-pandemic-fight-fauci-calls-it-highly-significant/story-PNiW5M4qtJ7Jh0YqisJ9VN.html
29-04-2020||World||Antiviral remdesivir showed ‘no significant benefit’ in virus patients||Treating coronavirus patients with the antiviral drug remdesivir showed no “significant clinical benefits” in the first randomised trial of its kind, according to research released on Wednesday.In a study among more than 200 Covid-19 patients in Wuhan, China, published in The Lancet, doctors found no positive effects of administering the drug compared with a control group of adults.The findings were released after US pharmaceutical giant Gilead, which makes remdesivir, said a separate large-scale trial with the drug had showed positive results.“Unfortunately, our trial found that while safe and adequately tolerated, remdesivir did not provide significant benefits over placebo,” said Bin Cao from China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in China, who led the research. “This is not the outcome we hoped for.”The Wuhan study was conducted in 237 Covid-19 patients, half of whom were given remdesivir. The other half were treated as a control group and given standard antibiotics. The mortality rate was the same in both groups, around 14 percent of each. However those patients who required ventilators spend far less time on the devices than the control group -- an average of seven days compared with an average of 15 days.“No significant differences were noted between the groups in duration of oxygen support, length of hospital stay, or time to discharge or death,” the study said.The authors said the trial has several limitations, including the fact that it was stopped prematurely when patient numbers dropped too low to continue as Wuhan got a grip on the outbreak. But they called for further randomised trials of the drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antiviral-remdesivir-showed-no-significant-benefit-in-virus-patients/story-vNaAUVxJZ6falVR86Ry4TN.html
29-04-2020||World||Singapore reports 690 new Covid-19 cases, mostly foreign workers||Singapore on Wednesday reported 690 new coronavirus cases, taking the total number of Covid-19 patients, a vast majority of whom are foreigners, to 15,641, the health ministry said.Out of the 690 fresh cases, six are Singapore citizens or permanent residents while the rest of them are foreigners with work permits residing in dormitories, it said.“We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the press release that will be issued tonight,” the ministry said. “The main increase today continues to be for work permit holders residing in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of extensive testing,” said the ministry.A total of 19 of the new cases were work permit holders (foreigners), living outside dormitories, it said. It said that the total number of coronavirus cases in the country stands at 15,641. Of the new cases, 63 per cent are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing, the ministry said. Twenty two of the 1,714 confirmed cases are still in hospitals and are in critical condition. Most of the rest are stable or improving. A total of 62 more Covid-19 patients were discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Wednesday, it said.To date, 1,188 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. So far, a total of 12,183 of the 323,000 migrant workers living in dormitories - about 3.77 per cent - have tested positive, putting the spotlight on their living conditions, according to reports.Fourteen people have died to date from complications due to the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.Meanwhile, a media report said that the local transmission of the coronavirus in the general community has been low, at least up until the middle of March, based on findings by researchers from the Covid-19 research group at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).This shows that Singapore’s contact tracing efforts have been effective, according to three studies by the NCID that are among the first of their kind in the world, according to The Straits Times report.However, this also means that immunity rates are low and much of Singapore’s population remains susceptible to the virus, NCID executive director Leo Yee Sin told reporters on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-reports-690-new-covid-19-cases-mostly-foreign-workers/story-vNc9scKhfQGIXWDYC3MOXO.html

29-04-2020||World||California food for seniors plan could run out of money soon||California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s first-in-the-nation plan to pay for and deliver three meals a day to vulnerable seniors during the coronavirus crisis has less than two weeks to launch before federal funding runs out, government documents show.It wasn’t clear how many, if any, cities and counties would be delivering meals in substantial numbers by May 10, when money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency is set to end. Also unclear is how much FEMA has budgeted for the program, though it told The Associated Press there is no preset limit.FEMA says it will cover three-quarters of the cost of preparing and delivering the food made by local restaurants, which could quickly soar into tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars in the nation’s most populous state, which has 5.7 million seniors. The state, cities and counties would pick up the rest of the cost, but local governments would also get an infusion of cash from sales taxes they collect on the meals.To keep the federal money flowing, the Newsom administration must give a “detailed justification” for continuing the so-called emergency feeding program, FEMA said in an April 10 letter.“While it is anticipated that, upon successful program execution, the state will request an extension, there is no guarantee it will be granted,” the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services acknowledged in a planning document.Without an extension, FEMA said it would cover costs “necessary to end these services in an orderly manner” for 15 days beyond May 10.Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, said the state had not submitted a request for an extension and would review the program before deciding.“The number of meals served will depend on the number of counties that decide to participate,” he said in an email.California requested the program in a letter to FEMA on April 1 and got approval nine days later. Newsom didn’t announce it and provide details on its scope until two weeks later.Newsom gave no hint of the tight timeframe for financing when he unveiled the program Friday. Also, while predicting that over a million seniors could benefit, he didn’t illuminate a key element for qualifying for $66-a-day meals: Recipients must be unable to purchase groceries and cook themselves.It isn’t clear how cities and counties could quickly determine who fits that criteria. They also are just beginning to figure out what restaurants would cook the meals and how they would be delivered.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti spoke hopefully Monday of having the first meals delivered by taxis next week, building off an existing food-delivery program. He didn’t estimate how many people could be served.Los Angeles County, the nation’s largest with 10 million residents, and neighboring San Bernardino County are developing plans, with no estimate for when they might be ready.California Pizza Kitchen was among the restaurants hoping to get a chance at preparing the meals, calling it “exciting.” But it said it was waiting for more details to determine if it would apply.At Nightbird in San Francisco, owner Kim Alter said in an email that the restaurant is “working to be a part of this.”“No word yet as to how it will play out,” Alter said.The meal plan was announced as Newsom and other state officials have started discussing easing stay-at-home orders imposed last month to deter the spread of the virus.Newsom has said the restrictions will likely last longer for people 65 and older because they are at greater risk of more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.To be eligible for the meal program, seniors must either live alone or with one other person who is eligible. They can’t earn more than $74,940 per year, or $101,460 for a household of two, and they must have documented exposure to the coronavirus or be at high risk of exposure. Anyone already getting money from other federal food programs would be ineligible.Along with getting isolated seniors free, nutritious food, the intent was to generate income for cities and counties and steer business to restaurants devastated after sit-down dining rooms shuttered. The meals can’t include sugary drinks or high-salt options.Jot Condie, who heads the California Restaurant Association, predicted that virtually any restaurant could qualify, from high-end steakhouses to small mom-and-pop diners. The group previously said as many as one-third of the state’s restaurants might never reopen.“For a restaurant that qualifies this will be ... the only predictable business that they have,” Condie said. “It’s three meals a day to a set population.”Chris Hoene, executive director of the nonprofit California Budget & Policy Center, which advocates for low-income people, said that even if it takes a few months to get the meals to vulnerable seniors, “the need is still going to be there.”“We are a big state. And whenever we put new systems in place, it always takes more time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-food-for-seniors-plan-could-run-out-of-money-soon/story-vV4Tfza7aS63dxG1Q9EWEK.html
29-04-2020||World||Pence flouts guidelines on masks, US toll goes past Vietnam War||Vice President Mike Pence toured a medical facility in Minnesota Tuesday without a face mask or covering. He and the White House coronavirus task force that he leads have so assiduously canvassed Americans to wear in public places where social-distancing rules are impossible to follow.The vice-president, who has been a staid and amiable contrast to his flamboyant and scrappy boss, interacted with healthcare workers, officials and and patients, who all wore masks, as is the policy at the facility, Mayo Clinic, which said in a tweet, since deleted, that Pence had been told about it. Pence defended himself telling reporters later, “As vice president of the United States I’m tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis, and everyone who is around me is tested for the coronavirus. He added that he wanted to to look workers and researchers “in the eye and say thank you”.At around that time, the number of reported and confirmed Covid-19 infections in the United States crept past the million-mark. And by Wednesday morning it had gone up to 1.01 million, with 24,385 new cases in the last 24 hours. Fatalities over the same period went up by 2,096 to 58,368, to cross another grim milestone. The novel coronavirus has now killed Americans than the 58,220 who perished in the Vietnam War. Face masks or coverings have been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and repeatedly endorsed by Pence and the task force to prevent transmission of the virus by infected but asymptomatic people, specially in public places where the six-foot rule is difficult to observe.Pence’s boss, President Donald Trump has been leery of masks from day one and, as he touted questionable cures and therapeutics such as disinfectants most recently, clearly rejected it for himself. It is only a recommendation and “I don’t see it for myself”, he said announcing the measure on April 3, .Many states, specially the hardest hit such as New York and New Jersey, have since made face coverings mandatory in public places, such as grocery stores. pharmacies.Face coverings and social-distancing rules will be required increasingly as states begin reopening businesses and are expected to be continued for the foreseeable future.As the United States seeks to find a way out of the crisis, it has found itself confronting, for the first time during the epidemic, the prospect of food shortages. President Trump on Tuesday used his war powers under a cold-war era law to order meat processing companies to stay open and keep the food supply chains intact and running. At least 20 plants have closed in recent days due to high incidence of infections and deaths among their workers, according to an analysis by the Washington Post.“The food supply chain is breaking,” John H. Tyson, chairman of the board at Tyson’s, one of the country’s largest meat processors, wrote in a full-page newspaper ad in multiple publications Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pence-flouts-guidelines-on-masks-us-toll-goes-past-vietnam-war/story-74BDjFbrGT45MIt9UmyalJ.html

He has earlier had stints at the permanent mission in Geneva and as director in the foreign secretary’s office and joint secretary (UN, economic and social).The other key appointment announced on Wednesday was that of Deepak Mittal, an IFS officer of the 1998 batch and currently joint secretary (Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran) as the next ambassador to Qatar.Mittal, who played a key role in handling the face-off with Pakistan following the suicide attack in Pulwama last year and the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor, is expected to take up his assignment shortly.The current envoy to Qatar, P Kumaran, is expected to be appointed the new high commissioner to Singapore. JP Singh, currently India’s consul general in Istanbul, is considered a front-runner to replace Mittal in the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran desk as he has served as the deputy high commissioner in Islamabad. Namrata S Kumar, an IFS officer of the l997 batch and currently deputy director general of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, was appointed as the next ambassador to Slovenia. She is expected to take up her assignment shortly.India’s current ambassador to the Philippines, Jaideep Mazumdar, an IFS officer of the 1989 batch, was named the next envoy to Austria. He too is expected to take up his assignment shortly.Piyush Srivastava, an IFS officer of the 1998 batch and currently joint secretary (north), has been appointed as the next ambassador to Bahrain.The high commissioner to the UK, Ruchi Ghanshyam, who too is set to retire this month, is expected to be replaced by Gaitri Kumar, currently the envoy to Belgium, Luxembourg and the European Union.Santosh Jha, currently India’s envoy to Uzbekistan, is tipped to be the new ambassador in Brussels, the people said.The Covid-19 crisis and subsequent travel restrictions have delayed the movement of several Indian envoys to postings abroad. They are now expected to begin moving out when the nationwide lockdown is eased next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ts-tirumurti-is-india-s-new-permanent-representative-to-the-un-to-replace-syed-akbaruddin/story-VQi25i82jI3Qd4hLEYK8eL.html
29-04-2020||World||Israel marks its Independence Day under coronavirus lockdown||Israelis celebrated their Independence Day at home Wednesday amid a nationwide lockdown aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The national holiday, which honours the creation of Israel after the end of the British Mandate in 1948, is usually a festive occasion, with people heading to the beach, hosting barbecues and watching fireworks.This year, however, the government has banned public gatherings and ordered people to remain within 100 meters (yards) of their homes unless they require medicine or have other vital needs. Public transportation has been shut down and police are manning roadblocks to prevent travel.The Israeli air force devoted its annual fly-by to health workers, with four planes crisscrossing the nation and performing aerial acrobatics over hospitals and medical centers.President Reuven Rivlin hosted an annual televised event in which the president usually presents awards to soldiers. This year, the awards ceremony was postponed and the event was reconfigured as an online, star-studded tribute to medical workers and security forces, with performances by famous musicians and comedians but no live audience.In a video message, Rivlin thanked Israelis for their “resilience.”“I wish us all a happy and healthy year in which we can enjoy every moment of Israeli normality that we all miss so much,” he said.Wednesday is also the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Dachau, a Nazi death camp. In honor of the occasion, the orchestras of the Israeli military and the U.S. Navy’s European command played the Israeli national anthem for Abba Naor, a Holocaust survivor in his 90s who lives in Israel.The performance was made via a Zoom call, with each musician and the two conductors performing remotely. Naor, calling in from his home, stood for the national anthem and then thanked U.S. forces for liberating the camp and saving his life.Israel has reported more than 15,700 cases and at least 210 deaths from the coronavirus. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, but can cause severe illness or death, particularly in elderly patients and those with underlying health problems.Israel imposed sweeping restrictions on movement and ordered most businesses to close in mid-March. It has recently begun easing those restrictions as the rate of new infections appears to have stabilized.The Independence Day lockdown is set to be lifted Wednesday night. Most shops will then be allowed to reopen, provided they meet regulations on social distancing and hygiene. People are required to wear masks in public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-marks-its-independence-day-under-coronavirus-lockdown/story-jfcbUPKSOrRlQV9vOZRZYK.html
29-04-2020||World||What you need to know today about the virus outbreak||With many U.S. states lifting their restrictions according to their own timetables and needs, Americans are facing a bewildering multitude of decisions about what they should and should not do to protect themselves and their neighbors.Is it safe now to join the crowds at the beach or go out to eat at a favorite restaurant? To visit the elderly parents you haven’t seen in nearly two months? The less-than-satisfying answer from the experts is: It depends.WHAT’S HAPPENING TODAY:— The U.S. economy shrank at a 4.8% annual rate last quarter as the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of the country and began triggering a recession that will end the longest expansion on record.— A coronavirus vaccine is still months or years away, but groups that peddle misinformation about immunizations are already taking aim, potentially eroding confidence in what could be humanity’s best chance to defeat the virus.— In cities around the world, public transport systems are the key to getting workers back on the job and restarting devastated economies, yet everything from trains to buses to ferries to bicycles will have to be re-imagined for the coronavirus era.— It starts with pulling on head-to-toe protective gear. Then comes a brisk walk down a hospital corridor, triple-gloved hands pushing a rattling anesthesia cart toward a door that leads to a frightened patient, gasping for air. Hundreds of times every week during this pandemic, doctors and nurses treating critically ill COVID-19 patients steel themselves for a procedure that remains anything but routine.— Seniors are at greater risk from COVID-19, and they now face added anxiety due to delays obtaining Medicare coverage. The delays stem from the closure of local Social Security offices to protect workers and the public during the pandemic.— China, taking a step toward a return to business as normal, announced that its previously postponed national legislature session will be held in late May.___WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

The move by UK is being seen as part of efforts to reach a target of 1 lakh tests per day, in order to tackle the pandemic that has claimed 21,678 lives so far and infected 161,145 people nationwide.Hospitals have seen a major drop in non-coronavirus patients, prompting health officials to appeal to the people to continue to access the National Health Service as they did before the pandemic struck. Hospitals have restructured facilities to cater to Covid-19 and other patients.According to campaign group Macmillan Cancer Support, nearly 18,000 people with cancer in England could die as the pandemic has forced hospitals to suspend treatment and deterred patients from seeking NHS care. Cancer should not be ‘the forgotten C’, it said.Research by the group shows that an extra 6,270 people in England recently diagnosed with cancer could die from it over the next 12 months as a direct result of the disruption caused by coronavirus, and the additional toll taking into account all those living with cancer could be 17,915.Alvia Lai, of the University College London who led the research, said: “Our findings demonstrate the serious potential for unintended consequences of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which may negatively impact on patients with cancer and other underlying health conditions.”The UK-wide death toll from coronavirus was set to increase substantially when the government begins releasing figures across all locations, not only from hospitals, from Wednesday. Thousands more have reported died in care homes, hospices and private homes.Health secretary Matt Hancock announced that groups eligible for coronavirus testing will be extended to those over 65 years old and those who work outside the home. All NHS staff, hospital patients, care home workers and their elderly residents would be able to book tests even if they did not have symptoms, he said.The expansion of eligibility is expected to be a key factor in plans to ease lockdown restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-triggers-collateral-damage-fears-18-000-uk-cancer-patients-may-die/story-DVZOzVCk2vRpMwcfNEA8gI.html
29-04-2020||World||UN human rights expert accuse Myanmar army of fresh abuses||The UN’s human rights expert on Myanmar has called for a new investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity during recent fighting in the Southeast Asian country as she approaches the end of her appointment. Yanghee Lee, whose formal title is special rapporteur, accused Myanmar’s military of “inflicting immense suffering” on ethnic minorities in Rakhine and Chin states, where the government is battling the Arakan Army, a well-armed and well-trained guerrilla force representing the Buddhist Rakhine minority. “While the world is occupied with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Myanmar military continues to escalate its assault in Rakhine state, targeting the civilian population,” Lee said in a statement issued Wednesday in Geneva. She accused the military of “systematically violating the most fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and human rights,” and said its conduct toward civilians “may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.” Lee, a South Korean whose term ends this month, has been a sharp critic of Myanmar’s military since her appointment in 2014, focusing especially on human rights abuses against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Rakhine state. In August 2017, the military -- known as the Tatmadaw -- launched what it called a clearance campaign in northern Rakhine state in response to attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group. The campaign forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. Security forces were accused of mass rapes and killings and burning thousands of homes. The International Court of Justice in the Netherlands agreed last year to rule on charges of genocide lodged against Myanmar. U.N. agencies and human rights organizations have extensively documented atrocities. Myanmar’s government says it acted justifiably and denies any major abuses. Lee linked the current situation in Rakhine and Chin to the government’s actions against the Rohingya, for which no senior officers have faced justice and token punishments were given to a handful of low-ranking security personnel. “Having faced no accountability, the Tatmadaw continues to operate with impunity. For decades, its tactics have intentionally maximized civilian suffering; we all know what they did to the Rohingya in 2017,” Lee said. “They are now targeting all civilians in the conflict area, with people from Rakhine, Rohingya, Mro, Daignet and Chin communities being killed in recent months. Their alleged crimes must be investigated in accordance with international standards, with perpetrators being held accountable.” The Arakan Army, which says it is seeking self-determination, has engaged in increasingly fierce combat with government forces since late 2018. Lee said government air and artillery strikes in recent weeks have killed and injured scores of adults and children. “More than 157,000 people have been displaced, and hundreds including women and children killed and wounded since the conflict started,” she said. Lee was also critical of the Arakan Army, which she said “has also conducted its hostilities in a manner that has had negative impacts on civilians, including kidnapping local officials and parliamentarians.” She added that the guerrilla force had declared a unilateral cease-fire, citing the need to combat the spread of Covid-19. “The focus of all authorities, including security forces, should be on dealing with the Covid-19 crisis,” Lee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-human-rights-expert-accuse-myanmar-army-of-fresh-abuses/story-dlLhdaVPMW8qbbMlxoCLiJ.html

Several professionals of Indian origin are likely to benefit from the extension.Home secretary Priti Patel also announced that those granted one-year extension will not be required to pay the controversial immigration health surcharge of 400 pounds per person per year. Levying the surcharge on medical staff is under review.The extension is for nearly 3,000 people whose visas expired or are due to expire between March 31 and October 1. Over 100 doctors, nurses and other health professionals have passed away after contracting the virus, including several Indian origin doctors.Patel said: “We are incredibly grateful to all overseas health and care workers fighting this invisible enemy. These extensions will be automatic, free and include exemption from the Immigration Health Surcharge”.She also confirmed that family members and dependants of healthcare workers who pass away as result of contracting the virus will be offered immediate indefinite leave to remain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/permanent-uk-residency-for-kin-of-infected-medical-staff-who-die/story-lSJHZHYASsUMCw2cvmcPWK.html
29-04-2020||World||China sets May date for Parliament in Beijing in show of post-Covid confidence||China will hold its most important political event, the annual session of its rubber-stamp Parliament in the third week of May after postponing it for more than 10 weeks because of the Covid-19 outbreak, official media announced Wednesday.The reconvening of the Two Sessions, as it is known here, on May 21 signals that China has effectively brought the outbreak in control.The decision to allow thousands to come to Beijing from across China is a show of confidence by the Chinese government as it tries to show to the world its success in containing the virus. Official news agency, Xinhua said China would begin its annual Two Sessions meeting on May 21, when thousands of delegates to the National People’s Congress (NPC), the legislature, as well as to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the top political consultative body, gather in the capital for around 10 days.The sessions are usually held early March.The upcoming session, however, could be shortened, a separate state media report said, quoting Parliamentarian delegates.During the choreographed meeting, about 3,000 national legislators from across China gather in Beijing to review work reports from the Communist Party of China-led central government as well as the country’s highest courts and the budget including for national defence for the year ahead.The announcement was made as Beijing health authorities said on Wednesday that the Capital’s emergency response level to Covid-19 would be lowered from the first to the second level from Thursday.On Wednesday, the Chinese mainland reported reports 22 new confirmed Covid-19 cases, with 21 imported cases, and 26 new asymptomatic ones in the past 24 hours.No deaths from the disease has been reported from the disease for nearly two weeks, health authorities said.China-Australia spatMeanwhile, the ongoing diplomatic tussle between China and Australia seem set to deepen with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying it was “entirely reasonable” for the world to ask for an international assessment into the origins of the pandemic.The coronavirus first emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year before spreading to rest of China and the world: Until Wednesday it had killed more than 2 lakh people, sickened over 3 million and battered the world economy to its worst state in several decades.Morrison’s call for an international inquest has been aggressively opposed by Chinese diplomats who have said Australia should stop resorting to “petty tricks”.On Wednesday, the Chinese embassy in Canberra, said on its website that details of a call between the Chinese envoy and Australian officials had first been “obviously leaked by some Australian officials” and it needed to set the record straight.“The Embassy of China doesn’t play petty tricks, this is not our tradition. But if others do, we have to reciprocate,” an embassy spokesperson said in the statement.Chinse state media has strongly criticised Australia’s stand.Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the nationalistic Global Times said on Chinese social media that Australia was always making trouble.“It is a bit like chewing gum stuck on the sole of China’s shoes. Sometimes you have to find a stone to rub it off,” Hu wrote.China is Australia’s largest trading partner and Canberra has accused Beijing of economic coercion after the Chinese ambassador threatened a boycott of Australian goods and universities by Chinese citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sets-may-date-for-parliament-in-beijing-in-show-of-post-covid-confidence/story-NWrg3FHNFUv3mb3wvF9HVJ.html

In most places, some shops will open on May 11, and socializing will be permitted in outdoor cafés, bars, as well as services in churches and mosques at one third of their capacity.Territories that by that point keep the epidemic at bay will be granted further relaxation of restrictions in restaurants, cinemas, theatres and museums by the end of May. Preschools will reopen then but only for parents who need to work, since in-classroom education won’t resume until the new school year in September.Barring any worsening of the outbreak, capacity in venues will be increased toward mid-June and beaches will open before gradually settling into a “new normal” that will allow domestic travel. International travel still needs to be sorted out by the European Union, Spain says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-reports-325-new-covid-19-deaths-total-deaths-cross-24-000/story-hRmOu2WhHIztBVrI0f70SO.html

Assadullah Khalid, and the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, U.S. Gen. Scott Miller, visited the base, known as Army Commando Corps, praising achievements of the Afghan commandos and their dedication in defending the country.Also Wednesday, a sticky bomb attached to vehicle detonated elsewhere in Kabul, wounding three civilians, according to Firdaus Faramarz, spokesman for the Kabul police chief. No one claimed responsibility for that attack.The Taliban have continued to attack security outposts, even as the U.S. and NATO proceed with a full troop withdrawal that is set to be completed next year under a deal signed at the end of February between the U.S. peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, and the Taliban.On Sunday, Khalilzad called on the country’s feuding political leaders to set their differences aside to combat the coronavirus pandemic and advance the stalled peace agreement signed with the Taliban.He said Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah, who each declared himself the victor in September’s election, should “put the interest of the country ahead of their own” during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began last week.He urged the government and the Taliban to carry out a prisoner exchange that was part of the U.S.-Taliban agreement. The agreement had called for the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 government personnel held by the insurgents.To date, Ghani has released 550 detainees based on age, vulnerability to the virus and time served behind bars. The Taliban have not said if those released are among the prisoners referred to in the agreement. For their part, the Taliban have freed 60 prisoners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-bomber-kills-3-injures-15-in-afghanistan-s-capital-kabul-report/story-frJ4VNc3kv8GOjuEzWfLaN.html

Despite all of this, a blessing came to us,” he added. And so, CovidMarie it was.Weeks earlier, two mothers in southeastern India had had similar ideas, apparently encouraged by a doctor in the hospital where their babies were delivered.One was called Corona Kumar and the other Corona Kumari.“I told them this would help create awareness about the disease and remove the stigma around it,” said S.F. Basha, the doctor. “To my surprise, they agreed.”Not to be outdone, a migrant-worker couple in India’s northeast stranded thousands of kilometres from their home in the desert state of Rajasthan decided to name their child Lockdown.“We named him Lockdown remembering all the problems we had to face during this tough time,” local media reports quoted the father Sanjay Bauri as saying.Tupas, the father of baby Covid Marie, said that while he had fielded criticism on social media for his unorthodox choice, he would not be swayed.“She might experience bullying, but I’ll just teach my daughter to be a good person,” he said.“We didn’t have second thoughts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-corona-and-lockdown-the-newborns-named-amid-virus-pandemic/story-nd42ihdj33Fq2ZYtBtdd5N.html

29-04-2020||World||Beijing scrambles jets and ships to expel US warship in South China Sea: PLA||China scrambled aircraft and sortied ships to track and expel a frontline US warship from near a Beijing-controlled island chain in the South China Sea on Tuesday, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has said.Accusing the guided-missile destroyer USS Barry of carrying out a “provocative act” and violating Chinese sovereignty, the PLA’s southern command said the intrusion of the American warship prompted it to “track, monitor, verify, identify and expel” it.A Chinese military spokesperson later had a piece of advice for the US military: Focus on Covid-19 prevention at home rather destabilising regional peace and security.The incident took place off the Paracel Islands, known as the Xisha Islands in China, and the Hoang Sa Archipelago in Vietnam, in the South China Sea.A cluster of more than 30 islands, they are controlled by Beijing but also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.China claims nearly the entire South China Sea but those claims are disputed by several maritime neighbours including Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia besides Vietnam and Taiwan (which China says is a breakaway region.) The route taken by the US warship, which also earlier crossed the Taiwan Straits, prompted strong response and reaction from China.“The US’ provocative actions seriously violated international law and related norms, seriously violated Chinese sovereignty and security interests, and intentionally increased regional security risks,” a statement posted on the military unit’s WeChat social media account quoted Li Huamin, a command spokesperson, as saying.Referring to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Li added that the incident could have “…easily caused an accident, and is against the context in which the international community is making concentrated efforts to fight the pandemic and the common will of countries in the South China Sea to safeguard peace and stability in the region”.“We urge the US side to focus on the epidemic prevention and control on its homeland, contribute more to the international fight against the pandemic and immediately stop military actions against regional security, peace and stability,” Li said.According to the US-based non-profit US Naval Institute, the The FONOP (freedom of navigation operations) from the Japan-based USS Barry closely follows the destroyer transiting the Taiwan Strait twice this month.“A day after Barry’s April 22 transit, the Chinese (aircraft carrier) Liaoning Carrier Strike Group also transited the Taiwan Strait. In addition to the presence operations, the destroyer has been active in the South China Sea operating with guided-missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill (CG-52) and amphibious assault ship USS America (LHA-6) off the coast of Malaysia near an ongoing dispute over mineral exploration between Malaysia and China,” the USNI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/focus-on-covid-19-at-home-beijing-to-us-after-expelling-us-warship-from-south-china-sea/story-NdLhhq4Rcqx6AFbI4I0BcM.html
29-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Disrupted access to contraceptives could result in 7mn unwanted pregnancies, says UN||Ongoing lockdowns and major disruptions to health services during the COVID-19 pandemic could leave 47 million women in low and middle-income countries unable to use modern contraceptives, leading to seven million unintended pregnancies in the coming months, according to data released by the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and partners.The agencies estimate that the number of women unable to access family planning or facing unintended pregnancies, gender-based violence and other harmful practices, could “skyrocket” by millions due to the crisis.“This new data shows the catastrophic impact that COVID-19 could soon have on women and girls globally,” UNFPA Executive Director Natalia Kanem said on Tuesday. “The pandemic is deepening inequalities, and millions more women and girls now risk losing the ability to plan their families and protect their bodies and their health,” Kanem said.As a clear view of the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is only beginning to take shape, experts estimate that the human cost could be extraordinary. The economic and physical disruptions caused by the disease could have vast consequences for the rights and health of women and girls, the new analysis by the UNFPA and partners noted.Globally, around 450 million women across 114 low and middle-income countries use contraceptives, the study said.“Significant levels of lockdown-related disruption over 6 months could leave 47 million women in low- and middle-income countries unable to use modern contraceptives, leading to a projected 7 million additional unintended pregnancies. Six months of lockdowns could result in an additional 31 million cases of gender-based violence,” it said.The pandemic is also expected to cause significant delays in programmes to end female genital mutilation and child marriage, resulting in an estimated two million more cases of FGM over the next decade than would otherwise have occurred. These delayed programmes, on top of growing economic hardships globally, could result in an estimated 13 million more child marriages over 10 years. There also will be 31 million additional cases of gender-based violence during the same period, with a further 15 million more cases expected for every three months the lockdowns continue.These figures – produced in collaboration with partners Avenir Health, Johns Hopkins University (USA) and Victoria University (Australia) – are rough estimates. The analysis said while a great deal is still unknown about how the pandemic, and the response to it, will unfold around the world, the projections offer an alarming view of the future that could confront women and girls if efforts are not urgently made to secure their welfare and ensure their rights.COVID-19 is having an enormous impact on women and girls as health systems become overloaded and facilities close, or provide a limited set of services which they need. At the same time, many women and girls also are skipping important medical check-ups for fear of contracting the virus, the study said.Disruptions to global supply chains could lead to significant shortages of contraceptives, it said, while gender-based violence – already on the increase due to the pandemic, is expected to rise still further as women are trapped at home for prolonged periods.The UNFPA is working with governments and partners to prioritise the needs of women and girls of reproductive age during the pandemic.The agency is focused on strengthening health systems, procuring and delivering essential supplies to protect health workers, ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence services, and promoting risk communication and community engagement.“Women’s reproductive health and rights must be safeguarded at all costs. The services must continue; the supplies must be delivered; and the vulnerable must be protected and supported,” Kanem said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-disrupted-access-to-contraceptives-could-result-in-7mn-unwanted-pregnancies-says-un/story-JrZI1lVs5EU99chIn0mA7O.html
29-04-2020||World||Over 2 lakh H-1B workers could lose their right to be in US by June||Manasi Vasavada has less than three weeks left before she loses her legal right to be in the country. The dental practice in Passaic County, New Jersey, where Vasavada, 31, has worked for almost two years closed its doors in mid-March due to Covid-19. She has been on an unpaid leave of absence ever since. Vasavada is in the country on an H-1B visa, a temporary visa program designed for people with specialized skills. H-1B recipients can only remain in the country legally for 60 days without being paid. Her husband Nandan Buch, also a dentist, is in the country on an H-1B visa that expires in June. They have been watching the days tick by with growing fear.There may soon come a point when the couple can’t stay and can’t go: India, their home country, has closed its borders indefinitely. They also have a combined $520,000 in student loans from the advanced dental degrees they completed at U.S. universities, which would be nearly impossible to pay back on the salaries they would earn in India. The stress has caused Buch, also 31, to start losing his hair. Neither of them is sleeping well. “Everything is really confusing and dark right now,” said Vasavada. “We don’t know where we will end up.” Also Watch | Donald Trump signs executive order, suspends issuance of green cards for 60 daysAs many as 250,000 guest workers seeking a green card in the U.S.—about 200,000 of them on H-1B visas—could lose their legal status by the end of June, according to Jeremy Neufeld, an immigration policy analyst with the Washington D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. Thousands more who are not seeking resident status may also be forced to return home, he said. About three-quarters of H-1B visas go to people working in the technology industry, though the exact levels vary year by year. Tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs in the last two months, but workers on visas are vulnerable in ways native-born workers aren’t. H-1B visas, for instance, are tied to a specific location and employer who commits to paying the recipient a minimum salary. Furloughing recipients, reducing their wages, and in some cases allowing them to work from home violates visa requirements. H-1B workers who are terminated have 60-days to find another job, transfer to a different visa or leave the country. Even if they don’t lose their jobs, workers can find themselves in a dilemma if they can’t get their visas renewed during this period of disruption.The visa crisis is causing “a catastrophe at a human level and an economic level,” said Doug Rand, who worked on technology and immigration policy in the Obama administration before co-founding Boundless Immigration Inc., a company that helps people navigate the immigration system. H-1B workers often have families who also rely on their jobs for authorization to stay in the country, including children who may have spent their entire lives in the U.S. “It’s just a mess,” Rand said. In a letter sent to the State and Homeland Security departments on April 17, TechNet, a lobbying group whose members include Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, joined a coalition of trade groups calling for relief for foreign-born workers. The letter requested a delay in work authorization expiration dates until at least Sept. 10. “Without action, these issues will lead to hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs and have profound negative economic effects,” the letter read.The tech industry is crucial to supporting offices working remotely, helping doctors provide telehealth services and keeping students learning at home, said Alex Burgos, senior vice president of federal policy and government relations at TechNet. ‘We’ve seen the administration extend tax filing deadlines,” he said, and similar flexibility in visa programs makes sense “because no one here is at fault in any way.”The Trump administration has not responded to the letter. A U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson declined to say if the agency would extend visa deadlines but said it may provide special support for people affected by circumstances beyond their control when requested. The administration has taken a consistently hard-line stance on immigration and foreign-born workers. The number of non-immigrant visas issued in 2019 declined for the fourth consecutive year, to 8.7 million from 10.9 million in 2015, according to the State Department. Last month, the department closed embassies and consulate operations with little guidance to those who risk falling into illegal status. In-person services at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a unit of the Department of Homeland Security, have been suspended since March 18 and won’t resume until June 4 at the earliest, a 78-day gap in service. On April 20, President Donald Trump tweeted that he planned a temporary ban on all immigration to protect American jobs; the following day he announced an executive order blocking most people coming from outside the U.S. from receiving green cards for 60 days. This raised the threat of further disruptions for companies who employ many foreign-born workers. On the day the president announced his executive order, Luis von Ahn, co-founder and chief executive of the language-learning startup Duolingo Inc., posted a message on Twitter saying a green card ban would force the company to move jobs abroad. Von Ahn is an immigrant from Guatemala, and one-fifth of Duolingo’s 250-person staff are on H-1Bs or other visas. The company plans to boost staff by 50% to keep up with a spike in usage that corresponds with the pandemic. “We have definitely felt the practical impact of processing delays,” said Duolingo spokesman Sam Dalsimer. ‘There’s also a psychological impact on employees whose futures and abilities to remain here are even more uncertain than ever.’ In one case, Duolingo has been trying to hire an engineer who was recently let go from another tech company. The worker is in the U.S. on an O-1 visa, which is designated for individuals with extraordinary ability. Now with added pandemic delays, Duolingo estimates he’ll have to wait 6 to 9 months for his visa and work authorization. In the meantime, he can’t work for the company or leave the U.S.The companies facing the hardest decisions, though, are those reducing staff in response to the pandemic. Some are choosing to furlough U.S.-born workers and fire foreign employees whose visas require them to be paid. Others are choosing to keep H-1B workers on staff to maintain their legal status, while firing U.S. workers. There’s risk in either approach, because employers who treat workers differently based on their immigration status expose themselves to potential discrimination lawsuits, according to immigration and employment lawyer Rebecca Bernhard, partner at Dorsey & Whitney LLP. For some workers, a stable future in the U.S. suddenly seems distant. Shawn Noronha, a 23-year-old Australian living in San Francisco, was let go from his job at a fintech startup, in January. He found a new position with an enterprise software startup willing to sponsor his visa. But before he could get to an Australian consulate to update his paperwork Covid-19 hit. Noronha changed his status from a working visa to a tourist visa, which gives him until the end of June to stay in the U.S. He is spending his free time baking, taking walks and learning Python, a programming language. But without a regular paycheck he’s eating into his savings. The recent tweets from President Trump about tightening restrictions on immigration have him questioning his choice to migrate to the U.S. ‘It’s made me think, have I made the right choice?” said Noronha. “Should I just go back home and maybe chase the American dream later on in life?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-200-000-h-1b-workers-could-lose-their-legal-right-to-be-in-us-by-june/story-HY2BiCMeBzAIAtaqpDIVtN.html

While there is nothing wrong it in, what makes Becca Brown’s move interesting is the fact that she has refused to donate any of these to healthcare workers in the UK, saying the government should have been more prepared.Brown’s story has been reported in every major Brtish publication. She lives in Portsmouth, about 100 kilometres from London, and has amassed £2,500 worth of medical equipment.Brown’s collection includes simple 500 surgical masks, military style face masks, shoe covers, face shields, surgical gloves and other medical items.She is using some of these vital equipment to paint on, saying it makes the “perfect canvas”, according to British media.In her defence, Brown says she has an elderly aunt to look after due to which she stockpiled these medical equipment to avoid unnecessary trips to shops, according to media reports.The UK, meanwhile, came together on Tuesday for a minute’s silence in the honour of hundreds of healthcare and other workers who have lost their lives on the frontline of the coronavirus fightback across the country.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who just recovered from a severe coronavirus attack, led the tributes with UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak at 10 Downing Street for the National Health Service (NHS) and other key workers across care homes and public transport.So far, 82 staff members of the UK’s National Health Scheme (NHS) are known to have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, including many with their roots in India.“Nothing can make up for the tragic loss of a loved one during this pandemic. We owe a huge debt to those who die in service to our nation and are doing everything we can to protect them,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.The UK government has announced a new time-bound insurance scheme for the families of such public sector healthcare workers who lost their lives while on duty during the pandemic, worth 60,000 pounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-woman-has-stockpiled-covid-19-kits-worth-2-500-says-won-t-donate-to-healthcare-workers-report/story-JBgCXhasK9F1xXK0l2wKFN.html
29-04-2020||World||Canada plans to ease Covid-19 lockdown restrictions||Even as Canada has crossed 50,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection, the Government has released new guidelines for gradual easing of restrictions across the country.The Government also published new projections for the toll the pandemic is having. The new short-term modelling forecasts that by May 5, the country will record between 53,191 and 66,835 cases and between 3,277 and 3,883 deaths.Those numbers on Tuesday night were at 50,015 and 2,859, respectively. At the same time, public health authorities pointed out to a pattern of slowing of coronavirus-related caseload, with the doubling rate now at 16 days against three days earlier.However, officials warned that the country could be beset by a second wave of infections if people were careless about safety precautions like social distancing going ahead. During his daily media briefing, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, “The measures we have taken so far are working. In fact, in many parts of the country, the curve has flattened. But we are not out of the woods yet.”Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Federal Government has worked out guidelines with provincial and territorial administrations about the path ahead. According to a statement from the PMO, they “agreed to a set of common principles for restarting the Canadian economy, based on shared understanding and appreciation of what science and experts are telling us.” It also acknowledged the importance of restarting the economy through “a gradual approach that protects the health of Canadians” while ensuring “public health capacity for future waves of the virus.”Different jurisdictions will take different routes and time frames for this process, “in order to ease restrictions, reflecting the specific circumstances” of each province or territory. “Our priority is keeping all Canadians safe, while getting back to normal as much as we can,” Trudeau noted. Among the main principles for the criteria and measures required before easing is undertaken is that “Covid-19 transmission is controlled, so new cases are contained at a level that our health care system can manage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-plans-to-ease-covid-19-lockdown-restrictions/story-zl9IMqn2OY0KklhGprOmhP.html

The list, it says, is not comprehensive, but contains 200 names which are available in the public domain.There are 735 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Senegal and nine deaths, according to World Health organisation (WHO).Africa has so far recorded 22,239 positive cases of Covid-19, according to WHO. From zero case on March 1, the continent saw over 1,000 daily Covid-19 positive cases in the last few days of April.Based on a provisional modelling, the WHO had said earlier this month that coronavirus cases in Africa could shoot up to 10 million within three to six months.The worst affected country in the continent is South Africa. However, infections there have slowed after it began a strict lockdown, but other nations - like Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Algeria - have seen higher than average fatalities.The WHO is working with authorities there to improve patient care and reduce fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senegal-working-on-1-testing-kit-for-covid-19-say-reports-as-number-of-cases-in-africa-cross-22-000/story-1QXofDXeNatYs7aySCGzTJ.html
29-04-2020||World||How human sewage could be a silver bullet in tracking Covid-19||Since the beginning of the epidemic, researchers across the world have been tracing the spread of the coronavirus through waste water and sewage. From the first outbreak in China, several scientific studies have picked up the clear presence of Covid-19 in patients’ stools.Testing human sewage could now become a key way of tracking the pandemic’s spread -- and a precious early warning system for a feared second wave.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageResearchers have found genetic traces of Sars-Cov-2 -- as the virus is officially known -- in waste water in toilets, sewers and sewage farms from Brisbane to Paris and Amsterdam.These discoveries pose “no risk” to public health, insisted Luca Lucentini, water quality director at the Italian Institute Superior of Health (ISS), after several tests came up positive in Rome and Milan.Experts say drinking water in countries with strict treatment procedures is also safe.While the presence of the virus in faeces does not mean that it can be transmitted through them, being exposed to effluent “could pose a health risk,” warned researchers Willemijn Lodder and Ana Maria de Roda Husman from the Dutch Centre for Infectious Diseases Control in a paper in The Lancet.The centre reported late last month that it detected genetic material from the virus in waste water in Amsterdam.Precisely followed deaths’But the pair also insist that waste water could a precious “data source, indicating if the virus is circulating in the human population”.It could even allow experts to “track the virus”, French virologist Professor Vincent Marechal of the Sorbonne university in Paris told AFP.In a study of waste water in Paris -- which has yet to be validated by other scientists -- Marechal and his team found that the rise in levels of genetic material from the virus in water “followed precisely the number of (coronavirus) deaths”.Marechal is now call for a national waste water warning system in France which might help “anticipate a second wave” of the virus. Given the large number of coronavirus cases that have little or no symptoms, waste water testing could signal the presence of the virus even before the first cases are clinically confirmed in areas untouched by the epidemic or where it has ebbed. Click here for Covid-19 updates“That would allow barrier measures to be put place and give us time, a key element with this epidemic,” Marechal added.Such a system has already worked against other viruses.In a study published in 2018, researchers showed how polio being detected in waste water in Israel in 2013 gave time for a vaccination campaign to be launched, which meant no child was paralysed by the disease.Call for global test network For the Sars-Cov-2, waste water studies in several countries are still at an early stage. But some scientists are enthusiastic about their potential.“It could be used as an early warning tool for pandemic surveillance,” Dr Warish Ahmed, of the Australian public research agency CSIRO, told AFP.Having found the virus in waste water in Queensland, he said it could also be a key indicator to show if lockdown and other measures were working. “Access to this type of data could underpin... a surveillance program to identify areas where there is evidence of Covid-19 outbreaks, without requiring testing of all individuals,” Dr Warish added.He said although it was a “cost effective way of tracking community-level infection”, he warned that it should be used “in combination with other measures, such as the testing of individuals.”Its relative cheapness would also make it useful for countries that “don’t have the technical or logistic means to test the carriers” of the virus, Marechal said.He has called on the World Health Organization to set up a worldwide waste water virus detection network, which would help combat other killer diseases beyond beyond Covid-19.“It could be essential in Africa,” he said. “To protect a population, you have to safeguard water quality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-human-sewage-could-be-a-silver-bullet-in-tracking-covid-19/story-XVyRVhKyOrNeEM4TgYN4bN.html
29-04-2020||World||China’s Congress to convene next month after postponement due to coronavirus outbreak||China has decided to hold the annual meeting of its ceremonial parliament late next month after postponing it for weeks because of the coronavirus outbreak.The official Xinhua News Agency on Wednesday said the National People’s Congress would open in Beijing on May 22, according to a decision made by its standing committee, which handles most legislative affairs outside the annual two-week session of the full body.The convening of the full session, which would encompass about 3,000 members, indicates China’s growing confidence that it has largely overcome the pandemic that was first detected in China late last year.The meeting normally held in March involves bringing delegates from across the country by plane and train to Beijing, where they first meet to hear a state of the country address from Premier Li Keqiang, seated shoulder-to-shoulder in the colossal auditorium at the Great Hall of the People.It wasn’t clear from the report whether delegates would be meeting in person or virtually and there was no word on any meeting of the congress’ advisory body that meets around the same time.China on Wednesday reported a jump in imported cases of coronavirus, but no new deaths from the disease it causes.Out of 22 new cases, 21 were brought from abroad and one was a result of local transmission in the southern industrial province of Guangdong, the National Health Commission said. China, where the pandemic began, has registered 4,633 deaths from the virus among 82,858 cases.Authorities have relaxed social distancing restrictions, but have maintained strict quarantine rules on those coming from abroad or other parts of the country to ward off a second wave of virus cases as summer approaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-congress-to-convene-next-month-after-postponement-due-to-coronavirus-outbreak/story-ZbjHX1VJwiKXnW3yHFPLsJ.html

He has also indicated that the US may be looking at “a lot more money” in damages from China than the USD 140 billion being sought by Germany from Beijing for the pandemic.Leaders of the US, the UK and Germany believe that the deaths and the destruction of the global economy could have been avoided, had China shared the information about the virus in its early phases.“It’s in 184 countries, as you hear me say often. It’s hard to believe. It’s inconceivable,” Trump told reporters at White House Tuesday. “It should have been stopped at the source, which was China. It should have been stopped very much at the source, but it wasn’t. And now we have 184 countries going through hell.” The virus, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in mid-November, has killed more than two lakh people and infected over three million globally. The largest number of them are in the US: nearly 59,000 deaths and over one million infections.The massive outbreak in the US has put Trump under increasing pressure from American lawmakers to decrease US dependence on Beijing and they have also sought compensation from China.Senator Ted Cruz and his colleagues have urged Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to support the development of a fully domestic supply chain of rare earths and other minerals that are critical for manufacturing defence technologies and supporting national security.“It is clear that our dependence on China for vital rare earths threatens our US manufacturing and defence-industrial base. As the October 2018 Defence Industrial Base Report states: ‘China represents a significant and growing risk to the supply of materials deemed strategic and critical to US national security.’ [...] Ensuring a US supply of domestically sourced rare earths will reduce our vulnerability to supply disruptions that poses a grave risk to our military readiness,” the Senators wrote.The US is 100 percent import-dependent for rare earths as well as 13 other metals and minerals on the US Government Critical Minerals List and more than 75 percent import reliant for an additional 10 minerals.Congressman Brian Mast on Tuesday introduced a legislation to hold China accountable for its “coronavirus deception”. The resolution would empower the US to withhold payments on debts owed to China equal to the costs incurred by the US in response to COVID-19.“China’s total lack of transparency and mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak has cost tens of thousands of lives, millions of jobs and left untold economic destruction. Congress must hold China accountable for their cover-up and force them to pay back the taxpayer dollars that have been spent as a result,” Mast said.Cruz, member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, announced his intention to introduce a legislation to cut off Hollywood studios from assistance they receive from the Department of Defence if those studios censor their films for screening in China.This legislation is part of Sen. Cruz’s comprehensive push to combat China’s growing influence over what Americans see and hear, which includes legislation targeting information warfare from the Chinese Communist Party across higher education, sports, films, radio broadcasts, and more.Indian-American Congressman Ami Bera and Congressman Ted S. Yoho, both members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will lead a bipartisan virtual Special Order to highlight the importance of US global leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic.“If we abdicate our place as a leader in global health, there is another country eager to take the reins. China has not been subtle in asserting itself on global health issues, and often not for the benefit of other nations. China’s recent coronavirus debacle should be evidence enough that their communist regime cannot be trusted to lead with accountability, transparency, or pragmatism, traits that are essential when fighting widespread disease,” Yoho said.“As for how China would fare as a global health leader, look no further than the disastrous initial response by the WHO to coronavirus, one that was clearly influenced by Beijing. Information was slow-walked, warnings from nations like Taiwan were ignored at crucial turning points, and cooperation with outside health experts was spurned until it was too late. And it has resulted in the largest public health disaster the world has seen in over a century,” he said.In an interview to Fox News, Senator Marco Rubio alleged that if China had acted when those warnings were being made, instead of silencing the people that were talking about it, they could have limited the spread.“So there was no doubt that that was a deliberate decision made on their part. The one way to hold them accountable is to do what we should be doing anyway. That is moving the means of production to become less and less dependent upon them. What you’re going to see after this pandemic is that more and more countries are going to prioritize their healthcare manufacturing capabilities and other industries,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-again-slams-china-over-coronavirus-outbreak-says-184-countries-going-through-hell/story-x9Ess1llidCTisn7rjxWjP.html

We were rebuffed,” Pompeo said in a statement on Tuesday.“The Chinese government wouldn’t let it happen, indeed just the opposite of transparency. They kicked American journalists out and denied access to American and other Western scientists at the time that it was frankly most critical that we understand what was going on there,” he said.US officials were part of the WHO expert team delegation that travelled to China. “Upon arrival, the delegation travelled in groups to several locations, but Americans were not among those who travelled to Wuhan,” a State Department spokesperson said.The US, the spokesperson said, continues to engage with the WHO to insist that the organisation undertake substantive reform and encourage it to play its mandated global coordination role.“As Secretary Pompeo has repeatedly said, the United States supports multilateral organizations. We simply insist that they fulfil their missions, including demanding full transparency and information sharing and a willingness to speak the truth and hold member states accountable when they fail to comply,” the spokesperson said in response to a question.The United States provided USD400 million to the WHO in FY-2019, including funding from the Department of State, USAID, and other US government agencies, including Department of Health and Human Services.“FY 2020 is still underway. Previously obligated funding is not impacted by the current 60-90 day halt and review on new funding,” said the spokesperson.“The review process is under development, and will include all relevant US government departments and agencies,” said the spokesperson in response to a question.Meanwhile Senators Chris Murphy and Ed Markey, both members of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Tuesday called on Pompeo for answers as to why key public health positions based in China were eliminated and why warnings of safety and management concerns at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) were not taken seriously.“Understanding what happened at the WIV is critical to keeping Americans safe. We urgently need to fully understand the origins of this pandemic because the next pandemic will not wait,” they wrote.“Indeed, if COVID-19 did accidentally escape from this lab, we need to understand what happened and how this could have been prevented, and work with the World Health Organisation to ensure the security and safe management of sensitive bioresearch laboratories,” the senators said.“Even if the COVID-19 pandemic originated naturally through animal-to-human transmission, as many scientists believe, the State Department cables suggest the risk of a new virus emerging from a laboratory due to lax safety procedures or other accidental release remains high,” they wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rebuffed-us-efforts-to-contain-coronavirus-pompeo/story-9H2eZBhCoJRXP5HdLoGqPM.html

29-04-2020||World||Brazil’s Covid-19 deaths cross 5,000, toll higher than China’s||Brazil, the South American country worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, has registered more than 5,000 deaths from COVID-19, the health ministry announced Tuesday, pushing the toll above that of China.A record 474 deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours, with the number of infections rising to 71,886, the ministry said.China, where the virus first emerged before spreading across the world, has recorded about 4,600 deaths.The ministry said Brazil’s toll could be higher than Tuesday’s official figure of 5,107, as the cause of 1,156 further deaths are under investigation.Experts believe the overall number of COVID-19 cases could be 12 to 15 times higher, due to a large number of undetected cases given the lack of testing availability across the country’s 210 million population.Deaths among vulnerable indigenous communities rose by 15 on Monday, a jump of 50 percent in the past five days, according to the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil.President Jair Bolsonaro regularly expresses his impatience with restrictions imposed by the state governors to slow the disease’s spread and has pushed hard for economic activity to restart.Health Minister Nelson Teich, who took office earlier this month after the controversial firing of his predecessor, said last week as the death toll hit 3,000 that it was premature to attribute the rise in fatalities to a surge in COVID-19 infections.He suggested it could instead be the result of an increase in testing.Sao Paulo, the hardest-hit state with a third of the country’s cases, plans to gradually resume economic activity -- sector by sector -- from May 11.Rio de Janeiro and southeastern Minas Gerais states are preparing similar measures, while the federal district of Brasilia and southern Santa Catarina state have already resumed certain activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-covid-19-deaths-cross-5-000-toll-higher-than-china-s/story-TWACLuBqroEOIHw3nkxu0I.html
29-04-2020||World||Trump to order meat processing plants to remain open amid Covid-19 pandemic||President Donald Trump said he will take executive action Tuesday to order meat processing plants to stay open amid concerns over growing coronavirus cases and the impact on the nation’s food supply.The order will use the Defense Production Act to classify meat processing as critical infrastructure and mandate plants stay open to prevent a shortage of chicken, pork and other meat on supermarket shelves. Unions fired back, saying the White House was jeopardizing lives and prioritizing cold cuts over workers’ health.More than 20 meat packing plants have closed temporarily under pressure from local authorities and their own workers because of the virus, including two of the nation’s largest, one in Iowa and one in South Dakota. Others have slowed production as workers have fallen ill or stayed home to avoid getting sick.The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 1.3 million food and retail workers, said Tuesday that 20 food-processing and meatpacking union workers in the U.S. have died of the virus. An estimated 6,500 are sick or have been exposed while working near someone who tested positive, the union says.As a result, industry leaders have warned that consumers could see meat shortages in a matter of days. Tyson Foods Inc., one of the world’s largest food companies, ran a full-page advertisement in The New York Times and other newspapers Sunday warning, “The food supply chain is breaking.”“As pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close, even for short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,” it read.Tyson suspended operations at its pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa after a slew of infections, and Smithfield Foods halted production at its plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after an outbreak infected 853 workers there.The 15 largest pork-packing plants account for 60% of all pork processed in the U.S., and the country has already seen a 25% reduction in pork slaughter capacity, according to UFCW.A senior White House official said the administration was trying to prevent a situation in which a “vast majority” of the nation’s meat processing plants might have temporarily closed operations, reducing the availability of meat in supermarkets by as much as 80%.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before its release, said the White House was also working with the Labor Department to provide enhanced safety guidance for meatpacking workers. That will include trying to minimize the risk to workers who may be prone to serious complications from the virus, including strongly recommending those over the age of 65 and with preexisting conditions stay home.The five-page order, which was developed in consultation with industry leaders including Tyson and Smithfield, is designed, in part, to provide companies with additional liability protections in case workers get sick.Trump on Tuesday described the issue as a “legal roadblock.” The order, he said, would “solve any liability problems where they had certain liability problems and we’ll be in very good shape.”But UFCW International President Marc Perrone said that more must be done to protect the safety of workers.“Simply put, we cannot have a secure food supply without the safety of these workers,” he said in a statement, urging the administration “to immediately enact clear and enforceable safety standards” and compel companies to provide protective equipment, make daily testing available to workers, and enforce physical distancing, among other measures.Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said the administration should have acted earlier to put safety measures in place.“We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry products,” he said.And Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7, which represents 3,000 workers at the JBS meat processing plant in Greeley, Colorado, said the order “will only ensure that more workers get sick, jeopardizing lives, family’s income, communities, and of course, the country’s food supply chain.”The administration is working with companies to help them secure protective equipment, like face shields and masks, and ramp up testing, the official said.Protecting workers at meat processing plants can be especially challenging. They typically employ thousands of people who often work side-by-side carving meat, making social distancing all but impossible. Some companies have been working to reduce infections by checking workers’ temperatures, staggering breaks and altering start times. Owners said they have also done more to clean plants, slowed production lines so workers can spread out, and added plastic shields between workstations.When outbreaks have happened, local public health agencies have pushed in some cases for temporary closures so they can limit wider outbreaks in communities and conduct mass testing to determine who is carrying the virus. Some plants have also briefly closed for deep cleaning and to install new safety measures.Yet concerns about working conditions persist and have led some to walk off the job. In central Minnesota, some workers at the Pilgrim’s Pride poultry plant walked out Monday night to protest the company’s record on worker safety.Mohamed Goni, an organizer with Greater Minnesota Worker Center, said workers have complained the company is not sharing information about sick colleagues, has not implemented social distancing on the line, and that workers who were sick returned after just two or three days, and some workers who developed symptoms were not allowed to leave when they asked to go home.“The company refused, saying there would be a shortage of workers,” Goni said, adding that 80% to 85% of the plant’s workers are Somali.“They have other family members living with them — elderly, children, people with underlying conditions. So if one of them brings that to their homes, it’s going to be more worse and a more serious problem,” Goni said.Cameron Bruett, head of corporate affairs for JBS USA and Pilgrim’s, said in an email that employees are never forced to work or punished for an absence due to health reasons.“We will endeavor to keep our facilities open to help feed the nation, but we will not operate a facility if we do not believe it is safe. The health and safety of our team members remains our number one priority,” Bruett said.In South Dakota, Gov. Kristi Noem has said she hopes to see a reopening plan for Smithfield this week, but sidestepped questions Tuesday about whether she agreed with Trump’s order, which might have prevented the Sioux Falls plant from shutting down if it had been in place earlier.“We need to keep (plants) running, but we also need to protect people,” Noem said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-order-meat-processing-plants-to-remain-open-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-X0MDSd1gwIf5MiGbqiKOZI.html
29-04-2020||World||US first country with over 1 million Covid-19 cases, death toll over 58,000||The number of people infected by the coronavirus in the United States crossed one million and the fatalities jumped to nearly 59,000, but several states initiated the process to reopen their economies amidst signs of decline in both new cases and deaths.“We continue to pray for the victims as well as for those Americans who are grieving their lost ones and their loved ones. There’s never been anything like this. We suffer with one heart but we will prevail. We are coming back, and we’re coming back strong,” US President Donald Trump said at the White House during his remarks on the Paycheck Protection Program.The US on Tuesday became the first country in the world to have more than one million cases of coronavirus. It accounts for nearly one-third of the 3.1 million cases globally.With nearly 59,000 deaths, the US also accounts for one-fourth of the over 213,000 global fatalities.“Now that our experts believe the worst days of the pandemic are behind us, Americans are looking forward to the safe and rapid reopening of our country,” Trump said.“Throughout this ordeal, millions of hard-working Americans have been asked to really make tremendous, tremendous sacrifices. It is sacrifices like nobody thought would even be possible; nobody thought we would ever be talking about something like this,” he said.In California, Governor Gavin Newsom outlined the phased reopening of his state.“We are not going back to the way things were until we get to immunity or a vaccine. We will base reopening plans on facts and data, not on ideology. Not what we want. Not what we hope,” he told reporters.More than 1,800 people have died due to coronavirus in California so far. Schools and colleges, he said, could start in July-August.California and Washington were among the first two states to impose stay-at-home order. Now more than 95 per cent of the country’s 330 million population are under stay-at-home order.Texas Governor Greg Abbott has also announced first phase reopening of the state.Tennessee on Monday allowed reopening of restaurants and later this week retail outlets could resume their businesses.Pennsylvania has announced three-phase reopening of the state beginning May 3.States like South Carolina, Oregon, Oklahoma, Ohio, have announced phased reopening of their economies. The state of Utah Tuesday announced relax restrictions and offered a mask to its residents.In New York, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in the US, non-essential businesses are ordered to stay closed till May 15. New York along with other states including New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Rhode Island and Massachusetts have announced to coordinate reopening.Responding to questions, Trump said the US has done more testing that any other country in the world. “We’re doing more testing than any other country in the world by far… So, we’re going to show more cases because we’re doing much, much more testing, double than anybody else,” he said.Trump said he relied on experts, who apparently went wrong on this.“We were listening to experts and we always will listen to experts. But, the experts got it wrong. A lot of people got it wrong. And, a lot of people had no idea it would be this serious,” he said.“I listened to experts. I’ll tell you what. I did something that the experts thought I shouldn’t have done. I closed down our country and our borders. I did a ban on China from coming in, other than US citizens, and we did very strong checks on even our US citizens,” he asserted.The United States, he said, is opening up again.“I think it’s going to be very, very successful. I think that third quarter, it’s obviously a transition quarter, but I think it’s going to be okay, maybe better than okay. Then I think fourth-quarter will the great and I think next year is going to be a tremendous year for this country,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-first-country-with-over-1-million-covid-19-cases-death-toll-nears-59-000/story-JV22YIfQy1xwnr9HYU94TO.html

29-04-2020||World||Hillary Clinton endorses Joe Biden’s White House bid||Hillary Clinton endorsed Joe Biden’s White House bid on Tuesday, saying the United States needs a “real president” and not just “somebody who plays one on TV.”“I want to add my voice to the many who have endorsed you to be our president,” Clinton told Biden during a live video linkup from their respective homes.“I wish you were president right now,” said Clinton, who headed the Democratic ticket in 2016 but lost to Republican Donald Trump.“Joe Biden has been preparing for this moment his entire life,” the former First Lady said.“I’ve had the privilege to work with him,” said Clinton, who served in the US Senate with Biden and was Secretary of State for four years when he was former president Barack Obama’s vice president.Clinton said the coronavirus crisis gripping the United States -- which has by far the world’s highest death toll and caseload -- “is a moment that we need a leader, a president, like Joe Biden.“Think of what it would mean if we had a real president not just somebody who plays one on TV,” she said in a jab at Trump, Biden’s expected opponent in November.“Just think of what a difference it would make right now if we had a president who not only listened to the science with facts over fiction but brought us together,” Clinton said.Biden thanked Clinton for the endorsement, calling her “the woman who should be president of the United States right now.”Biden said that rather than accepting Clinton’s endorsement “I wish this was... my supporting your re-election as president of the United States.”“We’d have the pandemic but you would have already been prepared for it,” he said.- ‘Baggage’ -Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee to face Trump in the November 3 election although he will not be officially nominated until the party convention, which has been pushed back to August because of the virus outbreak.The 77-year-old former vice president has already been endorsed by Obama, and one-time rivals for the Democratic nomination Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, among others.Brad Parscale, Trump’s campaign manager, reacted to Clinton’s endorsement of Biden by saying on Twitter that they “both carry baggage of decades in the DC swamp.”“@realDonaldTrump beat her once & now he’ll beat her chosen candidate,” Parscale said.The Trump campaign manager also made references to Tara Reade, a former Biden staffer who has accused him of sexually assaulting her years ago, a claim his team firmly denies.Reade, who had previously accused Biden of unwanted touching, expanded on her claims in March, saying he assaulted her in August 1993.Clinton’s endorsement came as a survey published on Tuesday found that two-thirds of Americans believe the coronavirus pandemic is “very or somewhat likely” to disrupt the ability to vote in November.But a majority -- 59 percent -- of those polled by the Pew Research Center said they were confident the election will be conducted fairly and accurately.Trump on Monday dismissed allegations by Biden that he would try to delay the election.“I never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that?” Trump told reporters at the White House.The president cannot unilaterally change the date of the ballot but Biden raised concerns last week that Trump may try to do so.“Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held,” Biden said during an online fundraiser.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hillary-clinton-endorses-joe-biden-s-white-house-bid/story-52ciVzwhmBGHCJDLdJNWDI.html

The trial covering thousands of volunteers in Bristol, London, Southampton and Oxford is seen to be ahead of the nearly 80 similar projects across the globe.Reporting the data that’s yet to be peer-reviewed, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Montana said, “An investigational vaccine called ChAdOx1 MERS protected two groups of rhesus macaques from disease caused by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV is a relative of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).”“The rhesus macaque is pretty much the closest thing we have to humans,” Vincent Munster, who conducted the test on monkeys, told The New York Times, noting that scientists were still analysing the result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-vaccine-shows-promise-in-animal-test/story-DXkPjE9X5W93ca3gl8jKZP.html

The NHS issued an alert this weekend about a small number of children presenting an unusual set of symptoms, including abdominal pain and inflammation around the heart.They have required admission to intensive care, according to a report in the Health Service Journal. “I’m worried about the early signs that in rare cases, there is an impact of an autoimmune response in children that causes a significant disease,” health secretary Matt Hancock said. The Guardian reported that there had been at least 12 such cases.The UK came together on Tuesday for a minute’s silence in honour of hundreds of health care and other workers who lost their lives on the front lines of the coronavirus fightback across the country.Meanwhile, an Indian-origin London-based man, Karan Singh, has been jailed for eight months for spitting at police custody staff after lying about having Covid-19 because he was “angry”, Scotland Yard said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-fears-virus-linked-syndrome-in-children/story-deb8zWxbv6dZGol7XKCuKM.html

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said in its latest report that financial and humanitarian aid is urgently needed to help slow the spread of the virus in “fragile countries”, where it is still in its early stages.The aid group said conflict zones such as Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan and Iraq will be the hardest hit because years of violence weakened their health systems, while refugees and displaced people are highly susceptible to illness due to “impacts of war, disease and famine”. The report, based on data from the WHO and Imperial College London, said the IRC estimates cases in the range of 500mn to 1bn, leading to deaths in the range of 1.7mn to 3.2mn, in 34 conflict-hit nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-billion-could-be-infected-by-coronavirus-aid-group-report/story-vfVVIGQU4jwmCbmCcTx31I.html
29-04-2020||World||Pak gets 4 more months to deliver on terror financing watchdog FATF plan||Pakistan on Tuesday got a four-month reprieve for meeting a deadline set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to counter terror financing as the multilateral watchdog announced a temporary suspension of its activities because of the Covid-19 crisis.However, the Paris-based organisation said in a statement that there would be no let-up in its efforts to fight money laundering and terror financing, and that it would actively monitor the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on measures to counter illicit financing.The move had been widely anticipated as officials of FATF and affiliated regional groups have been unable to make visits to countries such as Pakistan to monitor the implementation of action plans and other programmes because of travel restrictions imposed around the world to prevent the spread of the pandemic.Pakistan has been on FATF’s “grey list” of “monitored jurisdictions” since June 2018 for failing to counter terror financing, especially by groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Taliban, al-Qaeda and Haqqani Network. A FATF plenary meeting in February had warned Pakistan that it had failed to meet all deadlines for a 27-point action plan, and given the country four more months to implement it.The FATF’s statement said the watchdog had “decided on a general pause in the review process for the list of high-risk jurisdictions subject to a call for action and jurisdictions subject to increased monitoring, by granting jurisdictions an additional four months for deadlines”.“Thus, the FATF is not reviewing them in June,” the statement said, adding the organisation’s plenary had agreed to “temporarily postpone all remaining FATF mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines”.Though FATF posted an updated assessment calendar, Pakistan wasn’t among the countries for which details have been finalised so far. The FATF said the calendar would be updated as the situation evolves.The statement further said: “Despite the decision to temporarily postpone the above-mentioned process deadlines due to the current force majeure situation, the FATF will not let up its efforts to fight money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing, and will continue working with all jurisdictions in its global network to ensure an effective implementation of its standards.“The FATF is actively monitoring the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on measures to combat illicit financing. We remain vigilant to the threats posed by criminals and terrorists who may seek to exploit this period to further their criminal objectives.”The gravity of the Covid-19 crisis globally and consequent measures adopted by countries, such as confinement and travel restrictions, are making it impossible for countries and FATF teams to conduct on-site visits and in-person meetings, the statement said.“This situation has significantly impacted countries’ ability to actively participate in mutual evaluation and related follow-up processes. The FATF Plenary acknowledges these severe challenges that countries face at this difficult time,” it said.Pakistan’s performance was to be assessed at review meetings to be held in Beijing during June 21-26. The review is now expected to be done in October.During its assessment at its plenary meeting in February, the FATF concluded that all deadlines for Pakistan’s action plan “have expired” and the country had “largely addressed” only 14 of the 27 points in the action plan.FATF had warned Pakistan that if its action plan is not fully implemented, it would face the possibility of being moved to the list of monitored countries, commonly known as the “black list”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-crisis-pakistan-gets-4-more-months-to-implement-terror-funding-watchdog-fatf-s-action-plan/story-bC4OsMf7oduz821RSmG1rO.html
