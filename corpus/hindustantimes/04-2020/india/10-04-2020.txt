Biren Singh following an issue regarding rice allocation during the lockdown.State Chief Secretary Dr J Suresh Babu issued a notification of reallocation of the portfolios held by Deputy chief minister to the Chief Minister on Thursday evening.As per the notification, the Municipal Administration, Housing & Urban Development (MAHUD), forest and environment and climate change, science & technology, economics and statistics departments, held by Joykumar, was reallocated to Chief Minister who is presently holding the charge of Home, finance, transport, tourism, sericulture, minor irrigation, minority affairs OBC & SC, Personnel, Planning, GAD and other departments not allocated to others.The new development comes hours after BJP MLA Sorokhaibam Rajen Singh of Lamsang assembly constituency, strongly reacted to the statement of Joykumar, a minister of ally National People’s Party (NPP).Joykumar reportedly termed the CM’s assurance of food security during the lockdown as words of an unreasonable person, saying rice allocation for his Uripok constituency was not enough to distribute to needy people.“They should have resigned boldly instead of criticizing the leader of the coalition government,” Rajen who is also the Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Board said. “We never expected such an irresponsible statement from a responsible leader.”Stating that the rice quota for the constituency could be managed as done by other MLAs, Rajen said that the MLAs should take up relief measures under the guidance of the Chief Minister. Rajen also reacted to a similar statement made by another NPP minister L Jayentakumar recently.. There are four NPP Ministers in the coalition ministry.Interestingly, the portfolios of MAHUD, forest and environment and climate change, science & technology, economics and statistics departments was allocated to Deputy Chief Minister Joykumar on April 4 as former minister Th Shyamkumar was disqualified by the Speaker’s tribunal of the state assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-remarks-against-cm-biren-singh-deputy-manipur-cm-stripped-of-portfolios/story-KwyhzcFI4AfsFusXPd8dcL.html

Twenty-eight of the total 29 positive cases in the state had links to the Delhi congregation.Assam recorded its first Covid-19 fatality on Friday when a 65-year-old with travel history to Saudi Arabia and the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi died at the Silchar Medical College Hospital (SCMH).“We have come to know now that there was a congregation at Athgaon Kabarstan Masjid on March 12 where around 100 people including at least 8 people who had come from Nizamuddin Markaz were present,” said Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.“Out of these 8, two have already tested positive and on Thursday another one from Dhubri who had attended the Guwahati gathering has been found positive. Because we have got 3 positive cases from the same venue, we have decided to convert that mosque into a self-containment zone,” he added.Sarma said like the Nizamuddin Markaz gathering, the mosque in Guwahati has also turned into a “hotbed’ for Covid-19 as three positive people in the state have links to it. The mosque will remain sealed for the next 14 days.“We have not been able put all the 100 who attended the gathering in quarantine as the authorities of the mosque have not been able to give us the entire list of attendees,” he said.Health authorities have got details of 58 of the 100 people who attended the Guwahati gathering.The Assam government has decided to help patients from the state suffering from cancer, kidney ailments and cardiac problems who had gone outside Assam for treatment and are now stranded due to the lockdown. They have been asked to call 0361-2558955 and give details about their problems.Sarma informed that the state government will procure 1 lakh rapid test kits for the state. He added that a FIR would be filed against one patient from Dhubri district for hiding his travel history. Authorities in Hailakandi district informed that the last rites of the first Covid-19 deceased was performed a few kilometers away from Hailakandi town in a secluded place following strict decontamination rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-guwahati-mosque-sealed-due-to-link-with-nizamuddin-markaz/story-a1KCB8u0M05JBhkDHa7FSL.html

This existing rule has exacerbated the problems of H-1B visa holders who have been laid off.Several reports in the US media have cited Indian H-1B visa holders as expressing concerns that it will be virtually impossible for them to find new jobs if they are laid off, given the rapidly slowing economy.A petition on the White House website is requesting the US administration to extend the 60-day period to 180 days to protect H-1B workers in these difficult times. The petition further states: “Most H-1B workers are from India and cannot travel home with children who are US citizens as many nations [have] announced an entry ban, including India.”It adds: “The Covid-19 situation is getting worse with massive lay-offs expected. The economic conditions may have a significant impact on H-1B workers.”The petition has nearly 49,000 signatures but will get a response from the White House only if it reaches 100,000 signatures by April 18.The Indian side is hopeful the US administration will step in to help H-1B visa holders.The H-1B programme is a non-immigrant work visa that allows American employers to hire foreign workers for specialist jobs, and Indians are the largest beneficiary of the programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-asks-us-to-extend-h-1b-other-visas-of-citizens-stranded-over-covid-19/story-CuMJmzQGC0thLQEerM0slM.html

Not just the Prime Minister, but most from Bollywood and even the sports world, have been praising their painstaking services. Time and again their videos and messages have surfaced on social media, asking everyone to follow social distancing. However, now, the medical residents (young doctors) have taken to social media to voice their anguish over the recent attacks on doctors — who are treating corona positive patients — that include being pelted with stones and even being spat on. READ | Covid-19: Health workers attacked in cities, 7 held in Indore for pelting stones“We are only trying to help. These incidents make me fearful for my future. I don’t want to be beaten up once I’m on the field serving patients,” says a second year undergraduate student of the University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, and Dr Lokesh Raghav, an orthopaedics resident, currently pursuing post graduation from Lady Hardinge Medical College, adds, “How will the country survive if the soldiers ie the doctors who are fighting against the world’s common enemy (coronavirus) are beaten for keeping their everything at stake?”  Medical students from across India are concerned about this issue. A senior resident of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Bengaluru, says, “In these tough times, motivation is one of the greatest weapons that we can use. And I feel perpetrators — who have attacked doctors — should be brought to justice so that the doctors have faith that the system backs them.” READ | Rishi Kapoor, Raveena Tandon lead Bollywood in condemning attacks on doctors, cops: ‘They are endangering their lives’Dr Nikita Garg, a junior resident at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, who is under self-isolation after tending to coronavirus patients, says, “What has happened is terrible!

Cases have been registered against Pannun and the US-based SFJ under Section 124 (A) of IPC, and Sections 10 (A) and 13 (1) of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, at the State Special Operations Cell in Mohali, Director General of Punjab Police Dinkar Gupta tweeted.According to officials at the State Special Operations Cell (SSOC), Mohali, a preliminary probe has revealed that Pannun was involved in seditious acts through automated calls as well as pre-recorded audio messages to various residents in March and April 2020. Soon after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in India, Pannun and his associates have been spreading seditious content on social media to further instigate the already distressed people of Punjab.Disclosing the modus operandi, a Punjab Police official said that in one such recorded audio message, sent from an international number of North America, Pannun instigated the listeners by alleging that the Central government and the Punjab government were torturing the youth in the name of enforcing the ongoing lockdown in the state.The pre-recorded interactive voice response messages through telephone calls as well as audio messages to the people of Punjab from New York are being made for pushing the agenda of this self-styled organization Sikhs for Justice, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-police-registers-case-against-banned-us-based-sikhs-forjustice-outfit/story-uUFYuR73SuSv7FaIla3iqO.html

10-04-2020||India||Blood donors asked for health status, but not tested for Covid-19||Blood donors are now asked for their health status, including symptoms of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), but are not being tested for it even as the number of cases nationwide crossed 6,700 on Friday.Despite the lockdown, there is no shortage of blood and its components as requirement for trauma cases and elective surgeries has substantially reduced.“We have started thorough screening of all donors. They have to fill up a detailed form about their health status and also [provide] details such as their Covid-19 status, or if anyone they know has tested positive or someone in their neighbourhood has any Covid-19-like symptoms,” said RK Jain, secretary general of the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS).“We are doing our own risk profiling before allowing [them] to donate,” he said.The number of blood donation camps organised every month has gone down from 35 to zero in Delhi since social distancing was mandated to contain the Covid-19 outbreak, and IRCS is reaching out to individuals to motivate them to donate.IRCS recently tied up with resident welfare associations and plans to send mobile collection vans to residential colonies from Monday. Since the government declared blood as an essential supply on April 9, blood collection vans can move without restriction.“We reached out to our voluntary donors individually, arranged pick and drop for them, and even forwarded short videos of children who need regular blood transfusions to motivate these people to come out and donate blood,” said Vanshree Singh, director (blood bank) at IRCS.“I have been issuing passes to ensure their movement isn’t hampered in any way. In areas where there were multiple donors, we even send our mobile van.”IRCS secretary general RK Jain said: “Since elective surgeries are not happening, and trauma cases have gone down, what we are getting these days is requests for blood from people who undergo regular transfusions, such as people suffering from thalassemia and other blood disorders, chemotherapy patients, and anaemic pregnant women. By and large, we managed to stay afloat due to demand from a particular set of people going down, and that compensated for the reduced blood donations.”The Centre has declared blood services as essential services.The Union health ministry’s recommendations to states, issued on April 9, said that “addressing concerns of those running blood centres and blood transfusion services, especially regarding concerns with managing safety and adequacy of blood during this period of restrained gatherings and social distancing… it is essential that the supplies of safe blood continue to be maintained at licenced blood centres in the country”.It added, “Activities for blood collection and voluntary blood donation therefore are required to be continued judiciously during this period to meet the blood requirements.” Blood banks across the world are dependent on voluntary donations from healthy individuals to meet demand for blood and its components. Singh said: “We are tying up with resident welfare associations to park our blood collection vans near residential localities so that people don’t have to travel long distances to donate blood. And at the time, we will follow all infection control and social distancing measures, such as two couches instead of the earlier practice of four to draw blood.“There will be a gap of at least three metres between the two couches and at one time, there will be no more than three people allowed into the camp. The vans will be disinfected on a regular basis.”Apart from the camps, the IRCS will run a fleet of cars to pick and drop donors from their residences to the donation centres.The news of donation camps being held will put a lot of harried minds at ease. Shobha Tuli, founder of Thalassemics India, said: “The challenge is that thalassemia patients need fresh blood, which should ideally not be more than five to seven days old. The guidelines say less than two weeks old, because if the blood is older, the haemoglobin doesn’t rise enough in these patients. So holding camps will help as donors otherwise have to go to a hospital and donate. We alerted patients that they should try to arrange for donors should such a problem arise.”RN Makroo, president of the Indian Society of Transfusion Medicine, said many blood banks have started pooling resources. “We are sharing the supply because this is an extraordinary situation. We tell regulars to try and inform the centre in advance of their arrival, preference and requirement, so that the centre is prepared to make adequate arrangements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blood-donors-asked-for-health-status-but-not-tested-for-covid-19/story-mbklsElhLkZDMnjcRiYReI.html

10-04-2020||India||Assam, Bengal tea industry stares at losses due to Covid-19 lockdown||The tea industry in Assam and neighbouring West Bengal has been hit hard by the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and any extension beyond April 14 could further cripple the beleaguered 180-year-old sector, said industry captains.Tea is among the biggest and most labour-intensive industries in both West Bengal and Assam. Assam, which accounts for more than half of the country’s tea output, employs about one million people in the plantation sector and has about 800 gardens.In West Bengal, 283 gardens, which are spread across the Darjeeling hills, the Terai and the Dooars, employ about 350,000 workers and another 100,000 work for 40,000 small tea growers in north Bengal.Though the Centre has allowed operations at tea gardens with 50% of their regular workforce, the governments in Assam and West Bengal have so far only allowed the plantations to irrigate and spray pesticides. In contrast, tea gardens in south India have started full-fledged operations in line with the Centre’s instructions.In Assam, the industry has been reeling under the impact of increased production and stagnant prices for long. The gardens in the Darjeeling hills and in the Terai have been relatively better off than the ones in the Dooars, where many are periodically closed over persistent disputes between the management and labour unions. The lockdown couldn’t have come at a worst time for an industry that has seen better days.Factories in tea garden across Assam and West Bengal are closed because of the lockdown and the plucking of leaves is suspended. The first flush --- the first plucking of the harvest season, which occurs between March-April and accounts for the best quality tea and fetches high prices in international markets --- has already taken a massive hit.“Labour unions are demanding that we pay full wages to our workers for the lockdown. If the lockdown continues and the industry is not given any benefits, the industry will be further crippled,” Bezboruah, a planter himself, said.In Assam, a decision to allow the gardens to continue plucking and operating factories from April 1 onwards while maintaining social distancing measures has been put on hold reportedly because of pressure from some groups.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on April 6 that she would not risk allowing the gardens to operate because the area, where the gardens are located, shares international borders with Nepal and Bhutan and state borders with Sikkim and Assam. “I’ve spoken with the people involved in the industry and they’re all of the opinion that the lockdown should continue. Also, the workers are scared of the viral outbreak and unwilling to join work,” Banerjee said. Tea bushes in many gardens in Bengal are overgrowing because of the lockdown and suspension of plucking and planters have been urging the government to allow skiffing -- the removal of overgrown leaves. On Thursday, the Bengal government allowed skiffing with only 15% of the workforce on condition that social distancing norms would be strictly followed.Banerjee also hinted that she would gradually allow more workers to join work. “Let them start with 15%. We can add 15% more in phases if the situation allows,” she said. “We welcome the Bengal government’s decision. It has come at a very good time. We can continue with skiffing and wait for plucking for a while,” said Arijit Raha, secretary-general of the Kolkata-headquartered Indian Tea Association. However, a Darjeeling-based planter, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “To a great extent, the first flush is already lost. However, we can still recover if we continue skiffing for the next few days and start plucking by the third week of April.”Assam industries minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said that deputy commissioners in districts would implement the Centre’s directives on the functioning of some industries during the lockdown, provided they fulfil the social distancing norms. “The rule is applicable to all sectors and not just the tea industry. The state government hasn’t issued any separate directives on this matter,” Patowary said.PK Bezboruah, chairman of Tea Board India, said: “While the Assam government is trying to address the issue, not a single measure has been announced by Centre to support the industry.”In March, Bezboruah had written to the Centre seeking a package worth Rs 1,500 crore, but the government’s response is still pending. The Centre has not been coming to the industry’s aid, despite the problems it has faced over the past two years, the planters alleged.“The production in north India (Assam and West Bengal) would come down by around 150 million kilograms during the 21-day lockdown. The industry will suffer a loss of around Rs 1,700 crore,” Bezboruah said.If the lockdown gets extended till mid-May and tea gardens are not allowed to operate or get a relief package, the loss of production and revenue could double to around Rs 3,000 crore and there would be a loss of production of 1,150 million kilograms -- nearly 25% of the annual output, industry watchers said.The Assam Tea Tribes Students Association has also expressed resentment over the “reluctance of the tea garden management to release full wages and rations to tea garden workers for the lockdown period”. However, no such demand has been launched in Bengal to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-bengal-tea-industry-stares-at-losses-due-to-covid-19-lockdown/story-2zKoaEWK63nDgNg1xPWz1I.html

There have been multiple intelligence reports about terrorists waiting across the Line of Control to infiltrate into India.Officials said the army targeted the Kel launching pads in Neelum Valley. According to information reaching Srinagar, officials said Pakistan’s firing ended up hitting a squad of Hizbul Mujahideen terroristsA top counter-terror operative said India was forced to retaliate in this sector because the terrain is such that if the terrorists would have crossed into the Indian side, it would have been difficult to capture or neutralise them without taking casualties.Last week’s operation that ended on Sunday with the killing of five terrorists trying to infiltrate had also cost India lives of 5 Special Forces commandos.The retaliatory strike at the terror launch pads comes amid a spike in ceasefire violations by Pakistan and a plan to send across over 200 terrorists.As reported by Hindustan Times, 160 terrorists of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) are ready to infiltrate into the Valley.In the Jammu sector, along the border, around 70 armed and trained terrorists are planning to sneak into the Indian territory through unfenced nullahs, the inputs added. Counter-terror operatives said Jaish terrorists were camping at Samani-Bhimber and Dudhnial launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. LeT has been sending its terrorists to the Leepa and Kel launching pads in Leepa Valley and Neelum Valley, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-hits-pak-terrorist-launch-pads-across-loc-releases-videos-of-shelling/story-sX1Vp9agqDDrmYITTxzX2H.html

Psychological discomfort will manifest in the form of anxiety, restlessness, and the physical discomfort could manifest in terms of palpitation, breathing difficulty, tremors of hand, not being able to sleep at night,” he says.Then the video goes on to visually narrate ways to cope with both physical and psychological discomfort.Ways to cope with psychological discomfort“Try to make yourself busy by watching movies, by watching television, by spending time with your family members, your children; indulge in some activities like gardening, or exercising. Remember to drink lots of water during this time. Have a fitful sleep for eight to nine hours, which will make you feel better,” says Rao.Ways to cope with physical discomfortHowever, if you have physical discomfort then Rao advises not to take it lightly as it could escalate to problematic symptoms such as seizures or delirium.“You need to take the help of a doctor during such time, and the doctor will prescribe you medication which you have to take under the directions advised to you,” says Rao.The video ends by a public service message from the AIIMS director, who advises people to use this opportunity to quit drinking.“I would also say that this is a good time to see how you can give up your addiction to alcohol for the simple reason that it will cause more harm than good in the long run,” says Dr Guleria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-tips-on-alcohol-deaddiction-during-lockdown/story-08pfvW035zR6XtNt8xAOXJ.html
10-04-2020||India||Lockdown should have been followed up with wider testing for Covid-19: Sitaram Yechury||CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Friday said a lockdown can help arrest the spread of the coronavirus only if the government backs it up with wider testing to identify and isolate the hotspots.Speaking to the press via a social media platform, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary said extending the ongoing 21-day lockdown and increasing the economic mess could have been acceptable only if right steps were taken to fight the pandemic.“Merely extending the lockdown and thereby, increasing the economic misery and chances of people losing their livelihood and nutrition, which is most important to fight this pandemic, cannot be allowed,” he said.Highlighting the three-layered recommendations made by an expert committee set up by the Kerala government as an exit plan from the lockdown, Yechury said it has to be a staggered withdrawal by opening up the clusters that do not have COVID-19 patients.Even though it has been 17 days since the nationwide lockdown was imposed, the government has failed to increase the number of coronavirus tests, which should have been the primary objective of the lockdown, the Left leader said.“The lockdown should have been utilised to identify areas to isolate and seal, otherwise we will have an economic crisis along with a health disaster,” he said.Yechury said in India, only 102 people out of every 10 lakh individuals are being tested for COVID-19, a rate that is lower than Pakistan, which is testing 197 people for every 10 lakh individuals.He said the government should ensure that there are no “starvation deaths” in the country during the lockdown.“According to reports, 117 people have died due to lack of food or shelter or sheer exhaustion. This situation has to be corrected,” the CPI(M) leader said, while pointing out that the Left government in Kerala has successfully provided food, shelter and medical attention to the migrant workers stranded in the southern state by active state intervention.

10-04-2020||India||Modi govt should talk to US to prevent job losses of Indians holding H-1B visa: Cong||The Congress on Friday urged the Modi government to talk to the Trump administration to prevent job losses of Indians holding H-1B visa due to the coronavirus pandemic.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said after compromising the “India First” policy in the HCQ drug climb-down, the government is again failing to secure the safety and livelihood of Indians in the US.“Time for the prime minister to ensure that our soft power of ‘Namaste Trump’ converts into fair treatment of H-1B visa holders in the US,” Surjewala said, noting that the US has put Americans on a temporary paid leave or allowed them to work for reduced hours in the wake of the pandemic.But “the sword of H-1B visa job terminations” looms large over an estimated 75,000 Indians, with the United States giving them only a 60-day period to find a new job in case of a lay off, he said.“Time for the prime minister to rise to the occasion. We demand that the Modi government ensure the extension of post-job loss limit of H-1B Visa holder Indians to 180 days,” Surjewala said. He said this will give them sufficient time to find another job when the situation improves.“Modi government should also ensure that H-1B visa holders, who lost their jobs, are covered for COVID-19 and other health insurance free of cost, including extending support to their families,” he said in a statement. The Congress leader said the party also demands that the Modi government deliberate with Indian industry confederations like NASSCOM, CII, and FICCI to prevent further H-1B job losses. He said there are 309,986 Indians working on H-1B visa in the US, and given the COVID-19 lockdown in the two countries, it is logistically impossible for them to return to India. He said nearly 60,000 H-1B visas are generally granted to Indians each year which have already been on a steady decline for a few years whereas the rejection rate has gone up to as high as 53 pc for some top IT companies, who contribute 8 per cent to the GDP.The economic slowdown is becoming “more and more extreme” during lockdown, he said.Surjewala alleged that most organisations are even considering to terminate the contract unless the Modi government and the Trump administration find a solution. This, he said, has to be taken-up on war footing as post-termination they would have 60 days to find a job, which seems bleak in these challenging times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-should-talk-to-us-to-prevent-job-losses-of-indians-holding-h-1b-visa-cong/story-QOp25H4GCOO4XQnrEv9saO.html

In a positive development, 19 people were discharged from hospitals in the state, taking the total number of persons cured of the disease to 124. Maximum people were discharged from north Kerala’s Kasaragod, a hotspot in the state.Among the seven fresh cases, two are Nizamuddin-returned Tablighi Jamaat members, both from Malappuram. 17 of the 212 Jamaat members found to have attended the Delhi event have tested positive. A total of 1,29,751 people are under observation in the state including 1,29,021 in their homes and 730 in different hospitals. Kerala was the first state to report a case of Sars-Cov 2 virus in the country on Jan 30 when a China-returned medical student was diagnosed positive for the disease.The state has the twin distinctions of highest recovery and lowest mortality rate in the country so far. A total of 124 people have recovered from the disease while only two deaths have been reported till now from the 364 positive cases, a mortality rate of less than one per cent.A 93-year-old man from Pathanamthitta and his 84-year-old wife are among those who recovered and their recovery has been cited as a medical success story.Health experts claim that the state’s early exposure, lessons from the nipah outbreak of 2018 (considered to be a more dangerous virus with 80 per cent mortality rate), robust health system and its preparedness has helped it to contain the mortality rate.“It seems our vigil and surveillance started paying some dividends. For the last few days, the number of positive cases came down drastically. If things go like this we can flatten the curve soon,” said the minister. As on Friday evening, the national tally of positive coronavirus cases stood at 6761 including 206 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/few-new-covid-19-cases-and-more-recoveries-in-kerala-experts-see-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/story-8RFyRVtd68x1GzabMGSjyN.html

There could be multiple screening by health officials, police and civic bodies. People living in containment zones are put under surveillance to track if any person has developed the symptoms of Covid-19 (fever, sore throat, etc).A majority of Covid-19 cases reported in Delhi are linked to the congregation at the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters last month, turning the Markaz into the epicentre of the disease in Delhi and across the country.In the national capital, Tablighi Jamaat-linked cases have also been a cause of key concern. For one, officials concede, because they cannot say with any amount of confidence that the authorities including the police have been able to trace all the people who joined the congregation at the Nizamuddin headquarters or identify all the Covid-19 clusters linked to the Jamaat.But Delhi Police has been trying, scanning phone signals that were in and around the Tablighi headquarters, the Markaz. A senior city government official said Nabi Karim and Chandni Mahal were added to the containment zone list after the police carried out field verification about some of these people, before the health services moved in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-more-delhi-areas-under-hard-lockdown-over-tablighi-jamaat-cases/story-EjLuYDcwhVdhkOB1zCFHON.html

Sopore’s superintendent of police Javed Iqbal said more than 12 people were arrested for violating social distancing norms at the funeral. “More people will be arrested,” he said.The JeM commander, Sajjad Nawab Dar, 23, was killed in a gun battle with security forces in Gulabad area of Sopore on Tuesday.Soon after his body was handed over to his family, more than 1,000 people, including women, from his village and adjoining areas joined a large funeral procession. Pictures of the gathering went viral on social media and many people questioned why social distancing norms were ignored at the funeral.A police spokesperson said on Thursday a first information report (FIR) was registered against the people who gathered for the funeral and violated Covid-19-related protocols and government advisories on social distancing.“The legal heirs had stated in writing they would adhere to social distancing norms when the body was handed over to them after completing medico-legal formalities. The matter is under investigation and defaulters will be dealt with strictly as per the law,” the spokesperson said.People familiar with developments said police teams conducted raids at several villages last night and arrested some people who participated in the funeral.

10-04-2020||India||Extend lockdown, don’t fritter away gains made in Covid-19 fight: Top army doc||India must extend its strict confinement measures to combat the coronavirus disease and the benefits of the lockdown should not be frittered away for short-term economic considerations, said one of the military’s topmost doctors, a three-star general who was at the forefront of the country’s fight against Covid-19 until 10 days ago.Lieutenant General Rajan Grewal, who retired as the head of the army’s medical services on April 1, told Hindustan Times on Friday that relaxing the lockdown would allow transmission rates to skyrocket across cities and communities, with horrific consequences of unmanageable disease burden and resultant mortality.The current 21-day lockdown was enforced on March 25 to break the chain of infection and control the spread of the coronavirus, and the government is expected to take a final call on extending it beyond April 14 soon.Grewal recommended a longer and calibrated lockdown that would give India an extended window of opportunity to blunt the Covid-19 curve.He said a prolonged lockdown might be perceived as an extreme step with its economic, vocational and food scarcity-related apprehensions, but it was the most reliable mechanism and perhaps the only means to minimise transmission through effective community containment.“Different studies reveal that even with 50% efficacy of the lockdown, there should be a considerable blunting of the curve. The question therefore is whether to consider a calibrated extension of the lockdown for a few more weeks or not. Despite its deleterious consequences for the economy and livelihoods of the weaker sections of our populace, can the nation afford to surrender these (lockdown) gains,” Grewal said.He stressed that the positive impact of the lockdown in dealing with the calamitous ramifications of the Covid-19 pandemic should not be underplayed.Grewal, however, flagged concerns about the variable implementation of the lockdown across states, pointing to a recent “avoidable congregation” in New Delhi and its widespread ramifications. As of April 3, a third of the country’s coronavirus positive cases were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month.He said if Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not ordered the lockdown, the Covid-19 pandemic could have triggered an unmanageable healthcare crisis in the country in the coming months.“As a result of the lockdown, the disease burden will be considerably less and delayed compared with the previous alarming estimates. The spread has been partially checked by the commendable measures planned and executed by the government,” he pointed out.Grewal said steps taken by the government to slow the spread of the disease were yielding results.“But this ought not to lead to complacence and laxity which may have catastrophic consequences. If the lockdown is totally lifted, the sheer magnitude of a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) environment would trigger chaos and devastation,” he said.He said the lockdown, preceded by the mass quarantine of evacuees from hotspots abroad and also those potentially exposed, has slowed down the progress of transmission.“If benefit accrual (from the lockdown) is surrendered, the control of the pandemic may become more challenging, complex and uncertain with each passing day. Things could spin out of control,” he said.Grewal said enhanced testing and contact tracing in and around Covid-19 hotspots across the country where the population was vulnerable to the disease was vital. “This may prevent us from basking in the comfort zone that we are doing better than most of the world,” he said.Preventing the spread of infection in pockets with high population densities, including slums and suburbs, was critical in the fight against Covid-19, he said. “Lockdown may not have the same success in these settings if it is not augmented by active screening, aggressive testing, rigorously enforced quarantine, zoning cordons and intense medical surveillance,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extend-lockdown-don-t-fritter-away-gains-made-in-covid-19-fight-top-army-doc/story-YBvhDHCn5atRy9YRPkVbGJ.html

The Centre has also asked authorities to keep tabs on social media and act against objectionable content.“Clause 9 & 10 of the Consolidated Guidelines (on the lockdown) state that no religious congregation will be permitted without any exception and all social/cultural/religious functions/gatherings shall be barred,” the order said.For the attention of the public authorities, social/religious organisations and citizens, guidelines of the lockdown should be widely circulated. People violating the guidelines will face penal action under relevant provisions of the law, the order said.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“There are several festivals in the coming week. In this regard, several community leaders have come forward & are convincing their respective communities to assist the government in strictly implementing lockdown,” a spokesperson of the home ministry tweeted.While Shab-e-Barat was on Thursday, Good Friday was observed on April 10. Festivals such as Baisakhi, Rongali Bihu, Vishu, Poila Boishakh, Puthandu, Maha Vishuba Sankranti too fall in April.The 21-day nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set to end on April 14. Even though the government is yet to take a decision, there are indications that the restrictions could be extended. Some states have already done that.A senior Indian Police Service officer from Uttar Pradesh, who didn’t wish to be named, said the state was deploying adequate number of personnel at places of worship ahead of the festivals, and drones were being used to the monitor movement of people in such areas. “Anybody violating the lockdown will face strict action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-states-asked-not-to-allow-religious-gatherings-during-lockdown/story-iUNir6cvZ2TXwgHSj1gM4K.html

This becomes more necessary because not only the people suffering from mental illness maybe deprived of basic amenities but also become an easy carrier of the deadly virus posing life threat to many,” NHRC said in a statement.According to a complaint filed in NHRC, a large number of persons suffering from various mental illnesses are loitering on the streets and are dependent for food, shelter and other kinds of help on temples, gurudwaras and other charity organisations.“But the administration has not issued any specific guidelines for these people and no arrangements for their survival during this period of the crisis have been made,” NHRC said.The central government and the states have made provisions for food, shelter and medical care of hundreds of thousands of destitute, mostly migrant labourers and other daily wagers while the economic activity has been scaled down to minimum during the ongoing three-week long lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-the-scramble-to-contain-coronavirus-a-thought-spared-for-mentally-ill-wandering-on-streets/story-o5OqVlaopeBkmCovkiuCvN.html

Odisha was first||The Punjab cabinet on Friday unanimously decided to extend the covid-19 lockdown in the state till April 30. Punjab becomes the second state after Odisha to prolong the lockdown. On March 23, Prime Minister Modi had announced the national lockdown till April 14 to stem the spread of Covid-19 disease.Earlier today, chief minister Amarinder Singh, addressing a news conference through video-conferencing, said he felt the lockdown and curfew should continue in view of the increased number of positive Covid-19 cases.“The number of positive Covid-19 cases will increase as is happening across the world and even in India. How can Punjab be isolated from it? We have contained the pandemic to some level as compared to other states. But this will spread. We have kept our contingency plan ready and lockdown is one of the methods to cut social contacts,” he said.Punjab, which was one of the first states to impose a state-wide lockdown and stop public transport, has reported 132 Covid-19 patients.Several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka, have called for lockdown enforcement beyond April 14, saying that the threat of Covid-19 would be easier to handle if it is kept in place for a longer period of time.On April 8, PM Modi , in his interaction with opposition leaders, said life will not be the same again after the coronavirus pandemic. He added there would be “pre-corona and post-corona” for times to come.“I am regularly talking to CMs, districts and experts. Nobody is telling me to lift the lockdown. We need strict rules to maintain social distancing. We have to take many unexpected steps too,” PM Modi told the leaders.The nationwide lockdown, at the same time, has worried experts and commentators that it would hurt the already slowing economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-after-odisha-becomes-2nd-state-to-extend-lockdown-till-april-30/story-41MuCBNK79z4FiLifsSgOI.html
10-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Centre says no community transmission, Punjab CM says may have begun||The government on Friday said that community transmissions of coronavirus have not begun yet in the country and that there was no need to panic. The central government officials made the comment while citing results of all samples tested on Thursday which included a minuscule 0.2% positive results for Covid-19.“Yesterday, we conducted 16002 tests. Only 0.2% cases tested positive. On the basis of the samples collected, the infection rate is not high,” said Lav Agrawal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health.Government’s assurance that the deadly contagion had not progressed to the community transmissions phase- considered dangerous as positive cases start rising exponentially making tracing of the contacts nearly impossible—comes within hours of the Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh expressing concerns to the contrary.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageSingh has expressed fear that there could be cases of community transmissions in his state that has reported a total of 113 positive cases so far including 8 deaths as per the data provided by the union health ministry. Singh said 27 positive cases in the state had been reported from secondary sources to back his claim.He also added that continuance of the 21-day nationwide lockdown and curfew was the only way to contain the spread of Covid-19. His sentiment on preventive measures was echoed by the Union health ministry official in Delhi. “Today, the challenge is not local or community transmission, but if we are taking all the precautionary and containment measures,” Agrawal said.India has registered a total of 6412 coronavirus positive cases so far including 199 deaths, says the data available on the health ministry’s Covid-19 dashboard. The health ministry official added that positive cases in the last 24 hours had risen by 678 including 33 deaths.Home ministry said that in view of the approaching festivals in the current month, all states and Union territories have been asked for strict compliance of the restrictions in place to prevent any mass events. The government also added that the country had no shortage of anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine which is also being used for the treatment of selective coronavirus cases on medical prescription.The government added that the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the country was being ramped up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-rules-out-coronavirus-community-transmissions-punjab-fears-it-may-have-begun/story-cZpyDH0ZbY4HOq9UT6bNEJ.html

The fine would be Rs 200 for the first 3 times and then Rs 500 for every subsequent violation.General Secretary of the Utkal Petroleum Dealers Association, Sanjay Lath said, the employees of fuel stations are also putting their lives at risk for the sake of their jobs and hence are at risk of infection. “The government’s decision is for the benefit of the public and we completely support it. Accordingly, keeping the customers’ and employees’ well-being in mind, we have taken this decision,” he said.Odisha is the first state in the country to make masks mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-odisha-no-fuel-for-people-if-they-don-t-wear-masks-at-petrol-pumps/story-qUI9A74V3MNTR5Nj9IsjNI.html

10-04-2020||India||Covid-19, hydroxychloroquine and Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray||Hydroxychloroquine or HCQ, the anti-malarial drug touted by some as a potential weapon against Covid-19, has put the spotlight on a company founded by Prafulla Chandra Ray, considered to be the father of Indian chemistry.The Kolkata-based Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Limited, the only public sector unit that manufactures anti-malarial drug in India, said it will apply for a licence to produce HCQ soon. Bengal Chemicals had started HCQ’s production but was stopped decades ago.Here is more about Prafulla Chandra Ray:* Born on August 2 in 1861, Ray set up Bengal Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals as an individual initiative in a laboratory in 1892 to foster a spirit of entrepreneurship among the youth of Bengal.* After getting a DSc degree from Edinburgh University in 1887, Ray started teaching chemistry at Presidency College. By 1892, with a capital of about Rs 700, he had started Bengal Chemical Works, and presented its herbal products before the Indian Medical Congress’ 1893 session held in Kolkata.* Ray transformed his initiative into Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceutical Works Pvt Ltd, with a capital of Rs 2 lakh, by 1901.* He never took any salary from the company.* By 1908, it had made its mark in Bengal’s industrial sphere and John Cumming wrote in the ‘Review of the Industrial Position and Prospects in Bengal’ that the ‘enterprise shows signs of resourcefulness and business capacity, which should be an object lesson to capitalists of this province’.* Under his stewardship, Bengal Chemicals grew fast. From having its first and second factories in Kolkata’s Maniktala in 1905 and the northern suburbs of Panihati in 1920, it set up a third factory in Mumbai in 1938.* Prafulla Chandra Ray authored, among other books, the ‘History of Hindu Chemistry – From the Earliest Times to the Middle of the Sixteenth Century AD’, a book that documented India’s indigenous chemical practices starting from the Vedic era.* He published a paper in 1896 on the preparation of a new stable chemical compound: mercurous nitrite. It made way for a large number of investigative papers on nitrites and hyponitrites of different metals, and on nitrites of ammonia and organic amines. * Ray retired in 1936 aged 75 and died on June 16, 1944, at the age of 82.* The Royal Society of Chemistry dedicated its coveted Chemical Landmark plaque to Ray, the first non-European to be conferred the honour, in 2011 on his 150th birth anniversary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-hydroxychloroquine-and-acharya-prafulla-chandra-ray/story-SWyel4KoS02hVGItmMWoPK.html

It was then found that five people from the area had attended the gathering following which several people, including the man, were asked to home quarantine, they said.Initially, the police had also asked the man, a former councillor of Nangli Sakrawati, if he was part of the event, but he denied it. His wife is the current councillor of Nangli Sakrawati, a village in Najafgarh, they said.During physical verification of the people quarantined at their homes in the area, the man was not found by health authorities at his residence. On subsequent questioning, he again hid facts about his past travel and movements, they said.Even during repeated medical and police enquiry, he withheld this fact and did not disclose it to the authorities, a senior police official said.Later, he fell ill and when he was tested he was found positive for coronavirus. His wife and child also tested positive for the infection, following which all three of them were hospitalised, the official said.After analysing his call records and upon physical enquiry, it was found that he had visited Jamaat at Nizamuddin, the official said, adding that he had jeopardised the health of the local community and his family members.As a result, a containment zone was declared in Deenpur village and legal action was initiated against him, the police said. A case under section 188 (for disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) Of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of Epidemic Diseases Act, has been registered against him at Chhawla police station, they said. Comprehensive surveillance and information gathering through rigorous physical verification and technical monitoring is being ensured to enforce the lockdown and home quarantine norms to contain the spread of coronavirus in Dwarka district, the police said.The Tabligh-e-Jamaat’s Markaz in Nizamuddin West, which is among the major COVID-19 hotspots in the country, was cleared after the evacuation of 2,361 people in the a 36-hour operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-leader-with-covid-19-booked-for-hiding-travel-history-village-declared-containment-zone/story-ICZaIqhtdam4jlK8YgLyGO.html
10-04-2020||India||Not Zoom, Vidyo is govt’s app of choice during Covid-19 lockdown||A host of privacy concerns related to virtual meetings of top government officials during the Covid-19 pandemic has made them turn to Vidyo, a video conferencing application vetted by the National Informatics Centre (NIC). The app developed by a US-based firm was first used by NIC in 1995 to host studio-based video conferencing. In 2009, the app was used for desktop-based video conferencing. It is the same secure channel that has been extended to officials at home to communicate. NIC data shows that from March 20, four days before the 21-day lockdown began, to April 9, a total of 79,405 calls lasting more than 37,909 hours have been made using the app. Privacy concerns about government meetings came to the fore on April 1, when defence minister Rajnath Singh posted pictures on Twitter of his video conference with Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat using Zoom. Also read: Zoom CEO Eric Yuan addresses privacy, security issues in first webinarZoom’s popularity in the government and private sectors surged during lockdowns in many countries. However, numerous security concerns related to the app have emerged. Authorities in Singapore, the US Senate and the German foreign ministry have barred the use of Zoom.From “zoombombing” or hackers entering private chat rooms to selling of user data, the app has faced criticism. On April 8, Google asked its employees to stop using Zoom. Talking about Vidyo, NIC director Neeta Verma said: “All the videos are stored on a secure government server and cannot be accessed by anyone else...The app is hosted on our own data centre and is end-to-end encrypted ensuring complete security.” She added that most ministries and departments were using the Vidyo app for official purposes, although officers may have been using others for their personal calls.  “Although the software is external, all the videos are stored on our own server and cannot be accessed by anyone else. The app is hosted on our own data centre.” Most ministries, she said, are using Vidyo for official purposes, though officers may have been using other apps for personal calls. Experts say Zoom could potentially expose the country to security risks. “The main challenge is if parts of the government, like the military and the home ministry, are using the software, it exposes the country to the risk of sensitive information being routed through foreign infrastructure,” said Sunil Abraham, former executive director of the Centre for Internet and Society. Abraham said Zoom’s lack of end-to-end encryption is the reason for this exposure. “The call is only encrypted between the user and Zoom, unlike end-to-end encryption. The company still has access to the information,” he said. Also read: Zoom’s latest update hides meeting ID numbers from the title bar“Keeping in view security concerns, the ministry of defence has since refrained from using the app for video conference,” a person familiar with developments told Hindustan Times. The department of personnel and training (DoPT) has been using Vidyo since virtual communications began. “There were security concerns around Zoom that we too read in media reports,” an DoPT official said. “We were sent a link by the NIC on WhatsApp for Vidyo and have been using that. They must have vetted it to ensure it stays confidential.”On Tuesday, the official said, DoPT secretary C Chandramouli held a meeting with senior officials on Vidyo to “review the present situation and formulate an action plan for the coming week”. According to a second DoPT official, meetings with the minister of personnel, grievances and pensions, Jitendra Singh, are exclusively held on Vidyo. “Work has been carrying forth as usual, but security has been our only concern,” the second official said. “Vidyo is the only app used for high-level meetings.” According to Abraham, however, even Vidyo is not completely secure. Also read: Google bans Zoom from employee laptops“The government has eliminated 50% of the risk by hosting it,” he said. “But at the same time, you don’t have complete control over the software. You don’t know what the software is doing exactly. It will have to be very closely monitored. It’s okay for low-level ministries but not the top level ones. If you use open source software Jitsi, you can avoid that risk too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-zoom-vidyo-is-govt-s-app-of-choice-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-8195JqwxqD5rQ7oORoxSuN.html

The Sena also said such meetings will only create confusion among state administrative staff.In an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, the ruling party said in the prevailing “war-like situation”, there should be a single centre of command to give directives to the administration.“The Prime Minister at the Centre and the Chief Minister at the state level (should have that authority).

Kerala will be the first state to carry out the test called convalescent plasma therapy against the coronavirus disease in the country.The test involves transfusion of specific components from the blood of people recovered from Covid 19—at least 14 days after their complete recovery—into those who have contracted the disease virus or are in the high-risk category. The recovered person’s plasma, which is rich in antibodies, is expected to help the patient, said experts adding they are getting encouraging reports from South Korea and the United States in this regard.“We have to get blood transfusion norms relaxed. Normally a healthy person is allowed to give blood for transfusion and other tests but here a person who recently recovered will have to bleed,” Dr Asha Kishore, director of Sree Chithira Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), the nodal agency to conduct the test, said.The donor has to be a patient who has fully recovered and shown no symptoms of the infection after 14 days isolation after getting discharged from the hospital, she said adding the blood group of both will have to be compatible. Also read: We must look at mass antibody testing for a calibrated exit from lockdown, says T Jacob JohnThis can also be tried in people who are at high risk of contracting the virus. She said her institute and four medical college hospitals in the state were fully equipped to conduct the plasma therapy.Dr Anoop Kumar, a member of the Kerala Medical Taskforce and also the head of the critical care unit of a leading private hospital in Kozhikode, explained that as a patient grapples with the virus, the body produces antibodies to attack it. These antibodies, proteins that are secreted by immune cells called B lymphocytes, are found in plasma or liquid part of the blood that helps in clotting when needed and supports immunity, Dr Kumar said.Also read: ‘In my blood, there may be answers’, says a Covid-19 survivor in New York“Even after recovery, these anti-bodies will remain in their blood waiting to guard any recurrence of infection. When these antibodies are injected into another person with the disease they recognise the enemy virus and kills them,” he said.He along with his friend Dr G Arun Kumar of the Manipal Institute of Virology was first to detect nipah virus in north Kerala two years ago.“Usually one person’s donation of plasma can produce two doses of blood component needed for transfusions. A patient needs one transfusion to get enough antibodies to fight the virus. This is not like blood donation. Only plasma is collected. A healthy person can donate 800 ml of plasma that can be treated at least four,” he said.Meanwhile, 12 fresh cases were reported in Kerala taking the total number of infected to 357. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said it was a proud moment for the state as 13 people, including eight foreigners, were discharged on Thursday which also marked the 100 days since the virus was first detected in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-waits-for-drug-controller-nod-for-plasma-therapy-for-covid-19-patients/story-g9jxHuJZDu2JXYSEipJPJP.html

Deb warned that strict action would be taken against them.Later, Dr Debasish Basu, secretary, health department, Tripura, said that 18 nurses were served with show-cause notices for making the complaint.Tripura, which has reported only one Covid-19 positive case so far, has put 985 people under quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-becomes-second-state-to-invoke-esma-to-manage-covid-19-outbreak/story-CQS4noUhrUmXErUh38E1cL.html

In an IPL game, we see action replay of batting and slow-motion movement of a ball. But as far as Covid-19 is concerned, all case details and analysis cannot be given on a real-time basis. We’ve to be careful. Time is not ripe to park an OB (outdoor broadcast) van in front of a hospital treating Covid-19 patients or a laboratory and do a live broadcast,” he said.His remarks came a day after the state government released a spatial distribution map of Covid-19 cases in Bhubaneswar that showed new areas where positive cases were found, but in the official tally of 44 as of Thursday, there was no mention of these neighbourhoods.The number of active cases in Odisha stand at 45 and one person has died due to the infection.

10-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Amarinder Singh hints at lockdown extension, fears community spread||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday backed extending restrictions on movement of people in the state to curb spread of Covid-19 cases, asserting that community transmission appeared to have started in the state.Addressing a news conference through video-conferencing, Singh said he felt the lockdown and curfew should continue in view of the increased number of positive Covid-19 cases. “The number of positive Covid-19 cases will increase as is happening across the world and even in India. How can Punjab be isolated from it? We have contained the pandemic to some level as compared to other states. But this will spread. We have kept our contingency plan ready and lockdown is one of the methods to cut social contacts,” he said.Punjab, which was one of the first states to impose a state-wide lockdown and stop public transport, has reported 132 Covid-19 patients.Also read: Officials spot a silver lining in India’s Covid-19 battle; prep for dark clouds“We had around 140,000 NRIs and foreign returnees, including from those countries where the virus had spread. They were the primary ones. Now, with 27 positive cases of secondary transmission we have entered the stage of community transmission. That is a serious cause of worry. That is why we have to seriously consider extending the lockdown,” added Singh.The chief minister said 651 people have come to the state from the Tablighi Jamaat’s congregations in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area, which emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hotspots in the country. Of them, 636 have been traced and 15 remain untraced.Community transmission is the third of the four stages of the spread of an infectious disease. The first is travel history, the second is local transmission, the third is community transmission, and the fourth is epidemic. The Union Health Ministry has been consistently denying that India had reached the community transmission stage, insisting that it was still at the local transmission stage.A new study by the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), however, found that 1 in 50 people admitted to hospitals with acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia suffer from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, said: “One may not like to call it community transmission but this is in fact community transmission”.Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, disagreed, underlining that the case history of the patients had probably not been analysed properly yet.Also read| Covid-19 latest updates: The extent of spread in India and Stage 3 concernsPunjab, Maharashtra, Delhi and Rajasthan have mandated that people should wear face masks in public places.Several states in the country have approached the Centre to extend the 21-day lockdown, which is supposed to be in place till April 14, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to take a call Saturday after a meeting with chief ministers. “Currently, only one patient is on ventilator support and two are on a pre-ventilator stage where they only require oxygen. We have 76 operational ventilators in government hospitals and 358 in private hospitals,” Capt Amarinder Singh added.He also said 11 people have died due to Covid-19 in the state till date. The number of samples which have been collected stand at 2,877, which he said, is not much for a state which has 28 million people.The chief minister said 651 people have come to the state from the Tablighi Jamaat’s congregations in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area, which emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hotspots in the country. “We have traced 636 of them. Fifteen are still untraceable and we are looking for them,” Singh said.Quoting studies that have projected a spike in Covid-19 cases later in the year, the The chief minister also cited studies including one by Chandigarh’s Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research that project Covid-19 cases could spike by mid-September when 58% of its population would be infected. In Punjab, he said, it had been projected that 87% of the population would be infected by the disease.“These figures are frightening. Predictions by health experts about the spread of the pandemic are horrendous. So, we have to do what we can and lockdown is one of such measures,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-transmission-started-in-punjab-says-cm-hints-lockdown-extension/story-MlSsrCMGr1Wsydj6ykYXiP.html

Bookings for the flights to be operated from April 13 began on Friday, the British high commission said.The first wave of seven charter flights will carry Britons from Goa, Mumbai and New Delhi during April 8-12. The total number of people to be brought back on these 19 flights is around 5,000.The first charter flight from India arrived at London Stanstead airport on Thursday morning with 317 British nationals from Goa.The 12 additional flights will depart from Amritsar on April 13, 17 and 19, from Ahmedabad on April 13 and 15, from Goa on April 14 and 16, from Goa via Mumbai on April 18, from Thiruvananthapuram via Kochi on April 15, from Hyderabad via Ahmedabad on April 17, from Kolkata via Delhi on April 19 and from Chennai via Bengaluru on April 20.The UK minister of state for South Asia and the Commonwealth, Tariq Ahmad, said: “We are doing all we can to get thousands of British travellers in India home.

10-04-2020||India||In advisory, govt lists who should not use hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19||The Press Information Bureau (PIB) on Friday posted an advisory on Twitter released earlier by the health ministry on the use of hydroxychloroquine as treatment for patients suffering from coronavirus disease Covid-19.The advisory is based on recommendation of the taskforce constituted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The advisory recommends not administering the drug to children below the age of 15. It also says that people with known case of retinopathy and known hypersensitivity to hydroxychloroquine or 4-aminoquinoline compounds should also not take the medicine.Hydroxychloroquine is being widely touted as the medicine which can treat Covid-19, but ICMR has said that it is not recommending its commercial use unless it gets satisfactory test results.“It is important to understand that this (hydroxychloroquine) medicine is not mandatory. Whether it will reduce the infection, will be known only after tests. The doctors are still testing it on symptomatic patients. ntil we get satisfactory results, we won’t recommend this to anyone,” senior ICMR scientist R Ganga Ketkar told news agency ANI on Thursday.Hydroxychloroquine has emerged as the most sought-after medicine after preliminary trials in China suggested it boosted recovery and lowered the severity of the coronavirus disease.According to ICMR, hydroxychloroquine is recommended only to those asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases.The advisory released by the health ministry has also listed things to be considered before administering/taking hydroxychloroquine. The most important consideration is to take the drug only after it is recommended by a registered medical practitioner, and to check with a physician about any adverse event before starting the medication.“If anyone becomes symptomatic while on prophylaxis, he/she should immediately contact the health facility, get tested as per national guidelines and follow the standard treatment protocol,” the health ministry guideline says.The government has ensured that there is no shortage of hydroxychloroquine in the country at present as well as in the future, Union Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Aggarwal said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-new-advisory-govt-lists-who-should-not-use-hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-19/story-KCX1EPr64LPvIw0VOu8zHP.html

10-04-2020||India||Covid-19 crisis: States asked to fill 227 vacancies for epidemiologists||There are 227 vacancies for epidemiologists, who track disease outbreaks, across all states and union territories as the country battles the Covid-19 pandemic.Ten states – Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Haryana, Mizoram, Tripura, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh and Telangana – and Delhi don’t even have a state-level epidemiologist.The Centre has now written to the states to fill these vacancies to ensure the availability of “qualified human resources” during the Covid-19 pandemic. A letter issued by the Union health ministry on April 7 directed states to fill a total of 382 vacancies under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP). Of these vacancies, the maximum are for epidemiologists, who study patterns of frequency and causes and effects of diseases. The other vacant posts are those of data managers, veterinarians, financial consultants and microbiologists. The need to fill these vacancies was raised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a virtual meeting with chief ministers on April 3, according to the letter issued by the health ministry and accessed by Hindustan Times. The vacancies for epidemiologists and others should be filled to ensure “surveillance activities of Covid-19”, the letter states. An epidemiology professor, who didn’t want to be named, said that ideally, every district under the IDSP should have at least one epidemiologist and there should be one state-level epidemiologist. According to data from census 2011, there are 640 districts. The letter states the highest number of vacancies are in Telangana (26), Bihar and Chhattisgarh (21 each), Madhya Pradesh (20) and Delhi, Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir (11 each). “As we know, the entire health team in all the States/UTs is putting all their efforts in the effective containment and management of COVID-19. Availability of Qualified Human Resources at required places is a critical element in the effective management of pandemics like COVID-19,” the letter said. “In the wake of the present COVID situation, it is essential to fill up the IDSP (lntegrated Disease Surveillance Programme) positions especially the Epidemiologist in all the District and State Units of IDSP in your States,” it added. IDSP was launched in 2004 to train state and district surveillance officers, rapid response teams and other medical and paramedical staff on principles of disease surveillance.The mission, according to IDSP’s website, is to strengthen disease surveillance by establishing a decentralised state-based surveillance system for epidemic prone diseases and to detect early warning signals, so that timely and effective actions can be initiated to respond to health challenges at the district, state and national levels.Currently, there are teams working on vector-borne diseases and HIV, the professor cited above said. The letter further states that any epidemiologists trained by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), working in other divisions of health departments, should be immediately deployed for Covid-19 surveillance.The Central government has asked state governments to offer a salary on “war footing” and use agencies empanelled under the National Health Mission to fill the vacancies. States can also redeploy existing “human resources working in other programmes and departments”.“This is an extremely important step,” said Jagat Ram, the director of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.“Even if we eliminate coronavirus from clusters and the country, there is still a possibility of isolated cases coming up. We need people to consistently track any possible contact cases that may spring up, not just for the present, but the future.”Ram said the 100% elimination of the Coronavirus will be very difficult.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-crisis-states-asked-to-fill-227-vacancies-for-epidemiologists/story-2Ggqep9XeGEezpXQgK2tsL.html
10-04-2020||India||Officials spot a silver lining in India’s Covid-19 battle; prep for dark clouds||India appears to have been able to control the spread of the coronavirus cases to a large extent but is still preparing for the worst case scenario should it unfold, a top central government official said on Friday as states executed a hard lockdown in 1,200 containment zones in 8 states, and counting.But the optimistic assessment has not stopped the government from taking steps, the official who spoke on conditions of anonymity said, to ensure that state governments have more than enough quantities of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (an antibiotic), the two drugs that could be used to treat coronavirus disease.Also read: India has enough Hydroxychloroquine says govt and specifies who can use itThe official, part of the empowered committee led by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba that tracks acquisition of drugs, Covid-19 testing kits, masks and ventilators at a granular level, told HT that drug consignment were sent as gifts to SAARC, Mauritius and Seychelles only after securing supplies for the country.In some studies, hydroxychloroquine when paired with azithromycin has been shown to clear patients of the virus at a much faster rate than seen usually. These studies had boosted global demand for the drugs. This week, India cleared their export from special economic zones to several countries such as the US, Brazil and Israel. “We are simply clearing the contracts based on the availability of any surplus stock,” explained a second government official familiar with development.The efficacy of the two tablets, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, against Covid-19 is still not proven in rigorous tests usually carried out but the two drugs have held out hope in the world, and India.The two drugs are only prescribed as a prophylactic for medical staffers in India.According to the status report on the supply of the two drugs, the Centre has received 100 percent of Azithromycin 500 mg tablets and allocated 80 percent of the total supply to states and union territories. The remaining 20 percent has been kept for central institutions and agencies.Also read: Netanyahu thanks PM Modi for delivering hydroxychloroquine to IsraelIn case of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, the government has more than ample supplies to meet its projected requirements till April 15, the official said.But the Centre is making sure that the states never run out of them. “We have ordered 11 times the requirement that was projected to be prepared for just about any eventuality,” the official said.Of this, the government has already received 20 percent of the supplies and sent a majority of this consignment to the states.India has, according to the Union Health Ministry, over 6,400 Covid-19 cases. By this morning, the ministry confirmed 199 deaths. Experts have argued that one reason for India’s low Covid-19 positive numbers could be the smaller number of people who have been tested in comparison to other countries.Also read: Hydroxychloroquine use may lead to irregular heartbeats, low blood sugarThe number of Covid-19 testing centres - there was just one; Pune’s National Institute of Virology - when the disease reached India two months ago. Since then, India has been able to create more than 180 testing facilities including 65 in the private sector. More than 1.30 lakh people have been tested for coronavirus over the last two months. This week, the government updated its testing guidelines to cover “asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case” between days 5 and day 14 of coming in contact with a coronavirus patient.The empowered committee has also placed orders for rapid testing kits from China even though this test is not the last word on confirmation. Besides, the European experience of these Chinese kits has neither been good or fool-proof.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officials-spot-a-silver-lining-in-india-s-covid-19-battle-prep-for-dark-clouds/story-0GsgsIa1adMTAF582W27aL.html
10-04-2020||India||Govt asks former IAS officer to return citing Covid-19, but he says no||Former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Kannan Gopinathan, who quit last year citing “growing intolerance”, has said he rejected the government’s directive to resume duties immediately because of the Covid-19 crisis.Gopinathan resigned from the IAS eight months ago to protest what he said was “growing intolerance and curtailment of freedom of speech”. He tweeted that he had no plans to re-join government service. “Received a letter from the Govt, asking me to rejoin my duty. While I extend all my services in health, wealth and mind to the Govt in this fight against Covid-19 pandemic, it will be as a free and responsible citizen and not anymore as an IAS officer,” he said in the tweet on Thursday.There was no immediate reaction from the government on his remarks.Talking to Hindustan Times from Maharashtra, where he is now settled, the former member of the 2012 batch of IAS said he had received a letter from the Union personnel ministry about resuming duties. He said he would formally respond to the latter in a couple of days.Gopinathan said he is ready to serve the government and society, but not as an IAS officer.“I am engaged in some service right now. I would like to continue this. If the government wants, I can go to Dadra and Nagar Haveli and any other part of the country, but only as a volunteer. Quitting the IAS was a well thought out decision and I stick to it,” the 33-year-old said.The government is yet to accept his resignation, and Gopinathan said he has no idea why the letter was sent to him at this juncture. He said he believes the authorities may take some action against him under the Disaster Management Act.“I really suspect [that] asking me to return is not with a good intent. I am not worried at all. Now I am working with some NGOs in Maharashtra. I don’t need the IAS tag to do some work. I am happy with my present freedom,” he said. After quitting the IAS, Gopinathan was active in some protests and got arrested in December while travelling to the Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh.During the 2018 floods, he came to Kerala to hand over a cheque from the Dadra and Nagar Haveli administration and left the place quietly. On leave, he discreetly worked for eight days in several relief camps, loading relief materials.He left immediately after his batch-mate, then Ernakulam district collector YS Safarulla, recognised him. His service went viral on social media after he left Kerala. But he shunned all publicity and said he was only doing his job when his state was in distress. Gopinathan hails from Eramalloor in Alappuzha district. As a union territory cadre officer, he was posted in Dadra and Nagar Haveli when he quit the IAS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-former-ias-officer-to-return-citing-covid-19-but-he-says-no/story-0NnDrwgPGQm2oBoo8pW2MK.html
10-04-2020||India||Covid-19 latest updates: The extent of spread in India and Stage 3 concerns||A study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to identify the spread and extent of transmission of coronavirus disease has revealed that just two per cent of the patients have tested positive for Covid-19.The study was conducted on 5,911 patients of SARI or Severe Acute Respiratory Infection, caused by the Sars-CoV-2 virus, in 52 districts in 20 states and union territories between February 15 and April 2.The study showed that only 104 people (1.8 per cent) tested positive for Covid-19. Out of this group, 40 per cent cases did not have any international travel history or contact with laboratory tested confirmed Covid-19 positive case.This study by ICMR has been published in the latest issue of the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR). SARI surveillance was initiated in the early phase of the Covid-19 outbreak in India.Among the 965 SARI samples tested between February 15 and March 19, only two (0.2%) were positive for Covid-19. But when the testing strategy was expanded to include all SARI patients, out of 4,946 samples, 102 (2.1%) were positive for Sars-CoV-2.Some experts say that these studies suggested the disease has entered the “community transmission” phase (Stage 3) in the country. “One may not like to call it community transmission but this is in fact community transmission of Covid-19,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology at the Christian Medical College, Vellore.Community transmission is the third of the four stages of the spread of an infectious disease. The first is travel history, the second is local transmission, the third is community transmission, and the fourth is epidemic.India has maintained that the disease is in the second stage, or between stage two and stage three with “limited community transmission” in some clusters.R Ganga Ketkar, senior scientist at ICMR, reiterated that the country has still not reached Stage 3 of the disease spread.A few days ago, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria had said that the threat of community transmission is serious given the number of cases. “It becomes even more serious if people don’t understand their responsibility of social distancing, home quarantine and avoiding crowded areas,” Guleria told Hindustan Times. “Data from US and Europe is pretty frightening and worrying. We have to take all steps that we don’t move in that direction,” he added.Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 positive cases reached 6412 on Friday morning, the health ministry said. India reported 30 Covid-19 related deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the number of fatalities to 199 across the country, it further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-latest-updates-the-extent-of-spread-and-stage-3-concerns/story-GkvydhV5ulONwF2zuILFfP.html

10-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Continued lockdown could cripple Assam’s tea industry||Assam’s tea industry has been hit hard by the 21-day lockdown across the country to contain spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19. And if it continues further, it could cripple the 180-year-old industry.The sector which employs around one million people (both in big tea gardens and small ones) was already facing problems due to increased production and stagnant prices.“While the Assam government is trying to address the issue, not a single measure has been announced by Centre to support the tea industry at this time,” said PK Bezboruah, chairman of Tea Board India.Factories in tea garden across Assam are closed because of the lockdown and plucking of leaves suspended. The first flush, which falls between March-April, and accounts for the best quality tea, is already affected.“We are expected to pay wages to our workers through the lockdown and unions and pressure groups are insisting that we don’t operate but pay full wages. If the lockdown continues and tea industry is not given benefits, the industry will get severely affected,” Bezboruah, a tea planter himself, added.While tea gardens in South India have started operating after instructions from Centre, it still hasn’t happened in Assam which has close to 800 gardens and accounts for over half of the country’s tea output.Assam government has allowed gardens to irrigate and spray pesticides, but a decision on allowing them to continue plucking and operate factories from April 1 while following social distancing measures, has been put in hold reportedly due pressure from some groups.The Assam Tea Tribes Students Association has expressed resentment against tea gardens for “reluctance of tea garden management to release the full wage and the due ration to tea garden workers for the lockdown period.”“The Centre’s directions to the state government on functioning of some industries during the lockdown will be implemented by deputy commissioners in districts provided they fulfill the norms of social distancing,” said industries minister Chandra Mohan Patowary.“This is for all sectors and not just the tea industry. Assam government will not issue any separate directions on this matter,” he added.Last month, Bezboruah in his capacity as Tea Board chairman had written to the Centre seeking a package worth around Rs 1500 crore, but there was no response. Planters say Centre has not been coming to the industry’s aid despite problems facing it in past two years.In 2019, Assam’s tea production had reached an all time high of 715 million kg, which is 51.5% of all India production, but the industry didn’t benefit as prices have remained stagnant for several years.“The production in north India would come down by around 150 million kg during the 21-day lockdown. The economic loss to the industry would be around Rs 1,600-Rs 1,700 crores,” Bezboruah said.If lockdown gets extended till mid-May and tea gardens are not allowed to operate or given a relief package, the loss of production and revenue could double—around Rs 3,000 crore and 1150 million kg loss of production (nearly 25% of annual output)In Assam, the government assured supply of rice for tea garden workers through PDS as subsidized rate of Rs 22/kg in view of the lockdown, but only a few districts have implemented it till now.Due to lockdown and suspension of plucking tea bushes in many tea gardens are overgrowing and planters are asking the government to allow skiffing-removal of the overgrown leaves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-continued-lockdown-could-cripple-assam-s-tea-industry/story-4axc9nzC7yTa88qfym3WsO.html

It was uncalled for and inappropriate. Such a letter is only given in emergencies. We will take stringent action following a probe.”The letter issued by Gupta stated, “This is to just inform you that following are known to me as they are my family friends and travelling from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar for family emergency. Particulars of the cars are as given below.” The letter signed by Gupta concluded, “Hence you are here by informed through this letter to cooperate with them to reach their destination.” The letter also bears the number of five vehicles and 23 names from the family and friends.Police have detained 23 people, including DHFL promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhwan, for violating prohibitory orders of the nationwide lockdown. Kapil and Dheeraj are accused in DHFL scam and had been issued non-bailable warrants by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The family, along with other outsiders, had travelled from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar on Wednesday evening in their cars even when the borders of Satara and Pune districts are sealed amid the lockdown.The family was detained from Diwan farm house by civic authorities after locals raised strong objection of them staying their amid the outbreak of Covid-19. The 23 people are believed to have been under Section 188 of IPC.The controversy is said to have damaged the image of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. The state government has taken the issue very seriously and additional chief secretary (home) is expected to conduct an inquiry.Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has criticised the government over the issue. “No lockdown for mighty & rich in Maharashtra? Once can spend holidays in Mahabaleshwar with official permission from police. It is not possible that a senior IPS officer would do such gross mistake knowing the consequences on his own. With whose order or blessing was this done? Mr CM & HM you owe us an explanation,” he tweeted late on Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-opposition-attack-maharashtra-acts-tough-against-official-who-gave-lockdown-passes-to-wadhawans/story-uUjPYqqR2j63P2v7vvrM8H.html

10-04-2020||India||47 in Covid-19 quarantine locked inside their houses in MP||Forty-seven people under quarantine have been locked inside their homes with their families by authorities in Madhya Pradesh to prevent them from moving out during the isolation period of 14 days, according to officials.This is the first time such a step has been resorted to by authorities in the state in the fight against Covid-19. This was done in Khajuraho and Rajnagar towns of Chhatarpur district, about 350 km northeast of Bhopal, on Thursday evening.Both towns have been under curfew since March 25, after it was found a tourist infected by the Coronavirus had visited the places. Arrangements have been made for delivery of essential goods to the people locked within their homes.The sub-divisional magistrate of the area, Swamnil Wankhede, said he took the decision to lock the houses as the families were not cooperating with the administration in observing home isolation norms.“The step was taken for only those persons who went out of the district after March 30 and returned after getting themselves treated in hospitals in Gwalior, Bhopal, Kanpur, Allahabad, Delhi and other places. We had not put any lock earlier but we observed that in the past two days, many of them violated the home quarantine norms and moved out,” he said.“Since they came from areas which are in a danger zone as far as Covid-19 is concerned and they were not willing to follow the home quarantine norms strictly, such a step was taken by the administration.”The families of these 47 people had to be quarantined too as they were in touch with them, Wankhede said.He said arrangements were made for delivering goods to meet the needs of the people locked within their houses. “We have given them phone numbers for home delivery of essential items. We have also provided emergency phone numbers to them in case they need it,” he said.The ‘patwari’ of the area and nagar parishad employees will visit these houses every morning and evening, he added.Though outsiders aren’t being allowed to enter the area, Wankhede said similar steps will be taken for anyone who comes to the district from outside and doesn’t cooperate with the administration in observing home isolation.Chhatarpur’s Congress MLA, Alok Chaturvedi, criticised the administration’s action, describing it as “autocratic and inhuman”.“The administration has unleashed a reign of terror instead of creating awareness among people. The public representatives were not taken into confidence before taking such a harsh measure,” he said.However, Chhatarpur’s district collector Sheelendra Singh said, “The step is just to ensure they strictly follow the home quarantine norms to ensure their own safety and that of others in society. The decision was taken only when it was observed that they left their houses during the night. If they are willing to cooperate with the administration and stay in their houses during the [quarantine] period, we will remove the locks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/47-in-covid-19-quarantine-locked-inside-their-houses-in-mp/story-MPM6aLV5GllC4wbbPm1FkL.html
10-04-2020||India||‘Took it head-on’: IAS officer Tina Dabi on how Bhilwara model for Covid-19 worked||Rajasthan’s Bhilwara was one of the first Covid-19 clusters to emerge in the country and was put under complete lockdown by the state and district authorities to contain the spread of coronavirus. From becoming the coronavirus hotspot, Bhilwara, about 250 km south of state capital Jaipur, is now being talked about its ‘ruthless containment’ model as administrations elsewhere are following the steps taken by the district’s authorities. Tina Dabi, the 26-year-old Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer and a part of the team that handled the situation, spoke to Hindustan Times’ national political editor Sunetra Choudhury about how things turned around.Dabi said one of the first things the team did was to isolate the district and make sure people were taken into confidence.Also watch| ‘Decided on curfew within 1 hr’: IAS Tina Dabi on stemming Covid in Bhilwara“Even we were taken aback that we would be compared with Italy and described as the coronavirus hotspot. Preparations were in place like any other place in the country and basic measures were in place,” Dabi, who has been Bhilwara’s sub-divisional magistrate from October 2018, said.Also read: Will containment zones work?“On March 19, we got our first positive case and it was on March 20 we connected the dot and we found out that it was one whole private hospital that could be the epicentre of the whole crisis,” she said.The young IAS officer was talking about the Brijesh Banger Memorial Hospital (BBMH) whose doctors and staff were the first ones to test positive in the area. The district administration decided right away for a complete shutdown and Bhilwara was sealed off, much before the nationwide lockdown on March 25.“Within a matter of two hours, the collector of the district Rajendra Bhatt took the very stern and firm decision that we need to go for a curfew and we need to go for a complete shutdown,” she said.Dabi said as soon as the order was passed and she went around the whole city, “shutting everything down, convincing people, even scolding a few people, requesting and persuading them telling them not to panic”. “And, within a day or two we had to work out all the system to ensure that people are not inconvenienced,” she said.The 2016 batch IAS office said it wasn’t smooth sailing for the team looking to wage a war against the coronavirus disease.“For the first three-four days, we were receiving panic calls from everywhere in the city and district…We had to tackle so many things but we always took it as a matter of pride that we are doing national service and it is a time of public health emergency and no matter how hard it gets we have to take it head on,” she said.“We had just one mission in mind and we had just one target that we just need to stop it … We were sitting on a ticking time bomb where it could reach any number. There was actually a possibility of massive community spreading,” she added.The administration had to ensure door to door supply so that people understood the danger at hand and they managed.“It took a week... People won’t cooperate if you don’t take care of the essential services and working that out was a nightmare for my district collector and the entire team but we worked really well under his leadership.”One of the most challenging things during the implementation of the containment, Dabi said was to handle cases where people were very emotional. She said students stuck in the city and their worried parents were among such people.“When people are emotional it’s very difficult to make them understand that these are tough times and they really need to understand that,” she said.The IAS officer is all about extending the nationwide lockdown put in place from March 25 to April 14. “I am saying this because we really don’t know the current status of the virus and how it’s going to pan out. We must accept that we are slightly clueless about it. But what we are really sure is that social distancing is what can really, really avert the crisis. And for social distancing, the thing which can only be done administratively is going for lockdown and shutdown,” she said.The Bhilwara model was successful because they ensured it was implemented ‘very well’ despite the many problems on the ground level.“Everybody was scared about Bhilwara and now everybody is appreciating it… We convinced the public though it took a short while of three to five days now they are cooperating,” she said.“They finally understood that it was for their own good.”For that to happen, the administration had to make sure that the essential supplies and services were kept running.“Without this in place, people would never cooperate, your lockdown measures will fail within a day or two. And then it will be of no use,” she said.Dabi also had a word of caution. “You have to also ensure that if there is an emergency…you have to consider those cases on a case by case basis. Of course, there might be some exigencies you can’t avert your eyes from that. You have to keep yourself open to that possibility.”Handling the situation in Bhilwara, Dabi said, will be one of the challenging assignments and a lifetime opportunity.“We never get this opportunity to serve so many people to handle a crisis of this magnitude. I think the Iearning experience that is going to come from it is going to be very rewarding for me though out my career and I am looking at it as a matter of pride.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-took-it-head-on-ias-officer-tina-dabi-on-how-bhilwara-model-worked/story-0EJjKmKt9LX5KmvhZS6WoK.html
10-04-2020||India||Drastic fall in TV viewership during ‘9pm 9min’ call given by PM Modi: Report||When India united to light lamps and candles on appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “challenge the darkness of coronavirus”, it led to a steep fall in television viewership.PM Modi had asked people to switch off lights and light up torches, candles, lamps and cellphone torches at 9 pm for 9 minutes on April 5 as a mark of solidarity in fight against coronavirus disease Covid-19.According to a report by Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), Prime Minister’s appeal led to the lowest ever viewing in that time segment since 2015, showing how the initiative brought the nation together. The TV viewership dropped by 60 per cent during these nine minutes as compared to previous weeks. The decline started by 08:53 pm and came back to current trends only after 09:30 pm, the BARC report said.The report was released on Thursday jointly by BARC and Nielsen Media. It showed how India follows the global trend in showing continued increase in TV (43 per cent) and smartphone consumption (13 per cent) this week vis-a-vis the period before Covid-19.The growth in TV consumption this week was driven by the movie genre (77 per cent growth).Interestingly, despite the absence of any new sporting event, the viewership for sports channels grew 21 per cent as they beamed India’s cricket wins from the past and also old wrestling matches, it said.PM Modi had earlier called on people to go on a self-imposed Janta Curfew and stay inside their homes and avoid going outside between 7 am to 9 pm on March 22. He had also asked people to come to their doorways, balconies and windows to clap or ring bells at 5 pm to thank those working toward essential services.Hundreds of thousands across the country had responded to the Prime Minister’s appeal to cheer doctors, nurses, police officials and others who are working to fight the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drastic-fall-in-tv-viewership-during-9pm-9min-call-give-by-pm-modi-report/story-O2K6kpHqAW7T4SEboGuK1L.html

10-04-2020||India||Covid-19: States protest against Centre’s directive on PPE procurement||A directive by the Centre, asking states to not procure personal protective equipment (PPE) for Covid-19 on their own, has led to protests from states.In a notification sent to principal secretaries of the health departments of states on April 2, the Union ministry of health and family welfare asked them to not procure crucial medical equipment such as PPEs, N-95 masks and ventilators on their own, as they will be procured by the Centre and then distributed to the states. The decision was taken at the third meeting of the empowered group formed to look at procurement of medical equipment that took place on April 1, the note said. By way of rationale, the notification said that states were found to be hoarding these materials as field functionaries, such as care working as essential service providers, continued to work without them. In some areas, inventories which can do with some repair work, were lying, the Centre noted. A senior government official, involved in the process, said that the move was prompted by reports coming in from states that in states where domestic producers of PPEs are situated, state officials have insisted that the produce be sent to states instead. India has just started domestic production of PPEs. The textile ministry has readied over 45 producers to manufacture PPEs such as masks and coveralls - that require non-woven fabric - as well as manufacturers of such fabric. N-95 masks are being made by two domestic producers with the help of DRDE, while ventilators are manufactured by two other producers domestically. In addition to that, Indian auto manufacturers are also preparing to step up manufacturing of ventilators.The official said there were reports that some of the states were individually procuring PPEs which were untested by authorised agencies. To ease shortage, the Centre has announced the lifting of basic customs duty and health cess till September 30 on crucial medical equipment such as ventilators, face and surgical masks, PPEs, Covid-19 test kits, and on any item that goes into the making of these items. A notification was issued by the finance ministry’s department of revenue on April 9.The move has led to protests from states. Former Lok Sabha MP from Kerala, MB Rajesh said that the Centre is trying to wash its hands off its failure to act in time and because of this move, states will suffer. “The first case was detected on January 30 and the lockdown was announced on March 24; the government had 54 days to act, but it wasted time. One cannot eradicate Covid-19 by lockdown, so every state has to prepare,” he said. He added that since health is a state subject, states should be allowed to do their own procuring. DMK MP from Tamil Nadu’s Dharmapuri, Dr Senthilkumar S, took to Twitter to voice his protest. He said that he strongly condemns the move to make health care centralised, and that Tamil Nadu and Kerala will be affected the most. “This is (an) infringement on state’s federalism,” he tweeted. The move could well be revised soon, said a senior textiles ministry official. Nihar Ranjan Dash, joint secretary at the textiles ministry, said that the health ministry’s move might have been prompted by a need to “rationalise” procurement and inventories. He said that the domestic manufacturers whose samples were tested and approved by the textile ministry have started producing 15,000 units of PPEs such as masks and ventilators per day. “By April 20, we will be producing 30,000 units per day easing the shortage,” said Dash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-states-protest-against-centre-s-directive-on-ppe-procurement/story-C2HLEkLKvPL9gMYGA494LP.html

10-04-2020||India||‘Lord Christ devoted his life to serving others’: PM Modi in Good Friday message||Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished Good Friday by remembering Jesus Christ in his wish on Twitter.“Lord Christ devoted his life to serving others. His courage and righteousness stand out and so does his sense of justice. On Good Friday, we remember Lord Christ and his commitment to truth, service and justice,” he tweeted today. Lord Christ devoted his life to serving others. His courage and righteousness stand out and so does his sense of justice. On Good Friday, we remember Lord Christ and his commitment to truth, service and justice.Good Friday is also known as Great Friday, Black Friday, Easter Friday or Holy Friday, and this year it falls on April 10.It is a significant day for the Christian community since it commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Judas betrayed Jesus, and Christians believed that Jesus came back three days after being crucified, on the day known as Easter.The word ‘good’ in Good Friday means pious or holy. The death of Jesus signifies forgiveness for all of the sins of mankind, with Jesus sacrificing himself for the good of humankind.But this year, the day is being marked in a subdued manner.There was no gathering at churches in Kerala due to lockdown declared by the government to prevent spread of novel coronavirus.Several important rituals including washing of feet were skipped during the ceremonies held at the churches, attended by priests in limited numbers.The torch-lit Way of the Cross procession at Rome’s Colosseum on Good Friday is a traditional highlight that normally draws large crowds of pilgrims, tourists and Romans. But this year, like all public religious gatherings in locked-down Italy, it has been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak.Instead of presiding over the procession at the ancient arena, Pope Francis will lead the Good Friday ritual this year in a night-time ceremony closed to the public in St. Peter’s Square.Good Friday is a day of mourning, and people keep fasts and pray to the Lord. It is a day to remind oneself of Jesus Christ’s sacrifices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lord-christ-devoted-his-life-to-serving-other-pm-modi-in-good-friday-message/story-i2TTb2YrfAIvicHZAUjaAK.html

10-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: What made Kasaragod a Covid-19 hotspot and how life is in this Kerala town||A police vehicle screeches to a halt in a deserted locality in Kasaragod town, which was earlier a busy intersection, and makes a public announcement that those who need essentials can dial the number given to every household and these things will be distributed in the evening. Fire department personnel are busy spraying disinfectants at the bus stand and other areas.In Kerala’s hotspot Kasaragod district in north Kerala which reported 156 of the state’s 345 Sars-CoV-2 virus cases, people are living under a curfew.Initially it was difficult for the people to follow stricter norms, but they were forced to fall in line after police started implementing them ruthlessly. Strict action forced many to remain indoors. “We have made the turnaround. We did it ruthlessly and told people it is life and death situation. Results are there to see,” said Vijay Sakhare, Inspector General of Police (Kochi range) who was specially assigned in north Kerala when situation turned alarming.“First we cut off all villages and all roads were blocked and started observing people on home quarantine strictly. Those who jumped home quarantine were shifted to government quarantine, which have minimum facilities, immediately. Every day a sub-inspector and his team visits people on quarantine and monitor their health condition and shows a video on social distancing and other measures,” he said.Kasaragod is one of the early 10 Covid-19 hotspots declared by the Union Health Ministry. When Pathanamthitta in central Kerala came out of the list, Kasaragod struggled with cases. High number of expatriates, poor surveillance in initial days and lack of proper medical infrastructure pushed the costal district neighbouring Karnataka to infamy. Senior IAS officer Alkesh Kumar Sharma and Inspector General of Police Vijay Sakhre were rushed to the district when Kasargod reported at least half of the total cases.“It is worse than a curfew. Though we faced many difficulties we realised it is for our good. Mobile and socialising lot, we never spent so many days behind doors like this. But we are happy that these restrictions helped contain the virus otherwise Kasaragod would have been another Dharavi,” said Usman Koya, a native of Kananhad, who returned from Bahrain last year.Earlier, the district had reported many glaring cases of apathy, including that of an alleged smuggler jumping quarantine and transmitting the disease to many. After his case came to light, customs officials found that he had made 14 trips to the Middle East in last three months. Later, the district collector had impounded his passport and registered a case against him.“Things are under control now. Among 156 cases, 101 are those who returned from the Middle East. Rest are their immediate contacts. There is no community spread in the district but we are keeping a strict vigil,” said district collector D Sajith Babu.According to the district administration, at least 5,000 people came from the Gulf since February 15 in the district and they were put on home quarantine but many later slipped out aggravating the situation. At least 60 per cent of the returned from Dubai are from Naif, a crowded commercial and residential area in Dubai, one of the hotspots in the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-what-made-kasargod-a-covid-19-hotspot-and-how-life-is-in-this-kerala-town/story-Ctixt9iDqCJF4rCftLzbcO.html
10-04-2020||India||Officials in MP town lock families inside houses, say not cooperating during Covid-19 lockdown||In perhaps first of its kind measure in the country, as many as 47 persons were locked inside their houses with their families by district administration in a bid to prevent them from moving out during home quarantine period of 14 days to check the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19, as per administrative authorities.The steps were taken at Khajuraho and Rajnagar, two towns in Chhatarpur district, 344 kilometres north east of capital Bhopal, on Thursday evening.Both the towns are under curfew restrictions since March 25 after it was found that a Covid-19 positive tourist had visited the places earlier.Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of the area, Swamnil Wankhede, took the decision in view of as he said the families not cooperating with the administration in observing home isolation norm.He said, “The step was taken for only those persons who went out of the district after March 30 and returned to the place after getting themselves treated in hospitals in Gwalior, Bhopal, Kanpur, Allahabad, Delhi and other places. We had not put any lock earlier but we observed that in the past two days many of them violated home quarantine norms and moved out. Since, they came from such areas which are in a danger zone as far as Covid-19 is concerned and they were not willing to follow the home quarantine norm strictly such a step was taken by the administration.”“Members of these people’s families had to be quarantined too as they are in touch with them,” Wankhede added.The official said that the administration has taken care of their needs while taking the stringent measure. “We have given them phone numbers for home delivery of essential items. We have also provided ‘emergency phone numbers’ to them in case they need it. The Patwari concerned and employees of nagar parishad would visit these houses in the morning and evening every day invariably.”He said such a step would be taken for others also who come from outside and are not willing to cooperate with the administration in observing home isolation. However, outsiders were not being allowed to enter the area.Chhatarpur’s Congress MLA Alok Chaturvedi said, “The decision of the administration is autocratic and inhuman. The administration has unleashed a reign of terror instead of creating awareness among people. The public representatives were not taken into confidence before taking such a harsh measure.”However, district collector of Chhatarpur Sheelendra Singh said, “The step taken is just to ensure they follow the home quarantine norm strictly to ensure their own safety and that of others in society too. The decision was taken only when it was observed that they left their houses during night hours. If they are willing to cooperate with the administration and stay in their houses during the period we will remove the locks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officials-in-mp-town-lock-families-inside-houses-say-not-cooperating-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-kPUdIhUJSaxIZyIplXuw6K.html

At present, China is holding presidency of the UNSC.Also read: Pakistan pledges $3 mn to Saarc Covid-19 Fund proposed by PM Modi. Then, a riderThe official also reportedly said that the Kashmir issue is a dispute left from history and should be properly and peacefully resolved.“We reject the reference to Jammu and Kashmir in a statement made by the spokesperson of the Permanent Mission of the People’s Republic of China to the United Nations,” Srivastava said.He was responding to a query on the remarks by the Chinese spokesperson.“China is well aware of India’s consistent position on this issue. The Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir has been, is and shall continue to be an integral part of India. Issues related to J and K are internal matter to India,” he said.“It is, therefore, our expectation that other countries, including China, would refrain from commenting on matters that are internal affairs of India and respect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said.China has been critical of India’s reorganisation of J-K, and has particularly criticised New Delhi for making Ladakh a union territory. China lays claim over several parts of Ladakh.China has unsuccessfully attempted to raise the issue in the UN after India announced its decision in August last year to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcate the state into two union territories.In August, China pushed for a UNSC meeting on Kashmir after India’s decision. However, the attempt was foiled by other member-states of the powerful body.India’s decisions on Kashmir had also cast a shadow over Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India in October last year for the second informal summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.However, notwithstanding the acrimony over the issue between the two countries, Modi and Xi held “successful” talks in Mamallapuram in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-has-been-is-shall-continue-to-be-an-integral-part-india-slams-china-over-remarks-to-un/story-q9C4EBpRisKYleqmUJSoAN.html
10-04-2020||India||Calls to scrap Central Vista project grow||Pressure is mounting on the Narendra Modi government to put on hold the central vista redevelopment project in New Delhi and the construction of a new Parliament building as the nation battles the deadly coronavirus disease outbreak, which has claimed 166 lives and infected 5,095 people as of Thursday. Almost all opposition parties have urged Modi to shelve the project and spend the money instead on advancing the fight against Covid-19.Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to the PM on Tuesday in which she listed five austerity tips that included suspending the Rs 20,000 crore allocated to the project. “At a time like this, such an outlay seems self-indulgent to say the least. I am certain that Parliament can function comfortably within the existing historical buildings. There is no urgent or pressing requirement that cannot be postponed until this crisis is contained,” she wrote.“This sum could instead be allocated towards constructing new hospital infrastructure and diagnostics along with equipping our frontline workers with better facilities,” added Gandhi.NCP chief Sharad Pawar urged Modi to consider postponing the move after examining the country’s current priorities.His views were echoed by DMKleader TR Baalu who told the PM the need of the hour is to abandon the move. “It is not required at this moment. The government should instead divert the Rs 25,000 crore earmarked for the project to step up efforts to fight Covid-19,” he said. CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury too questioned the timing of issuing the land use change notification. “When all resources must be mopped up to meet this Covid-19 challenge, a gazette notification is issued for the Rs 20,000 crore central vista project. Shame,” he tweeted.TMC leader Mahua Moitra also slammed the move. “The government is suspending MPLADS funds for two years for generate resources to fight Covid-19 but wants to spend Rs 20,000 crore on the central vista project,” she said.“The project was scheduled to be tendered in April but given the current situation all resources have been diverted to fight Covid-19. There will be delays for now, but we are on track and will make up for the time lost,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity. The BJP refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calls-to-scrap-central-vista-project-grow/story-yaWBo0NqXKcfu5032GsBoL.html
10-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Rural women in India bear the brunt of the lockdown||On Wednesday, 62-year-old Vandini Devi walked five kilometres from her village in Bokaro, Jharkhand to the bank in order to check if money had been credited to her Jan Dhan account. She was disappointed to learn that it hadn’t. A resident of Chargi village, Devi said she had not received her widow pension since February, either. “We were promised two months’ free food grain, but I was given 5 kilograms of ration for only one month. My younger son works as a daily wager and has had no work due to lockdown. I am in big distress,” Devi said.India’s rural population has been central to most relief measures announced since the 21-day lockdown began. On March 26, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ~ 500 will be credited into Jan Dhan accounts held by women for three months, starting April. There are more than 203.9 million such accounts. Separately, many states have also allocated funds to keep the Public Distribution System (PDS) flush with supplies, even as daily wage, manual and agricultural work dries up. At the other end of this are the nearly 40 million rural women who are the purported recipients of these benefits. With no money in the bank account, and government assistance awaited, 55-year-old Shahjahan in Lucknow’s Asti village has only 15kg wheat and 10kg rice left for her family of five. On March 30, UP chief minister Adityanath announced relief worth ~611 crore to all Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme beneficiaries, following which Shahjahan visited her bank. She said she waited for over an hour but found no cash in her account. In many parts of the country, work under MNREGS has come to a halt. Crop harvesting too has been affected leading to a break in supply chains, as farmers are unable to send their produce to ‘mandis’. In Maharashtra, for instance, the lockdown is being implemented rigorously, with police patrol cars preventing farmers from farming activities. Sulekha Naba, a 40-year-old tribal woman in Badipalli village of western Odisha district of Bargarh queued up like other villagers to get the ~1,000 assistance that chief minister Naveen Patnaik had announced for cardholders under the national food security act. Naba, a landless daily labourer, has been without work since the lockdown. While she did receive three months ration, she worried that the cash assistance would hardly be enough to sustain her family. Odisha has 7.4 million households under Jan Dhan yojana — that’s 99.85% of the total number of households in the state. Long queues of women to withdraw ~500 from their Jan Dhan bank accounts have been witnessed in almost all rural areas in Maharashtra. Yogesh Warkhede, a ‘bank friend’ appointed by Bank of Baroda at Nampur village in Nashik district of Maharashtra said almost 200 people have visited his home to enquire about the deposits.To an extent, the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu have been able to manage such crowds through an innovative token system: Each family is given a token with a specific date and time to pick up their rations at the Fair Price shops. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh completed the first phase of distribution of rice and other essential commodities, as well as cash assistance in the first week of April itself. In Kerala, ration holders are classified on the basis of their economic vulnerability. The state did away with biometric identification on April 1 to aid the process of distribution. It has now started supplying the ration based on SMSes in order to control the rush. Not all states have been able to use technology seamlessly, however. In Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh, Guddi Bai Lodhi, 58, went to the branch of Gramin Bank to collect her ~500. “When my turn came, the bank clerk said the ‘link’ was not working.”She managed to get cash and purchase a few grocery items.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-rural-women-in-india-bear-the-brunt-of-the-lockdown/story-gpWttWeBmJlUPwCZg43dHJ.html
10-04-2020||India||Coronavirus lockdown: Over 80% people in the metros tune in to radio||Radio has emerged as one of the most credible sources of information for millions of people in India, who are unable to venture outside because of a nationwide lockdown, according to a recent survey.As many as 82% of the population in metros is turning to radio, according to the survey conducted by market consulting firm AZ Research Partners Pvt. Ltd in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Pune and Hyderabad among the 18 years and above age group.Radio has a credibility score of 6.27, second only to the internet, at 6.44, with television at 5.74, the survey found. The radio industry has witnessed a listenership of 51 million people, close to television’s reach of 56 million and social media’s reach of 57 million.Radio’s at-home listenership has jumped from 64% to 86%. The time people spend listening to radio has soared 23% to 2.36 hours every day during the lockdown, second only to television.“As the covid-19 pandemic takes over the world, the role of entertainment mediums becomes all the more crucial. Radio, which is a critical medium, has the dual responsibility of not only entertaining listeners, but also ensuring that correct and genuine information reaches the country’s citizens. At a time like this, the power and effectiveness of our medium increases manifold,” said Harshad Jain, chief executive of radio and entertainment at HT Media Ltd and Next Mediaworks Ltd.“People are now tuning in to the radio sets more than ever for their daily entertainment needs and also to stay updated with credible information. With the entire country under lockdown, the listenership has shifted to in-home listening. The entire radio industry stands together in these tough times to win the fight against coronavirus,” said Jain.It is encouraging to note that radio is evolving as one of the most preferred sources of infotainment, said Anurradha Prasad, president of the Association of Radio Operators for India.HT Media Ltd, publisher of HT, operates radio channels under the Fever 104 FM and Radio Nasha brands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-lockdown-over-80-people-in-the-metros-tune-in-to-radio/story-O0WOutLDO6jmD5Hg21EWlL.html
10-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: States asked to fill 227 vacancies of epidemiologists||The Central government has directed states to fill up 382 vacancies of medical and other staff across the country to ensure the availability of “qualified human resources” during the coronavirus pandemic. A letter, issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on April 7, directs the states to fill these vacancies under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP). Of the vacancies, the maximum – 227 – are for epidemiologists. As many as 11 states do not have a state-level epidemiologist. Epidemiologists study patterns of frequency and the causes and effects of diseases in human populations. The other vacancies include that of data managers, veterinarians, financial consultants and microbiologists. The issue of the vacancies was highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a virtual meeting with the chief ministers on April 3, the health ministry letter said. HT has seen a copy of the letter. The decision to fill the vacancies of epidemiologists and other required posts is to ensure “surveillance activities of Covid-19”, the letter states. An epidemiology professor who did not wish to be named said that ideally every district under the lDSP should have at least one epidemiologist along with one state epidemiologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-states-asked-to-fill-227-vacancies-of-epidemiologists/story-yOGWX7kCCLopX6p5HaVrIO.html
10-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Wednesday and Thursday, more states adopted the containment zones approach, enforcing hard lockdowns selectively — the size of the zone ranges from a single apartment block to an entire city — highlighting the strategy that India will use over the next few weeks to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) .The HT newsroom has written extensively on such zones, and what the approach involves — door-to-door screening, aggressive testing, and enforced containment and social distancing. Given that Covid-19 tends to manifest itself in clusters (even on a larger scale as evident from what’s happening in New York City), and that India will never be able to test as aggressively as, say, Germany or South Korea, this is a sound approach. It identifies and sequesters the hot spots — and then tests anyone with even the mildest symptoms.With 6,701 infections (and 231 dead) on Thursday, India, this writer would like to think, has been ahead of the curve when it comes to defining containment zones — just as it has been behind the curve on testing proactively. It was also ahead of the curve on enforcing a lockdown at a time when the number of cases in India were still low. Indeed, a study by the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government, says India was quicker than almost every other country in imposing a lockdown on March 25. Did the lockdown work? Did it flatten the curve? Or is the virus raging undiscovered through India? The last seems unlikely. If that were the case, there would have been be a spike in unexplained fatalities across the country — the kind of thing that is almost impossible to hide in a country with as high a number of mobile phones as India (nothing seems to happen without at least a few people capturing it on their phones).That could mean one of two things: the curve is flattening; or the strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus infecting people in India has mutated into a milder version (which means it may be infecting lots of people without really affecting their health significantly). After all, only around 50 of the 3,375 active cases in India on April 6 were on ventilator support. Still, all these are questions and theories that require more scientific study.As is the question of whether the Sars-CoV-2 virus is affected by temperature and humidity. Not enough to cause a sharp reduction in infections, the US National Academy of Sciences said in a report that summarised existing research, although it said more research was warranted. The number of infections, fatalities, and cured recoveries (581 according to the latest data) in India have now reached a level where researchers in the country can start doing primary research to answer such questions and, indeed, others — such as the immune response in India; the strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus in later infections; and the treatment that seems to be the most effective. Social distancing can help prevent the spread of the infection, but ultimately, only research can find a cure for it.Meanwhile, health care workers at the frontlines continue to fight it with all they have. Theirs are the stories that need to be told and celebrated, of real heroes going above and beyond the call of duty (but still behaving as if it’s just business as usual). At Delhi’s Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, for instance, doctors, nurses, technicians, even security staff have been doing 14-day shifts, and then 14-day furloughs at a hotel or a hostel (without going home so as to not infect anyone) since March 16 (see page 1). When it really matters, India’s health care workers have stepped up to be counted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today-april-10-2020/story-UP2cakzLJXqyC66TEtNCpK.html
10-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Cops turn counsellors for denizens||When everyone in the country has been asked to remain indoors during lockdown, and is receiving all the gyan in the world on how to deal with social isolation, it’s mostly the cops that you get see on the roads. And it’s the men in uniform who aren’t just maintaining law and order but also doubling up as counsellors to help people stay safe and sane amid the coronavirus scare. Mitali Khuranna, a resident of Delhi’s Moti Bagh, says, “I live alone with my house help; my kids are settled in London. So, when the lockdown was announced, I was so scared about the whole scenario that I called on the Delhi Police helpline number for senior citizens, and was directed to a personnel at the Covid-19 helpline. And I must say that the cop on the phone were really patient, heard me, and even asked me if I needed them to visit my place. It’s satisfying to know that someone is there for me.” READ | Delhi police head constable posted at IGI airport immigration tests Covid-19 positiveThere have been instances of people, who had stocked up ration in their homes much before the lockdown was announced, also calling the cops out of panic. Asif Mohd Ali, DCP Licensing — who is heading the Covid-19 helpline of Delhi Police — says, “Many want to store maximum ration in their houses. We told them there is nothing to worry. And our beat officers are even meeting the senior citizens who feel depressed and alone at home in these times. We have clearly briefed our staff to be gentle and caring towards the people who are already in a state of panic right now.”   The 24X7 helpline number issued by the Delhi Police (011-23469526) received a total of 10,352 calls from the day the lockdown was announced till April 3. And there are also personal interactions that the cops on beat have been having with public in general. Ali adds, “Our role has evolved from just being cops who look after law and order to be counsellors. A few days back, we got a call on the helpline where a family wanted to take their relative’s body to their hometown in Bihar, for cremation. We met them, and made them understand the whole scenario where all of us are expected to follow social distancing, and then we helped them cremate the body in Delhi itself.” READ | Social distancing in Delhi: Grocers say stuck between defiant customers and police booking violatorsBesides, don’t be surprised if you see cops distributing food packets to the needy.

10-04-2020||India||4 medical staff in Andhra’s Anantapur test Covid-19 positive, doctors protest||Several junior doctors at the Government General Hospital in Andhra Pradesh’s Anantapur district boycotted their duties on Thursday in protest against the quality of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits given to them so that they could deal with Covid-19 patients.The doctors’ protest comes in the wake of four medical professionals of the same hospital – two doctors and two nurses – testing positive for coronavirus on Wednesday evening.The Anantapur district medical and health officer confirmed that the four hospital staff, including two senior doctors tested positive for Covid-19 and said they might have contracted the virus due to some lapses in dealing with a 64-year-old patient who died of coronavirus on April 4.Additional Chief Secretary, Health, P V Ramesh, also confirmed the incident in his post on Twitter. Describing the incident as “unfortunate,” he said the government would take measures to see that such incidents did not recur.Anantapur has reported 13 positive cases till now, seven of which were recorded on Wednesday alone, including that of four medical professionals.District Collector Gandham Chandrudu, who visited the hospital on Thursday morning, told reporters that the doctors and nurses had treated the patient suffering from Covid-19 without taking any precautions.“After it was confirmed that the patient had died of Covid-19, the four hospital staff members who treated him were isolated and tested for the virus. On Wednesday evening, it was proved that they had contracted coronavirus,” he said.Apart from the four, as many as 20 other staff members of the hospital, who were suspected to have come in contact with the doctors and nurses, were also isolated.The protesting doctors told the Collector that they would not be able to perform their duties at the hospital if they were not given adequate PPE kits. Chandrudu said he had instructed the medical and health department to ensure that all doctors were provided with protective gear.Lack of sufficient number of PPE kits has become an issue in some other hospitals in the state too. On Wednesday, the state government suspended Dr K Sudhakar, an anaesthesian at the government hospital at Narsipatnam in Visakhapatnam district, for alleging that the government was not providing adequate PPE kits to the doctors.Sudhakar had, on Monday, protested before the media regarding N-95 masks and other protective equipment meant for doctors that were being provided to politicians and the police. “We are asked to use the same mask for 15 days before asking for a fresh mask. How can we treat patients risking our lives?” he asked.As the video of his comments went viral on social media, the state government ordered a probe into his allegations and suspended Sudhakar on disciplinary grounds. The local police also booked a case against the doctor on charges of abusing the government.Narsipatnam MLA P Uma Shankar Ganesh alleged that the doctor had made baseless allegations at the behest of TDP leader and former minister Ch Ayyanna Patrudu.Sudhakar told reporters that he stood by his allegations. “We are working round-the-clock risking our lives. I only spoke the truth and did not make any derogatory comments against the government,” he said.Telugu Desam Party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday wrote a letter to the chief minister requesting that the suspension of Sudhakar be revoked, as he was only highlighting the lack of sufficient protective equipment for doctors.He pointed out that four medical professionals in Anantapur had tested positive for coronavirus while discharging their duties to treat the patients. “When the doctors are risking their lives in the battle against Covid-19, the government is demotivating them instead of giving greater encouragement. The government should give N95 masks, gloves, full-sleeve gowns and eye-shield goggles to doctors at least now,” Naidu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-medical-staff-in-andhra-s-anantapur-test-covid-19-positive-doctors-protest/story-aGsqYZVxZbpC7sAjAji0CO.html
10-04-2020||India||Balancing health concerns and economic activity a challenge for us: Conrad Sangma||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to have a video conference with chief ministers on Saturday to discuss the next course of action after the three-week lockdown to halt the coronavirus pandemic ends on April 14. Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about the meeting, what the way forward should be at the national level and in his state, which has so far remained untouched by the pandemic. Edited excerpts:Your Odisha counterpart, Naveen Patnaik, has announced an extension of the lockdown till April end. Are you likely to follow suit?I think the lockdown definition is the crucial part. What does one really mean by that? One thing is for sure, the inter-state and the movement at a national level is something that states want not to happen at this point. Does that mean that a state as a whole also locks down? That is a call that we have to take in every state. In Meghalaya, we want a lockdown in terms of the inter-state movement. But [the curbs on] small activities like farming or MGNREGS [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme], which involve local people or even small constructions , daily wage people, could be relaxed. It really depends on the definition of the lockdown.Are you saying this because your state has not reported any coronavirus cases yet?I am speaking from both perspectives. From the national perspective, it is advisable that we continue with the lockdown in terms of movement. When it comes to my state, the challenge that we are facing is the balance between health concerns and the livelihood and economic activity of the poor. As a government, we are looking at striking a balance, which is not always the easiest thing to do. We felt that in our state, we would see that in a small, controlled manner, we could have economic activity without risking any health hazard.Is the Centre open to this?If you remember even in the beginning, the Centre allowed certain concessions and some activities. The general consensus is that there should not be movement of people inter-district and there should not be any kind of gatherings. At the end of the day, essential commodities need to move, people need to buy daily products and food items. So there has been flexibility for that from the beginning. I think farming activity, small time construction should be considered now because it is also the time for sowing. What has been the impact of the lockdown on mental health given two labourers in Meghalaya have committed suicide?It is unfortunately that those incidents took place and people were pushed to that level. We pray that it does not happen again but these are testing times. There is no doubt about it. In situations like this, it is not as easy for us to always go to the micro level although we would like to. But we are forced to look at the overall picture and see what is in the national interest. This [lockdown] was a tough decision and I understand people are facing a lot of problems. I can only urge people to see that this is not being done to make their lives difficult but to guard everybody’s interest and health. It is the bigger picture we are looking at. We will do all we can to help the people who are poor and needy and those from the backward sections.Did Modi’s announcement for the national lockdown take you by surprise or you knew about it?Of course, there was a hint in our different discussions... but not on the number of days and the extent [of the lockdown]. Even now, we do have an idea about where we are heading to but we will have to wait and see day after tomorrow [Saturday] what is going to be there. The prime minister has been proactive in consulting chief ministers... it has been a team work on everyone’s part--bureaucrats, political leadership and health workers.What kind of economic impact do you see for your state?I think there is no doubt about the huge impact... The smaller and weaker sections, the daily wage labourers are the people we need to look at. Overall, we are going to see a lot of impact on service sectors like tourism. A large chunk of our population depends on hotels, restaurants, taxis. We have a certain level of manufacturing too. I just hope it [impact] is minimised and the Centre and the state can work together for that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/balancing-health-concerns-and-economic-activity-a-challenge-for-us-conrad-sangma/story-EFTbM5FVKcr1PoWa8K7xvK.html
10-04-2020||India||When govt made 21.9 million e-transactions in a day||On March 30, six days after the prime minister announced a 21-day lockdown in India, the government set a new record : officials across departments carried out 21.9 million financial transactions online, the highest in a single day. The financial year was coming to a close and many to vendors and beneficiaries of welfare schemes had to be sent out in the last week of March and the first two weeks of April (CHECK) . For a team of 16 from the National Informatics Centre (NIC), the brief was clear-- prepare for an avalanche of online transactions on the Public Financial Management System or PFMS. A senior official at NIC said on condition of anonymity that between March 24 and 31, there were 72 million transactions hosted on the system, more than double of the 34.4 million transactions during the same period that the PFMS hosted in 2019. While there is no clarity on the amount of money transacted during that period, an indication is that on April 9 alone Rs 2004 crore was sent across the network. Many of the the transactions were towards PM Kisan, the cash payout scheme for farmers. “Of the 21.9 million transactions on March 30, 19.7 million were direct benefit transfers for PM Kisan,” said the official. The payouts for PM Kisan, a scheme under which farmers get Rs 2000 every four months, have always mostly happened online. The scheme was launched last year in February. The challenge for NIC this time, however, was to ensure that payments are validated and sent out to the 80 million beneficiaries of the scheme by officers from their homes. And that, in doing so, the officers do not face technical problems at their end. All of these transactions were hosted on a management information system (MIS), developed by the NIC sometime in 2013. Known as the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) and accessible online, the software application in its earlier avatar was known as the Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System (CPSMS). It was aimed to bring in transparency to government programs. The application is available on work computers in all government offices through a virtual private network (VPN). The first challenge, the official added, was to ensure that all designated officers had access to it from their homes. In every ministry, only certain officials can greenlight payments and funds transfers. And before the lockdown, most of the permissions were given out on paper, hand-delivered by a network of clerks. However, for times like these when physical signatures cannot be accessed, the system has the option of digital signatures, which designated officials can issue from the system online. To access them, a designated officer needs to enrol at the PFMS portal through a Digital Signature Certificate enrolment module and validate credentials. Nagesh Shastri, deputy director general of the NIC said that apart from direct benefits transfer, other payments made trough the system include funds sent to states and implementing agencies. “The system is integrated with core banking and 400 banks, including the postal bank network, is linked to the system,” said Shastri. Shastri said that the most common problem faced by officials had to do with authorisations of digital certificates. They were all worked out, he added. “To keep it secure, NIC used only its own infrastructure; the central database of the PFMS is in Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-govt-made-21-9mn-e-transactions-in-a-day/story-O6ebyIknRQ93MmM35mB8OL.html
10-04-2020||India||Covid-19 in India: Food prices surge 3 times as supply chain takes a hit||The prices of key staples, barring cereals, have surged nearly three times from a month ago because of a noticeable supply shock amid the three-week nationwide lockdown to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, according to official and market data reviewed by Hindustan Times. Three main factors are driving food prices higher, according to data from the consumer affairs ministry, as well as a dozen agricultural produce market committees (APMCs), which are state-regulated wholesale points. One, arrivals of farm commodities in APMC markets have plunged sharply, down almost 60% in some markets from a month ago, that is, in the first week of March. Two, land transportation costs have risen sharply, as truckers struggle to cross interstate boundaries, despite exemptions from the lockdown. Three, restrictions and quarantine measures have resulted in serious labour shortages, affecting the loading, unloading and sorting of commodities.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic A 10% rise in food prices proportionately hits household budgets in developing nations, according to the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organisation. On April 8, the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation, in a report, said the coronavirus shutdown in India could shatter incomes of potentially 400 million poor Indians.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakCurrently, supply-side factors, such as restrictions and regulations in movement, have caused a spike in food prices. Soon, things could run the opposite way, economists warned, meaning supply shocks could turn into demand shocks.“Loss of income will lead to a drop in demand for food in the coming months. A possible decline in food consumption could result in malnutrition too,” said Himanshu (one name), an economist with the Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University On an aggregate basis, price of cereals, such as wheat and rice, are steady, mainly because these are being adequately supplied from state-run granaries.Also Read: Coronavirus cases in India mount to 6,412, death toll touches 199“Restrictions have impeded farmers’ access to markets, denying outlets of sale for farm produce,” said R Mani, an economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. What is clear is that there has been no noticeable fall in winter crop production. Rather, state and federal officials have failed to coordinate supplies and ensure deliveries at the right time and at fair prices.The Centre has issued advisories on four occasions to freely allow agriculture and linked activities that form the farm-to-fork supply chain, on March 25, March 26, April 2 and April 8.Yet, broken chains of command are testing the limits of ensuring that the essential needs of 1.3 billion people are met during the lockdown, which was imposed from March 25. States are regulating supplies with permits and only selected agents are being given passes to deliver commodities at farm markets, to reduce crowding and maintain social distancing norms. This permit-driven supplies are a throwback to the Socialist licence raj era predating the 1991 economic reforms. APMC markets are the nerve centres of the country’s food supply chain, which see a web of daily interactions between producers and food aggregators, large suppliers, auctioneers, transporters and packagers, who collectively act as price setters.India’s official retail food inflation data for March is due for release on April 13 and will likely reflect this upswing. However, since retail prices are collected by field agents, an activity that has been disrupted by the lockdown, the National Statistics Office has, in a directive, asked its statisticians to adopt novel ways, including telephonic enquiries. Two commonly consumed vegetables – tomato and onion – offer a representative idea of the supply crunch.Between April1-6, for instance, Andhra Pradesh’s Mulakalacheruvu APMC market, a tomato hub, received just 60 tonnes of tomato that went for a modal price of Rs 550 a quintal (100 kg each) or Rs 5.5 a kg, according to official data. Modal price, a type of average, is simply the price point occurring the most number of times during auctions. The retail rate of tomatoes in towns supplied by Mulakalacheruvu ruled between Rs 30-40 kg, a huge mark-up, according G. Sasidhar, an official of the APMC. In Nashik’s Lasalgaon, Asia’s biggest onion market, arrivals are down by over 80% from a month ago, data from the state-run National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation showed. In the first week of April, the market saw arrivals of nearly 11,878 quintals of onion, trading at a modal price of Rs 775 a quintal. In contrast, in the first week of March, onion arrivals in Lasalgoan were 73,955 quintals. This is an 83% drop. The average retail price of onions in Chandigarh and Guwahati were Rs 40 and Rs 50 respectively, double their usual rates.On April 8, the Union home ministry, which coordinate with the states, asked all state governments to invoke provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, which includes capping prices of any edible item. No state has so far put a price cap on food staples. Unable to source buyers, farmers are dumping farm produce. “My neighbour had to dump one tonne of chillies and two tonnes of chickpeas because there were no buyers at the mandi,” Amra Ram, a leader of the All India Kisan Sabha, said over the phone from Rajasthan’s Sikar APMC. Bottlenecks in transportation have weighed heavily on farmers. Federal instructions and orders issued by state administrations are not in tandem, as first-hand reports suggest. India is one economy but many individual markets. Steering all of them in one direction, all of sudden, has been a key challenge, ground reports suggest. “The home ministry’s orders have not percolated to the ground level even though operators want their vehicles to move. Trucks are still being stopped at various state borders,” Kultaran Singh Atwal, president of the lobby group, All-India Motor Transport Congress, said.Atwal said once trucks dump their consignments, they are then stuck as state authorities don’t allow them to ply back empty. This problem of one-way traffic needs immediate resolution and has pushed up road transport costs by at least 15%, he said.“We got 42 kg of rice, five kg of dal [lentil] and two litres of cooking oil from the government. But my three children are eating much less than before because there are no vegetables and fish on their plates,” said Atifa Begum, a resident of North Lakhimpur in the northeastern state of Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/food-prices-surge-3-times-as-supply-chain-takes-a-hit/story-QRqfvQpEnlJOdbwWzsCl4N.html
10-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: Odisha to remain locked down, states weigh options on curbs||Odisha took the lead on Thursday by extending the lockdown for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic by a fortnight until the end of the month, shrugging aside its economic impact, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi indicated that his government isn’t inclined to lift the emergency protocol in its entirety when it lapses on April 14.Human life is more important than the economy, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik remarked after presiding over a meeting.Patnaik requested the Centre to not to order a resumption of commercial flights and train services to Odisha until after the extended lockdown ends. Schools and colleges in the state of 46 million people will remain shut until June 17, he said.“Coronavirus is the biggest threat that the human race has faced in more than a century. In a powerful nation like the US, corona cases have jumped from 3,000 to 400,000. More people have died of coronavirus in the US than all those killed in the 9/11 attack and subsequent wars.Yet, a lockdown could not be implemented entirely there,” said the Odisha CM.Patnaik’s announcement, without waiting for the Centre to take a final call, could set an example for other states that favour a prolonged lockdown to follow. To be sure, most state governments said they were waiting for the Centre to set the direction.  Covid-19 has claimed 230 lives in India since a 76-year-old man from Karnataka’s Kalaburgi on March 10 became the first person in India to die of the infection after returning from a visit to Saudi Arabia. The number of coronavirus infections as of 11p.m. on Thursday had reached 6,701. Odisha’s toll is 44 infections and one death.Prime Minister Modi on March 24 announced a nationwide lockdown with effect from the following day,calling it an effective curfew. All offices and factories, schools and colleges have been shut, and flights,train services and public road transport suspended as part of the lockdown.Modi is due to discuss extending the lockdown with state chief ministers on Saturday via a video conference. On Wednesday, in a video conference with floor leaders of political parties in Parliament, he indicated that he was averse to lifting the lockdown abruptly.“Nobody is saying that lockdown should be lifted. I will talk again to CMs. But as of now the mood is that the entire lockdown lifting is not possible. For us, lockdown is the only way to save our people,” Modi said. Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka have informed New Delhi that the threat of Covid-19 would be easier to handle if the lockdown is prolonged, HT reported on Wednesday, citing an official who requested anonymity. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, too, have favoured an extended lockdown.Here is a snapshot of some states’ stands on the extension. AssamAs of now, the Assam government has decided not to pass any separate Odisha-style directive and to follow the Centre’s guidelines on the lockdown. The state cabinet will meet on April 12 after receiving guidelines from Centre on the lockdown.The Assam government has suggested to the Centre a conditional relaxation of the lockdown in some areas and strict enforcement in other, more vulnerable regions, beyond April 14, state finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.JharkhandJharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren told reporters after meeting experts that the state government would take a timely call on the lockdown, and listed out the factors to consider . “We know the impact of this pandemic if it spreads further. We lack health care facilities. We have sought the Centre’s help. We have made adequate arrangements for providing social security, especially providing food and rations to the needy. But we also need to factor in the impact lakhs of migrants who are stuck in other states would have once they return when we lift the lockdown...”KeralaKerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the state will take a decision on extending the three-week lockdown after the video conference with the Prime Minister on Saturday. The Indian Medical Association’s Kerala chapter and many health experts have called for the lockdown to be prolonged.An expert committee constituted by the state government has suggested that the government lift the lockdown in three phases. It said the time was not ripe for a complete withdrawal after April 14.HaryanaThe Haryana government is likely to go along with the central government’s decision on the lockdown. Indications that the state government is expecting an extended lockdown became apparent on Wednesday when chief minister ML Khattar held a video conference with leaders of opposition parties as well as religious denominations, seeking the latter’s help in persuading people to practice social distancing and abide by stay-at-home orders.Officials said that they were also working on an exit plan in case the lockdown is relaxed after April 14. At the least, the four worst affected districts , Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal and Nuh, which account for 114 of the 134 active Covid-19 cases in Haryana, are certain to face an extended lockdown.MaharashtraSenior officials said the government could decide after Modi’s meeting with chief ministers on Saturday. State health minister Rajesh Tope indicated that the lockdown could continue and that people should not expect things to go back to normal after April 14. The state has seen a sharp spike in cases in urban areas, many of which are densely populated, and the administration might decide to continue the lockdown in these areas, the officials added.Madhya PradeshChief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has dropped hints that the lockdown will be extended. Covid-19 positive cases in Madhya Pradesh are increasing by the day and 13 districts are in the grip of the virus. “Whether or not lockdown period has to be extended will depend on the circumstances in the next one week. The situation in Indore and Bhopal is a matter of grave concern. If need be, the lockdown period can be extended but a decision on the same will depend on the circumstances. Life of people is more important to me. The economy can be revived, but t if we lose a life it can’t come back.”KarnatakaIn Karnataka, chief minister B S Yediyurappa said an expert panel of doctors has unanimously recommended that the lockdown be extended for another fortnight to contain the spread of Covid-19.A final decision on the matter will be taken only after consulting PM Modi and experts on what to do he added– whether to extend the lockdown across the state or to selectively de-escalate it in districts where no Covid-19 cases have been reported as yet . Twelve of Karnataka’s 30 districts are free of the virus. BiharSenior health professionals last week advised Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar against lifting the lockdown fully, cautioning that it would defeat the purpose of containing the fast-spreading contagion. Additional chief secretary (home) Amir Subhani said it was up to thecentral government. “We will abide by the direction of the Centre,” he said.PunjabPunjab has not taken any decision on the extension or relaxation of the lockdown so far. Chief minister Amarinder Singh’s media adviser Raveen Thukral said a decision would be taken after a cabinet meeting on Friday, April 10. Punjab was the first state to impose a curfew on March 23 because of the Coronavirus pandemic.Uttar PradeshChief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Sunday that the state the government will begin lifting the lockdown from April 15, but in a staggered manner. The next afternoon, in the backdrop of a rise in Covid-19 cases, additional chief secretary Awanish Awasthi said lifting the lockdown may not be possible when it ends.On Wednesday, Adityanath said: “The state government--in consultation with the Union government--will decide, -may be on April 11-12, on the lockdown.” On Wednesday,the state government sealed 105 areas in 15 UP districts until April 15 to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease.West BengalChief minister Mamata Banerjee held a meeting with various chambers of commerce and representatives of micro, small and medium enterprises on Thursday to chalk out future plans on the lockdown.The state has already relaxed restrictions on sweet shops, flower traders, the beedi industry and betel leaf traders.“I will put across my views if the Prime Minister consults the states before announcing anything. If the Centre takes a decision we will abide by it,” Banerjee said on Wednesday. Banerjee has also advised people to maintain social distancing for at least 49 days.UttarakhandThe Uttarakhand cabinet, which met on Wednesday, decided that state government will recommend to the Central government to extend the lockdown , given a sudden increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the state. Madan Kaushik, a cabinet minister and government spokesperson, said that until about a week ago, Uttarakhand had only seven cases of Covid-19 and the situation was under control. “But after several jamaatis (those who attended the March meting of Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi) tested positive, the total number of cases has surged to 35. Hence, we have decided to suggest that the Centre increase the lockdown period”Telangana, Andhra PradeshTelangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has already pitched for an extension of the lockdown period for at least for two weeks and has instructed state officials to prepare for it.The Andhra Pradesh government has not yet taken a decision on extending or exiting the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-remain-locked-down-states-weigh-options-on-curbs/story-UFx0UzD4k5KLPMwL6UwM3I.html
10-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: In the line of duty, till the last patient is cured||At 8am on Monday, March 16, a group of 47 health care workers reported for duty at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Delhi’s Tahirpur, aware that they would not see their families for at least the foreseeable future.In the second week of March, the hospital’s administrators knew that it was only a matter of time before the hospital was asked to handle Covid-19 cases. They started discussing work plans with the doctors and other health care workers.On March 16, just around the time everyone was waking up to the crisis, they implemented this plan, which involved everyone in the hospital working 14 days at a stretch, and then spending the next 14 days at government allotted accommodation — on campus, or at the nearby Hotel Leela — in a sort of quarantine to ensure they did not carry the infections back to their families and neighbourhoods.Two 14-day cycles are almost over; the second cycle will end over the weekend. And the first batch of workers — nurses, doctors, technicians, housekeeping and security staff — that worked between March 16 and 30 will be back again.“We came here mentally prepared. We knew that we would not be able to see our families for months. Now we will go home only when we have no Covid-19 patients left in our ward,” said Dr Ajeet Jain, who has been coordinating with authorities from across agencies – officials from the integrated disease surveillance programme, the testing centres, the district magistrates, and ambulance operators who bring in patients.He has also been on call with agencies providing food, arranging transport for those who are discharged, and with the anxious families of the patients admitted to the hospital.“My phone does not stop ringing. I get at least two or three calls every minute,” said Dr Jain, a cardiac surgeon by training and the nodal officer for Covid-19 efforts at the hospital. Between all the calls, he manages a two-hour nap, usually between 3 and 5 am.His wife is a doctor in a mohalla (neighbourhood) clinic in the city, and he has been sharing tips with her on staying safe after reports of mohalla clinic doctors being infected started coming in.“I learnt about all infection control measures and told her everything over video call. At least at her clinic, the staff uses N-95 masks, and all the patients follow social distancing to ensure that no one gets the infection,” said Dr Jain.With at least 172 suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital houses the second highest number of patients after the Lok Nayak Hospital near Delhi Gate. It is located right in the middle of one of the 23 hot spots for the infection that have emerged in the city.All patients coming to the hospital are referred by state health department or district officials who call in ahead. An ambulance is sent to get them.“A separate corridor and lift have been kept for patients coming in. The hospital staff come in from a separate entry,” said Dr BL Sherwal, director, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, which also serves as a screening and sample collection centre.A sample collection kiosk has been created away from the main building, where people can walk in, get screened and, if needed, give swab samples for the test. The hospital is also in the process of upgrading its microbiology laboratory to start doing the RT-PCR {Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction} test for Covid-19. Currently, it sends the samples to four testing centres in the city.The hospital has 200 operational beds, with 45 in the intensive care unit.On Wednesday, there were five patients in the ICU. In the unit, doctors and nurses work in a 6-hour shift without a break.“They all hydrate and visit the washroom before donning Personal Protective Equipment, and usually stay inside for the entire duration of the shift. It can be very taxing,” said Dr Jain.Here’s what is involved: In the donning area, doctors change into hospital scrubs and slippers. They remove all accessories and wash their hands thoroughly. They then put on the shoe covers, the first set of gloves and the full body suit. Then, the N-95 masks are put on, followed by the goggles or face shield. Then comes the head cover and a second pair of gloves.To keep lines of communication open, the doctors and nurses are allowed to carry their cell-phones inside but it has to be without any case and in a plastic bag.“The nurses or junior residents on duty can communicate with senior doctors outside, so they are allowed to carry the phones inside. However, when they step out they have to sanitise the plastic bag, and then the cell phone before taking off their PPE,” said Dr Jain.For those working in the general wards, the shift lasts for 12 hours with only two breaks – one for lunch or dinner and another for tea.At the end of the day, all health care workers at the hospital have to change out of their duty clothes and take a bath before heading home. Which is actually not home. Even at the accommodation, they are asked to stay inside their rooms.“They cannot go out. The food is delivered outside their door. All they have are their phones to communicate with their families and may be watch something. The next morning, they again wake up by 6 and after breakfast report to duty at 8am,” Dr Jain said.Like Dr Jain, Dr Sherwal is on his phone constantly.“There is always some or the other problem that comes up. Yesterday, we received the test report for a patient at midnight; (it was negative) she was with her two children (their tests too were negative). I decided to discharge her immediately. So, I had to coordinate with my team on arranging a vehicle for her,” he said.After she left for home with her children, he complimented his team on the WhatsApp group before going to bed at 1am.He is one of the few who gets to go home in Dwarka, 20km from the hospital. “When I reach home, I ask my wife to open the door and head straight to the shower,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-the-line-of-duty-till-the-last-patient-is-cured/story-Mz9i3TQW6AUxsp71KarQDI.html
10-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: 816 cases jolt India amid harder curbs||The Centre on Thursday approved an emergency response package worth ~15,000 crore to control the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and was considering dividing the Indian Railways into three zones for a staggered exit from the nationwide lockdown, even as it opened a new front in the battle to halt the outbreak by creating over 1,100 containment zones.On Thursday, India reported a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, adding 816 infections to take the total case count up to 6,701, according to a compilation of the official data released by states. Fifty-three fresh deaths were also reported on a day the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) revised its testing strategy. All people with symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose in Covid-19 hot spots or cluster areas will now be tested. Over the past three days, the focus has shifted to the containment zones that are being put under hard lockdown – people can’t step out, shops and banks have to remain closed, and entry and exit from the clusters are sealed. Ranging in size from apartment blocks to entire neighbourhoods, even parts of an entire district, these are the front lines of the Covid-19 war. Teams of sanitary workers make hourly passes, spraying disinfectants, and health care and local officials conduct door-to-door surveys. In Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal termed his government’s containment efforts “Operation SHIELD” – sealing, home quarantine, isolation, essentials, local sanitisation and door-to-door health checks. “I appeal to all living in the containment areas to cooperate with the Delhi government’s Operation SHIELD. These are strict measures but are necessary to protect you and others,” he said.  Kejriwal said the operation was running in 21 localities of Delhi to contain the disease.On Thursday, the government detailed the approval of Rs 15,000 crore for what it called the Covid-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package. Of the total amount, ₹7,774 crore will be utilised immediately and the remaining will be used for medium-term support (one to four years).“The key objectives of the package include mounting emergency response to slow and limit Covid-19 in India through the development of diagnostics and Covid-19 dedicated treatment facilities, centralised procurement of essential medical equipment and drugs required for treatment of infected patients, strengthen and build resilient national and state health systems to support prevention and preparedness for future disease outbreaks…,” the Union health ministry said.The project will be implemented in three phases during the period from January 2020 to March 2024. Phase 1 from January to June 2020, phase 2 from July to March 2021 and phase 3 from April 2021 to March 2024. The scheme, previously announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be centrally funded.Modi is scheduled to hold a video conference with chief ministers on Saturday, his third such meeting with the heads of state governments since India declared the 21-day national lockdown starting on March 25.Several chief ministers have called for at least a partial extension of the lockdown; and the group of ministers headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh that is leading India’s response to the pandemic has also recommended that even if the lockdown is eased, the ban on interstate travel and public transport must remain.Officials said on Thursday that once the lockdown ends, the government may only resume Indian Railways passenger services by dividing the country into three zones according to the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases – a red zone, where no transport will be resumed, a yellow zone with restricted services and a green zone, where transportation will be allowed.“All probable scenarios are being discussed for resumption of services when the lockdown is lifted. We will have to ensure strict social distancing in trains, there has been discussion on no allotment of middle berth in sleeper coaches. No linen or food should be served on trains till situation gets better. Thermal screening should be done at all stations. For the initial days, only special trains should be run in areas with low risk as has been recommended by the empowered groups as well,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity. Measures such as tracking the health of passengers and not allowing passengers above 60 years of age to travel were also being considered, the official added.Under its containment strategy against Covid-19, a highly infectious disease that has killed at least 90,000 across the world, the authorities have identified more than 1,100 zones, mostly in states that have reported more than 100 Covid-19 cases. States such as Odisha, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu released maps on social media notifying the boundary and the buffer of the containment zones.Containment zones are more localised (up to a kilometre in radius) than the hot spots (spreading to several kilometres) and are aimed to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from a locality or a village to nearby areas. “In simple terms, it is a barrier erected around the focus of infection,” said a health ministry document on containment zones.In Delhi, no one is being allowed within two kilometres of containment zones. The police have put up barricades and special local control rooms have been set up to monitor the movement of people in these areas through CCTV cameras.Mumbai, which has the highest number of Covid-19 patients for a city, has 381 containment zones – they have more than doubled in the past two days. A locality with even a single Covid-19 patient is being declared a containment zone. “Health of every person in the zone is monitored around the clock,” said a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) official.Over the past few days, on directions of the Union health ministry, state governments have declared a large number of containment zones. Maharashtra alone has 401 containment zones, with Mumbai having 381 and Pune 20. Uttar Pradesh has 105 containment zones, Rajasthan 38, Madhya Pradesh 180, Tamil Nadu 220, Delhi 23, Telangana 125, including 36 in Hyderabad, and 121 in Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/816-cases-jolt-india-amid-harder-curbs/story-mCeG5z7h7lgQn2gNle90NJ.html
10-04-2020||India||Post lockdown, Indian Railways may colour-code zones||When the coronavirus lockdown eventually ends, the Centre will likely resume railway transport services by dividing the country into three zones based on the number of Covid-19 cases each has reported.The plan is to divide the country into a red zone in which no transport will immediately be allowed, a yellow zone where restricted services will resume and a green zone where transport will be allowed free movement. According to officials aware of the development, these are all probable scenarios that have been discussed by the Centre for resumption of passenger transport after the lockdown, which is due to be lifted on April 14, but may be prolonged . Following a Railway Board review meeting, divisional railway managers (DRMs) across the state-run network have been asked to provide suggestions on how train services can resume in the post-lockdown phase Hindustan Times had reported on Wednesday that the national transporter plans to implement social distancing rules for passengers inside coaches. “All probable scenarios are being discussed for resumption of services when the lockdown is lifted. We will have to ensure strict social distancing in trains, there has been discussion on no allotment of middle berth in sleeper coaches,” a senior government official, said requesting anonymity.No linen will be provided and food served on passenger trains until the situation stabilizes, the official said. Measures such as tracking the health status of passengers and not allowing people above 60 to travel on trains are also being considered. Thermal screening at all stations is being mulled and wearing a face mask will be mandatory. All passenger transport has been suspended for the three-week duration of the lockdown that began on March 25. The national transporter may continue with the restrictions on scheduled passenger trains and run only special trains in the immediate post-lockdown phase, the official cited above said. “There have been suggestions to not allow unreserved travel also as it increases the risk of monitoring travellers who might have symptoms. Trains should avoid and not stop at hotspots that fall in the red zones. In those zones it is advisable to not begin services till the situation improves. One way is to run those trains only from originating stations and terminating stations,” the official added. The national carrier will also seek inputs from states also on resumption of services. Even at airports and on planes the government is seeking to implement strict social distancing norms.The aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), is also preparing a standard operating procedure (SOP) to ensure social distancing among passengers and reducing contact with staff on board. This includes measures like leaving the middle seats empty. The ministry of railways on Wednesday also issued a clarification saying railways has not issued any protocol regarding passenger travel for the post lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-may-colour-code-zones/story-CkpwpjidopgfOJftdgPACJ.html
10-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: India sets up 1,200 Covid-19 containment zones; Maharashtra tops this list||As India intensifies its fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the focus has shifted to about 1,200 containment zones, mostly in states which have reported more than 100 Covid-19 cases. These zones are now under a more strict form of lockdown, with a complete prohibition in the movement of residents, with states adopting specific measures to implement restrictions. The zones — varied in size and scale, ranging from apartment blocks to entire neighbourhoods, even parts of an entire district — are the frontlines of the battle against the pandemic now, where no one, other than except authorised government officials and health workers, are allowed to enter or exit.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The declaration of these zones has happened a little over two weeks into a national lockdown. In the past few days, on directions of the health ministry, state governments have declared a large number of containment zones. Maharashtra alone has 401 containment zones, with Mumbai having 381 and Pune 20. Uttar Pradesh has 105 containment zones, Rajasthan 38, Madhya Pradesh 180, Tamil Nadu 220, Delhi 23, Telangana 125, including 36 in Hyderabad, and 121 in Andhra Pradesh.Containment zones are more localised (up to a kilometer in radium) than the hotspots (spreading to several kilometers) and are aimed to prevent spread of Covid-19 from a locality or a village to nearby areas. “In simple terms, it is a barrier erected around the focus of infection,” said a health ministry document on containment zones.  The logic is that the authorities can focus on containing the infections to a limited cluster, screening residents so that those with symptoms can be identified, testing necessary and eligible cases, and ensuring that those infected and those with a contact history of those infected have no interface with the outside world. Expert quote here on efficacy of the model. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayIn these zones, the police, including special response team of armed commandoes, maintain a round-the-clock watch, assisted with CCTV cameras and drones. Essentials are being delivered by Covid volunteers.Teams of sanitary workers spray disinfectants at regular intervals; health care and local officials do door-to-door surveys; no outlet is allowed to remain open; and people are not being allowed even in the common areas of their localities. Aggressive contact tracing of Covid-19 patients is being done and movement of people, including non-Covid positive persons, is being monitored through mobile apps.State governments, across the country, have adopted different strategies to manage these zones. States such as Odisha, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have released maps on social media notifying the boundary and the buffer of the containment zones.Chennai has two-layered containtment zones. Within nine large zones, there are 70 smaller containment clusters, in the immediate vicinity of those who have tested positive for Covid-19. Each containment zone has a protective radius of five kilometers where movement of people is restricted and disinfectant spraying carried out regularly.Mumbai, which has the highest number of Covid-19 patients for a city, has more than doubled the number of containment zones in the city in the past two days to 381 zones. A locality having even a single Covid-19 patient is being declared a containment zone. “The health of every person in the zone is monitored around the clock,” said a BMC official.Also read: Coronavirus may not go away in warmer weather, says US reportIn Delhi, no one is being allowed within two kilometers of containment zone. The police have put barricades and special local control rooms have been set up to monitor movement of people there through CCTV cameras, officials said. Officials in Jaipur said that every home in the 20 containment areas were being sanitised twice a day.On Thursday, most of the containment zones bore a deserted look as police pushed people back into their homes and municipal workers started massive sanitisation drives, spraying disinfections, cleaning door of individual homes, followed by health workers screening all individuals.In Lucknow’s Sadar’s Kasaibada locality, where Tablighi Jamaat attendees were staying in 12 mosques, Yogendra Kumar, a resident, said, “I peeped out of my window at around 11 am and found cops using a baton to push back three people who had come out in the street despite the strict orders to remain indoors. In the morning, every nook and corner of the locality was cleaned.”In Bhopal, around 3,00,000 people are confined in 70 containment zones. “Health status of every person is with authorities,” said a Bhopal district administration official. In Indore, about half-a-million people are confined in their homes in the around 90 containment zones. “A constant health survey is being done,” said Dr RR Patel, joint director in the directorate of information at Indore.Also read: ₹10 lakh crore stimulus need of the hour, experts estimateIn Punjab’s Mohali, where 15 people tested positive in a Jawaharpur village, 24*7 police barricades have been put up. “Any area, where positive cases are reported, is ‘contained’ by us. We have allowed essential supplies to the village. Entry and exit in these villagers is banned,” said Mohali deputy commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan said, adding quick response teams comprising of Punjab police commandoes have been deployed in these places.Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has announced a “containment zone”, of 1.5 km length and 800 metre width containment zone around a housing complex, the epicenter of the local outbreak with 18 Coronavirus cases. On Twitter, the BMC released a map showing a black dotted line along the busy Cuttack-Puri road indicating the contours of the zone saying “no one can enter or exit” as long as the containment orders were on.However, locals, including some who went out to buy medicines, said that despite a helpline to order essentials, the supply has been erratic. Similar complaints were also reported from Ghaziabad, Noida and Jaipur.Also read: Food prices surge 3 times as supply chain takes a hitMore than shortage of supplies, there is palpable fear of catching the deadly virus. Suketh Chinchela, who lives in Bhubaneshwar’s Surya Nagar area with his family, said there is a certain eerie feeling of living in a containment zone. “But the fear is more that the dreaded disease has come to our doors. Surya Nagar is an area full of retired bureaucrats and old people, thereby heightening the fear,” said Chinchela.“The place looks like a graveyard even in the daytime,” said Samar Khadas, a resident of containment zone in Mumbai’s Worli. “Many residents urgently need physiological counseling as they are feeling depressed,” he said. A resident of Rambanj in Jaipur, Uday Narayan Singh, whose area is under curfew for the past 15 days, said that patience and cooperating with the authorities is the only way to come out of it. “I have seen even most people getting disturbed. We need more reassurance from the government that we are safe,” he said.Kasaragod in Kerala, has been a model in fighting Covid-19 through a containment zone. The small district in northern Kerala, from where 156 of the state’s 345 coronavirus cases were reported, was the first to be declared a containment zone in the country and had been so since March 24.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Initially, it was difficult for the people to go by stricter norms but the police implemented them ruthlessly. Strict action forced many to remain indoors. “We have made the turnaround. We did it ruthlessly and told people it is life and death situation. Results are there to see,” said Vijay Sakhare, Inspector General of Police (Kochi range) who was specially assigned in north Kerala when situation turned alarming.Usman Koya, a native of Kananhad, said it was “worse” than a curfew. “Though we faced many difficulties we realised it is for our good. But I am happy these restrictions helped contain the virus otherwise Kasaragod would have been another Dharavi,” she said.Declaring Kasaragod a containment zone prevented community spread. “Among 156 cases, 101 are people returned from the West Asian countries. The rest are their immediate contacts. There is no community spread in the district but we are keeping a strict vigil,” said district collector D Sajith Babu.The model was also replicated in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara, where the health workers in a private hospital first got infected. The state adopted a model of “ruthless containment”, which succeeded in stopping infections and its spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-on-1-1k-containment-zones-in-covid-action-plan/story-8DwxozZvTMPD3m66O0IMzH.html
10-04-2020||India||Forest ranger comes to aid of tea workers||In April 2017, forest ranger Sanjay Dutta was made in charge of a special task force that aimed to protect eight districts of north Bengal, where the wildlife was particularly vulnerable to poachers. Already well known in the environmentalists’ circles — he received the prestigious Clark R Bavin Wildlife Law Enforcement Award handed out by the Animal Welfare Institute in Johannesburg, in 2016 — Dutta’s brief, as before, was to stop rampant smuggling of rare wildlife like pangolins, and animal products like ivory, in the Belacoba range in Jalpaiguri district.The 42-year-old had, by then, already made scores of arrests and seized smuggled goods. The locals even had a nickname for him: “Forest Singham” (lion of the forest).In the past two weeks, however, Dutta has been busy with something else. With the state government turning down the Centre’s request to allow tea gardens to resume operations, the nearly 283 tea gardens in north Bengal remain under lockdown; most of the 350,000 permanent and casual workers are staring at an impending shortage of food and supplies, and money.Familiar with the area, Dutta has already identified the out of reach spots where tea garden workers have settled, and where local non governmental organisations involved in helping the underprivileged during this lockdown, have not been able to reach. Together with members of his forest department team, he has distributed dry ration and cooked food for thousands of residents in villages and colonies of tea estate workers. Till Tuesday, they had distributed dry rations — 10 kg rice, 500 gram dal, two kg potato and 250 grams soybean — to around 1700 people, and cooked food for more than 3600 people, Dutta said. He also added that he has budgeted Rs 4 lakh of his money for these expenses.Even joint forest management committees — agencies formed by a cluster of villages living close to a reserved forest and registered with the territorial divisional forest office — have come forward with funds. The money raised by at least 20 such committees, made up of villagers and tribal families, was used to distribute 15 to 25 kg rice each among 3000 families living in villages located in remote forest areas, Dutta said. “With Dutta around, we now know that not only forests but even the people who live there are safe,” said Tula Mohammed, president of Hiramari joint forest management committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forest-ranger-comes-to-aid-of-tea-workers/story-6wyfbGh1UmQzT70NEGkf4L.html
10-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Some British tourists stay back in Goa||For Andrew Taylor, it was an easy choice. Retired from the oil rigs and travelling alone, he made a quick decision that he would be staying put in Goa despite the option to go back home to London in the repatriation flights that the UK government is organizing for British citizens stranded across the globe. “I look back at the situation in London where there are thousands of cases a day and I think it is safer here,” Taylor, who is staying at Agonda in south Goa, said. There are around 20,000 British nationals across the country that are stranded in India of which a few thousand are in Goa. The British government has arranged three flights from Goa from this week and four others from Mumbai and Delhi but the repatriation is expected to be a long drawn process with wait lists already running into thousands.Some tourists have chosen to stay put and wait it out in Goa. “I’ve been thinking the same but I’m leaning towards staying here in Goa. I’ve got a place to stay, with plenty of food and water now. Lots of restaurants reopened for home deliveries. Also, the locals have been very caring and friendly to me. I also don’t have my own place in the UK and would have to stay with my parents. I don’t want to put them at risk in case I pick up the virus on the journey,” Josh Baxter, another traveller to Goa staying at Calangute, said.“My only worry is if things get worse in India. And if we did contract the virus, the healthcare would not be as good as the UK. We’ve got another week of lockdown at least. Maybe wait until then and make a decision next week,” he added. Travellers to India usually visit other locations of India as well. Yet, Goa is yet to report its first case of a foreigner contracting the coronavirus (Covid-19). “I’m in Arambol (north Goa) with three of my friends I met. I came here with a girl I met in the hostel I was staying at in Udaipur and then the other two came from Jaipur and we met those at the airport coming here and shared a taxi and ended up staying together,” Charlotte Collins said. “We are having such a nice time and in the same boat as to whether or not to go home. I’m from northeast England, my friend is from Oxford, my other friends are from Mexico and Germany. We all think we want to stay here but due to it being so unpredictable, we are unsure what to do. Plus flights are pretty expensive right now.” A factor on the minds of Britishers in Goa is the price of the repatriation flights which are upward of 600 GBP and the situation in the UK once they land, especially since they will be quarantined upon landing. While initially with the lockdown being near total and a lot of tourists afraid of police brutality as well as hostility from locals, the Goa government has moved to reassure tourists that they will be taken care of and asking hotels and guesthouses to charge tourists only half the rack rates while also providing provisions to some who were caught unawares. “The tourists who are staying in Goa have come much before and are not carriers of the virus so no one should target them,” Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said. The Goa airport has handled 19 relief flights taking around 3,300 tourists back to their respective countries, including Russia, France, Germany, Sweden, Ireland, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, and Kazakhstan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/british-tourists-refuse-to-leave-goa/story-W8UORkiLJ8vANJuM9vz4tI.html

I live in a small rented apartment and do not have many expenses, the money would be better used to fight the coronavirus pandemic,” said Bhandari.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat praised Bhandari’s gesture.“In this land of India, we had only read the stories of great kings and their charity, but today we have seen it in person. Despite being alone, Mrs. Bhandari has selflessly sacrificed everything, donating all her savings to India, which she considers as family and presented an example before us,” said Rawat.Uttarakhand so far has reported 35 Covid-19 positive cases with the maximum being reported from Dehradun (18). Out of the 35 cases, 26 are followers of the Tablighi Jamaat who attended the Islamic missionary group’s mid-March congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin Basti, which has since emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hot spot in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-yr-old-donates-all-her-savings-worth-10-lakh-to-pm-cares-fund/story-ozJf4v1z02nht93fAZJYCL.html
10-04-2020||India||Covid-19 in India: Top govt schools turned into quarantine facilities||Over 90 Centre-run Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) and Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) have been turned into quarantine centres across India as part efforts to create additional heathcare infrastructure to deal with any major spike in the number of the coronavirus (Covid-19) cases, according to officials aware of the matter. India plans to ramp up Covid-19 testing to deal with the pandemic better and it is likely to lead to an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases. According to official data, as many as 60 KVs and 33 JNVs have been converted into quarantine facilities in places like Balasore in Odisha, Karnataka’s Bidar, Tinsukia (Assam) and Joshimath in Uttarakhand.One of the officials cited above said of the 645 JNVs across the country, 400 such schools have been offered for the creation of facilities to isolate 2.5 lakh people. There are over 1,100 KVs.Union human resource development minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank had directed an assessment of how the premier central schools could offer support in the fight to against the pandemic.The 60 KVs are spread across 26 regions and state and defence ministry authorities have taken them over for creating quarantine facilities.In the Agra region alone, four KVs in Sarsawa, Chandinagar, Surajpur and Hindon have been taken over by authorities combating the virus. Similarly, four schools in Baroda, Ahmedabad and Jamnagar (Gujarat) have been turned into isolation centres. Two schools have been taken over by authorities in the Bengaluru region.Buildings of 10 KVs have been converted into quarantine centres in the Chandigarh region and seven in the Jammu region.B K Singh, the commissioner of Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti that runs JNVs, said his organisation has been contributing in the mitigation of the impact of Covid 19 by offering around 400 Schools, with a capacity of isolating around 2.5 lakh persons, spread over 400 districts. “Already in 33 schools, it [quarantine centres] is functioning,” Singh said.Singh said they had advanced the internal exams and concluded them by March 18. “So, the academic session was completed and by March 21, summer vacation was announced ahead of the scheduled up to May 25.”He said due to the lockdown imposed to check the pandemic, around 20-25 students have been unable to return to their homes. “In view of this unforeseen situation, the students staying on different campus continue to access to mess halls, libraries, smart classes, games, TV etc. However, these campuses have been locked down.”An official said the students have been offered facilitated like video calling, text messaging and calling free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-govt-schools-turned-into-quarantine-facilities/story-QaxpYasw2UJQMhw1yZIXwN.html
10-04-2020||India||Respiratory illness study hints at community spread: Experts||About one in 50 people hospitalised with acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia are suffering from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to a new study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) — findings that some experts said suggested the disease has entered the “community transmission” phase in the country.Close to 40% of these patients did not have recent travel history or known contact with a Covid-19 case.The study, published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR) on Thursday, found that Covid-19 positivity among severe acute respiratory infections (Sari) patients is 1.8% out of 5,911 samples tested between February 15 and April 2.Among the 965 Sari samples tested between February 15 and March 19, only two (0.2%) were positive for Covid-19. But when the testing strategy was expanded to include all Sari patients, out of 4,946 samples, 102 (2.1%) were positive for Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19).According to the survey, of the 102 Covid-19-positive Sari patients, one reported a recent history of international travel, two reported contacts with a confirmed case, and 40 (39.2%) did not report any history of international travel or contact with a Covid-positive person. The data on exposure history was not available for 59 cases.“One may not like to call it community transmission but this is in fact community transmission of Covid-19,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology at the Christian Medical College, Vellore.“Sari in the absence of Covid-19 is essentially due to influenza A (H1N1 or H3N2) or influenza B (the Victoria strain or Yamagata). These four are essentially the only reasons for Sari. Sometimes Sari patients are also affected by Adenoviruses. The results of the ICMR study indicates that Covid-19 is entering this scene. So now we have about two Sari patients in 100 who are testing positive for the new virus. It’s becoming a much commoner problem than what we had expected earlier. Waiting for this evidence for intervention is not needed,” Dr John added.Community transmission is the third of the four stages of the spread of an infectious disease. The first is travel history, the second is local transmission, the third is community transmission, and the fourth is epidemic. India has maintained that the disease is in the second stage, or between stage two and stage three with “limited community transmission” in some clusters.The median age of Covid-19 positive Sari patients in the study was 54. It found that Covid-19 positivity was higher among men (85 of the 102 Covid-19 positive patients).Most of the Sari patients tested were from Gujarat (792), followed by Tamil Nadu (577), Maharashtra (553) and Kerala (502). Covid-19 cases among these were detected from 52 districts in 20 states.“Covid-19 containment activities need to be targeted in districts reporting Covid-19 cases among Sari patients. Intensifying sentinel surveillance for Covid-19 among Sari patients may be an efficient tool to effectively use resources towards containment and mitigation efforts,” the study said.Another expert said that it was still too early to say this was “community transmission”. “We can’t just jump to the conclusion that there is community transmission from these findings. These are from the laboratory and we haven’t started testing in the community yet. I think their case history hasn’t been analysed properly yet,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/respiratory-illness-study-hints-at-community-spread-experts/story-wBEKwnl7NEPtNyCEdV1wtK.html
10-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: Centre removes customs duty, health cess on ventilators, kits||The government on Thursday exempted crucial medical equipment required to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from basic customs duty and health cess for six months, the revenue department said in a statement.The decision will make import of ventilators, face masks, surgical masks, personal protection equipment (PPE), Covid-19 test kits and inputs required for manufacturing of these items cheaper by 11% to 22%, a government official said on condition of anonymity.“In the context of Covid-19 situation, considering the immediate requirement of ventilators and other items, the central government has granted exemption from basic customs duty and health cess, on their import, with immediate effect,” the official said.The exemption from the basic customs duty and the health cess, wherever applicable, shall be available up to the September 30, 2020, the official said.Currently, there is a 10% duty on ventilators and test kits, and 7.5% on face and surgical masks. It ranges from 7.5% to 10% on PPE. Health cess is flat 5% on all these goods.India has restricted exports of diagnostic kits to discourage outbound shipments. The government has also banned exports of all kinds of ventilators, sanitisers, and textile raw materials for masks and coveralls. These all moves are aimed at maintaining the availability of these goods in India.Reacting to the move, Abhishek Jain, Tax Partner, EY told PTI: “This was a much anticipated and a welcome exemption given the dire need of these goods to fight COVID 19 in India.”The move came even as some political leaders protested the Centre’s notification that said states can’t procure their own PPE.In a notification sent to principal secretaries of the health departments of states on April 2, the Union ministry of health and family welfare asked them not to procure crucial medical equipment such as PPE, N95 masks and ventilators on their own, as they will be procured by the Centre and then distributed to the states. The decision was taken at the third meeting of the Empowered Group formed to look at procurement of medical equipment that took place on April 1, the note said.DMK MP from Tamil Nadu’s Dharmapuri Senthilkumar S condemned the move to make health care centralised. Former Lok Sabha MP from Kerala MB Rajesh said: “The first case was detected on January 30 and the lockdown was announced on March 24; the government had 54 days to act, but it wasted time. One cannot eradicate COVID-19 by lockdown, so every state has to prepare.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-removes-customs-duty-health-cess-on-ventilators-kits/story-Q1uG8NOOtk8aumU3oFBbxM.html
10-04-2020||India||Covid-19: After Supreme Court orders free tests, labs urge govt to reimburse costs||Private laboratories on Thursday urged the government to intervene after the Supreme Court asked all Covid-19 tests to be free of charge, even as experts said the judgment could impact the effective expansion of testing, which is key to the containment of the infection. While the labs said they would obey the order, some firms were considering a legal challenge saying it would be difficult for the laboratories to continue testing for free. Experts said the order, while aimed at making testing easily available, may force many private firms to scale down operations at a time when the infection has reached almost every state and intensive testing is urgently required. “Humanitarian in intent but impractical to implement - I fear testing will plummet,” said Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar Shaw on Twitter. “A judgment that will severely affect testing. Private labs simply cannot be expected to run their businesses on credit,” she added. Responding to a public interest litigation, the top court on Wednesday made Covid-19 tests in government and private laboratories free, and asked the government to pass the necessary orders to make this possible. The tests are already free in the 139 authorised government laboratories. Private laboratories used to charge Rs 4,500 previously.“We may not file a petition in the Supreme Court yet, as we have been talking to the government, and it seems inclined towards working out a solution to help us. However, until that happens we will be offering the test for free,” said Dr Arvind Lal, chairman and managing director, Dr Lal PathLabs, one of the 67 private sector players permitted to test by the government. Some experts -- such as Girdhar Gyani, director general of the Association of Healthcare Providers -- said the government could reimburse the cost of testing to private labs. During the hearing on Wednesday, the court had also asked the government to reimburse laboratories but didn’t pass an order to this effect. “There is a lot of confusion at the moment whether to charge or not; until the confusion clears out, I have given standing instructions to my staff not to charge anyone for Covid-19 testing,” said Navin Dang, founder of Dr Dangs Lab.Corporate hospitals also decided to conduct the tests for free, but indicated that they were speaking with the government “Since we have not heard anything from the government yet, we are not charging anything for Covid-19 testing,” said a spokesperson for Apollo hospital. A spokesperson for the Max Hospital said, “Based on the latest order of the SC, Max Healthcare has stopped charging for the Covid test. We are awaiting further directive from the government.”But many private labs said they would find it tough to sustain testing at a time when India needed to dramatically scale up testing. “We need test more, much more, as what we are doing right now is nowhere close to what we should be doing. We would need at least one lakh tests in a day. The next 10 days window is critical, so the government will have to think of a way such as creating a corpus or subsiding testing so that it’s feasible for private players to do the tests. For small standalone labs it will be nearly impossible to sustain free testing,” said Sanjeev Bagai, chairman and managing director, Nephron Clinic. Indian Council of Medical Research director general Balram Bhargava did not respond to calls and text messages despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-sc-orders-free-tests-labs-urge-govt-to-reimburse-costs/story-gPYvr6v5DgCJfsaZoKba1H.html
10-04-2020||India||Covid-19: MSMEs hope for govt aid to revive sector||A fund similar to the PM-Kisan scheme, re-opening industries where work from home is possible, and complete waiver of bank charges on all types of loans are among the slew of suggestions made to the union government to revitalize micro, medium and small enterprises (MSMEs).Facing staggering losses on account of the ongoing lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19, the MSME sector is looking for help from the union government, which is expected to announce an economic stimulus package soon.Estimated to employ 110 million people, over 63.3 ,million MSMEs in the country contribute nearly close to half of the country’s total exports and almost a third of India’s GDP, according to government data.Sudarshan Sareen, president of the All India Manufacturers’ Association said MSMEs should be offered help on the lines of relief packages announced for farmers in times of distress. “The way the government has come up with a PM-Kisan scheme that gives farmers Rs 2,000 in their bank accounts, there should be some aid for the manufacturers whose production has stalled. Small factories cannot run unless the government offers help during this time of a national emergency.” AIMO has already issued a statement citing the difficulties being faced by member MSMSEs to pay wages and not cut jobs as instructed by the government.“If banks don’t offer short term loans that will need to be repaid only after a year at maximum 4% interest, it will become untenable for many manufacturers to keep business going,” Sareen added.The need for setting up a COVID fund with a corpus at least Rs one lakh crore to roll out relief measures immediately was also flagged by former union minister and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh in a letter to MSME minister Nitin Gadkari.On Thursday, HT reported that the government is considering just such a fund with a corpus of Rs 50,000-75,000 crore“To ensure liquidity for business continuity, the government must direct all its agencies and public sector units, to pay their bills immediately, similar to the initiative taken under NHAI. Financial institutions should reschedule or restructure loans, as well as offer 6-month payment moratoriums to MSMEs. Extend soft loans with approximately 50% government guarantee for affected sectors through SIDBI, along with an adhoc enhanced working capital limit of 25% on request,” Jairam suggested.Laghu Udyog Bharati, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) that works with the MSME sector wrote to union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday, seeking a complete waiver of bank charges and fees on all types of loans and advances to all micro and small industries from all banks and financial institutions with effect from March 1, including interest of this period until the restart of production, considering the lockdown period as “force majeure.”While MSME ministry officials could not be reached for a comment, Gadkari on Thursday, held a meeting with officials through video-conferencing to review the existing schemes and draw up a future plan.In a tweet about the meeting, Gadkari said, its main purpose was to get the ministry and MSME ready for the future. “Reviewed the status of the existing schemes and discussed the future course of action. We are taking steps to make our industry COVID ready and both ministry and field organizations are taking necessary steps to support them in that direction. Thrust is to get industry feedback and take action in the short term. #IndiaFightsCorona.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msmes-hope-for-govt-aid-to-revive-sector/story-YXDnFghK9N07zo73rggoBJ.html
10-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: India gears up to begin plasma therapy trials||India is preparing to start clinical trials to treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients with convalescent plasma therapy that involves drawing antibody-rich blood of Covid1-9 survivors to treat the sick.The therapy has shown promise in treating Covid-19 patients, the American journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), reported on Tuesday.The country’s apex biomedical research organisation, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), is working on the guidelines to conduct the trial, and, once ready, the draft will be taken to the apex drugs regulator, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), for approvals to conduct the trials.“The draft should be ready in the next couple of days. Since it is a new drug, it has to be given on a clinical trial mode, for which the approval of the drugs controller is a must. Once the draft is ready, then ICMR, as per protocol, will approach the DCGI, for approval to conduct a clinical trial in the country,” said Dr Manoj V Murhekar, director, National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai.The therapy, the most distinct among the handful of options doctors around the world have for Covid-19 at present, had consistent and safe effects on a small group of 10 patients in China who were critically ill but began to show significant improvements after a single dose, PNAS reported.“In other countries, it has been found to be useful in limited patients who were on ventilator support. It is not meant for everyone but to begin with we will be selecting patients who would be given this medicine on a study mode. The process will be expedited as during pandemics you don’t have to recruit a large number of patients for such trials. A small number is good enough, and the DCGI is quick to give approvals for anything Covid-19 related these days, so we are expecting to start soon,” said Dr Murhekar.“Unless the DCGI approves, the clinical trial cannot begin anywhere in the country,” he added.The basis for convalescent plasma therapy is simple: plasma – a component of the blood – from a recovered patient carries the specific antibodies that can neutralise the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. This is transfused in a patient fighting the infection, acting as reinforcement for the immune system.The ICMR’s technical committee that reviews testing criteria also revised the guidelines on Thursday, and directed states to focus on hot spots and clusters to conduct rRT-PCR (Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing of all influenza like illnesses if the symptom (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose) has developed within seven days.Those who came down with symptoms more than a week ago should be made to undergo antibody based rapid blood test. “If negative then has to be confirmed by performing an RT-PCR,” says the revised guideline. Also, to understand the evolution of the virus better, the Centre has involved two Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) labs, the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad, and the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in New Delhi that have started working together on the whole genome sequencing of Sars-Cov-2.“These two labs have already started work on the virus, and hopefully we should be able to know the virus better,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-gears-up-to-begin-plasma-therapy-trials/story-cfIGMEP9u24UlEuCXgf3IJ.html

The new report, which was submitted to the White House on Tuesday, said that on current evidence and given the lack of host immunity globally, any reduction in transmission because of higher temperature and humidity may not lead to a significant decrease in disease spread without major interventions, such as personal protection and social distancing.“We cannot rely on summer to rescue us from coronavirus disease as temperature is just one of the many factors that affect transmission. Very hot climate may reduce cases by a small number in high population density areas as heat will destroy the virus faster. I’m hopeful it may do so to some extent in Dharavi, but since hot spots are typically in hospitals, malls and offices, which are often air-conditioned even in India, transmission is unlikely to end in summer without strong public health interventions,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.Other coronaviruses that cause potentially serious human illness, including both Sars-CoV and Mers-CoV that have caused outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle-east respiratory syndrome in the past, have not demonstrated seasonality either. Indeed, a reading of the history of such illnesses shows that those that first emerged in winter, saw a second wave in summer - and vice versa. Some of the compounding factors that affect virus transmission are geography, population density, per capita income, access to testing, quality health care systems and human behavioural patterns, including mobility and migration.“There are many other factors that may influence virus spread and it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions without data on this novel virus in the real world. In the Indian context, the factors would include population density, difficulty of maintaining physical distancing in households where space is limited, inability and unfamiliarity with cough/sneeze etiquette, migrant labour returning home with the virus, and mingling of people even during the current lockdown,” said Dr V. Ramana Dhara, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad.Also read: India sets up 1,200 Covid-19 containment zones; Maharashtra tops this listWith little evidence on how this new virus will behave, virologists are falling back on the behaviour of coronaviruses, particularly Sars-CoV, with which Sars-CoV-2 shares the most similarity. Pandemic influenza strains have not exhibited the typical seasonal pattern of endemic and epidemic strains, the report said. “There have been 10 influenza pandemics in the past 250-plus years – two started in the northern hemisphere winter, three in the spring, two in the summer and three in the fall. All had a peak second wave approximately six months after the emergence of the virus in the human population, regardless of when the initial introduction occurred,” said the NAS report.“The second wave of the Spanish flu in 1918 was devastating for India, and even if temperature and humidity have some affect on transmission, it may not be as apparent because most people have no immunity to Sars-CoV-2, unlike pre-existing respiratory viruses against which is there is some degree of immunity,” said Dr Dhara.“In such a scenario, I would suggest a staggered exit to the lockdown where some people can return to work to restart economic activity because a hungry and malnourished population would be more susceptible to infections, including Covid-19,” added Dr Dhara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-may-not-go-away-in-warmer-weather-says-us-report/story-Mr2STpD3B6bjDx7jnCTBKJ.html
10-04-2020||India||Maharashtra govt left red-faced after official gives free pass to Wadhawans during lockdown||The Maharashtra government late Thursday ordered a probe into the home department giving a free pass to the Wadhawan family caught in the multi-crore rupee Deewan Housing Finance scam to travel from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar on Wednesday in violation of the lockdown in Maharashtra to check the spread of coronavirus.The letter said to have been signed by principal secretary, home department Amitabh Gupta had left the government red-faced.The safe passage was given to the Deewan Housing Finance Limited promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan along with 21 other members of their family, friends in five cars.“This is to just inform you that following are my family friends and travelling from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar for family emergency. Particulars of the cars are given below,” the letter stated. Home minister Anil Deshmukh late on Thursday announced a probe in the issue as the letter by Gupta was released to media “We will probe how permission was granted to allow 23 members of Wadhawan family to travel from Khandala to Satara,” Deshmukh tweeted. “I had no idea about this letter. This was given by Gupta, that’s true but I don’t know the details over why this letter was given. So, we will conduct a probe and tomorrow a strict decision will be taken. This was not appropriate, I completely accept this,’’ said Deshmukh.The letter gave details of the five cars, their registration numbers and names of the persons travelling in every car. The Wadhawans were allowed to travel from Pune district to Satara district bypassing the state norms that district borders be sealed.The issue came to light when residents protested after the Wadhawans and their friends reached Dewan bungalow in Mahabaleshwar.A senior official in the state secretariat said that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was furious because the incident has embarrassed his administration which has been strictly enforcing the lockdown. The home department is empowered to give such leeway or travel pass only to those who have family emergencies including hospitalisation or death of a family member. “Wadhwan brothers, who are accused in Yes Bank/DHFL fraud, CBI had issued non-bailable warrants against them. Instead of handing them over to the police, Maharashtra government gives them a VVIP treatment. Home minister Anil Deshmukh owes the country an explanation,’’ said former BJP MP Kirit Somaiaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-govt-left-red-faced-after-official-gives-free-pass-to-wadhwans-during-lockdown/story-E5hHJVoiQmYEvi8SrYBWuO.html
10-04-2020||India||Pakistan wants Covid-19 Emergency fund be placed under Saarc secretary general||Pakistan, the only Saarc member state that hasn’t contributed to the Covid-19 Emergency Fund, has called for finalising modalities for using the fund and for placing it under the secretary general of the South Asian grouping.The functioning of the emergency fund figured in a telephone conversation on Tuesday between Bangladesh foreign minister AK Abdul Momen and his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who said the facility should be placed under the secretary general of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).The fund was created with an initial contribution of $10 million from India following a video conference of Saarc leaders on the Covid-19 pandemic that was called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 15. The fund has so far garnered commitments worth a total of $18.8 million.Pakistan’s position on the fund was outlined in a Foreign Office readout of the conversation between Qureshi and his Bangladeshi counterpart, which said: “Discussing the need to share resources, it was underlined that SAARC Covid-19 emergency fund should be placed under the Secretary General of SAARC and the modalities for its utilization should be finalized through consultations at the earliest.”The current secretary general of Saarc is veteran Sri Lankan diplomat Esala Ruwan Weerakoon, who recently succeeded Pakistan’s Amjad Hussain Sial.There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to Pakistan’s demand. Over the past few days, the external affairs ministry has accused Pakistan of politicising a humanitarian initiative such as the video conference of Saarc leaders on Covid-19.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was the only Saarc head of government who opted out of the video conference and the country was represented by its de facto health minister, who angered the external affairs ministry by raising the issue of Kashmir during the meeting.During his phone conversation with the Bangladesh foreign minister, Qureshi “underscored that Pakistan considered SAARC an important platform for regional cooperation”. Qureshi also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the Saarc process and said Pakistan is ready to host a conference of health ministers of the member states to enhance cooperation on Covid-19.Qureshi proposed a video conference could be organised first and Momen “conveyed Bangladesh’s readiness to participate in the video conference”, according to the Pakistani readout.Qureshi also suggested Saarc should evaluate and coordinate on the economic and social disruption caused by Covid-19 and experts from member states should commence work in this regard immediately.The Indian prime minister had already mooted such an initiative during the March 15 video conference. Modi had suggested brainstorming by experts on the long-term economic consequences of Covid-19 and ways to insulate internal trade and local value chains from its impact.The external affairs ministry has also announced that a video conference of senior health professionals of Saarc states will be held on March 26.A person familiar with developments, who declined to be named, said: “Pakistan hasn’t done anything to contribute to the fund and is only taking steps that are coming in the way of meaningful cooperation within the Saarc framework. This isn’t new and it isn’t surprising.”The Dawn newspaper quoted an unnamed Pakistani diplomat as saying that the country is “expected to make a pledge” to the Covid-19 Emergency Fund “but after clarity about the fund was achieved”.In recent days, Qureshi has held phone conversations with his counterparts from Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Bangladesh. Though he had said he would be speaking to foreign ministers of all Saarc states, he is yet to call his Indian and Afghan counterparts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-wants-covid-19-emergency-fund-be-placed-under-saarc-secretary-general/story-67qXuCBWg9NGWkp1eeHfEO.html
