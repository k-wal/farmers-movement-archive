Under the new system, the USCIS will pick the Congressionally capped 85,000 beneficiaries for 2021 from only among registered beneficiaries. The USCIS released the numbers in an announcement inviting registered employers to begin filing their applications (H-1B visa application are filed by employers, not beneficiaries).The chances are higher, therefore, of more foreign students being picked than the other open category.And the chances of more Indians being selected among them were higher as 67% of the potential beneficiaries were from India. The Chinese were a distant second with 13.2%.The registered beneficiaries have still to go through the approval process, subject to the selection criterion, as every year. The difference, under the new system introduced for 2020, is that the USCIS will select only from among those who were electronically registered by their potential employers.Indians have tended to be the single largest beneficiary of the H-1B visa programme for US employers to hire highly skilled foreign students to make up the shortage of local availability. They have accounted for upwards of 70% of the visas, which, for many Indians is the gateway to permanent residency and citizenship.Of the total of 85,000 such visas given out every year, 65,000 were set aside earlier for foreign workers hired from abroad and 20,000 from among foreign students in US colleges and universities. The Trump administration has changed it to accord priority to foreign students, opening up the general category to them as well.“The new H-1B electronic registration system has been an overall success. As a result of this modernized process, the amount of paper and data exchanged between USCIS and petitioners will dramatically decrease this year,” said USCIS Deputy Director for Policy Joseph Edlow in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-indian-students-in-us-may-be-hired-under-h-1b-visa-in-2021-than-those-in-india/story-QKPlepxxgw7RnrOP86Hd9J.html

Some forces are trying to communalise the situation. They have started a virulent campaign on social media. Such attempts will not succeed in a state like Kerala,” the CM said adding strict action will be taken against such people. “There is no need of such intolerance. We will not tolerate it,” he said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicHe said there is no need for any panic over the Tablighi Jammat incident. “At least 60 people returned after the congregation and are under observation. We have collected details and passed all information to respective districts,” he said. When asked about the exact number of pilgrims from the state he did not reply. There are allegations that the government is not disclosing details so as not to trigger panic.However, there are unconfirmed reports that more than 300 people from the state attended it.At least 80 of them returned between March 5 and 8 to north Kerala and they were asked to remain in quarantine until the shutdown is over. Health officials said in their case there was no need to worry as the incubation period is almost over. But 60 of them returned a day before the lockdown began (March 23) and they were identified and put under strict quarantine in different hospitals, said a senior health ministry official.Over 100 people are reportedly stranded in Delhi and there are reports that some of them have proceeded to other religious places in north India as part of their itinerary and are stuck at different places. Fearing action some of them are not receiving calls on their mobile phones making their contact tracing really cumbersome, police officials said.A resident of Pathanamthitta, Dr M Saleem (67), who participated in the congregation, died on March 24 and later his body was buried in Delhi. His relatives said he was suffering from multiple complications and he died of a heart attack. But now many suspect he may have died of Covid-19 and his test results are yet to emerge. Meanwhile the state has reported 24 new cases taking the total number of positive cases to 265-- this includes 26 people discharged from hospitals. Among 24, 9 are foreign returnees and 15 their contacts. The total number under observation has also risen to 1,64,130. To a question the CM said community transmission was yet to take place in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virus-has-no-religion-pinarayi-vijayan-on-criticism-of-tablighi-jamaat-meet/story-Rd1mlpC9mNkFQp0B8OUZjL.html
01-04-2020||India||Covid-19 cases hit close to 2000, Markaz contact tracing on ‘war footing’||The number of Covid-19 cases in India soared close to 2,000 on Wednesday, fuelled largely by infections linked to a March event of the Tablighi Jamaat in the heart of Delhi that emerged this week as the biggest domestic source of the disease in the country.According to a tally of numbers released by 25 states and union territories, close to 8,500 people have been identified as having been to the Islamic sect’s headquarters in the capital’s Nizamuddin area, prompting authorities to intensify efforts to trace them since they may be carrying the virus and potentially infecting others.This is in addition to the 2,346 people who have been evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat’s six-storey mosque complex – called a markaz – in Delhi since Sunday, including 531 who have now been taken to hospitals as they showed symptoms of the disease.In all, 358 confirmed Covid-19 across the country have been linked to the markaz.In a video conference with the police and administration heads of the states, Union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba asked all states to launch on “war footing” a contact tracing of all those who attended Tablighi Jamaat events in Delhi this month.In a briefing later in the evening, the health ministry said the country recorded 386 new cases in 24 hours – a surge that was driven by the infections among the sect’s members. “I want to highlight that the rise in the number of positive cases does not represent a national trend, but if there will be a failure anywhere, obviously cases will rise,” said health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal, reiterating the need for people to follow social distancing guidelines and not violate the nationwide lockdown underway at present.Over the weekend, officials discovered infections were multiplying at the markaz after alerts began streaming in from other states where people who had been to the building and developed symptoms after heading out to other cities. At least nine of these people – six in Telangana and one each in Kashmir, Gujarat and Karnataka – have died due to the disease.By 1 pm on Wednesday, the markaz was sanitised by sanitation workers in decontamination suits. The workers said they found the insides of the building to be damp. “We have sprayed every corner of the building, but its insides are damp due to the absence of sunlight. Usually the surfaces we have been spraying all these days were dry, so we don’t know how effective the disinfectant would be,” said Harish Kumar, a sanitation worker.Kumar described the markaz as comprising mostly large halls, many of which had rows of beds spread out. “Rows and rows of mattresses were spread out in the halls, floor after floor,” he said.Authorities may now begin an exercise to canvass the Nizamuddin area, a congested residential locality. “As part of the cluster containment strategy, Nizamuddin, which is turning out to be a big cluster, would require aggressive door-to-door- contact tracing and testing to pick up positive cases. After the evacuation and segregation at the epicentre, next step will be to trace possible cases that may have directly or indirectly come into contact with them; and test them,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting anonymity.The Delhi Police and Intelligence Bureau separately estimated that around 6,500 to 7,000 people visited the markaz between March 10 and March 24 – when active infections are believed to have been taking place at the building. At least 300 of these were foreign nationals, including the six Indonesians who died in Telangana.Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have seen the bulk of infections linked to the markaz, with the three states reporting 237 cases. Tamil Nadu added 110 on Wednesday alone, taking its total to 190.Officials in at least two other states -- Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra -- said they are using cellphone location and call data to search for people who had been to the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi.According to intelligence bureau officials who asked not to be named, about 2,000 foreign nationals arrived on tourist visas from at least 70 countries to take part in the sect’s work across the country since January 1. Participating in religious activity while on a tourist visa is prohibited by Indian immigration rules.According to the home ministry’s assessment, a majority of these foreign nationals were from Bangladesh (493), Indonesia (472), Malaysia (150) and Thailand (142).“All the ambassadors of the concerned countries have been contacted and they’ve been informed about the position of various nationals that are involved in this [matter],” said a person who asked not to be named.The home ministry has now directed state authorities to immediately deport foreigners who test negative for Covid-19 by the “first available flights”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-hit-close-to-2000-markaz-contact-tracing-on-war-footing/story-FLt7KkRIXpbwhdHGJdvZGK.html

Bhalla told them that they had to stick to the script outlined by the Centre and enforce the lockdown in “letter and spirit”.Bhalla had invoked his powers under the disaster management law to order the nationwide lockdown on March 24, shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke the news to the country in a televised address to the nation.Since then Bhalla has tweaked the ground rules on a few occasions.But there have been instances of some state governments relaxing the lockdown to make exemptions.Like the Kerala government which has allowed people to pick up their supply of liquor if they could get a doctor to prescribe it to them. The unusual order was issued by the Pinarayi Vijayan’s government after eight deaths linked to non-availability of liquor were reported.In Punjab, on the other hand, the government asked industrial units and brick kilns to resume operations to stop migrant workers from heading home if they can accommodate the workforce within the complex.In his letter to states, home secretary Bhalla did not cite any specific instance but sent his message across.“It has been noticed that some state governments/UT administrations are allowing exceptions beyond what has been allowed under lockdown measures by the Ministry of Home Affairs,” Bhalla’s letter to the states said.“This amounts to violation of the lockdown measures issued by MHA under the Disaster Management Act 2005 and may defeat the overall objective of containing the spread of Covid-19 in the country,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-exceptions-to-lockdown-mha-order-after-kerala-s-liquor-on-doc-advice-rule/story-NVUvHuvl6suxEwmSLbIDZP.html
01-04-2020||India||Garbage disposal, no groceries in Goa: Complaints for govt after Covid-19 lockdown||From groceries not being delivered in Goa to pleas from the UK and New York to evacuate stranded Indians, from frantic requests for garbage disposal to complaints about police harassment -- these are some of the matters that have come to the central government ‘s notice since the 21-day lockdown to curtail the spread of the coronavirus disease began on March 25. Around 345 complaints relating to Covid-19 were registered with the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and various government departments and ministries, according to an official in the Department of Administrative Reform and Public Grievances (DARPG). The DAPRG has now sorted 336 complaints into 11 categories to “expeditiously address them.”“These grievances have been filed with the Prime Minsiter’s Office on the PM”s website,” a senior DARPG official said on condition of anonymity. “There is a 60 -day period for the redressal of grievances filed with the PMO. But since these are urgent, and a huge data dump has taken place, a separate portal has been set up to monitor and address them.”These complaints will be resolved in a period of three days. The 11 categories include inadequate facilities in hospitals, problem in donating to the PM-CARES fund, essential supplies not being provided, request for rescue from another country, stuck in some place because of lockdown, harassment, lockdown not adhered to, examination-related and quarantine-related matters, suggestions and others, according to data accessed by Hindustan Times.A majority of the grievances are health-related, the official cited above added. These include overcrowding of isolation wards, lack of masks and sanitisers and not enough testing facilities or hospitals being ill-equipped to test patients. According to the official, the DARPG has also received requests for immediate garbage disposal and evacuation of Indians from overseas. “We have received requests from UK and New York to evacuate Indians stranded there as the situation has gotten really bad in those countries,” he said. Several students, family members and concerned parties have also reached out to external affairs minister S. Jaishankar on the same issue, including senior Nationalist Congress Party leader Supriya Sule. “We are looking into it. People have also complained that essential services, like garbage collection, are not happening anymore,” the official said. There have also been requests from people to intervene with banks since the Reserve Bank of India has allowed a moratorium on payments of equated monthly instalment but the banks haven’t responded, leading to concerns among consumers about being penalised in case of non-payment of dues. “There are also litigants who have reached out to us,” said the first official. “They haven’t been able to reach courts on time and are afraid it may adversely impact their cases. They have asked us for help.” The DARPG has also received requests to help ease supply chains so that essential services may not be hampered. In Goa, according to the analysis accessed by Hindutan Times, people have complained about groceries not being provided. Seven requests to postpone government exams have also been received. Among the harassment complaints are cases of people being evicted from college and police high-handedness. Around 28 grievances have been lodged under the lockdown not being followed category; that includes private sector and postal employees being called to work, according to the data.“In the general pipeline (PMO or CPGRAMS) we receive lakhs of grivances,” a second official said. “The Covid-19 specific ones have been segregated for immediate attention.” CPGRAMS is short for Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring SystemThe department has also received suggestions to extend the lockdown. There have also been bogus claims like discovery of a Covid-19cure. A person even lodged 54 grievances not related to Covid-19 that the department has noted. The grievances have been collated on a portal on the DARPG website launched by minister of personnel, public grievances and pensions Jitendra Singh on Wednesday. These have further been allocated to each department/ministry for redressal. On the day of the launch, the National Monitoring Dashboard received 43 grievances related to the ministry of health and family welfare, 31 grievances under the ambit of the ministry of external affairs and 26 grievances in the domain of the ministry of finance.“It is the endeavour of the Modi Government to ensure timely redressal of Covid-19 grievances and directions have been issued to all ministries/ departments to prioritize these grievances and provide redressal in a period of three days,” Singh said on Tuesday. “For the remainder of the lockdown, these will be addressed on a priority basis and anyone wishing to lodge a complaint may log on to the website,” the first official said. “After that, they may be merged with the PMO again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/garbage-disposal-no-groceries-in-goa-complaints-for-govt-after-covid-19-lockdown/story-JnGz9l7EMuoizP46HAOwdK.html

01-04-2020||India||‘Stupid advice,’ says Chidambaram on interest rate cut for small savings||The Congress on Wednesday criticised the government for its decision to reduce interest rates on small saving schemes with senior party leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram calling it a wrong step based on “stupid advice”.The opposition party demanded its immediate rollback.The government reduced the interest rates on small savings schemes by 70 to 140 basis points for the year 2020 during April-June quarter.Public provident fund interest rates in the quarter have been brought down by 80 bps to 7.1% and for KVP -- Kisan Vikas Patra -- have been slashed by 70 bps to 6.9% and after reduction of 0.8%, the girl child-focussed Sukanya Samriddhi scheme now stands at the interest rate of 7.6%.“I know that sometimes the government acts on stupid advice, but I am amazed how stupid this advice was. While reducing the interest rate on PPF and small savings may be technically correct, it is absolutely the wrong time to do so,” Chidambaram tweeted.He said though India’s GDP for the last quarter could not be have been more than 4%, it was time to focus on saving people’s lives and not the GDP.In times of acute distress and uncertainty about income, people depend on the interest income on their savings, added Chidambaram, demanding immediately rollback of the decision and restoring old rates until June 30.About the GDP, he said after the three quarters’ growth rates of 5.6%, 5.1% and 4.7% respectively, the fourth quarter of 2019-20 ended Tuesday. “Q4 growth could not have been more than 4%. So, annual GDP for 2019-20 must be a disappointing 4.8%.”However, Chidambaram said this was the time of discussing the growth rate of coronavirus and not GDP. “Once Covid-19 is in control automatically the GDP will increase. In my view, we should not worry about growth now. The focus should be on saving people’s lives whatever it takes,” he said.The former finance minister also expressed concern over the government not announcing the second financial assistance package during the lockdown imposed amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“That is why I am appalled that the government has not yet announced FAP II after the miserly and disastrous FAP of March 25,” he tweeted.His party colleague Jaiveer Shergill termed the government’s decision “irrational, illogical and ill-timed”, saying it has come at a time when the people are already facing hardship due to the lockdown and the economic recession.“The BJP government’s decision to cut interest rates on small saving schemes is a heartless and shameful act that will hit the common people, especially the farmers, middle class and the poor who are already suffering due to the downturn in the economy,” he told reporters at a press conference held through video conferencing.He demanded that the government waive interest on EMIs for the three-month period from March to June, saying the moratorium on EMIs is merely hogwash and a postponing exercise.Shergill also urged the government to come out with a second tranche of economic relief packages to help small and medium enterprises, and the poor and common people from the economic downturn the country is facing.“The decision to reduce interest rates on small savings is ill-timed, illogical and irrational,” he said, adding that it will snatch the incomes of 90 crore people in the country.Shergill said the government will earn an additional Rs 26,000 crore through this reduction in interest rates and said it should not act like “Shylock to extract a pound of flesh” from the people.The government should instead work towards raising incomes of people instead of shrinking it, for helping them survive this economic downturn, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stupid-advice-says-chidambaram-on-interest-rate-cut-for-small-savings/story-khWgyeHCsX9v7cRNOqjDgM.html
01-04-2020||India||Envoys of nations whose nationals violated tourist visas for Tablighi activities alerted||The Indian government has alerted envoys of several South and Southeast Asian countries whose nationals allegedly violated visa regulations to attend a gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat in New Delhi that has emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday.Action will be taken under India’s regulations and laws against hundreds of foreign nationals who entered the country on tourist visas and joined the gathering at Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz or headquarters in Nizamuddin area of New Delhi, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.The Jamaat’s six-storey headquarters has emerged as the single biggest source of Covid-19 infections in the country, after being linked to at least eight deaths and 283 infections. Officials have said members who joined a gathering at the Markaz earlier this month had tested positive in New Delhi, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Kashmir.“All the ambassadors of the concerned countries have been contacted and they’ve been informed about the position of various nationals that are involved in this [matter],” said a person who declined to be named.The home ministry is taking action in close coordination with external affairs ministry, the people said.“If there have been violations of the rules and laws of the land, appropriate action will be taken by relevant authorities,” said the person cited above.According to a statement from the home ministry, as of March 21, there were 216 foreigners at the Jamaat’s Markaz and 824 more foreigners engaged in activities of the Jamaat in different parts of India. The home ministry directed state police forces to identify these 824 foreigners, medically screen and quarantine them.A classified assessment by the home ministry, accessed by HT, said eight Indonesian nationals who were part of a Jamaat team tested positive for Covid-19 in Telangana. It also estimated some 2,000 foreigners from 70 nations, who all entered India on tourist visas, were “spread all over the country for Tabligh work”.The assessment said a majority of them were from Bangladesh (493), Indonesia (472), Malaysia (150) and Thailand (142). The home ministry directed state authorities to immediately deport foreigners who test negative for Covid-19 by the “first available flights”.Most foreign members of Tablighi Jamaat travel to India on tourist visas, and the people cited above said it is difficult to ascertain the purpose of visit of individual applicants, especially in the case of friendly countries such as Thailand and Indonesia for which visa regimes are relatively liberal. They said Jamaat members should apply for missionary or conference visas.The home ministry has now said the external affairs ministry should advise foreign missions to refrain from granting tourist visas to foreigners “who are likely to use it for Tabligh activities”. It also said missions should check details such as place of stay in India, return tickets and financial means of applicants before granting tourist visas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/envoys-of-nations-whose-nationals-violated-tourist-visas-for-tabligh-activities-alerted/story-nQbPzG0352JNpMZwWP773H.html

The principal secretary also said that a public notification appealing to all those who attended the meet to voluntarily get in touch with the state government has been issued.He added that the 800 identified individuals will be first quarantined at a public facility for two weeks followed by home quarantine.“We are in the process of collecting travel history of all these people.”The government, however, has not provided details as to how many of these 1500 Jamaat members are foreigners and from which countries. It only said that they were spread all over state’s 30 districts.Nine more people tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, bringing the state’s total infections to 110. Three patients have died and nine have been discharged till now.Meanwhile, Bengaluru’s city crime branch police have arrested the manager of Prajaval Surgical and Scientific store for selling fake infrared thermometers.These thermometers were apparently being sold for Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 a piece. A bunch of these fake thermometers were also seized and a case registered. This comes in the backdrop of busting of rackets selling fake sanitizers and masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-now-says-1500-from-the-state-were-at-nizamuddin-gathering-only-800-traced/story-GQbJXxt05r9i8OIhh91gSI.html

A decision has been taken to accept contributions from abroad in the PM-CARES Fund,” said a person who declined to be named.The Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-CARES) Fund was set up in view of several spontaneous requests from India and abroad for making contributions to support the government’s fight against Covid-19, the people said.Also Watch: Will the Centre extend lockdown?  Contributions to the fund can be made by individuals and organisations, both in India and abroad, in view of the expressed interest to contribute to the government’s efforts and keeping in mind the “unprecedented nature” of the pandemic, the people said.In 2018, the government refused all foreign aid, including a reported offer of $100 million from the United Arab Emirates, for disaster relief following floods in Kerala that displaced millions of people. Offers of help from Thailand, Qatar and the Maldives too were declined.This was in line with a long-standing policy put in place after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, and at the time, the external affairs ministry had said in a statement that the “government is committed to meeting the requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts”.The people cited above pointed out that no foreign governments had so far come forward to donate to the PM-CARES Fund, which has largely attracted pledges from NRIs and people of Indian origin based in several countries.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has directed the heads of Indian missions around the world to explore the possibility of sourcing medical equipment needed to fight Covid-19 – especially personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, ventilators, and three-ply, surgical and N95 masks – as there is a huge shortage in the country, the people cited above said.In the case of China, some relief materials were coming to India from independent sources as donations while the mission in Beijing is looking at procuring available equipment on a commercial basis, the people said.“The embassy in Beijing is working on this and we are looking at various options and sources,” said a second person. “There is a huge shortage and we will source materials from wherever they are available.”At the same time, domestic companies are being encouraged by the health and textile ministries to ramp up production of PPE and medical equipment, the people said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-to-accept-help-from-abroad-for-pm-cares-fund/story-fCUA0AJ7eerKLfocPWP9VI.html

As one call disconnects, another follows. The person deployed at the helpline is instructed to attend each call and note down the request made by the caller, his name, the area he belongs to and the cell phone number in a register, Pathak says.In addition, many daily wagers, who are stranded in different areas, dial the helpline number and ask for delivery of food packets to them, he adds.Their location is noted. With the help of several organisations, food packets are delivered to them within an hour.Pathak says, “The helpline functions round the clock. On average, around 80 to 90 seek help. Each call is attended and it is ensured that the problem is solved quickly.”Around 20 calls are by labourers, who ask for food. Around 25 calls are from other residents, including senior citizens, who want home delivery of medicines. Then, about 5-10 calls are for getting residential areas sprayed with disinfectants. About 20 others ask for proper supply of cooking gas and so on, he says.“As soon as the helpline receives a call from any labourer, his location is established and the cell phone number is noted. Soon after that, the helpline contacts social organizations to ensure delivery of food packets to the person (labourer) quickly,” Pathak says.Two days ago, Vikas Kumar, a daily wager from Khojwan area asked for food packets, which were provided.Dr Suresh Kumar, a resident of Ashokpuram Colony, dialled the Mini PMO helpline and sought help for getting his colony sanitised.Pathak spoke to the Varanasi municipal authorities and ensured the colony was sanitized.Amit Kumar Pandey from Pandeypur area sought help for proper distribution of foodgrains by the fair price shop in the locality.Pathak said he spoke to additional district magistrate (supply) Satish Pal and had the problem solved immediately.In the meantime, one Bhanvar Lal from Guru Dham colony sought help for ensuring home delivery of medicine, he said.The helpline volunteer called up a medical store identified by the administration for home delivery and made sure that Bhanwar Lal got the medicine at his doorstep, he said.An official at the ‘mini PMO’ said several calls were received with requests for delivery of cooking gas cylinders at home.Pathak said he spoke to ADM supply Pal and asked him to ensure proper supply of cylinders in each and every area of the city.The ADM said passes were already issued to trolley-men for the door to door delivery of cooking gas cylinders.Navratan Rathi, the BJP spokesperson for the Kashi region, said, “The helpline at the Mini PMO received around 400 calls in the last five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mini-pmo-at-pm-modi-s-kashi-flooded-with-calls-for-lpg-food-ration-supply/story-SsU6eKVBZ1r7hlcvF3jdfP.html

Officials have said members who joined a gathering at the Markaz earlier this month had tested positive in New Delhi, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Kashmir.“All the ambassadors of the concerned countries have been contacted and they’ve been informed about the position of various nationals who are involved in this [matter],” said a person who declined to be named.The home ministry is taking action in close coordination with external affairs ministry, the people said.“If there have been violations of the rules and laws of the land, appropriate action will be taken by relevant authorities,” said the person cited above.According to a statement from the home ministry, as of March 21, there were 216 foreigners at the Jamaat’s Markaz and 824 more foreigners engaged in activities of the Jamaat in different parts of India. The home ministry directed state police forces to identify these 824 foreigners, medically screen and quarantine them.A classified assessment by the home ministry, accessed by HT, said eight Indonesian nationals who were part of a Jamaat team tested positive for Covid-19 in Telangana. It also estimated some 2,000 foreigners from 70 nations, who all entered India on tourist visas, were “spread all over the country for Tabligh work”.The assessment said a majority of them were from Bangladesh (493), Indonesia (472), Malaysia (150) and Thailand (142). The home ministry directed state authorities to immediately deport foreigners who test negative for Covid-19 by the “first available flights”.Most foreign members of Tablighi Jamaat travel to India on tourist visas, and the people cited above said it is difficult to ascertain the purpose of visit of individual applicants, especially in the case of friendly countries such as Thailand and Indonesia for which visa regimes are relatively liberal. They said Jamaat members should apply for missionary or conference visas.The home ministry has now said the external affairs ministry should advise foreign missions to refrain from granting tourist visas to foreigners “who are likely to use it for Tabligh activities”. It also said missions should check details such as place of stay in India, return tickets and financial means of applicants before granting tourist visas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-alerts-envoys-of-countries-whose-nationals-violated-tourist-visas-for-tabligh-meet/story-mEFzWtHPmYEazqxwXwaiEL.html

Maulana Saad’s relative Maulana Badrul Hasan said he usually stayed at the Nizamuddin Markaz and visited his home in Kandhla for a day or two every month. But he didn’t come to Kandhla on Wednesday as claimed by a section of the media, Hasan said.Follow coronavirus live updates here.Maulana Saad has been in the news after at least eight people, who participated in a religious gathering at the Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz (centre) in Delhi between March 13 and 15, died of coronavirus. Saad and five other top functionaries of the Tablighi Jamaat were booked on Tuesday after its headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area emerged as the single biggest source of Covid-19 infections in the country. Maulana Hasan said, “Maulana Saad is not a fugitive as presented in a section of the media. He is in Delhi and we support every action and order of the government during this crisis.” He claimed neither Maulana Saad nor other organisers had received a copy of the FIR lodged by the Delhi Police against the cleric. “Media trials should be stopped against the Markaz and its organizers,” he said. Maulana Saad Kandhalwi is the great grandson of Muhammad Iliyas Kandhalwi, who organised a group of young madarsa graduates from Deoband and Saharanpur in early 1920s and sent them to Mewat to establish a network of mosques and Islamic schools. Later, people of South Asia started calling these devotees ‘Tablighi’ and the organisation became popular as Tablighi Jamaat. Maulana Hasan said it was an apolitical organisation with over 20 crore (200 million) members across the world. He said Maulana Saad preferred to keep a low profile during his visits to his hometown where he has an ancestral house in Maulvian locality of the town. “He is a cult figure. Within no time, a big crowd gathers to meet him. Therefore, he avoids meeting people here in order to stay in peace for a day or two,” said Maulana Hasan. Maulana Saad was born in Kandhla in May 1965. After pursuing a religious education under his father’s tutelage, he studied at the Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband and thereafter completed Dars-e-Nizami studies from the Kasiful Uloom madarsa of Hazrat Nizamuddin Markaz.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tablighi-jamaat-head-booked-over-covid-19-spurt-not-in-up-hometown-say-police-relative/story-48ehqewOr0w5aYT00JuenO.html

Despite this, we have somehow been able to pay the salaries, wages and pensions of government employees this month though some major states of the country could not do that on full. And even with the massive debt trap left behind by the previous government, we were able to service the debt so far, but future remains uncertain,” Banerjee said in the letter to the prime minister.“Furthermore, we are required to meet our commitments towards girl child, students, farmers, unorganised workers, weaker sections, minorities, SC, ST and OBCs. We are also having to honour our commitments of providing free ration to almost 9 crore people, who need this so crucially to survive in this perilous time,” she wrote.Banerjee said the Centre should sanction Rs 25,000 crore to West Bengal and also release the other funds due to the state.“The Centre has already reduced their devolution to our state by over Rs 11,000 crore and were yet to pay Rs 36,000 crore owed by the GoI (Government of India) to our state, she said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-writes-to-pm-modi-seeks-rs-25-000-crore-financial-assistance/story-fyYWwIiT0idrzbjn8STyNN.html
01-04-2020||India||Centre grants permission to passenger aircraft for ferrying medical cargo, essential goods||The Centre has granted special permission to conduct cargo operations using passenger aircraft for ferrying medical equipment and essential goods during the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown, which started on March 25, to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in an order issued on Wednesday said there has been an additional demand for transporting essential cargo services due to the viral outbreak.“With the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown in the country, there is a demand for cargo operations for transporting medical equipment and essential goods. Considering the extraordinary situation that the country is facing, permission may be given to scheduled/non-scheduled operations to use the available passenger category aircraft (without configuration changes) for the carriage of cargo,” the DGCA said in its order.So far, 74 flights have been pressed into service to carry essential medical supplies and goods. A total of 37.63 tonnes of cargo has been transported to date, according to the Union ministry of civil aviation.Carriers involved in Lifeline Udan operations include Air India, Alliance Air, Indian Air Force (IAF) and Pawan Hans. Private carriers such as IndiGo, SpiceJet and Blue Dart are also operating medical cargo flights on a commercial basis. The DGCA order comes after the shortfall was pointed by the government’s nodal agency for medical procurement, HLL Lifecare Limited. The state-run company had pointed towards a shortfall of supply of equipment due to high demand and logistical issues because of the lockdown. The state-run company had also written to the Indian Railways citing the crunch. “Normal movement has been a bit strained because raw materials first have to be ferried to a manufacturing unit, then the finished product has to go The South India Textile Research Association (Sitra) for testing, and finally to the facilities where they’re needed, “ a government official said requesting anonymity.The Union government has also formed a committee under the ministry of home affairs for enabling the supply of medical equipment. Besides the railway board chairman, the panel on logistics comprises secretaries to the ministries of aviation, health, drugs, textiles, consumer affairs and shipping. The committee is tasked with ensuring unhindered supply of essential and medical goods during the lockdown and coordinating on relief operations.The committee, which is slated to hold a daily meeting, discussed the issue of making domestic cargo service operational. It also held talks on logjam across highways as hundreds and thousands of trucks are stranded since the lockdown.The civil aviation ministry has said special flights have been arranged to ferry cargo, including Covid-19-related reagents, enzymes, medical equipment, testing kits, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves and other accessories across the country.The Indian Railways has also begun special parcel train services in a bid to increase the supply of essential items such as medical supplies and equipment and groceries in small parcel sizes. Also, freight trains have been operational.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-grants-permission-to-passenger-aircraft-for-ferrying-medical-cargo-essential-goods/story-ZD8ru5Vr41i96VbcGZ98FL.html

It had snowed and the night temperature had plummeted. They were coming from Anantnag to Dooligam area in Banihal area but died of hypothermia.”Three other labourers had also trekked to their village in Banihal from Anantnag. “In fact, seven labourers took a hilly route from Verinag in Anantnag towards Banihal on Tuesday. While three labourers reached their village, remaining four got stuck at a hilltop in Nagimandu (Hingal Top), about five km from Dooligam in Banihal bacause of extreme bad weather conditions and snowfall,” he added.“These four labourers could not cross the hilltop and a rescue operation was launched this morning. While three dead bodies were recovered from the spot, one person was found alive and rescued,” said Rehman .The deceased were identified as Ghulam Mohiuddin (30), Zubair Ahmad Drabu (20) and Reyaz Ahmad (22). The man who was rescued was identified as Parvaiz Ahmad of Hinyal and has been hospitalized in Sub-District Hospital, Banihal.The SSP said that all the deceased were related to each other and belonged to Dooligam.“While three had reached their homes last night, these four men decided to cut short their distance and chose to cross a snow y peak fearing that they might not be allowed to pass Jawahar Tunnel due to the ongoing lockdown restrictions,” the SSP said.Deputy magistrate of Ramban district, Nazim Zai Khan said, “We had requested everyone to stay put where they were but they took a treacherous route which wasn’t right. They were coming from Verinag in Kashmir and were crossing a mountainous pass.”Khan also said that despite repeated advisories people have been violating lockdown norms and putting themselves and others at risk in Ramban district.“Nearly 200 people have reached Banihal and probablywant to go to Kashmir. We are giving them food and shelter but their number is increasing every day. They have been kept in quarantine for 14 days at Banihal railway station. Though there is no suspected case among them so far but they are certainly adding to the worries of the administration,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-men-trek-through-pir-panjal-range-to-reach-home-during-lockdown-3-die-of-cold/story-gkG4mIg1wFxFeP8LThhS4L.html

It was also attended by Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane and IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria.Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat told the minister that the armed forces have made more than 9,000 hospital beds available for Covid-19 cases and separate hospitals have been earmarked to exclusively deal with the coronavirus.The armed forces have earmarked 28 service hospitals for managing Covid-19 cases. Also, five hospitals run by the armed forces are equipped to carry out Covid-19 tests and six more would be added to the list soon.“Over 1,000 evacuees are quarantined at facilities in Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Chennai, Manesar, Hindon and Mumbai. Their quarantine period will end by April 7,” Rawat said during the video conference that was attended by the top military and ministry brass.Last week, the army said it was prepared to extend its network of military hospitals and laboratory facilities to the civil administration to assist in managing Covid-19 hotspots.Lieutenant General Anup Banerji, who heads the Armed Forces Medical Services, said, “Retired health professionals have also been kept in readiness to volunteer their services…Necessary equipment has been procured and dispatched to various hospitals.”Around 25,000 National Cadet Corps (NCC) cadets are also being mobilised to provide necessary local assistance, said a defence ministry release.Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said the air force had flown 25 tonnes of medical supplies during the last five days. He stressed that critical operational work was being undertaken with all necessary precautions.The essential medical supplies airlifted by the IAF include personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitizers, surgical gloves and thermal scanners, apart from medical personnel.“Regular airlift of Covid-19 test samples from the Union Territory of Ladakh to Delhi is also being carried. Towards this, C-17, C-130, An-32, Avro and Dornier aircraft are being tasked on as required basis and IAF is adequately geared up to meet all the emerging demands,” an IAF spokesperson said.During the video conference, Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh said warships were on standby to extend any assistance required.Defence Research and Development Organisation chief said a five-layered nanotechnology face mask N99 was being manufactured on a war footing.

01-04-2020||India||Case study of first US community spread patient offers vital Covid-19 clues||While health ministry officials quibble over whether increasing clusters of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases across India should be classified as “local transmission” that implies the infection source can be traced, or “community transmission”, which indicates more widespread disease because the source cannot be traced and contact tracing cannot be carried out to identify potential cases, clinicians in California have published a detailed case study of the first case of community transmission in the United States on February 26, underlining the need for expanded, aggressive testing to tackle the pandemic.Following the diagnosis, the US ramped up testing to discover the staggering magnitude of the epidemic, and now has the highest number of cases in the world, with at least 190,000 cases and 4,000 deaths.For clinicians, the medical history of an otherwise healthy woman in her 40s, whose chest infection rapidly deteriorated to near-fatal septic shock, offers critical clues to the management and treatment of Covid-19.The woman was admitted to the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, California, with a respiratory infection, which chest imaging indicated was pneumonia.Her condition worsened within 24 hours of admission, and she was quickly moved to the intensive-care unit (ICU) and put on ventilator support to help her breathe. She was given antibiotics, including linezolid, piperacillin-tazobactam and azithromycin, to kill a possible bacterial infection.The battery of tests over the next few days included a viral panel, respiratory culture, blood cultures, bronchoscopy cultures to identify infection source, but all came up negative.The doctors then started suspecting coronavirus disease but did not test her as she had no history of international travel or contact with a person with Covid-19, which was the testing criterion of the US Centers of Disease Control a month ago when no community transmission has been recorded.She next developed acute respiratory distress, with fluid building up in her lungs and making it difficult for her to breathe, which quickly worsened to septic shock, a potentially fatal sudden drop in blood pressure in reaction to severe infection.The severity of her respiratory condition and her lack of response to all supportive treatment led the clinicians to put her on airborne precautions and strict contact precautions and finally get her tested for Covid-19. Two days later, the results came back positive.Since there were no approved antiviral therapies for Covid-19, but the UC Davis got regulatory approval to treat her with an investigational drug called remdesivir, the broad-spectrum antiviral developed by Gilead Sciences that has shown promise against coronaviruses in animals.Remdesivir infusions resulted in the patient needing significantly less ventilator support and having better blood oxygen levels and chest X-ray results. Fourteen days after first admission to UC Davis, she was taken off ventilation. She has since been discharged and is recovering at home.“Remdesivir is an experimental drug, though there are ongoing clinical trials to analyse its safety and effectiveness against Sars-Cov2, the virus that causes Covid-19. In Medanta, we managed the 14 Italian patients symptomatically and all but one have recovered and been discharged. Only one is still in the ICU, but she is stable,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, Chairman Institute of Critical Care and Anaesthesiology, Medanta-The Medicity, Gurugram, where India’s first large group of 14 tourists were isolated for treatment in March.The US case study emphasises knowledge gaps in the diagnosis and management of Covid-19 patients in the absence of known community transmssion. Without clear risk factors, such as travel history, contact, co-morbidities like hypertension and diabetes, and advanced age, Covid-19 infection can initially masquerade as pneumonia.“According to recent guidelines in India, all hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory infection, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia without an explanatory diagnosis, must be tested for Covid-19 even if no clear source of exposure is identified,” Dr Mehta.The US study underscores the value of expanded testing. “There are individuals in the community who are not manifesting severe enough symptoms to check with their health care providers To tackle the pandemic, there needs to be significantly faster, less expensive and more widespread testing of all patients who potentially have Covid-19,” said Michael Schivo, co-director of UC Davis Comprehensive COPD Clinic and senior author on the study, in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/case-study-of-first-us-community-spread-patient-offers-vital-covid-19-clues/story-N9OGDb1IErKKXxtzRXcGwN.html

01-04-2020||India||Assam Covid-19 positive cases touch 5, all linked to Tablighi Jamaat congregation||Four more people in Assam tested coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive on Wednesday, a day after the first case was reported in the most populous North-eastern state, taking the total number of infected people to five.Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that all the five Covid-19 positive patients had taken part in the international congregation organised by Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin in Delhi between March 13 and 15. The minister said that the number could reach double-digits after more tests results are available later on Wednesday evening.“We have received a list of 456 people, who were present in and around Nizamuddin during the Tablighi Jamat’s congregation. The total number of people from Assam who were in Delhi stands at 547, as we have collected another 91 names locally,” the minister said.“We have gathered that 134 people were in the area but didn’t attend the congregation, while another 68 took part but are yet to return to Assam. Our target is to locate those 347 people who have since returned home,” he added.So far, the state government has identified and located 230 people who have come back to Assam and swab samples of 196 of them have been sent for tests. The authorities, however, are yet to locate 117 people and efforts are on to trace them.“Most of the test results are expected by Wednesday evening, but as of now we have four new Covid-19 positive cases confirmed by the Guwahati Medical College and Hospital. The total tally of Covid-19 patients in Assam is five and all of them had attended the Jamaat congregation,” said Sarma.“We have got reports that four other persons from Assam, who are among the 68 attendees of the congregation, are yet to return to the state but have tested Covid-19 positive in Delhi,” he added.The minister appealed to the 117 others, who are yet to be traced, to voluntarily contact healthcare authorities or call the 104 helpline number and inform about their location.“We have entered a critical stage as most of the 347 people who came back to Assam from the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in March didn’t quarantine themselves. We have no clue how many people they might have come in contact with since their return,” he said.A 52-year-old man, who also attended the Jamaat meet and belongs to Karimganj district in the Barak valley, is Assam’s first Covid-19 positive case, as test results confirmed on Tuesday. He has been admitted to Silchar Medical College and Hospital after he returned to Guwahati from Delhi by train. Those who came in contact with him since his return have been quarantined and swab samples of five of them have been sent for tests. The authorities are keeping a close watch on Assam’s zero patient’s health, as he also suffers from cancer and diabetes. Of the 386 fresh Covid-19 cases recorded in the past 24 hours, 154 have been traced to the Jamaat meet in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-covid-19-positive-cases-touch-5-all-linked-to-tablighi-jamaat-congregation/story-vUDRM13hL6DoWS9koNaJaM.html

While Frontline Indian Health workers are struggling for protective equipment we are supplying Serbia. Air India to fly out Germans and 90 tonnes of Protective Medical Equipment to Serbia. Are we nuts? This is CRIMINAL,” Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari tweeted.People familiar with developments said an assessment by the commerce and external affairs ministries concluded the equipment sent to Serbia – 3.5 million pairs of surgical gloves sold by a Kerala-based private company – was not on the list of medical gear whose export is prohibited.At the Congress’ news briefing through video conference, Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill hit out at the government on the issue. He alleged that when doctors and nurses across the country are crying for better equipment, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government was exporting PPE to Serbia.Shergill attacked the government for using Air India to fly out German nationals to their homes when Indian migrant labourers are dying on the roads.“This is heartless, shameless and brainless behaviour of the BJP government,” he alleged.On March 29, the official Twitter handle of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Serbia said a Boeing 747 had arrived in Belgrade with 90 tonnes of medical protective equipment from India.“The transportation of valuable supplies purchased by @SerbianGov has been fully funded by the #EU while @UNDPSerbia organized the flight & ensured the fastest possible delivery,” it tweeted.The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the guidelines regarding medical equipment whose export is prohibited are very clear. “The restricted items can be exported on a case-by-case basis with the approval of the DGFT (Director General of Foreign Trade),” said a person.Notifications issued by the DGFT on Feb 25 and March 19 state the exports of surgical and disposable masks, ventilators, and textiles and raw materials for masks and overalls are prohibited. Other equipment such as gloves, non-woven shoe covers and gas masks with chemical absorbents can be exported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-hits-out-pm-modi-over-medical-supplies-to-serbia/story-pTeKGhJdSwSonoQrQ8EKhI.html
01-04-2020||India||J&K parties call new domicile rights ‘insult’, seek suspension of ‘casual’ order||A Central notification issued on Wednesday defining domicile rights for the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir has led to criticism from most regional parties including the newly launched Apni party which described the policy as an “ill-timed” and “casual” attempt.The notification grants domicile rights in Jammu and Kashmir to those who have lived there for 15-years and to children of central government employees who have served in the UT for at least ten years among others. The rules also reserve group-4 level jobs for domicile right holders.Former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah described the notification as an “insult” while questioning the timing of its release. “Talk about suspect timing. At a time when all our efforts & attention should be focused on the #COVID outbreak, the government slips in a new domicile law for J&K. Insult is heaped on injury when we see the law offers none of the protections that had been promised,’’ tweeted Omar Abdullah.The policy also grants domicile to those who have studied in J&K for seven years and appeared in Class 10 and Class 12 examinations in an educational institution located in the Union Territory apart from those registered as migrants with the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner (Migrants). Apni party president Altaf Bukhari said the policy didn’t take the expectations of the local people into account and demanded that the ‘ill timed, order be put in abeyance till the Covid-19 pandemic is over.“While JKAP had been vehemently demanding Domicile Rights on land and jobs for the people of Jammu and Kashmir, the order issued by the union government reflects a casual exercise carried out at bureaucratic level without taking aspirations and expectations of people into consideration,” Bukhari said.Bukhari said the order was “causal” in attempt and designed to “hoodwink” the people of Jammu and Kashmir.“This Order in its entirety is a casual attempt, cosmetic in nature, to hoodwink the people of Jammu and Kashmir who genuinely believed that post October 31, 2019, their rights and privileges in the matter of employment and other rights would remain as it had been,” he said, adding that being a government-issued order and not a law made by the Parliament, the new gazette notification regarding domicile rule for J&K was not immune to any judicial review. Bukhari said a tangible, legal and constitutional mechanism was needed to safeguard privileges such as employment rights to non-Gazetted and Gazetted post and admissions to professional colleges for “the permanent residents” of J&K.As many as 28 of the 138 acts have been repealed as the domicile policy was notified months after the union territory came into existence on October 31, 2019, after its special status and statehood were taken away by the Parliament in August. J&K Peoples Conference led by Sajjad Lone said the order fell way short of expectations. “The new definition of ‘domicile’ is humiliating and insulting. Adds insult to injury. The lowest rung in jobs has been reserved for locals - not even non-gazetted but Class IV jobs,” J&K Peoples Party spokesman said in a statement.Congress said the notification diluted the privileges enjoyed by Jammu and Kashmir residents instead of safeguarding their interests with provisions that exist in the northeastern states.“This is an insult to the people of J&K. By this order the centre has made lakhs of people eligible for the jobs and other things which were reserved for the people of J&K,” J&K Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir told Hindustan Times.PDP spokesman called the domicile policy a “crude joke”.“The people of J&K will not benefit from this and it is a symptom of a larger problem,” the spokesperson said.However, the BJP welcomed the decision and termed it to be a step in the right direction post the abrogation of article 370.“It’s same like our neighboring state Himachal Pradesh’s domicile rights. It is a good step, though some people will criticize it. We welcome this notification and reservation,” former J&K deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Kavinder Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-parties-call-new-domicile-rights-insult-seek-suspension-of-casual-order/story-2mGlo2CyruywHnvM9yYPtM.html

Today, 14,000 more numbers were sent,” he said.The decision to use smartphones was taken at his meeting with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal.Also Watch | Covid-19 | ‘Rs 1 crore compensation...’: Delhi CM’s promise to medical staff It was inspired, the chief minister said, by countries such as Singapore that are using technology to enforce quarantines.The use of smartphone locations to locate a person in quarantine started in China, was quickly adopted in Singapore and China, and has been adapted by countries in Europe. Last week, the UK’s data and privacy authority confirmed that it wasn’t a violation of an individual’s privacy.Ensuring that people who are ordered to stay in isolation do not move out has been a challenge for states across the country. Health departments and the police had initially started pasting notices outside homes of people under self-quarantine and encouraged neighbours to report violations.But it was often not enough. So Karnataka came up with a mobile application that requires people to send geotagged selfies every hour, a system that is being adopted in Telangana as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-police-told-to-track-mobile-phones-of-people-under-quarantine-says-delhi-cm/story-2sZ90oirpjMrKbjnG1KNRI.html

The recent rise in cases does not represent a national trend,” Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary in the Union health ministry said at a briefing.Over the past three days, the number of positive cases has risen sharply across many states. Many of the news cases have been linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area. Follow coronavirus live updates here.“Till now there are 1,637 Covid-19 cases, including 386 new positive cases since yesterday. There have been 38 deaths. One hundred thirty two people have recovered. The number of positive cases has gone up since yesterday. One of the main reasons for it is the travel by members of Tablighi Jamaat,” Aggarwal said.Also Watch l Will the Centre extend lockdown?  He urged people to follow guidelines during lockdown period, avoid congregations and religious gatherings.In a related development, the Centre instructed states to intensify contact tracing of Tablighi Jamaat members who participated in the gathering at Nizamuddin March 13-15, and asked them to initiate steps to cancel visas of its foreign members who participated in the event in violation of their visa conditions. As the numbers continue to surge, the government is also stepping up efforts to stop the pandemic with the railways contributing in a large way by modifying coaches to set up quarantine facilities.“The Railways is preparing to set up 3.2 lakh isolation and quarantine beds by modifying 20,000 coaches. Modification of 5,000 coaches has begun. Lifeline flights have been started to transport essential commodities like testing kits, medicines and masks” Aggarwal said.Joint secretary in the Union home ministry, Punya Salila Srivastava who also addressed reporters said state governments are taking care of migrant workers who were heading home from different metros following the announcement of the 21-day lockdown.“The States are arranging food and shelter for the migrant workers; 21,486 relief camps have been set up where 6,75,133 persons have been given shelter,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recent-rise-in-covid-19-cases-not-a-national-trend-says-govt/story-g4iHTlQVHebMrRrQcRdjPN.html
01-04-2020||India||Congress to send its speakers to TV debates, Ist time since May last year||The 21-day national lockdown and strict social distancing measure to battle coronavirus have prompted the Congress to rescind its 10-month-old decision of not sending its spokespersons on television debates.The party has decided to send its spokespersons and panelists to TV channels to articulate its views on the pandemic.However, according to a party functionary familiar with the development, the Congress will continue to boycott certain “anchors who are perceived to be biased and only toe the line” of the government and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).It was on May 30 last year soon after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections that the Congress had decided not to send its spokespersons on television debates.The move was then widely attributed to the party’s discomfiture caused by the leadership crisis triggered by Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s insistence on quitting the post.But Congress functionaries had maintained that the decision was taken to register protest against the alleged “unfair treatment” meted out to its panelists in debates.“This is our protest against the acquired characteristics of the media. There is no level playing field on news channels. The TV debates are more like a circus than a discussion where they pitch one against the other and most of it is aimed at painting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP as hero and all the opposition as villain,” an office bearer of the party’s media department had then said.But the Covid-19 crisis forced a rethink in the Congress and accordingly it was decided to revoke the earlier decision.Keen to ensure that its voice reaches a wider audience, the grand old party has started using the new technologies available to cater to the needs of the media.From this week, Congress spokespersons have addressed daily press briefings through video-conferencing. The questions from journalists are sought well in advance and after initial remarks the spokespersons respond to those.Congress president Sonia Gandhi has also held a meeting through video-conferencing with party chief ministers on the coronavirus situation and the steps taken by the state government to deal with the crisis and also spelt out her suggestions.A meeting of Congress general secretaries, in-charge of states, state unit chiefs, legislature party leaders and heads of frontal organisations was held on March 28 through video-conferencing to assess and discuss the preparedness in fighting Covid-19.As many 82 functionaries, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Ahmed Patel, KC Venugopal and Randeep Singh Surjewala took part in it.And now on Thursday, the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, will discuss through video-conferencing the impact of nationwide lockdown on the economy, poor and marginalised besides the problems faced by the migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-withdraws-10-month-old-decision-to-boycott-tv-debates/story-NFuEr9C1cTAkFFMsiEfi7I.html

Before Parliament scrapped Article 370, only those considered permanent residents of the erstwhile state could get jobs in the state government. Here are 10 facts about the reworked domicile law:1.The Centre on Wednesday issued a notification announcing a number of amendments to 138 Acts of Jammu and Kashmir that include protecting jobs up to Group-4 for only those who are domiciled in the union territory.2. Among the laws amended is the Jammu and Kashmir Civil Services (Decentralisation and Recruitment) Act. 3. The government has inserted a clause for domicile category under which a person has to stay in the Union Territory for a period of 15 years. Children of all-India services personnel who have served there for 10 years also come under the category.4. The tweaked law says that no person shall be eligible for appointment to a post carrying a pay scale of not more than Group-4 (Rs 25,500) unless he is a domicile of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Group-4 is equivalent to the rank of constable in police parlance.Also Read| Amit Shah reworks Kashmir’s domicile law, includes residents for 15 yrs5. A total of 28 of the 138 Acts have been repealed as the Union government has laid down a procedure for being a domicile of the Union Territory, which came into existence on October 31, 2019, after the Centre scrapped Article 370 which gave special status to the erstwhile state. It was then bifurcated into two union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.6. According to the procedure, anyone who has resided for 15 years in Jammu and Kashmir or has studied for seven years and appeared in Class 10 and Class 12 examinations in an educational institution located in the Union Territory is a domicile.7. Anyone who is registered as a migrant by the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner (Migrants) will also be deemed to be a domicile.8. The others who can be deemed to be a domicile include children of those central government officials, all-India services officers, officials of public sector undertakings and autonomous bodies of the central government, public sector banks, officials of statutory bodies, central university officials and those of recognised research institutes of the central government who have served in Jammu and Kashmir for 10 years.9. Children of those who fulfil any of the conditions or children of those residents of Jammu and Kashmir who reside outside the Union Territory in connection with their employment or business or other professional or vocational reasons but their parents fulfil any of the conditions provided in the sub-section will also be deemed to be domiciles, the notification said.10. The domicile law would apply for recruitment to all posts that come with a basic salary of Rs 25,500.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-gets-a-new-domicile-law-sets-off-a-political-firestorm-10-facts/story-QVFG9AzUVfVV2n4dBjY3YP.html

About 23 people from Thane district’s Mumbra and 29 others from Ahmednagar have now been placed in 14-day mandatory quarantine in their respective districts, and are under close watch for symptoms of the disease, according to state government officials. “We have initiated a tracking method in which, as of now, around 52 persons have been tracked down in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event and the operation is going on across Maharashtra,” a senior official from the state home ministry told HT on condition of anonymity. Several states across the country are tracking down people who attended the Tablighi programme in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area. Around 2,000 people, including over 200 foreigners, reportedly visited the headquarters of the Muslim sect in mid-March, flouting several restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the virus. Out of these, more than 100 tested positive for Covid-19 till Tuesday while at least nine deaths are linked to the programme. Of the 52 traced till Wednesday – all of them preachers -- 13 are Bangladeshi nationals, 8 Malaysian and 2 from north-eastern states. The Union government had hinted a day before that the foreign nationals who visited Nizamuddin might have violated Indian visa norms by attending a religious event on tourist visas instead of the Missionaries visa. State officials said that the 29 traced to Ahmednagar had also attended another religious function organised at a dargah in Jamkhed, around 76km from the district. According to officials the state health ministry, none of those tracked down have so far shown symptoms of Covid-19, but will undergo a detailed check-up and will be monitored for 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-tracks-down-52-who-visited-tablighi-jamaat-event-officials/story-Kmr0HPLqopf9ryhdbT9dnO.html

The instructions were issued in a video conference chaired by the Cabinet Secretary with all the Chief Secretaries and police chiefs of states. “The States were sensitized about the intensive contact tracing of Tablighi Jamat participants as this has increased the risk of containment efforts of COVID-19. The States were asked to complete the contact tracing process on a war footing,” an official release on the meeting said.The meeting comes ahead of a video conference, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold on Thursday with the chief ministers of states and union territories to review the progress made in containing coronavirus through lockdown measures and to address any key challenges in its effective implementation and desired outcomes.The Nizamuddin congregation has turned out to be a major source of infections around the country, with Telangana reporting that all its new cases were from attendees to the Delhi meet, which is suspected to have been held in violation of several restrictions imposed on large gatherings and holding of religious events. Delhi police had registered an FIR against the organizers of the event on Tuesday and the government release detailing points from the meeting held by the cabinet secretary, says states have also been asked for registering cases against the organizers of the Jamaat and its foreign participants. “It has been found that foreigners who had participated in the Tablighi Jamat had violated visa conditions. The States were asked to initiate action for violation of visa condition against the foreigners and the organizers of the event,” the release said.In other important measures, the states were asked to implement the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana within the next week, while taking care to maintain social distancing. The central government had announced a combined package worth 1.7 lakh crore under the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana early last week which included several cash relief measures including Rs 1,000 to three crore senior citizen, widows and disabled among the poor class, Rs 1,500 assistance for women holding Jan Dhan accounts, Rs 2,000 advance payment to farmers months apart from other measures including additional ration for the poor, increased wages for MNREGA workers and relief for construction workers through state wage board funds. The cabinet secretary is said to have told states that the implementation of the scheme will likely involve large cash transfer to beneficiaries and it should therefore be organized in a staggered manner to ensure social distancing.In other important steps, the states were also told to ensure the manufacturing of essential goods continues along with the maintenance of supply chains of such goods with and between different states.It was also noted that the lockdown is being implemented effectively all over the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-told-to-intensify-contract-tracing-as-tablighi-jamaat-leaves-a-trail-of-covid-19-patients/story-NDhStHtaz5UjzkRkidWxRO.html

01-04-2020||India||HRD frames new reservation norms for KVs, JNVs to accommodate OBCs||The human resource development (HRD) ministry has framed new reservation rules for Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) and Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) run by it to provide quotas to Other Backward Classes (OBCs). It’s the first time that seats are being reserved for OBC students at the school level. KVs will create additional seats for scheduled castes (SCs), scheduled tribes (STs) and OBCs incase their numbers fall short after the regular admission procedure.For JNVs, it has been decided that the proportion of reservation for SCs and STs will be equal to their population of the district where the school is located but subject to minimum of the national average and a maximum of 50% for both these categories. Above this 27% reservation will be provided to the OBCs.This would help in imparting quality education to rural students in districts with large SC, ST populations while also providing opportunities to the OBCs, said a senior official who didn’t want to be named.The HRD ministry has also finalised the norms for implementing reservation for OBCs in KVs from the upcoming academic session itself.According to the modalities decided by the ministry, in the KVs, it has been decided that in the first phase, there will be a draw of lots for the seats reserved under the Right to Education Act from among the SCs,STs and OBCs. Following this, the seats for students belonging to employees in transferable jobs under the central government would be taken up and following that seats for those in public sector undertakings would be filled.Priority will also be given to the wards of state government employees.According to an HRD ministry official, once these seats are filled, a significant number of students would belong to the SC, ST and the OBC sections.In case it is found that the number of such students is below the reservation proposed, additional seats can be created, the official said.“The Modi government has a strong commitment for the welfare of the backward sections and HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank has felt that the constitutional mandate should be fulfilled without delay,” said the official. He added that despite the lockdown for the coronavirus disease, the ministry did not want to delay the important decision, which was taken when a majority of HRD ministry officials are working from home.The KVs are a chain of schools under the Union HRD ministry for the children of transferable central government employees. Currently, they provide 15% reservation in admissions to SC and 7.5% to ST students, apart from setting aside 25% seats under provisions of the Right to Education Act (RTE). The latter includes horizontal reservation of 3% for disabled students.The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan was established in November 1962 to provide uninterrupted education to wards of transferable central government employees.

Sahoo, who works as an automobile mechanic, has been in love with Meher for over a year.On Tuesday, the couple chose Bargarh town police station as the makeshift venue to get married since the marriage registrar’s office has been shut since March 25 – the day the lockdown started.They went to the police station and expressed their wish to get married to inspector Sadanand Pujahari. “I allowed the couple to get married in the police station because of the difficult circumstances due to the nationwide shutdown. They have given us in writing that they will live as man and wife from now on,” said Pujahari.The couple was given hand sanitiser and masks before Sahoo tied a mangalsutra around Meher’s neck. The couple and the police officials had to make do with biscuits as no sweets were available due to the lockdown. Later, the couple went to a nearby temple to seek blessings of a local goddess.“I had never imagined that I would ever get married in a police station.

01-04-2020||India||Will interrogate Tablighi Jamaat leader over audio clip: Delhi Police||Tablighi Jamaat (TJ) head Maulana Saad was on the run a day a case was filed against him for allegedly defying restrictions on gatherings to contain the coronavirus (Covid-19) spread, two investigators said on Wednesday, and added they want to interrogate him over an audio recording in which he is purportedly heard asking his followers to flout social distancing guidelines.Saad and five other top functionaries of the group were booked on Tuesday after it was discovered that the TJ’s headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area has emerged as the single-biggest source of Covid-19 infections in the country. The six-storey headquarters has been linked to at least eight deaths and 117 confirmed Covid-19 cases. The discovery prompted around a dozen states to sound an alert and search for the people, who had been to the headquarters. The Centre separately began the process to blacklisting 275 foreigners, found at the headquarters, who allegedly flouted visa rules by claiming to be tourists.The investigators cited above said they will question Saad over the recording they have found in which he is purportedly heard urging his followers against following the prohibitory orders while calling them the government’s conspiracy. The Delhi Police have mentioned the recording in the first information report (FIR) filed in the case. HT has seen a copy of the FIR.“The audio tape is an important evidence. Before the [three-week countrywide] lockdown [was imposed from March 25 to check the Covid-19 spread], they should have sent back the visitors. Instead of making arrangements, the head [Saad] wilfully misled the gathering and asked them to stay put. The case against him and others has been registered under sections of criminal conspiracy and the Epidemic Diseases Act,” one of the investigating officers said on condition of anonymity.Over 400 people at the headquarters have shown Covid-19 symptoms. A joint team of police, health workers, and the World Health Organization have evacuated at least 2,361 people from congested Nizamuddin until Wednesday. They have been sent to quarantine centres and hospitals.Investigators said Saad allegedly ignored the government’s March 13 and March 16 orders banning gatherings of over 200 persons and any form of religious congregations.Officers of the Delhi Police, who are authorised to speak to the media, refused to comment on the investigations despite repeated text messages and phone calls.The TJ on Tuesday issued a statement, saying the visitors were stuck at the headquarters because of the lockdown. Its spokesman, Mohammed Shoaib, said they had sent a request for curfew passes to the Delhi government to help the visitors leave their headquarters but they received no reply.Police and government officials have been scouring 16 mosques across Delhi, where some visitors at the TJ headquarters had stayed after leaving Nizamuddin. On Tuesday, the Delhi’s Police’s intelligence gathering wing wrote to the health department asking it to take “necessary action” as the “persons/foreigners associated with Tablighi Jamaat” were staying at those placed and posed “a grave danger to public health.”Syed Shaban Bukhari, the vice-Shahi Imam (prayer leader) of Delhi’s Jama Masjid, said they have sent a message to management committees of mosques in Delhi, urging them not to panic and make it mandatory for guests to get their medical check-ups done.“We have sent the message via a WhatsApp group asking committees to ensure they get the medical check-ups of guests conducted. It is crucial for the overall safety and for containing the Covid-19 transmission” said Bukhari.Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, the Shahi Imam of Delhi’s Fatehpuri Masjid, said mosques have been shut since they were ordered to do so. “We had already issued advisories asking people not to gather at mosques. The government should set up a help desk for the people who are stuck since the lockdown was imposed... [They] were not given any time to go back to their respective places.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-interrogate-tablighi-jamaat-leader-over-audio-clip-delhi-police/story-VRm02rpV0U10uuLvsVAUdP.html

But from March 25, five out of its 19 plants began producing sanitisers.The plants have produced about 1.4 million bottles of sanitisers until March 31 and supplied free of cost to government departments in the front line of the Covid-19 fight.Follow coronavirus live updates here.“The approximate cost producing these sanitisers is Rs 3.5 crore. We consider it as our contribution to the state’s efforts to fight the pandemic,” said Kesar Lal Meena, RSGSM general manager. The government organization has also donated Rs 5 crore to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund Covid-19 Mitigation Fund.The plant in Jaipur operates in two shifts – 6 am to 1.30 pm and 2 pm to 9 pm – and the plants in Mandore (Jodhpur), Hanumangarh, Ranpur (Kota) and Udaipur operate in one shift – from 8am to 5pm – to produce sanitisers in plastic bottles of 180ml each.Meena said two chains are operating in Jaipur and one chain each in the other plants. “There’s a shortage of labour so we cannot operate more chains. On a normal working day, we have 160 labourers in Jaipur plant alone. Currently, the plant is operating with 40,” he said.Excise commissioner Bishnu Charan Mallick said the sanitisers have been given to district administrations for free distributions to frontline workers in police, medical and health and other departments.Meena said production of sanitisers began on March 25 on a small scale. “Large-scale production began the next day when all five plants got operational,” he said.The RSGSM GM said the sanitisers will be available across 40 depots of Rajasthan State Beverages Corporation Limited, which normally handle supply of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), from Wednesday for Rs 37.50 each bottle.“We know there are restrictions on movement but people are exempted from the lockdown orders may also need to buy these sanitisers. The cost of our sanitiser is one third of the market rates,” Meena said.So until the plants are closed for production of country liquor, the rectified spirit is being turned into sanitisers with lemon and pink essence to colour the liquid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-distilleries-in-rajasthan-now-producing-sanitisers-to-fight-covid-19/story-4gWoiHriGMhLPi7RM5HL3N.html

Gauba told chief secretaries that they should carry out intensive contact tracing of the Tablighi Jamaat participants “as this has increased the risk of containment efforts of Covid-19,” a government statement said.Gauba said this exercise should be carried out “on a war footing”.According to the World Health Organisation database, the disease is in the local transmission stage in India.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ordered a 21-day national lockdown on March 24 in his televised address to the nation to stop the disease from spreading. Cabinet Secretary Gauba noted that the lockdown was now being implemented effectively all over the country, a reference to the flagrant violations in Delhi last week when tens of thousands of migrants reached the national capital’s borders with Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-discuss-covid-19-challenges-with-chief-ministers-tomorrow/story-Psnxg7MZa3R8nVHuSSS2sI.html
01-04-2020||India||Coronavirus hotspots: Kasaragod accounts for half of Kerala’s positive cases||Nearly half of Kerala’s total coronavirus cases--241-- are from Kasaragod, which is one of the ten hotspots of Covid-19 pandemic in the country. The north Kerala district has a high number of expatriates from the middle-east and its poor medical infrastructure combined with slack surveillance is feared to have pushed the coastal district to infamy.Out of 128 coronavirus cases in Kasaragod, 90 are Gulf-returnees and their contacts, but some others have no travel or contact history, which is adding to the district administration’s concerns. The district is in complete lockdown and two senior IPS and IAS officials are camping there to check the possibility of community spread of the virus.Kasaragod’s high population density (13 lakh people for a small district) and a poor doctor to population ratio of 1: 1500 as compared to 1: 300 for the rest of the state, might have aided in the spread of the virus, say officials.“We literally pleaded foreign-returnees to remain in their homes for at least 3-4 weeks. Many followed our advice but some flouted it, making the district pay a heavy price. We are fighting with all our might to contain the spread,” said State Revenue Minister E Chandrasekharan, who himself hails from the district.The district had reported some glaring cases of violations including that of an alleged smuggler who jumped quarantine and transmitted the disease to many. After his case came to light, customs officials found out that he had made 14 trips to the middle east in last three months. Later, district collector Sajith Babu impounded his passport and registered a case against him.According to the district administration, at least 8000 people came to the district from the Gulf since February 15 and they were put into home quarantine before many of them slipped out. At least 60 per cent of Dubai returned Kasaragod residents were living or working in Naif, a crowded commercial and residential area in Dubai, which is one of the Covid-19 hotspots in the middle-east.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-hotspots-kasaragod-accounts-for-half-of-kerala-s-positive-cases/story-5BrJ7ZGapqhto9LQqrDHSM.html

The patient was suffering from liver and kidney ailments. His immunity was low because of multiple health complications. However, he had had no overseas travel history and might have been infected because of low immunity. The deceased’s contacts have been quarantined,” BRD principal Dr Ganesh Kumar said.Initially, the deceased was admitted to the hospital’s trauma centre on Sunday noon but later shifted to the isolation ward, where he died on Monday morning.Six people, including laboratory technicians who collected his swab samples without a preventive kit and family members who at his attended last rites, have been quarantined. Also, the neighbourhood, where he lived in Basti district, has been cordoned off as a precautionary measure, officials said.The BRD Medical College authorities alerted the Basti district administration after his death on Monday morning, as they suspected him of being Covid-19 positive while awaiting the test results from KGMC, Lucknow.UP reported 103 Covid-19 positive cases till Tuesday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-reports-first-covid-19-fatality-as-25-yr-old-man-tests-positive/story-zUAWPHM52yssNcOv8kZQVM.html
01-04-2020||India||National lockdown over Covid-19 leads to drug shortage for HIV patients||HIV patients in remote areas of Odisha and Bihar who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs have not received their dosage of medicines for the month of March due to the national lockdown over the threat of the coronavirus.A 40-something HIV patient in a remote village of Odisha’s Khurda district was planning to get his ART drugs last week when the lockdown was announced, putting his plans of getting his medicine on hold. “I was not prepared for the lockdown. Normally I take a bus or auto to get the medicine from the ART centre. But with no transport available, I don’t know what to do,” he said.In another village of the same district, a 45-year-old HIV man as well as his HIV-positive wife and son have been frantically calling the president of HIV Positive People Network, an NGO supporting the HIV positive persons, to help them get the drugs as far as possible. “None in the family can move out and get the drugs from ART centre while it is difficult for outreach workers to deliver the drugs to all of them,” said Prabasini Pradhan of the HIV Positive People Network in Khurda district.In Ganjam district, that has the maximum number of HIV positive patients in Odisha, 5,000 are on therapy. But least 2,500 are yet to get the drugs, said Nilambar, of the HIV Positive People Network in the district. The outreach workers who can help in carrying the medicines to the doorsteps of those who need, are scared of getting beaten up by police. “A couple of days ago, one of our outreach workers was thrashed by police. Naturally we are scared,” he said. Though the government could have distributed the medicines through NGOs working among HIV patients, there was a risk. “In villages where everyone knows the other, sending the drugs through NGO worker would lead to identification and possible social ostracism of the HIV patient,” said Ajay Patra, an NGO worker.Project director of Odisha State Aids Control Society, Sanjukta Sahu admitted that some of the HIV patients have not got their medicines due to the lockdown. “Those who are in Bhubaneswar and nearby have managed to take their medicines from the ART centre, as police allows them to travel after seeing their green book. Those who are in remote areas are facing difficulties. By tomorrow we may reach all HIV positive persons,” said Sahu.There are more than 2.4 million HIV patients in India, of whom more than 1.2 million are on ART drugs.Odisha has over 35,000 HIV positive people living of which around 21,000 are availing the ART. The rest though registered with the Odisha State Aid Control Society, have discontinued the therapy. Getting supplies of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs is proving difficult for patients in far-flung areas of Bihar too. With immunity levels already compromised, walking to ART centres to collect the drugs in the absence of public transport is not easy.There are only 20 ART dispensing centres to cater to Bihar’s 38 districts, with two in the state capital Patna, which must be accessed by patients on the periphery of the city too. For instance, patients in Barh, located 70 kilometers away, have to travel to Patna. Doing so on foot during the lockdown is proving hard for patients.“My monthly stock of ART drugs was getting over today. I panicked because missing a single dose can have serious repercussions. I then came to know about the NGO, Patna Network for People Living With HIV Society, who arranged for the drugs to be sent to our local district hospital,” a 35-year-old HIV-positive widow in Barh said.It was not easy for workers of the NGO to convince the state health authorities to part with the drugs either.“After much persuasion, the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) provided us two ambulances and health staff yesterday to deliver ART drugs among people living with HIV in various districts”, the NGO’s president Gyan Ranjan said.BSACS additional project director Dr Abhay Prasad confirmed that there is no shortage of ART drugs and pointed to the difficulty in collection only due to the absence of public transport.“We have instructed our civil surgeons in districts and superintendents in medical colleges to make available drugs at the doorstep of HIV patients. NGOs, who are part of our support system, are also helping us ensure delivery,” Prasad said, adding that supplies for three months will be disbursed in one go and that even migrants with HIV infection who are in Bihar but not enrolled at the state’s ART centers, will be accounted for.Bihar has 60,033 people living with HIV enrolled at its ART centres.Earlier this month, an elderly Italian couple who underwent treatment for Covid-19 in Jaipur were administered a drug combination commonly used to control HIV infection. The drugs have been employed during clinical trials in China and Thailand. The Union Health Ministry has approved the use of the anti-HIV drugs in Covid-19 cases on a case to case basis and depending on the severity of the condition of a patient of Covid 19, giving rise to fears that patients may resort to stock-piling of the drugs.Visakhapatnam-based AIDS specialist Dr K Surya Rao said there was no cause for worry.“The production of anti-HIV drugs like Lopinavir and Ritonavir is on a large scale in India. While there are more than 2.4 million HIV patients, victims of Covid-19 are still in the hundreds. So, for now, there is no scarcity,” Rao said. Rao also pointed out that anti HIV drugs had not received FDI approval for Covid-19 treatment yet and that once they do, Indian drug companies would ramp up production immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-lockdown-leads-to-drug-shortage-for-hiv-patients/story-81uSkJbhDACZzbkAmZSsjO.html

01-04-2020||India||Migrants question implementation advisory on protecting wages, jobs||Nanhe Lal, 52, was busy setting up a makeshift tent on Monday in the fields on the periphery of his village in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur district. The tent, he said, would serve as his personal isolation ward for the next two weeks.Lal was among thousands of migrant workers from Delhi who took to the national highways on foot, soon after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, in their desperation to get back home and safety—a feat he finally accomplished on Sunday night.The exodus of workers, headed to their native lands, has been witnessed across the country over the past few days. For a country like India, which has an internal migrant population of around 37% (according to the 2011 census data) the movement of migrants was of such a scale that many likened it to the exodus triggered by the Partition of 1947. Photographs by media houses and agencies showed massive gatherings at state borders, highways and bus terminals, with people desperately looking for a way to get back home.On Sunday, the Union home ministry directed states to ensure that no employer sacks these workers or deduct their wages during the lockdown period, through an advisory. The direction was welcomed by the migrant workforce but its potential for enforcement was beyond their imagination.HT later reached out over the phone to a dozen migrant workers from different states and told them about the Union home ministry’s directive.Lal was one of them. “How is that possible? We don’t have any records. How will I prove I have been sacked or my salary has been deducted?” Lal said.They said the direction was welcome but wondered how it would be implemented on the ground even as Delhi’s labour minister Gopal Rai assured workers that his government will ensure that no worker is sacked or not paid because of the lockdown.Delhi has around 1.5 million migrant labourers engaged in the unorganised sector which perennially suffers from an arbitrary—or rather malicious—record-keeping system in terms of employees on payroll.“How can any government which till date could not ensure that we receive the stipulated minimum wages suddenly enforce a crackdown on employers for terminating our employment or not paying us during this lockdown?” said Amar Ahirwar, another migrant worker who does loading and unloading of heavy machinery in Delhi’s Mayapuri industrial area. He has now reached his village in Madhya Pradesh’s Morena and quarantined at a government centre there.Rakhi Sehgal, a labour rights activist and researcher, said, “India has plenty of labour laws but for ages, they were not enforced efficiently. The result—hundreds and thousands of wrongful terminations, wage disputes, inhuman working conditions, etc. The lack of enforcement is why no migrant labourer today trusts the news that government will act against employers for wrongful termination and/or salary cut during the lockdown.”Even if the government has the right intent, how will they transform it into action, a senior official in Delhi’s labour department asked. He further said, “The task of crackdown will lie with the states. Let us take Delhi as an example. The department has 20 field officials against a sanctioned strength of 72, only five case officials against a sanctioned strength of 20. Five joint commissioners preside over courts, against a sanctioned strength of 13. Who will do the enforcement?”Animesh Das, a member of the Delhi government’s minimum wage committee, said, “The government should do four things. First, make record-keeping in the unorganised sector less arbitrary by issuing mandatory identity cards to labourers. Second, digitise the wage mechanism to strengthen the record-keeping process. Third, create a strong complaint registration mechanism for labour disputes that arise out of the lockdown. And, fourth, strengthen the labour law implementation machinery in general.”Gopal Rai said, “Right now, the priority for migrant workers is food and shelter. As far as the enforcement of the government’s directive is concerned, we will do everything to ensure that no worker is terminated or suffer a salary cut because of the coronavirus lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-question-implementation-of-govt-advisory-on-protecting-wages-jobs/story-bSJcx1l7ODCA1qgUBnG6qJ.html
01-04-2020||India||Telangana engineering student sets herself ablaze fearing coronavirus infection||A 20-year old engineering student in Telangana’s Rajanna Siricilla district committed suicide on Tuesday by setting herself ablaze fearing that she might have contracted Sars-Cov-2 virus, the police said.The deceased was identified as Dasari Sravanthi, daughter of Dasari Balaiah of Jillella village of Thangallapalli block in the district. She was a B Tech final year student at a private engineering college in Siddipet district.According to the complaint lodged by the victim’s mother Lakshmi, no one was at home when Sravanthi doused herself with kerosene and set herself ablaze.“My husband Balaiah went to Muscat long ago, my son Vamsi and I had gone to the fields for work and my father-in-law Rajaiah had gone out for some personal work. When my father-in-law returned home in the afternoon, Sravanthi was burning in flames. By the time my son and I reached home, she was already dead,” Lakshmi said in the complaint, a copy of which was seen by HT.The police rushed to the village with a fire tender and put out the flames after it was alerted by the villagers. A suicide note was recovered from the house in which Sravanthi said she was suffering from symptoms of cold and fever and feared she might be suffering from coronavirus.“She suspected that she might have contracted the virus from her co-passengers in the bus in which she used to travel to her college in Siddipet. She asked her brother to take care of parents,” Lakshmi said.Stating that Sravanthi had not spoken about symptoms before, Lakshmi told the police that there could be some other reason for her suicide and requested a thorough investigation.Rajanna Siricilla superintendent of police Rahul Hegde told HT that prima facie, it was evident that Sravanthi had committed suicide fearing that she might have contracted Covid-19. “But we have sent the suicide note to the forensic experts to find out whether it was written by Sravanthi herself or fabricated by anybody else. We are also awaiting the autopsy report to know whether she really had any Covid-19 symptoms,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-engineering-student-sets-herself-ablaze-fearing-coronavirus-infection/story-fmU5RQCTgB64kItjC6ZP3L.html
01-04-2020||India||As govt seeks feedback to tackle Covid-19, suggestions pour in||Cab driver Deepak Gupta wanted to know if the government has any welfare scheme to offer his fraternity; he has earned little money in recent days.Raman Bhatia, the owner of a small business, sought the prime minister’s intervention for the release of payments owed by state-owned companies to his firm. Anand N suggested that volunteers be enlisted to deliver groceries at the doorstep of residents so that people don’t have to go out to shop.These are just three among the more than 52,000 comments that have poured in after the Narendra Modi government sought feedback from people on ways to tackle the coronavirus disease, widening the scope of public consultations.As India scrambles to stop the spread of Covid-19, the government opened a platform for public suggestions, seeking to involve more people in the battle against the disease, on mygov.in, the popular platform for government and public interface.An official note says the ideas people suggest can include “innovative and best practices regarding hygiene, hand washing, social distancing and preventing spread of rumours and being prepared rather than panicking.”The government has a record of taking suggestions seriously. For instance, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to launch his Namo app, he sought competitive suggestions on this platform; the final design for the app was suggested by a participant .The effort to tap public opinion on ways to tackle the coronavirus and its fallout is an indication of the government’s desire to engage with the people, a government official said, requesting anonymity.The success of the government’s battle against Covid-19 ultimately depends on the people’s participation. An internal evaluation of the suggestions is on and some of them may be implemented, he added.A participant, Tushar, used the opportunity to alert the government to the fact that many residents of east Delhi were not taking the lockdown seriously and were coming out onto the streets. He advocated the use of force to confine people to their homes. Hemendra Kumar suggested the use of school and college buildings and train coaches to shelter migrant workers.Inderdeep Singh proposed that airline caterers be used to provide food in shelters and camps for migrant workers. “There is a huge kitchen and delivery infrastructure available with organisations like Taj Sats that provide food to Air India and other airlines. Currently none of them is operating and therefore government can use that infra to provide food in Delhi and Mumbai,” he said.Varun Malviya wanted the lockdown, which ends on April 14, to continue for another week at least,.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-govt-seeks-feedback-to-tackle-covid-19-suggestions-pour-in/story-nucoRh8xz3Uj3foiswXLoK.html

The state government on Tuesday announced that around 800 people from the state had been identified as having attended the Jamaat event.Vijayawada commissioner of police Dwaraka Tirumala Rao said the police had identified all those who had returned from the New Delhi congregation and all of them had been sent to isolation centres.On Tuesday, state government advisor (public affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy declared that Andhra Pradesh was better placed than many other states in containing the spread of the coronavirus disease because of the stringent measures the state government was taking to implement a lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-sees-sudden-rise-in-covid-19-cases-total-goes-up-to-89/story-78SMu1cmiGIvG83v6YmFGJ.html

We wear multiple hats, ranging from being policy advocates; to building a taskforce that the government and citizens can rely on,” said Mekin Maheshwari, ex-Flipkart executive turned social entrepreneur who is the original founder of the group.Startups vs Covid-19 has adopted muli-pronged strategy to check the spread of the disease, scale up the testing infrastructure, prepare for the next stage (Stage 3) of the outbreak and ensure supplies for healthcare professionals.To help in checking the spread of coronavirus, the group advocates for lockdown and building applications to reduce contact tracing. It has also pushed for imposition of prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC which stops people from assembling in an area.To scale testing, Startups vs Covid-19 advocates telemedicine, building multi-scale testing and increasing testing infrastructure.The group has also launched a helpline where patients can consult with doctors without stepping out of the house and risking themselves. The vast pool of experts has enabled the group in building various applications, such as a portal for citizens to report symptoms and a heatmap of the infection based on symptoms reported by doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fighting-covid-19-bengaluru-based-group-leads-the-way/story-WYrJLDss0ul3Ir5ChGF8LK.html

The banking regulator had earlier announced several measures including slashing of bank rates to ease liquidity pressure and to stabilise the markets and the financial sector, along with steps to give major relief to individual borrowers by announcing measures including a three-month moratorium on EMIs of various loans including personal, housing and auto. Here are the additonal business-specific measures announced by the RBI on Wednesday1. Extension of realisation period of export proceeds by six monthsPresently the value of the goods or software exports made by the exporters is required to be realized fully and repatriated to the country within a period of 9 months from the date of exports. In view of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the time period for realization and repatriation of export proceeds for exports made up to or on July 31, 2020, has been extended to 15 months from the date of export. The measure will enable the exporters to realise their receipts, especially from Covid-19 affected countries within the extended period and also provide greater flexibility to the exporters to negotiate future export contracts with buyers abroad.2. Review of Limits of Way and Means Advances of States/UTsReserve Bank also increased the Ways and Means limits for state governments and Union Territories by 30 percent from the existing limit to enable the states to tide over the situation arising from the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The revised limits will come into force with effect from April 1, 2020 and will be valid till September 30, 2020.3. Implementation of countercyclical capital bufferRBI also deferred the activation of Countercyclical capital buffer or CCyB for a period of one year. The framework envisages the credit-to-GDP gap as the main indicator, which is used in conjunction with other supplementary indicators.Meanwhile, Congress has asked finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to ensure that the RBI circular regarding deferment of EMIs be issued widely and that interest subvention arrangement should be made for the interest on the deferred EMI payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-takes-more-steps-to-mitigate-covid-19-impact-exporters-get-6-months-buffer-for-realization-of-proceeds/story-dlszyPgbgflWMrht6NZ0wI.html

01-04-2020||India||Testing sewage water may give clue about Covid-19 circulation: Study||Testing sewage water could give authorities clues about the circulation of Covid-19 in cities, new research has found. Scientists in the Netherlands found the virus circulating in sewage water even when cases of Covid-19 were very low and the outbreak was still in its early stages in Dutch cities. In another analysis, Chinese scientists have suggested the use of paper-based devices (analytical devices for rapid diagnostics of pathogens. For instance, paper-based testing kits for malaria) to trace these pathogens early on.In the Dutch study, tests were conducted from sewage water samples three weeks before the first case of Covid-19 tested positive in the Netherlands but no markers were found in wastewater. When the test was conducted again on March 4 and 5, one week after the outbreak began in the country, markers were found in wastewater. Wastewater treatment plants were selected from two large and three medium sized Dutch cities and an airport to draw samples from which ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) was conducted.Scientists, however, clarified that there is no evidence yet that sewage is a transmission mode for SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in a significant proportion of stool samples in earlier studies, just two studies reported finding infectious virus from these samples. This indicates virus doesn’t sustain in sewage water for long possibly due to treatment. Surveillance of sewage water, however, offers the opportunity to check for community prevalence of the disease.“It is important to collect information about the occurrence and fate of this new virus in sewage to understand if there is no risk to sewage work ers, but also to determine if sewage surveillance could be used to monitor the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in our communities… sewage surveillance could also serve as early warning of the re-emergence of Covid-19 in cities, much like the sewage surveillance for poliovirus that has been used for this purpose,” authors from the KWR Water Research Institute in the Netherlands said in the studypublished in medRxiv.Another analysis published in the Environment Science and Technology journal by scientists from the School of Water, Energy and Environment, Cranfield University, and Chinese Academy of Sciences said paper based devices to pick up bio-markers in sewage samples similar to those being used for HIV, Malaria, Zika virus, human papillomavirus, among others, can be useful for tracking Covid-19.Dr Zhugen Yang, Lecturer at Cranfield Water Science Institute, said: “In the case of asymptomatic infections in the community or when people are not sure whether they are infected or not, real time community sewage detection through paper analytical devices could determine whether there are Covid-19 carriers in an area to enable rapid screening, quarantine and prevention.”“Sewage surveillance has been done for polio and non-polio viruses in the past. But testing sewage samples is not easy. We need RT-PCR now on a large scale for people. Swabs from sewage in cities can be extracted from the common duct in an area to test it. But I think that would be a post pandemic response in India. We need testing kits to be available right now. That’s a priority,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of microbiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. India is testing at only about 36% of its capacity currently, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/testing-sewage-water-may-give-clue-about-covid-19-circulation-study/story-jIgH37yczvOUyOgALiCusK.html

When a delegation of Kashmiri politicians met Home Minister Amit Shah last month, he had assured them that the Centre did not intend to carry out demographic changes in the union territory.Shah had also promised that the new domicile rule for J&K would be better than any other state.But the new rule triggered howls of protest from Jammu and Kashmir parties.Altaf Bukhari of the Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party, who had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah on his Delhi visit last month, was the first to lash out at the move. The former PDP minister who has floated a new party described the order as a casual attempt, cosmetic in nature, and designed to hoodwink the people of J&K. He asked Shah to put the notification on hold.Former chief minister Omar Abdullah criticised the timing of the order as well. ”Insult is heaped on injury when we see the law offers none of the protections that had been promised,” he tweeted.As evidence, Omar Abdullah pointed to Altaf Bukhari’s reaction.“You can imagine how hollow the domicile law is from the fact that even the new party created with Delhi’s blessings, whose leaders were lobbying in Delhi for this law, have been forced to criticise the #JKdomicilelaw,” he said.According to Tuesday evening’s notification by the home ministry, any person who has stayed in J&K for 15 years or has studied for a period of seven years and appeared in Class 10th/12th examination will be deemed as domicile.The government order said children of central government officials, All India Services, officials of Public Sector Undertakings and autonomous bodies of central government, public sector banks, officials of statutory bodies, officials of central universities and recognized research institutes of central government who have served in Jammu and Kashmir for a total period of 10 years will also be considered to be domiciled in the union territory.Children of residents of Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir who reside outside the union territory in connection with their employment, business or other professional or vocational reasons will also be treated to be domiciled in the UT if their parents fulfil the eligibility criteria to get a domicile certificate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-reworks-kashmir-s-domicile-law-includes-residents-for-15-yrs/story-HI3tqta82f2rbXDSGDYynL.html

Before this, Odisha reported three Covid-19 positive cases — of which two had travelled abroad. The third patient, a bank official, had travelled to Delhi and Haryana last month.Last week, the Odisha government revised its policy and decided to test all those who returned from abroad after March 4, said a senior state health official, adding that over 4,300 people have returned to the state since that date.Odisha health secretary Nikunja Bihari Dhal said the Bhadrak resident has been shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack late on Tuesday night. All his family members have been admitted to the isolation facility of the Bhadrak district hospital and their swab samples sent for tests. The authorities are carrying out contact tracing of the infected person. His residence has been sanitised and sealed by district officials.Senior state government officials also said at least 35 people from Odisha attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation held at Nizamuddin in Delhi between Match 13 and 15. The building, where the gathering was held, has become a hot spot of coronavirus infections in India.The Odisha government has also decided not to organise any function on the occasion of Utkala Dibasa (Odisha Day) on Wednesday due to the coronavirus outbreak and 21-day nationwide lockdown that started on March 25.Odisha governor Ganeshi Lal and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik wished the people of the state on Utkala Dibasa, which is celebrated every year to commemorate the formation of the state on linguistic basis on April 1, 1936.Governor Lal sought the blessings of Lord Jagannath for combating Covid-19 in Odisha.

01-04-2020||India||Gram panchayats asked to play active role to stop Covid-19 spread||The Union government has asked the over 250,000 gram panchayats to play an active role in staunching the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and identify residents of their areas who may have come in contact with Tablighi Jamaat members who attended a March congregation of the Islamic missionary group in New Delhi, people aware of the development said. “These elected representatives are the first point of contact for villagers because they are familiar with the specific problems of each household. It has been decided to use state and central funds to engage these representatives to fight the crisis,” an official said on condition of anonymity.Tablighi Jamaat members from all over India and its followers from overseas took part in the congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin in mid-March and then fanned across the country. The building where the congregation took place has become a hotspot of coronavirus infections in India.The government has begun aggressively tracing people with a history of contact with participants in the Jamaat congregation who have tested Covid-19 positive to date.While states have been put on a status of high alert, gram panchayats have been asked to step up monitoring and report anyone who could had come in contact with participants in the Jamaat gathering.Gram panchayats in each state have also been given specific tasks such as creating awareness of the disease and monitoring the home quarantine of those at risk of catching the infection, said a person aware of the development.There are over 250,000 gram panchayats across the country, according to the Union ministry of Panchayati Raj. Each gram panchayat consists of a village or a group of villages divided into smaller units called wards.“Tracing people with any contact or travel history has become an imperative as a large number of people have moved across states after attending the Jamaat meet. Preventing the spread of the virus to rural and semi-urban areas is critical. We are urging the gram panchayats to report cases as well as keep a strict vigil over those who are in quarantine. In many villages, there are community quarantine facilities,” said the official cited above.For instance, in Jharkhand, gram panchayats have been asked to disseminate awareness through wall paintings and set up isolation wards to treat migrants. In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, anganwadi (women and child welfare centres) workers have been supplying food to 41 children and six pregnant women. In eastern Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur district, gram panchayats have been pressed into service to reach out to the Mahadalit communities such as Musahars and Vantangiyas.In West Bengal, gram panchayat members are involved in making and distributing personal protective equipment ( such as masks and sanitisers. Vehicles meant for the community area development programme are being used to sell fresh vegetables, fruits and fish to the villagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gram-panchayats-asked-to-play-active-role-to-stop-covid-19-spread/story-vqu3HdlDodrRCuTMjmH4nO.html

The Tabhligi Jamaat, a religious group, had organised its annual congregation in the area which was attended by thousands at a time when coronavirus disease Covid-19 is spreading rapidly.“The Jamaat incident cannot be linked to any community. Such crimes are not linked to any community or caste,” Naqvi told Hindustan Times. (Read the full interview here)Naqvi, who heads the minority affairs ministry, said that what happened at Tabhligi Jamaat’s headquarters was a crime and it should not be seen through a religious prism.“We don’t look at it as a Hindu or Muslim or through any religious prism per so. This was a crime. The place, where this gathering happened, just happens to belong to one religious community,” said the minister.The uddin Markaz,six-storey building, the global headquarters of the Jamaat, has emerged as one of the biggest coronavirus hot spots in the country. Those who attended the congregation spread across the country during the lockdown increasing the risk of Covid-19 spread.“It is a Talibani crime. When the entire country is together to fight coronavirus, in such circumstances, such a thing is a crime. Not just the law, but even the Almighty will not forgive such a thing,” said Naqvi.He also slammed the statement by the Jamaat that many of those who came for the congregation could not move out because of the Janata Curfew on March 22. “Excuses are of no use. These kinds of excuses makes one feel that something was amiss,” Naqvi said.He also thanked the religious leaders for their positive response in fight against Covid-19. “I am happy that all religious leaders and more than that the public has responded very positively in the fight against Covid-19.

The meet has turned into a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hot spot in India. Speaking to Amandeep Shukla, Naqvi said 99% of the people, including minorities, are strongly supportive of the government’s efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The minister insisted that the fight against Covid-19 should not be viewed through religious prisms.Also read: Markaz leadership resisted, then NSA Ajit Doval dropped by at 2 am At a time when the fight against Covid-19 through social distancing is at its peak, an organisation such as Tablighi Jamaat has come under sharp focus for the gathering in the national capital. How do you view this?  It is a Talibani crime. When the entire country is together to fight coronavirus, in such circumstances, such a thing is a crime. Not just the law, but even the Almighty will not forgive such a thing. It is very unfortunate that the lives of so many people were endangered because of such a careless approach.Another issue that has emerged is that at this time a lot of foreigners were also staying there?I think the administration and the law enforcement agencies should be extremely strict with these issues. It is not just related to the lives of the people concerned, but also with the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. No one should be allowed to be negligent or carry out a criminal conspiracy under any circumstances.Also read: Timeline: How Nizamuddin event went on despite lockdown orders It is also being said on behalf of Tablighi Jamaat that the gathering was already held and many of them could not move out because of the Janata Curfew on March 22 resulting in lack of availability of transport facilities.Excuses are of no use. These kinds of excuses makes one feel that something was amiss. You are the minority affairs minister of the country. There may be statements against the Muslim community because of this incident related to the Tablighi Jamaat.We don’t look at it as a Hindu or Muslim or through any religious prism per so. This was a crime. The place, where this gathering happened, just happens to belong to one religious community. The participants are the first to be infected by the disease. Such an action damage society and the country at large.Do you plan to carry out any outreach towards religious leaders or community leaders? I am happy that all religious leaders and more than that the public has responded very positively in the fight against Covid-19. There is no contradiction from anywhere. For instance, talking about minorities, there has been a consensus about the Friday namaaz. Everyone has voluntarily decided not to offer prayers in public. But there are exceptions like the Jamaat meet that should be strictly dealt with.Do you plan to launch any awareness drive?We are talking to all stakeholders. We are getting positive reports from all across…99% of people are with us and working hard to spread awareness. The Jamaat incident cannot be linked to any community. Such crimes are not linked to any community or caste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-talibani-crime-union-minister-mukhtar-abbas-naqvi-on-tablighi-jammat-s-nizamuddin-congregation/story-ayp8shadVRIAmPb6XZlOcN.html

His wife and child have also been admitted to Lok Nayak hospital near Delhi Gate.Officials said the source of his infection is unclear.“He has no history of foreign travel or treating any Covid-19 patients. So, the source of the infection is still a question mark,” an official from the Delhi government’s health department, said.“His brother and sister-in-law did travel to the UK in February, but they haven’t tested positive for the infection,” the official quoted above said.Since the lockdown, the hospital saw around 100-150 cancer patients in OPD. Before that, the OPD attendance was between 1000 and 1500 a day.“We cannot take a risk. Only the cancer patient in emergent need of care is coming to the hospital right now and they are immunocompromised. We have to shut the OPD to sanitise the premises to ensure that no one gets it,” Dr BL Sherwal, director of the Delhi State Cancer Institute, said.More doctors infectedHe is the fourth doctor in the Capital to test positive for the coronavirus disease after two Mohalla Clinic doctors and a private practitioner from Hari Nagar contracted the disease.A doctor couple from two Delhi Mohalla Clinics in the northeast region had tested positive for the coronavirus disease on Tuesday.The 49-year-old doctor, who worked in a mohalla clinic in Maujpur, was diagnosed on March 21 after being infected from a patient who returned from Saudi Arabia. His 48-year-old wife, who also worked in a neighbouring clinic in Baburpur, and 17-year-old daughter tested positive for the disease on March 25.The city’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme is tracking all the people who came into contact with the doctor couple, as well as the 38-year old index patient.

We will be able to know the status of Covid-19 spread in Assam only after the results arrive,” Himanta Biswa Sarma, the state’s health minister, had said on Tuesday.Sarma had said he has instructed district authorities to find and quarantine them.“Held an urgent Video Conference with all DCs & SPs advised them to take swift & strict measures for all those who returned from hotstpot at #NizamuddinMarkaz of #TablighiJamaat. All of them shall be quarantined by evening,” Sarma tweeted late on Tuesday.The minster had also urged people who have returned to the state to voluntarily go to the nearest hospital or make a call on the state’s coronavirus helpline number.“Urgent Request. If there is anyone from Assam who attended the religious congregation of Tablighi Jamaat at Hazrat Nizamuddin in Delhi, please IMMEDIATELY report voluntarily to the nearest government hospital or by calling Helpline no # 104. Please treat this as very important,” he had tweeted.Also read: Markaz leadership resisted, then NSA Ajit Doval dropped by at 2amAssam had on Tuesday also reported its first Covid-19 patient after a 52-year-old man tested positive and Sarma said he is now at Silchar Medical College Hospital in Cachar district of Barak Valley.The man, Sarma told a local news channel, had first shown symptoms of Covid-18 on March 18. There are unconfirmed reports that he had gone for treatment of another disease to Delhi and had returned to Assam on March 11.“The patient was under our notice since Monday and we sent his samples to NIV, Pune to confirm.

01-04-2020||India||Covid-19: States coordinating on migrant workers, Nizamuddin event||State governments have increased their coordination to share details about migrant workers and those with travel and contact history with Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic missionary movement that held a congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi mid-March.Nizamuddin has since become the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hotspot, claiming nine lives and infecting at least 24 people across the country.The states are also trying to ensure safe transportation, screening, monitoring and providing food and healthcare for tens of thousands of migrant workers during the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown to tackle the pandemic.The labourers’ plight has emerged as a big challenge, said government functionaries aware of the details.During daily coordination meetings between state functionaries and ministers, the mass movement of these migrant workers, some of whom have walked for hundreds of kilometers after the lockdown started on March 25, has been identified as the most critical area requiring immediate attention. “Almost all states have made arrangements to look after these workers, but the situation is still quite fluid. Many state governments are coordinating to take care of the workers such as sharing details on how to help them,” said a Union minister requesting anonymity.On Tuesday, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh spoke to his counterpart in Bihar, Nitish Kumar, to apprise him of the arrangements being made by his government to look after the migrant labourers from the latter’s state. Singh told Kumar to reassure the families of these workers that they are being looked after well during the lockdown.People, who had begun their journey on foot, are still in transit or reaching their native places, despite the fact that states have been instructed to stop all movement of people beyond their boundaries. In such cases, states have been asked to take proactive steps to screen and monitor them.“In Uttar Pradesh, approximately three lakh migrant workers arrived over the last few days. They have all been screened and kept under watch for 14 days. Over 7,000 gram panchayats have been alerted to report cases of those who arrived earlier and managed to reach their homes,” said a senior functionary of the UP government.States have also started to share details on the number of people who came in contact with members of the Tablighi Jaamat’s congregation at Nizamuddin from foreign countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Kyrgyzstan. “We’ve told the states to exchange information on whereabouts of the people who attended the congregation or were in touch with the members of the Jaamat. States have started helplines to report these cases and are also making appeals to people to voluntarily come forward for screening,” said a member of Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party.Trade unions have urged the central government to reset the process of offering relief to the migrant workers stranded across the country. They have suggested direct cash transfers, ensure jobs and wages are not cut and healthcare needs are met at native places of the workers.K Saji Narayanan, president of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), said, “The workers are facing several problems. For instance, they are not accustomed to the food being provided to them. In some states, they are being forced to live in shelters that have no civic amenities. Besides, the anxiety of being away from home and not earning their wages are getting the better of them.”The BMS, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has a network of over 6,000 registered trade unions, on Monday wrote to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and urged her ministry to pay at least Rs 5,000 to each labourer’s family immediately, open new bank accounts for those in the unorganised and informal sector and allow the workers to run their own kitchens.Sukumar Damle, secretary, All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), said the government must ensure that there is compliance with its orders on the ground. He said the workers are bearing the brunt because of a lack of coordination between the state administrations and the police.Sachin Jain, of Vikas Samvaad, a Madhya Pradesh-based non-governmental organisation working with the migrant workers, flagged the need to involve civil society groups to reach out to the distressed workers.He said the government does not have a plan to deal with workers in an emergency and is relying on the police to overcome “the unprecedented humanitarian crisis”.“The police are overworked and stressed. Besides, they don’t have the capacity to address the workers’ issues. No wonder, workers are walking up to 500 kilometers to reach their native places amid this unprecedented humanitarian crisis,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-states-coordinating-on-migrant-workers-nizamuddin-event/story-x7WXVW5ae2TP8JHljhhzZN.html
01-04-2020||India||One-third of migrant workers could be infected with Covid-19: Centre tells SC||The government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that there is a possibility that three out of 10 people moving from cities to rural areas are carrying coronavirus disease Covid-19.The submission was made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre in the hearing on two public interest litigations (PILs). The hearing was held by video conferencing.Referring to the last census, Mehta who addressed the court from his office chamber, said there were about 4.14 crore people had migrated for work, but backward migration is now happening due to the coronavirus pandemic.More on Covid-19:• Covid-19: Your guide to staying safe• Covid-19: What you need to know today• Can Covid-19 spread after symptoms end?• How coronavirus is different from seasonal flu and common coldThe court directed the Centre to ensure that migrant workers kept in shelter homes are given food, medical aid, and also asked it to take assistance of trained counsellers and religious leaders of all faiths to help the migrants overcome their panic as “panic will destroy more lives than the virus”.“We want to impress upon you that the panic will destroy more lives than the virus. You need counsellors,” the bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justice L Nageswara Rao said, adding, “you can have ‘Bhajan, Kirtan, Namaz’ or whatever but you have to give strength to the people.”The court also asked the central government to set up within 24 hours a portal for dissemination of real-time information on the Covid-19 pandemic to counter the panic and fear being spread through fake news.Mehta told the bench that no migrant worker, who had left for their native places after being rendered jobless due to a 21-day nationwide lockdown, “is on the road now”. He also said that authorities would mobilise religious leaders to counsel the migrants in shelters so that they could stay calm.The PILs demanded direction from the court for the government to provide thousands of migrant workers who are rendered homeless and jobless due to the lockdown with relief, including food, water, medicines and proper medical facilities.Mehta said that the migration of people cannot be allowed at this juncture as this would spread the virus in villages.The bench adjourned the hearing on the PILs to April 7 while refusing to restrain the high courts from taking up the issue of migrants, saying that they may monitor the issue more closely.According to the Union home ministry, there are over 21,000 relief camps set up across the country where more than 6.6 lakh destitute people and those stranded because of the Covid-19 lockdown are sheltered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-third-of-migrant-workers-could-be-infected-with-covid-19-centres-tells-sc/story-bwKnI2oBI5tFoXlpvP0n7M.html

It has also said that any foreigner found to be free from Covid-19 should be immediately deported by the first available flight.“Till that time, such person must be confined and quarantined by his host organisation,” the government has said in its advisory.The advisory further says that foreign teams of the Jamaat are on tour to the hinterland of India, and appear to be potential carriers of the coronavirus disease.“TJ activists from India had reportedly attended a religious congregation (February 27 to March 1) in a mosque in Kuala Lampur, Malaysia. Open domain reports indicated that several of those who attended the congregation had tested positive for Covid-19. Hence, thorough screenings of these who arrived from Malaysia is urgently needed,” the advisory says.“Presently, it is estimated that about 2000 foreigners, on tourist visa, from over 70 countries are spread all over the country for Tabligh work. Their period of stay in this country is upto six months. Tabligh headquarters at Nizamuddin (Delhi) is reportedly in the process of calling the foreign Tabligh teams from different states and sending them back to their respective countries,” it adds.The six-storey headquarters of the Jamaat has emerged as the one of the biggest coronavirus hot spots in the country.

Of these 59 were recorded in Mumbai alone, taking the number of infected people in India’s worst-hit city to 151. However, state health minister Rajesh Tope said the jump on Tuesday was because the results of tests conducted by the city’s private laboratories over the past four days were declared together.Maharashtra’s chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had on Tuesday said they are sealing areas where there are coronavirus patients to curb the further spread of Covid-19.Thackeray also directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to set up 227 flying squads that will conduct a house-to-house inspection in each and every ward. The squad will have personnel each from BMC, police, health and revenue departments.“The squads will reach out to the members of the patient’s family and all those who came in contact with them. They will be asked if they have any symptoms of flu, such as cough, cold and fever, and for those having any of these symptoms, arrangements will be made for testing,” Thackeray said.Uddhav Thackeray had on March 22 declared imposing section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in urban areas of the state, restricting assembly of not more than five people at one place. His orders came two days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a 21-day lockdown across the country.Thackeray had also declared a shutdown of public transport services -- Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST), state transport and private buses. Mumbai Metro and Monorail also announced the closure of their services till the end of the month.The staff in all the government offices was also reduced to 5% each day.The numbers are still rising despite all the restrictions and are likely to further rise. Experts believe the state should increase its testing capacity and reach out to maximum people to contain the spread.Anil Deshmukh, the state’s home minister, has warned people against spreading any rumour on April Fool’s Day on Wednesday.“Tomorrow’s April 1st.

At least 3200 people from across the country attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin, which has emerged to be the biggest Covid-19 hotspot in the country.Hundreds of people have been put under quarantine and tested them for the dreaded infection by at least 11 state governments and Union territories.Results were awaited in many states but officials confirmed that congregation members had tested positive in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu, and J-K.Also read: How Nizamuddin event went on despite lockdown ordersThree villages in Hajin, one in Ganderbal, two in Shopian, seven in Pulwama, five in Srinagar and two in Budgam have been declared as ‘red zones’ and all those who have tested positive for coronavirus disease are connected with the Covid-19 patients belonging to Tablighi Jamaat. Many members of the Jamaat had voluntarily approached officials after they heard about the death of the 65-year-old religious preacher in Srinagar, whose was the first Covid-19 related death in J-K. The preacher had attended the gathering in Delhi on March 8 and 9 and left for Deoband in Uttar Pradesh on March 10. From there, he went to Samba district in Jammu on March 12, where people from different parts of the state had also participated.On March 16, he flew down to Srinagar and developed mild symptoms. Before he tested positive he had met dozens of people in the Valley and also attended a gathering in Sopore and Baramulla. The locality in Srinagar where the preacher lived was also sealed.Officials said that more than 100 people who had any sort of contact with the preacher are currently under the hospital quarantine and couple of them have already tested positive.Many family members and Jamaat members who had met the religious preacher in Delhi and Samba were tested and many turned to be negative, which has given a slight glimmer of hope to officials. Also read: Islamic missionary at centre of India’s Covid-19 outbreakIn Hajin, eight people affiliated with Tablighi Jamaat have tested positive and four villages—Batagund, SK Bala, Chandeergeer and Parray mollah of Hajin township—have been declared as red zone and the areas completely sealed as the police are keeping a close eye on the situation.Among these eight positive cases, two had come into contact with the religious preacher who died, while others have been travelling to different states across the country. However, officials say that they could have attended the religious gathering at Nizamuddin and other places and contracted the virus during travel or some other places.“They all positive patients had a travel history as they belong to Tablighi Jamaat. Around 200 people are under administrative quarantine and more than 600 in home quarantine,’’ said a senior officer in Bandipore district.Among these eight positive patients, two had visited neighbouring Ganderbal district and stayed at a mosque. Now, a big village which also houses a big mosque and Darul-a-uloom have been declared a red zone.“Nobody is allowed in or outside the village and names of all the persons who had met the positive patients have been contacted,’’ said another senior officer in Ganderbal district. In south Kashmir, three members of the Tablighi Jamaat had tested positive and all of them had travelled outside the state in the first week of March and two had even attended several religious congregations. Around six villages in Pulwama and two in Shopian have been isolated.

01-04-2020||India||At least 216 likely violated visa regulations: Officials||At least 216 foreigners who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation this month in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area, which has emerged as one of the biggest coronavirus (Covid-19) hot spots in India, violated visa norms by entering the country on tourist visas rather than the mandatory Missionaries visa, HT has learnt.The Jamaat is an Islamic missionary movement aimed at spreading the teachings of the Prophet and has a sizeable base in South Asia. Till Tuesday morning, at least 24 people who were part of the congregation tested positive for Covid-19 in Delhi alone and the area was locked down. At least 441 people from the location were taken to hospital with symptoms.The detection of the Covid-19 infection among the Tablighi Jamaat workers at Markaz (headquarters) Nizamuddin was an 11-day operation that began in Karimnagar in Telangana on March 18 and was completed in the wee hours of March 29 after intervention from the highest levels of the security establishment, officials familiar with the matter said.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe officials, from the home ministry, Delhi government, and security agencies added that the Jamaat came on the radar when nine Indonesians tested Covid-19 positive at Karimnagar, Telangana. The nine were members of Tablighi Jamaat (or Tablighis), and the organisation’s HQ was asked, as early as on March 19 to provide details of all the foreign nationals who had come visiting since January 1, 2020. The number was no less than 2000. And some of them had ventured out preaching across the length and breadth of the country. On March 21, the home ministry alerted all state governments about the crisis and asked them to contact district co-ordinators of the Jamaat so that all those who left Markaz, foreigners and Indians, were reported and tested for the virus. It was after this that Covid-19 positive cases among preaching Tablighis turned up in Andaman, Tamil Nadu, and Jammu and Kashmir.Co-incidentally, it was the same day, ahead of the People’s Curfew called for by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 22, that Maulana Saad Tablighi, the Emir at Markaz issued a statement that was also uploaded on YouTube, saying that the Modi government’s recommendation of social distancing was a way of keeping one good Muslim away from the other. Repeated attempts to contact Maulana Shahzad, the coordinator at Markaz elicited no response.According to official data accessed by HT, the 216 foreigners who were staying in the Nizamuddin area came from countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Saudi Arabia, among other places.Indian security agencies on March 21 brought the presence of foreign nationals in the gathering at the Tablighi Jamaat’s Nizamuddin headquarters, also referred to as Markaz, to the Delhi government’s notice.But a state official said the Delhi government was not informed about the scale of the congregation. “The Delhi Police [which reports to the Union home ministry] is the primary enforcing agencies of all the rules under the nationwide lockdown. The Nizamuddin police station shares a boundary with the Markaz. So what was stopping them from taking strict action?” this official, who did not want to be named, asked.On March 24, the SHO (Nizamuddin) served a notice to the Markaz to vacate the premises so that health checks could be carried out. The next day, Maulana Saad asked his followers to follow instructions of the government as workers were ill within the Masjid.According to home ministry officials, between March 26 and the evening of March 28, the Markaz only allowed the ill to be removed to the hospital; 32 people were taken to the Sanjay Gandhi hospital. The situation took a turn for the worse when one of the doctors of the Markaz also took ill. That was when the home ministry and agencies decided that the building had to be vacated. However, there was serious resistance mounted by the Markaz leadership on March 28 and at 2.00 am on March 29 National Security Advisor Ajit Doval was asked by Home Minister Amit Shah to break the deadlock. NSA Doval talked to the Markaz leadership and the latter yielded.While the Markaz has now been vacated with the inhabitants removed to either quarantine or hospitals, the Modi government has decided to black list all the foreigners who attended the missionary movement using tourist visas instead of mandatory missionary visa on the basis of registered FIR.In the past, the immigration department has black-listed a number of Tablighi Jamaat members for visa violations. Religious missionary visas are only given after much vetting, which perhaps explains why many of the people attending the Jamaat used tourist visas.In a statement, the Jamaat said that “visitors/guests/devotees/worshippers from across the globe throng the place for prescheduled programs lasting for not more than 3-5 days”.Although the Tablighi Jamaat has been under the scanner of security agencies around the world for suspected links with radical groups in South Asia and the larger Muslim Brotherhood, and also the involvement of its members in specific terror plots (such as the 2006 one to use liquid explosives on aircraft), nothing has ever been proved.“They operate in grey areas and their preachings can be used to radicalize youth in the name of Islam,” said a counterterror operative on condition of anonymity. The Tablighi Jamaat originated from the Mewati region on the Haryana-Rajasthan border and the organisation is currently headed by Maulana Saad. It has since spread across the world — as can be expected of a body whose name literally means “society for spreading the faith”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-216-likely-violated-visa-regulations-officials/story-2EbkOywhCPmHpIDFeMDhXP.html

01-04-2020||India||Coronavirus Update: Goa to use iron ore permanent fund to fight Covid-19 battle||The Goa government will dip into the Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund, a specialised fund set up on the orders of the Supreme Court, in a bid to find the finances to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Tuesday. Sawant, who had earlier admitted that the government was facing a fund crunch, said the state finances are also under tremendous stress due to reduction and stoppage of business activity and had sought donations from private companies through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to help battle against the disease. “We will be using money from the Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund for fighting Covid-19. We will use around Rs 120 crore, the fund is worth approximately Rs 400 crore,” Sawant said at his daily press briefing after discussing with stakeholders.Also read: Lockdown-hit Goa relaxes system to issue curfew passesThe Goa government is already using the district mineral funds that were set up as per the amended Mines and Minerals Development Act agreeing to spend Rs 52 crore lying with the two districts. The government, which was in a precarious financial position even before the Covid-19 crisis, has also set up a special bank account asking private companies to donate to help fight the disease. While not revealing the amount collected so far, the Goa chief minister has said that all MLAs have vowed to give one month’s salary to the account while industrial houses like Bandekar and Dempo have given money while Vedanta Group a large stakeholder in Goa’s mining industry has promised money but has not declared the amount.The Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund was set up for sustainable development and inter-generational equity. It was set up on the directions of the Supreme Court while disposing of the Goa Foundation’s plea in 2014 that the lessees who benefit the most from mining must contribute 10% from their sale proceeds for sustainable mining.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-goa-to-use-iron-ore-permanent-fund-to-fight-covid-19-battle/story-FjjoMJ01ouXjjhzJoGBqRI.html
01-04-2020||India||Plea before Supreme Court to make Covid-19 testing free||A petition was filed before the Supreme Court on Tuesday praying testing facility for the coronavirus disease should be provided free of cost to all citizens at all private and government testing laboratories.At present, private laboratories are allowed to charge people to test for coronavirus though the same is capped at Rs 4500.“It is urgently required that the respondents have to provide free of cost testing for Covid-19 to all citizens,” the petition stated.The petitioner, advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi, submitted that government hospitals are packed to capacity and it has become difficult for the common man to get himself tested in the government labs.With no alternative in sight, they are forced to pay money to get the tests done at private labs. Saddling ordinary citizens with such financial burden effectively deprives them of their accessibility to medical facilities and is violative of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, the petitioner submitted.Sudhi also pointed out there are only 114 identified testing centres for testing Covid-19 in an entire country with a population of 1.3 billion people. Also read: At 32 per million, India lags far behind on testingDue to this, he claimed, adequate testing was not happening to make the situation dangerous with each passing day.He, therefore, prayed that testing facilities should be ramped up so as to ensure that adequate tests are done and all tests relating to Covid-19 must be conducted by pathological laboratories accredited with National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL). “The impending danger of the Covid-19 is extremely serious given the deprived population of the country and testing is the only way to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic,” the petition said.“The private hospitals including laboratories have an important role to play in containing the scale of the pandemic by extending philanthropic services in the hour of national crisis,” it added.Government labs testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) seem to be already burdened by the sample load, with many hospitals saying that the lag in receiving test results has increased to three days.The 130 functional government laboratories across India have tested 42,788 samples so far, of which 4346 were tested on Monday alone. Of the 49 private labs approved for testing, 399 tests were conducted on Monday, and in total these chains have done about 14,00 tests since they were allowed to test, starting on March 21.All laboratories performing Covid-19 tests have a capacity of conducting 13,000 tests per day. The 49 private chains have around 16,000 collection centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-before-supreme-court-to-make-covid-19-testing-free/story-arFX9ZeOvSY1jru9kzC62H.html
01-04-2020||India||Podcast: Aarti Shahani on Her Indian-American Immigrant Story||If you listen to National Public Radio, chances are you’ve heard the journalist Aarti Shahani report on some of the biggest technology stories in the world. Microsoft. Google. Apple. Facebook. Aarti has covered them all.But there’s one story you may not have heard of--and that is Aarti’s own. In a new memoir, Here We Are: American Dreams, American Nightmares, Aarti documents her family’s harrowing journey--from Partition-era India to Casablanca, Morocco to Queens, New York. Aarti’s parents came to America with little money in their pockets and no legal documents to remain in the country. Battling poverty, discrimination, and wayward business partners, the Shahani family manages to make it. Until one day, nearly everything falls apart. Aarti’s father was arrested and accused of operating an electronics store that was a front for the Cali drug cartel. What followed was a jail sentence for Aarti’s father in New York’s notorious Riker’s Island prison and a years-long struggle to fight off deportation.This plot sounds like a made for Netflix special. But this is real life. This is Aarti’s story.This week on the show, Milan Vaishnav (Director of the South Asia programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace) talks to Aarti about her new memoir, her immigrant story, the “unsung heroes of low-end globalization,” and what she learned about America’s broken immigration system along the way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/podcast-aarti-shahani-on-her-indian-american-immigrant-story/story-G32y1rmMCTVtdX7D152tIM.html
01-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Edward Murphy, after whom the famous law was named, may well have scripted the tragedy (for it is definitely that) in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area, where the Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim missionary group, hosted a meeting of indeterminate length at its headquarters, a six-storey building. The meeting was attended by around 2,000 people although there are reports that this is just the count of those who registered for the event, that there were many who didn’t, and that people came and left in batches.This was a wilful tragedy, brought about by foolishness, compounded by carelessness, and, at every stage, characterised by a clear disregard for the law.Also read: Now a disease hub, Jamaat defied series of anti-Covid curbsIt emerges that at least some of the people who attended the meeting from other countries travelled to India on a tourist visa – a clear violation of Indian laws which would have required them to enter the country on missionary visas. It is estimated that there were 216 foreign delegates who attended the meeting, although there are fears that the actual number could be much higher.The meeting itself appears to have violated several Delhi government orders – one on conferences of more than 200 people; another on any religious gathering; a third on a congregation of more than 20 people; and a fourth on a meeting of more than five people.Once it was clear that there was no way those who attended the conference could stay back, the Jamaat seems to have decided to put them up, although it says it did inform the local police about the presence of the people at the Markaz and sought help, late last week, for their return home. Some of these people have now tested positive for Covid-19. It gets worse – some of those who were ill appear to have taken fever-reducing medication to pass the screening process; fortunately, these cases have come to light after people were quarantined. But the damage has been done. Many of those who attended the conference have already dispersed to states and Union Territories across India, and also back home to their countries in the case of the foreign preachers, with some of them taking the infection back with them.The headquarters, Markaz Nizamuddin, where around 2,000 people were staying even as recently as the weekend, will likely end up being India’s own Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that saw 712 infections. All occupants have since been moved out and the building sealed. It is likely that more infections are traced back to the Jamaat’s meeting. Already 117 cases, including eight deaths, can be.On Tuesday, India ended the day with 1,614 cases of Covid-19 and 46 deaths. The number rose by 294 during the day, on the back of an increase of 181 on Monday and 126 on Sunday. It is clear that India’s numbers are on the rise – and clusters such as the one at Markaz Nizamuddin will only accelerate that process. That makes the task of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), officials of which are engaged in contact-tracing, that much more challenging – and that much more critical.Still, India’s infection numbers are way below those of many other countries. On Monday, new research suggested that children given the BCG vaccine (which prevents against tuberculosis, and which is given to every Indian child, and has been since 1949) at birth may develop immunity to Covid-19, although large-scale tests are required before this can be confirmed . With no avenue being left unexplored, it isn’t surprising that Australia, Netherlands, Germany and the UK have said they will begin just such large-scale human trials involving health workers who are most at risk from the infection.India will hope it can continue to keep its numbers low. On Wednesday, April 1, the 21-day lockdown enforced to flatten the curve of infections entered its second week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-WlhcIvnObprc00SElZ3oSN.html

The 70 events planned by the two countries to mark the milestone year, however, are likely to impacted by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic that have killed more than 38,000 and sickened over 80,0000 globally.India was among the first non-Communist countries to recognise the People’s Republic of China (PRC) when it was formed under the rule of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1950 after years of a civil war. New Delhi and Beijing have finalised a long list of events to mark the year including dozens of exchange programmes and cultural, religious and trade promotion activities.The events planned both in China and in India are likely to postponed because of the pandemic.Both countries have implemented strict restrictions on international travel, which are unlikely to be resumed immediately, to contain the spread of the virus.The 70 events were finalised in line with the understanding reached by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping during their 2nd Informal Summit at Mamallapuram on October 11-12, last year.The Indian Embassy here said soon after that summit that the activities were aimed at demonstrating the historic connection between the two civilisations as well as their growing bilateral relationship over the years despite several differences.In 2018, Modi and Xi held the first informal summit in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, signalling a thaw in the chill that had set in bilateral ties following the military standoff between the border troops of the two countries near the Sikkim border.The two countries have continued to maintain close exchanges despite several old and new differences, the primary of which continues to be the disputed boundary question that has cast a shadow on bilateral ties for decades.Experts say its the lack of mutual trust between the two countries that have historically hampered the relationship between the two populous neighbours.The details of the letters to be exchanged between President Ram Nath Kovind and President Xi Jinping were not immediately available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-presidents-to-exchange-letters-to-mark-70-years-of-ties-on-april-1/story-qt4u3F34V2rjjuydKSX40J.html
01-04-2020||India||Hundreds from Telangana, AP attended event at Nizamuddin||Nearly 2,000 followers of the Tablighi Jamaat from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are estimated to have attended the March 15-17 congregation of the Islamic missionary movement in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin, which has since emerged as a coronavirus (Covid-19) hotspot, raising deep concern among governments of the two states at a time when the pace of the disease’s spread has escalated.Also read: States rush to track down over 3K who attended Delhi eventTelangana officials said six people from the state, who attended the congregation, had died of Covid-19, and the government was trying to trace the people who they had been in contact with. Andhra Pradesh discovered 11 people who had been infected by the virus after attending the event; three contacts too tested positive.At least 25-30 people from each district of the two Telugu-speaking states attended the congregation, said a statement released by the Andhra Pradesh government on Tuesday. Telangana has 33 districts and Andhra Pradesh 13 districts. The Andhra government has so far identified around 800 people who attended the Jamaat congregation. The Telangana government has identified 1,030 people who did so.“Officials are gathering information from the event organisers, police officials, the railway department as they travelled in trains, and from various other sources and tracking down everyone,” said the statement released by AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy ’s office on Tuesday evening.According to a bulletin issued by the Andhra Pradesh government on Tuesday, as many as 17 new positive cases of Covid-19 had been detected in the state since Monday night. Out of these, as many as 14 were connected to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation: 11 of them had attended the event and three are relatives of attendees.Chief minister Reddy, expressing concern over the development, appealed to the people who attended the congregation and the people they came in contact with to voluntarily step forward for medical treatment. He ordered the health department and the police to coordinate and identify fellow travellers of the Jamaat, test them, and shift them to quarantine centres in case they exhibited any symptoms.In Telangana, health minister Etala Rajender asked all those who returned from the congregation to get themselves tested and remain under quarantine so that the disease doesn’t spread. Mohammad Irfan, a professor of electronics at the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Nuzvid, in Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district, who attended the Nizamuddin event, said it was a peaceful congregation of Jamaat members to reaffirm their faith in Islam.He said no one exhibited any Covid-19 symptoms at the event. “We returned safely on March 18. Later, I was put in quarantine at Nellore government hospital along with a few others. So far, none of us has developed any symptoms for Covid-19 and we are safe. We are being taken care of by the doctors and government officials well. There is no need to create unnecessary panic about the Delhi meeting,” Irfan said on the phone from quarantine.Mohammad Akbar, who runs a business renting out tents for outdoor functions in Vijayawada, said he, too, had returned from the Delhi convention without any symptoms of Covid-19. “Maybe a small number of people might have tested positive for Coronavirus, but I can say 95% of those who returned from there are safe. As per the government instructions, I am maintaining home quarantine since my return,” Akbar said.According to the official statement, arrangements for the Tablighi Jamaat followers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to participate in the congregation were supervised by Ikram Ali, leader of the organisation based in Hyderabad’s Mallepall, who took care of their accommodation and food.HT couldn’t reach Ikram Ali , whose phone was switched off.In Telangana, out of the 1,030 people who were identified as having attended the meeting, as many as 603 were from the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits.“We conducted a joint operation in coordination with the health department since Monday night and started tracing the people who came in contact with those who attended the congregation,” said Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation commissioner Lokesh Kumar.Six people from Telangana who attended the congregation died in hospitals after they were infected by the Coovid-19 virus, a statement from the chief minister’s office on Monday night. On Tuesday, 15 more tested positive. Apart from Greater Hyderabad, the other districts that recorded a high number of travellers to Delhi included Nizamabad (80), Nalgonda (45),Warangal Urban (38) and Adilabad (30 ) .Telangana police said they were are on the lookout for those who came in contact with the six people who died of Covid-19, after returning from the Tablighi Jamaat event.Director-general of police, M Mahender Reddy, who held a teleconference with officials late on Monday, directed all district officials to immediately trace the contacts and put them under quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hundreds-from-telangana-ap-attended-event-at-nizamuddin/story-YFLGp8PPMqfPmcyxa2OI5I.html
01-04-2020||India||Study links climate crisis to low rainfall||Parts of India are facing a severe impact of the climate crisis with reduced rainfall and increase in dry, or no rain, and heavy rain days during the monsoon season, an India Meteorological Department (IMD) study on changes in monsoon patterns over 30 years has found.The monsoon, which generally begins in June and retreats by September, delivers around 70% of India’s annual rainfall. It is crucial for the cultivation of rice, wheat, sugarcane and oilseeds in the country where farming employs over half of its people. The monsoon is key to replenishing reservoirs, groundwater and addressing water shortages.The study found “significant decreasing trends” in the south-west monsoon from 1989 to 2018 in the Ganga basin states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, which are known to have among the most fertile lands in the country. Meghalaya, where Cherrapunji is known as one of the places with the highest precipitation globally, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh recorded a decreasing trend along with Himachal Pradesh. The study found a significant increase in heavy rainfall (6.5 cm or more) days in Gujarat’s Saurashtra and arid regions of Kutch and south-eastern Rajasthan, as well as northern Tamil Nadu, northern Andhra Pradesh, south-west Odisha, parts of Chhattisgarh, south-west Madhya Pradesh, parts of West Bengal, Manipur and Mizoram, Konkan, Goa and Uttarakhand.Goa has recorded the maximum monsoon rainfall over the past 30 years (2878.0 mm) followed by Meghalaya (2702.4 mm). Tamil Nadu reported the lowest (311.7 mm) followed by Rajasthan (414.2 mm). Pulak Guhathakurta, who heads the IMD’s hydrometeorology wing in Pune, said a Parliamentary standing committee had asked for a report on the impact of the climate crisis on monsoon in the recent decades. “The ministry of earth sciences presented this analysis to the Committee in February but it is being made public today [??],” said Guhathakurta, who has also conducted long-term studies on monsoon patterns with 100-year data. He said there is multi-decadal variability. “For example, 1940 to 1970 was a wet period for us and now we are in a dry period. But there is a clear imprint of climate change on monsoon which is something that farmers have been trying to deal with. The Ganga basin is recording a significant increase in dry days.” The IMD has put out individual detailed reports for states on variability in monsoon.In a press statement on Monday, IMD (Pune) said the monsoon rainfall shows high temporal and spatial variability. “Further, in view of ongoing climate changes, there have been significant changes in the mean rainfall pattern and their variability exclusively in terms of the intensity and frequencies of heavy rainfall events.” The IMD in January highlighted how monsoon onset dates had also changed in several parts of the country. “The onset and withdrawal dates for south-west monsoon recognised by the IMD were based on monsoon pattern between 1901 and 1940. But monsoon patterns including onset and withdrawal across the country have recorded significant changes in the recent decades and hence will be changed,’’ Union earth sciences ministry secretary M Rajeevan said in January.He said they will announce the new dates for monsoon onset to states sometime in April. All meteorological forecast and data are being shared with farmers.There was a bad start to the monsoon season last year with June being the driest in five years. “This monsoon will be bad. One challenge is when do farmers sow etc because of the unpredictable monsoon pattern but also because livestock is a major source of income for small and marginal farmers. Both fodder and water for livestock will be impacted if drought conditions extend. I fear there will be a deep crisis situation particularly for crops other than wheat and paddy for which there is no procurement policy. Markets are mostly closed owing to lockdown and outbreak. If you look at the past 10 years data, money earned by migrated labour comes into the village and used for agriculture. Now all those labourers have migrated back so there will be major stress on earning from the little agricultural plots in most parts of the country,” said GV Ramanjaneyulu, chief executive officer of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-links-climate-crisis-to-low-rainfall/story-66vpO8oXoJdX1zc3DVOuMI.html

01-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: States rush to track down over 3,000 who attended Delhi’s Nizamuddin event||State governments across India scrambled on Tuesday to identify at least 3,200 people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi that has emerged to be the biggest Covid-19 hotspot in the country.At least 11 state governments and union territories put hundreds of people under quarantine and tested them for the dreaded infection. While results were awaited in many states, officials confirmed that congregation members had tested positive in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu, and the UT of Jammu & Kashmir.Delhi government officials identified 1,830 people from 19 states and Union territories who visited the congregation in Nizamuddin, which was held between March 15 and 17, but state governments said they suspected many more people, who were not registered with the sect, had visited the event. At least seven persons who attended the event – six in Telangana and one in Kashmir – have died of Covid-19.The state government has so far identified around 800 persons who attended the Jamaat congregation. “The officials are gathering information from the event organisers, police officials, railway department as they have travelled in the train, and from various other sources and tracking down everyone,” an official statement from Andhra Pradesh chief minister’s office said on Tuesday evening.Of the 17 fresh cases on Tuesday, 14 were related to the Jamaat meeting – 11 attended the meeting and three are their relatives.CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy appealed to the travellers from Nizamuddin and their relatives to voluntarily come and take treatment. Mohammad Irfan, a professor in electronics in Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Nuzvid in Krishna district, who attended the Nizamuddin conference, said, “There were no symptoms of anybody suffering from Covid-19 at the meeting. We returned safely on March 18. Later, I was put in quarantine along with a few others. So far, none of us has developed any symptoms,” Irfan said.The local administration isolated at least 20 villages after some people affiliated with the Jamaat told officials about their travel history. The officials said three villages in Hajin, one in Ganderbal, two in Shopian and seven in Pulwama, five in Srinagar, two in Budgam had been declared as red zones.Only eight persons at Hajin have tested positive and all of them have come in contact with the 65-year-old religious preacher, who died last week. The preacher had attended the gathering in Delhi on March 8 and 9 and left for Deoband in Uttar Pradesh on March 10. From there, he went to Samba district in Jammu on March 12. On March 16, he reached Srinagar.“The locality in Srinagar where the preacher lived was also sealed...Around 200 people are under administrative quarantine and more than 600 in home quarantine,’’ said a senior officer of Bandipore district.As many as 157 people from 20 different districts of UP participated in the Jamaat congregation, the state police have said, putting all district under alert. “We are not releasing the figures but most of people from UP who visited the religious gathering in Delhi’s Nizamuddin are still in Delhi. Only a few of them had returned to UP and they are being fully examined and their entire track record maintained,” additional chief secretary (ACS), home, Awanish Awasthi said. A senior police official said the presence of 157 participants of UP in the religious gathering was worrying as at least 24 people from the same gathering tested positive since Sunday and nearly 200 others started showing symptoms on Monday..In Uttarakhand, the government said 34 people attended the meeting and 15 were quarantined so far. At least 22 people, including 17 foreign nationals and five Indians, who were picked up from two mosques from Ranchi early on Monday attended the congregation, officials said. Ranchi SSP, Anish Gupta said, “All 22 were put in isolation centre under strict watch. Their medical examination is underway.”A number of state governments said they were still in the process of identifying attendees. A senior official of Bihar home department, who did not want to be named, said they have got the list of 86 persons who attended the Jamaat meet and administrations of all districts had been asked to get them tested and ensure home quarantine. The police have also issued instructions that all foreigner preachers in the state be tested.West Bengal home secretary, Alapan Bandopadhyay, said, “All those from Bengal who have participated in this event are being identified and will be immediately tested and put under mandatory 14-day quarantine.”“Some people from the state must have gone to Delhi. But identifying them will not be easy,” Haji Jameel Manzar, a Kolkata-based member of the Muslim Personal Law Board told HT. Police is seeking help of local offices of Jamaat to get details.Rajasthan DGP, law and order, ML Lather, said 17 people from the state attended the congregation and all of them are in isolation in Delhi “but still we are trying to identify if there were some more who attended the event”.Assam government said 356 persons from the state were present in and around the hotspot near Nizamuddin. Meghalaya chief minister’s office said 12 people from Meghalaya attended the Jamaat. All of them were in Delhi, the statement said. Seventeen persons from Himachal are in quarantine in Delhi. Eight persons from Kerala were in quarantine in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-rush-to-track-down-over-3k-who-attended-delhi-event/story-1JWYnICAnpCXi0CNqIACYJ.html
01-04-2020||India||2nd Delhi mohalla clinic doctor’s contacts being traced||A doctor couple from two mohalla (neighbourhood) clinics in Northeast Delhi are central to one of two coronavirus disease (Covid-19) clusters in the city. The 49-year-old husband who worked in a mohalla clinic in Maujpur was diagnosed on March 21 after being infected by a patient who returned from Saudi Arabia. His 48-year-old wife, who worked in a neighbouring clinic in Baburpur, and 17-year-old daughter tested positive for the disease on March 25 — presumably infected by him. So far, 10 people have been infected by P0, the index patient of the cluster, in this case, a 38-year-old Dilshad Garden resident who returned from Saudi Arabia. At least 3,800 people who came in contact with the index patient, the doctor, or his wife, including patients from the two mohalla clinics, are being tracked by the city’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme .“Both husband and wife are doctors and used to work in two clinics not very far from each other. We are monitoring all the people they came in touch with including those who visited their clinics,” said an official from Delhi’s health department. There are around 450 mohalla clinics across the city. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the mohalla clinics would continue to remain open after the doctors tested positive.“A mohalla clinic doctor, his wife and daughter have tested positive for Covid-19. This is a sad news but it has led to a lot of rumours that mohalla clinics will be closed. The mohalla clinics will continue to remain open because if we close them down then people will have to go farther, to bigger hospitals,” the CM had said.Delhi has reported 97 cases so far, of which 24 are from another cluster in Nizamuddin.The 38-year-old index patient returned from Saudi Arabia on March 10; she tested positive for the disease on March 18. Before that, she visited her 65-year-old mother and 35-year-old brother living in Jahangirpuri, who tested positive for Covid-19 on March 10. She also infected two other relatives – sisters aged 24 and 26 – living in Dilshad Garden. They tested positive on March 21.She also went to the evening clinic of the 49-year-old doctor (before she tested positive); the doctor tested positive of March 21. Later, another friend of the index patient – a 35-year-old man from Jahangirpuri – and his relative tested positive for Covid-19.The city’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme is tracking all people who came into contact with the doctor couple, as well as the 38-year old index patient . That includes almost 1,200 people who came in contact with the husband (including patients at the mohalla clinic, evening clinic, his family/friends etc.) and another 1,400 people who came in contact with the wife. Around 1,200 people who came in contact with the index patient are also being tracked. These people have all been quarantined at home and if they develop symptoms, they will be taken to a hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-delhi-mohalla-clinic-doctor-s-contacts-being-traced/story-PcZukzXNblzBrvyy70Y3YL.html
01-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Now a disease hub, Jamaat defied series of anti-Covid curbs||Delhi Police on Tuesday registered a case against Maulana Saad, the head of the Tablighi Jamaat, and other officials of the group for defying a series of government orders that restricted gatherings in the city in a scaled manner between March 13 and March 21, before a full-fledged national lockdown was put in place on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).In the first information report (FIR), parts of which were reviewed by HT, the police have claimed that they have recovered an audio recording in which Maulana Saad was expressly heard asking people to “defy” the government’s lockdown and prohibitory orders. The charges include sections of the epidemic diseases act -- meant to punish a person not following directions meant to stop an epidemic -- and those relating to criminal conspiracy.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageThe police have also mentioned that on March 23, they apprised the officials of Tablighi Jamaat about the need to maintain social distancing in the building, which was not followed. News agency ANI late on Tuesday released a purported video recording of the conversation at the Nizamuddin police station. HT could not independently verify the video.The Jamaat, which issued a statement defending its actions earlier on Tuesday, said its centre -- known as a markaz -- is routinely occupied by followers who come from pre-scheduled events, and that hundreds of them were stranded as the government gradually tightened its curbs on people’s movement to stop Covid-19 from spreading.Over the past three days, close to 2,000 people have been evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat’s markaz building in Nizamuddin and 24 of them tested positive in New Delhi alone till Monday night, according to the health bulletin released by the government. At least 117 more who visited the complex have tested positive for Covid-19 across the country and close to 3,000 others are feared to have been exposed to the virus.According to health department officials, some of the people in the building may have tried to hide their symptoms such as fever by taking medication prior to being evacuated over the last two days. According to a home ministry official asking not to be named, around 164 -- including 146 foreign nationals -- left the facility and are spread in other parts of the national capital. On March 13, the day the Delhi government banned gathering of more than 200 people in the city as one of the key measures to prevent the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covis-19, the Tablighi Jamaat -- a Muslim missionary group -- hosted a congregation of over 1,800 people in its premises, according to multiple people aware of the matter.Those in attendance included preachers from across the country and several foreign nationals . The six-storey markaz building has residential rooms for guests, and can accommodate about 2,000 people. Even as some of the preachers left after March 13, other groups continued to pour in at the headquarters to participate in the programmes organised inside the building. The congregations continued till the evening of March 23, despite the Delhi government banning any form of religious events on March 16, further restricting gatherings to 50 peole or below, and then 20 people of below (March 19), and the police issuing prohibitory orders under Section 144 across the city on March 22. The Tablighi Jamaat, in a press statement issued on Tuesday, said that the people who were inside the headquarters were trapped because of the March 25 lockdown.A senior government officer, however, dismissed this contention, saying the matter should have never reached that stage. “By the first week of March, the coronavirus scare had already hit Delhi. Schools were ordered to close on March 6. For the first time, the Holi celebration was also cancelled by the state government. Even at the Resident Welfare Association (RWA) level, they had announced that Holi would not be celebrated. Advisories were issued by different departments. In that scenario, if the government issued order on March 13, the organisers of the mosque should have compiled. The impact of the damage would have been less,” said the official who asked not to be named.Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the organisers were “highly irresponsible” and “extremely wrong” in defying the orders. He also said that lapses, if any, found on the part of any Delhi government officer would be acted upon. “If we find that any officer has failed to deliver his/her duty properly or there has been any kind of negligence, strict action will be taken.” After the evacuation of over 200 foreigners from the building, police have found that several of them violated visa norms by coming to India on a tourist visa rather than the mandatory Missionaries visa.Though the Markaz building is a venue for such congregations throughout the year, the largest influx of people from abroad and other states was on March 10 and 15, according to people aware of the developments. A police officer who is probing the case said: “The government order was widely reported by the media but the organisers paid no heed. At that time, there was no lockdown. All airports, bus stations and the train services were open and yet they continued to gather inside the mosque. The organisers should have asked their guests to vacate the headquarters and return to their home towns. It was their responsibility.” He asked not to be named.Police also said that on March 22, a day after the completion of the one-day “janta curfew” imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, section 144 was imposed across the city, and the Jamaat officials were asked to shut the centre. Under section 144, gatherings of no more than four people are allowed.“Section 144 was imposed across the city at 9pm on March 22. The following day, the local police also sent them a letter to shut the headquarters but they did not act. While some 1,500 persons left the mosque on the morning of March 23, another group of around 1,500 preachers came to the mosque in the evening. They should not have allowed the group inside,” another senior officer said. The Tablighi Jamaat’s statement said that the Delhi government sealed the city’s borders starting 6am on March 23, ”diminishing any chances of these visitors availing road transport for their journey back home”. The statement added: “Despite this challenging situation, with the help of Markaz administration, around fifteen hundred visitors left Markaz Nizamuddin by availing whatever meagre transport was available. On the evening of 23rd March, a further nationwide lockdown was announced by the Prime Minister with clear message for people to stay-put wherever they are. Under such compelling circumstances there was no option for Markaz Nizamuddin but to accommodate the stranded visitors with prescribed medical precautions.”The Jamaat’s spokesperson also shared a copy of the letter they wrote to Delhi Police on March 24 in response to the police’s directions to close the mosque. In the letter, they said they were trying to evacuate the people from the mosque but were yet to get curfew passes from the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM). The letter by spokesperson Maulana Yousuf mentions that while police advised them to get pass from the SDM, they were yet to get the curfew passes. In response, a second senior Delhi government officer, who did not wish to be named, said that the requests were sent too late. “They should have followed the orders in the days leading to the lockdown. The local administration was not clear about whether e-passes to the Markaz administration should be issued or not. The request for car passes for 17 vehicles came after the nationwide lockdown was imposed. It was kept in abeyance because there was confusion on whether issuance of the e-passes to them would have violated the lockdown norms as movement of every body, except those engaged in essential services, is banned during this period. The directions of the PM were clear, people had to stay where they are. Also, their request does not under essential services.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-a-disease-hub-jamaat-defied-series-of-anti-covid-curbs/story-GbqN4E7Bz7whMXb9NSjumM.html
01-04-2020||India||ICMR plays down signs of community transmission||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has come under scrutiny over the past few days for its continued insistence that there is no community transmission of Covid-19 in India, and delays in approving testing kits, parameters for which have been set at absurdly high levels, according to many experts.The National Institute of Virology (NIV) was also taking far too long to evaluate the kits — delaying the entire testing process, which was only last week opened to private laboratories. ICMR eventually opened up six more testing sites to start clearing the backlog.On Tuesday, a day when the number of cases in India rose by 146 (and number of deaths by 3), Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head, division of epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR, defended the organisation’s stand on both. He maintained that there is no community transmission and that at the stage of the disease India is, it cannot afford to compromise on the parameters of the testing kits.Gangakhedkar explained that a recent Union health ministry document on transporting of positive patients mentioning “limited community transmission” was actually referring to localised transmissions that have erupted in certain pockets of the country that are still manageable.“We are nowhere close to being in community transmission. If there was community transmission then I wouldn’t be recommending healthy people to not wear a mask. There is an increase in number but it is not an alarming increase. Look at other countries that are reporting cases in thousands, that’s what community transmission is,” he said.ICMR has already expedited the process of evaluating test kits, Gangakhedkar said in an interview. Explaining the very exacting 100/100 (sensitivity/specificity) parameter for validating all new testing kits, he said: “This is because we don’t want to compromise on quality. At the initial stage of transmission, only foolproof testing is needed so as to pick up maximum true positive cases. We need highly sensitive and specific results; we don’t need any false negatives or false positives at this stage in the outbreak.”Sensitivity or true positive rate is a measure of the proportion of infected people correctly identified. Specificity or true negative rate is a measure of the proportion of uninfected people identified as uninfected. ICMR has said that only kits with 100% in both will be approved.“Even false positives and false negatives samples are used to check the kit’s ability whether it is able to pick up the results accurately or not,” said Gangakhedkar.However, ICMR has also said kits approved by the US FDA and European CE will be allowed — some of which do not follow the 100/100 parameter ICMR has set for new kits.“Even in these, we have recommended the best available ones to open up more options in case we need to scale up,” Gangakhedkar explained.It usually takes a couple of days for serological test (blood test) kits to be evaluated and kits based on polymerase chain reaction test evaluation may take four to five days, he said, adding that “since National Institute of Virology was overburdened there was some lag period in evaluating the kits, which is why we opened up other six sites to validate kits testing that has helped speed up the process.”Gangakhedkar said it was difficult to put a number to the infections at which it could be said that India was in the community transmission stage. “Before community transmission, there has to be focal transmission. Even with focal transmission, that we are seeing in India at the moment, if you are able to get to the source of transmission, and manage the cases.... There is no particular number or percentage as such after which you can say community transmission has occurred.”India’s approach of not testing more widely has come in for criticism, but even those countries that test widely started doing so only after there was community transmission, Gangakhedkar added. At that stage, he said, the strategy would be “aggressive containment measures, ... mapping of clusters, door-to-door surveys, and aggressive testing.”“Right now, we are testing about 4,000 to 5,000 people a day across the country. This is a very small number. My feeling is that Delhi alone should test about 3,000 people a day — this would include the contacts of those positive but also all the health care workers, ambulance drivers, anyone who comes in contact every few days. Now that we have the kits, we should be more liberal with testing. I think, by nature’s design, community transmission must have started – I would be very surprised if it hasn’t – the number of cases are likely to surge by next week,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, who heads the Delhi expert committee on Covid-19 management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-plays-down-signs-of-community-transmission/story-sSqwyC8PSOSgMBRDockWbM.html
01-04-2020||India||States scramble as pilgrims transgress||Officials across the country began a frantic search for thousands of people who had been to the headquarters of a religious group in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area that has now emerged as the single-biggest source of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections in the country, leading to at least eight deaths and 117 confirmed cases. The discovery of the hot spot at the six-storey building of the Tablighi Jamaat – called a markaz – triggered alarm in several circles of the government: the Delhi Police filed an FIR against functionaries of the centre for flouting social distancing rules, roughly a dozen states sounded an alert, and the Union government began the process to blacklist 275 foreign nationals belonging to the sect who purportedly flouted visa rules by claiming to be tourists.“So far about 2,137 people (who were at the centre) have been identified in different states. They are being medically examined and quarantined,” a senior official of the Union home ministry said on Tuesday, asking not to be named. The people quarantined and being searched for in the states are in addition to roughly 2,000 who were evacuated from the building since Sunday night and may have been exposed to the Sars-Cov-2 pathogen in the facility, where residents routinely dined and attended religious functions together.According to a health official in the Delhi administration, who asked not to be named, at least 400 among those who have been evacuated from the building since Sunday have been taken to hospitals with symptoms of the disease. They are being tested, this official said, adding that they are preparing for at least half of these symptomatic cases to be positive for the virus.Delhi health minister Satyender Jain said the gathering at the markaz flouted Delhi government’s orders. “The organisers have committed a grave crime. I have written a letter to LG (Lieutenant Governor) Anil Baijal to take strictest action against the organisers. We have given directions to the police to lodge an FIR as well,” Jain said, a day after the Delhi government ordered the filing of the first information report (FIR). The functionaries of the Tablighi Jamaat denied allegations of wrongdoing and said that their members routinely arrive for events that last 3-5 days, and that the people who were left behind in the facility were stranded by the lockdown announced last week. The largest cluster of cases that is linked to the mosque complex appears to be in the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. In Tamil Nadu, 50 of the 57 new Covid-19 cases confirmed on Tuesday had visited the complex earlier this month. At least 500 others were at the building and are being sought out.Andhra and Telangana together suspect nearly 2,000 may have visited the congregation in Delhi.Delhi banned on March 13 any seminar or conference having more than 200 people. Three days later, it prohibited any form of religious, academic, political, social, cultural, personal gathering involving over 50 people, and then gradually tightened the curbs in subsequent orders.Government officials said the attendees flouted all these orders, and also those issued on March 19 (prohibiting the gathering of not more than 20 people) and March 21 (prohibiting the gathering of four or more people). Then on March 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown in an unprecedented move that banned gatherings, and halted commercial rail and flight services.As the lockdown began, the police asked the organisers to close the markaz, according to government officials and a purported video recording of the conversation from March 23, released by news agency ANI. But they told police that they have asked the administration for approval to transport the visitors though they did not get it.Markaz Nizamuddin said it did not violate any provision of the law and offered its premises for setting up a quarantine facility. It also said it will cooperate with the authorities. HT contacted Mohammed Shoaib, spokesperson of the markaz, who did not respond to calls and text message seeking response on allegations that the organisation’s members had violated visa rules.The infections at Tablighi Jamaat came to light around March 25 when contact-tracing efforts in Telangana connected the markaz to the infections of 10 Indonesians who developed the disease and were hospitalised in Hyderabad. Six of those Indonesians have since succumbed to the disease.According to the Union home ministry official cited in the first instance, MHA wrote a letter to all states on March 28, asking them to trace all members of the organisation. The letter also refers to reports of foreign members who were visiting Tamil Naidu and Telangana testing positive, and flags the case of Indians who had travelled to a congregation in Malaysia last month. In Malaysia, the congregation was linked to 500 of the country’s 673 cases found till mid-March. The home ministry official said the arrivals of foreign nationals associated with the sect had begun on January 1, and about 2,100 of them visited India. Of these, around 216 were staying at the Nizamuddin-based TJ headquarters and 824 are believed to have dispersed to various parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-scramble-as-pilgrims-transgress/story-EMTdCz2be2TeSQDXmySAPN.html
01-04-2020||India||Govt cuts interest rate on PPF, NSC, Kisan Vikas Patra and Sukanya Samriddhi Accounts from April 1: All you need to know||The central government on Tuesday slashed interest rates on small savings schemes such as Senior Citizen Savings, Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC), Kisan Vikas Patra, Sukanya Samriddhi Accounts and Recurring Deposits in the range of 0.7% to 1.4% for the first quarter of 2020-21.The government has reduced interest rate on Senior Citizen Savings scheme from 8.6% to 7.4%, which will be effective from April 1, 2020 till the end of the first quarter on June 30, a finance ministry notification said.The interest rate of PPF has been reduced from 7.9% in the last quarter of previous financial year to 7.1% from for three months, it said. However, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), which is governed by a board of trustees, had on March 6, declared 8.5% interest rate for financial year 2019-20.Interest rates for small savings schemes are notified on a quarterly basis.The new interest rate for the girl child saving scheme Sukanya Samriddhi Account scheme in the first quarter of current financial year will now be 7.6% from 8.4% earlier.Interest rates on NSC have been reduced from 7.9% to 6.8% and Kisan Vikas Patra from 7.6% to 6.9%, the order said. “This has the approval of finance minister,” the notification said.After the reduction in interest rates, term deposits of 1-3 years will now fetch an interest rate of 5.5% from 6.9% applicable in the previous quarter, a reduction of 1.4%, the notification said.While the five-year term deposit will earn 6.7% from the current rate of 7.7%, the interest rate on five-year recurring deposit has been reduced sharply by 1.4%. The five-year recurring deposit will now fetch 5.8% interest instead of 7.2% in the previous quarter, it said.The interest rate on savings deposit has, however, been kept unchanged at 4%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-cuts-interest-rate-on-small-savings-schemes-for-q1-of-new-fiscal/story-WmeDldrZWgGbBpChmkxlPJ.html
01-04-2020||India||FRRO, immigration bureau probe irregularities||Organisations under the Union home ministry like the Bureau of Immigration and Foreigners Regional Registration Offices (FRROs) have a greater responsibility to monitor activities of foreign members of groups such as Tablighi Jamaat, people familiar with developments said on Tuesday.However, there is little that can be done by authorities if foreign nationals, including those who are part of a group, misrepresent the purpose of their visit to India, as was apparently done by Tablighi Jamaat members who came to India on tourist visas, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.“If members of even a large group apply individually for tourist visas and do not mention that the purpose of their visit is to join a congregation organised by a private entity, there is no possibility that anything can be done,” said a person who declined to be named.“Only if the persons are invited to events organised by Indian government entities or events that require clearance from the home ministry would Indian missions be brought into the loop. Then if the invitee applies for a tourist visa, he would be asked by the concerned mission to apply for a conference visa,” the person added.The people said the Bureau of Immigration and the FRROs have a greater role to play in scrutinising and monitoring the activities of groups such as the Tablighi Jamaat.They noted that members of the group that came for the congregation at Nizamuddin area of New Delhi should have applied for conference or missionary visas.Conference visas are granted to foreigners whose sole purpose for visiting India is to attend an international conference or seminar, and such events require prior clearance from the home ministry only if participants are from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Sudan. If a conference is being organised by a private organiser, the entity should forward complete details of the participants to the foreigners division of the home ministry 60 days before the event.Missionary visas are granted to foreigners whose sole purpose for visiting India is “missionary work not involving proselytization”, according to the home ministry’s rules. While there is a list of foreign missionary organisations recognised by the Indian government for such visas, there is apparently no similar list for Indian organisations.While the Bureau of Immigration has shared lists of those who came to India from abroad with state governments, there is no specific information on the Tablighi Jamaat members as they didn’t travel with conference or missionary visas. Following the New Delhi gathering, Covid-19 infections have been recorded among participants from Kashmir to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Weeks before the gathering in New Delhi, some 16,000 members of the Tablighi Jamaat had gathered for a four-day meet at a mosque outside Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia from February 21 to March 1. The gathering was joined by about 1,500 foreigners from a dozen countries.“Three weeks later, participants…had spread the coronavirus to half a dozen nations, creating the largest known viral vector in Southeast Asia,” The New York Times reported.More than 620 cases in Malaysia, most of the 73 cases in Brunei and 10 cases in Thailand were linked to that gathering, according to media reports. At least three coronavirus deaths have been linked to the event.Leading Malaysian jurist and scholar Mohammad Asri Zainul Abidin has questioned the apparent lackadaisical attitude among Jamaat members toward coming forward to be tested for the coronavirus.“The reason Allah sends his religion is for the well-being of the human being. The religion does not teach its followers to self-destruct,” he told Malaysia’s BenarNews.“There is [nothing] in the religion’s teachings that teaches about harming ourselves. [But] some members seemed to have failed in understanding this.”The Tablighi Jamaat had planned to hold another gathering at the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia during March 19-22 but this was cancelled at the last minute after a public outcry over Covid-19. More than 8,000 people who had already arrived for the event were put into quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/frro-immigration-bureau-probe-irregularities/story-Hc3ip4fSXgvNz2KTwnrGSJ.html
01-04-2020||India||Navy’s ventilator to help 6 at a time||As the country prepares to handle a rising number of cases and meet its need for ventilators, which about 5% of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients may require, the Indian navy has pitched in with an innovative ventilator design that can cater to six patients simultaneously.Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam, has manufactured this portable multi-feed oxygen manifold ventilator, the Navy said in a statement. “To cater to the requirement of oxygen supply for multiple patients during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, personnel from Naval Dockyard Visakhapatnam have designed an innovative ‘Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold(MOM)’ using a 6-way radial header fitted to a single cylinder. This innovation will enable one Oxygen Bottle to supply six patients concurrently thus enabling critical care management to a larger number of COVID patients with the existing limited resources,” the statement said. A typical oxygen providing facility at hospitals comprises an oxygen cylinder feeding only one patient through a Ventimask arrangement. “A need was therefore felt to design a suitable portable arrangement that could provide oxygen through masks to a number of needy patients using a single-cylinder during emergencies which is the need of the hour,” the statement added. The preliminary trials of the entire assembly were conducted at the naval dockyard, Visakhapatnam, followed by rapid trials at the Naval Hospital, INHS Kalyani, in which the portable MOM was successfully set up within 30 minutes.After successful trials, Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam, has started manufacturing 10 portable MOM with two 6-way radial headers, which can cater to 120 patients at makeshift locations, especially during the current Covid-19 pandemic.With close to 1200 cases having tested positive for Covid-19, India is ramping up its disease management capacity, and has already placed an order of 40,000 ventilators.A domestic manufacturer, Agva Healthcare in Noida, has been able to develop suitable ventilators and an order of 10,000 ventilators has been placed with the company. Supplies are expected to start by April 2. In addition, an order for 30,000 ventilators has been placed on Bharat Electronics Limited, which is going to collaborate with domestic manufacturers. Indian auto manufacturers are also preparing to manufacture ventilators.Separate orders are also being placed by states to procure more ventilators in case numbers surge.“…the government is taking all necessary measures to ensure there is no shortfall of necessary equipment,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-s-ventilator-to-help-6-at-a-time/story-zShfvHPGOlK2jb3kfW0GcN.html
01-04-2020||India||Supreme Court concerned over ‘fake news’ on Covid-19||Media should maintain a strong sense of responsibility, while disseminating news on coronavirus and should ensure that unverified and fake news is not published, the Supreme Court said on Tuesday after the central government drew the court’s attention to the possibility of people panicking due to “fake” and “inaccurate reporting” of news connected with Covid-19.Media should refer to and publish the official version about developments regarding coronavirus threat, the court said, while maintaining that it does not intend to interfere with the “free discussion” about the pandemic.“We expect the media (print, electronic or social) to maintain a strong sense of responsibility and ensure that unverified news capable of causing panic is not disseminated. We do not intend to interfere with the free discussion about the pandemic, but direct the media refer to and publish the official version about the developments”, the order passed by the court read.The apex court was hearing two petitions, one by advocates Rashmi Bansal and Anuj Gupta and another by advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, that brought the issue of plight of migrant labourers to the notice of the court.The court , on Monday, asked the centre to submit a status report regarding the same. The government, pursuant to the court’s order, filed a detailed affidavit on Tuesday explaining the steps taken by it to combat the Covid-19 threat.In the affidavit by Home Secretary, Ajay Kumar Bhalla, the centre had also prayed that directions should be issued by the court to the print, electronic and social media to not publish anything without first ascertaining the factual position by way of a mechanism provided by the central government.“Any deliberate or unintended fake or inaccurate reporting either in electronic, print, or social media and particularly web portals has a serious and inevitable potential of causing panic amongst large sections of the society”, the affidavit stated.The bench of Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde and justice L Nageswara Rao underscored the need to prevent spread of incorrect information through social media platforms. It also noted that the migration of large number of labourers working in the cities was triggered by panic created by fake news that the lockdown would continue for more than three months. “Such panic driven migration has caused untold suffering to those who believed and acted on such news. It is therefore not possible for us to overlook this menace of fake news either by electronic, print or social media”, the court said in its order.In a bid to combat spread of fake news, the court directed the central government to publish a daily bulletin through all media avenues including social media platforms.“Centre’s prayer (to restrain media) is absolutely absurd. Controlling fake news is one thing while having pre-censorship is another thing. They are effectively saying that whatever the government says is the only version This prayer by centre is virtually a plea for pre-censorship of media and is unknown to any democracy”, said Mahesh Menon who teaches law at Daksha Fellowship.The Centre in its affidavit said that while action can be taken by authorities against those crating panic under the Disaster Management Act, a direction from the court will go a long way in mitigating any potential damage resulting from a false alarm. “Of course, a framework is currently in place under the Disaster Management Act but it is not in negation of Constitutional or fundamental rights. Article 19 (1)(a) which guarantees freedom of speech and expression is still very much in place. Part of the reason why things got out of control in China was there was no free media there and the state officially tried to suppress the information and facts”, Menon added.The court’s order does specifically mention that it will not interfere in “free discussion of the pandemic” but it also asks that the media “refer” to and “publish” the “official version about the developments.” It wasn’t immediately clear what this would entail. For instance, almost all state governments put out official bulletins with the number of confirmed cases and deaths , but the dashboard of the ministry of health and family welfare updates this with a significant lag. The Centre also informed the court that large-scale exodus of migrants, mostly daily wage labourers, was under control and that most of them have been taken to government shelters. According to the status report submitted by the centre, 666,291 persons have been provided shelters and 2,288,279 persons have been provided food.“I have instructions to state that no one is now on the road. Anyone who was outside has been taken to the available shelters,” solicitor general Tushar Mehta, the Centre’s second senior-most law officer, told the courtThe court recorded the submissions of the centre and expressed hope that all authorities will comply with the directives, advisories and orders issued by the union government.The hearing on Tuesday also included steps to be taken to avoid panic among residents of shelter homes. The central government suggested roping in the services of trained counsellors, and religious and community leaders, to counsel those lodged in shelter homes, a suggestion which the court accepted.The countrywide lockdown, which began on March 25, led to an exodus of labourers from large cities to their homes in distant towns and villages of other states. The situation was particularly dire in Delhi over the weekend, when tens of thousands crowded the Anand Vihar bus terminal in East Delhi to travel parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Many of them violated the lockdown and set out on foot along with their families.In its affidavit, the government said that there is an institutional response monitored at the highest political and executive level, led by the Prime Minister.“Indian government gave an institutional response to the management of Covid-19 most scientifically and methodically. The situation was monitored at the highest political and executive level by the Hon’ble Prime Minister”, the affidavit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-concerned-over-fake-news-on-covid-19/story-6q1uVSTcXwmwJmLNHummGL.html
01-04-2020||India||UP officials race to identify 157 at Jamaat gathering||Uttar Pradesh put all districts on high alert and launched a drive to identify 157 people confirmed to have attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi earlier this month.“We are not releasing the figures but most of people from UP who visited the religious gathering in Delhi’s Nizamuddin are still in Delhi. Only few of them had returned to UP and they are being examined and their entire track record is being maintained,” additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi, said over phone.A senior state police official said on condition of anonymity that the list of 157 people had at least 28 people from Muzaffarnagar, 18 from Lucknow, 15 from Barabanki, 12 from Bijnor and 11 from Prayagraj. Also, the list contained eight people each from Varanasi and Meerut, seven from Saharanpur and six each from Ghaziabad and Sitapur, four from Baghpat, three each from Agra, Shamli and Pratapgarh, two each from Mathura, Hapur and Gonda and one each from Bahraich, Bhadohi and Balrampur.The officer said the district police chiefs were directed to immediately get medical examination of these people done and admit the Covid-19 infected to isolated wards. He said efforts were on to trace people who had come in contact with these 157 people. Abrar Ahmad, a Lucknow resident who attended the Delhi event, said, “I was contacted by the Delhi officials on Monday. They asked my address besides inquiring about my health and if I had any flu-like symptoms.”Later in the day, state minister Mohsin Raza urged clerics and preachers who had participated in the Jamaat to identify themselves and inform the district administration about their identity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-officials-race-to-identify-157-at-jamaat-gathering/story-8ticpwXXKJUS1zN1puRfQM.html
01-04-2020||India||50 Jamaat congregation attendees test positive in TN, 515 put under quarantine||Of the 57 new people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday, 50 had travelled to New Delhi and attended the religious conference organised by the Tablighi Jamaat in mid-March in the densely populated area of Nizammuddin, which has emerged over the last two days as a coronavirus disease hub that has left several states scrambling to find potential patients and spreaders.All of the 50 attendees — 22 from Tirunelveli, 18 from Namakkal, four from Kanyakumari, three from Villupuram, two from Madurai and one from Thoothukudi — have been placed under isolation at government medical college hospitals in their respective districts. They are all reportedly stable.“There were 1,500 persons from Tamil Nadu who attended a conference [the Tablighi Jamaat held] in Delhi recently. Out of them, 1,130 returned to Tamil Nadu. The rest of them stayed behind in New Delhi. Of the 1,130 that returned to the state, we have identified 515 across several districts... Out of these only, we have had a number of positive cases today,” Beela Rajesh, the state health secretary said at a press conference on Tuesday. All the 515 people were put under quarantine. “I would like to make a sincere appeal to each and every member who attended the same conference in Delhi, in your own interest and in the interest of your family and community, to please come forward and declare yourself so that we can help you, we can cure you and we can ensure that your family members don’t suffer and the entire community and state doesn’t suffer,” she added.State authorities were first alerted to the possibility of a larger spread emanating from New Delhi’s Nizamuddin area after a 54-year-old man, referred to as Patient 12, died in Madurai on March 25. He is reported to have come in contact with preachers who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat. Three of his family members also tested positive for the virus. HT could not independently verify this information.In Erode, which has emerged as one of the biggest clusters in the state, a group of preachers who attended the Jamaat reportedly reached the city on March 11. Ten of them later tested positive for Covid-19. The data with the TN state control office indicates that on March 30, Erode had 24 cases — the highest in the state — with 889 people under home quarantine for a 28-day period.The spread of the virus within Tamil Nadu was also likely triggered by Patient 5 and Patient 6 – both Thai nationals — who are admitted to the IRT Perundurai Medical College in Erode after testing positive for Covid-19. With Tuesday’s new cases, the number of Covid-19 affected persons in the state now stands at 124. At least 60 of the confirmed cases had attended the conference.According to the government officials, many of the attendees who have been traced are spread over several districts, including Chennai, Erode, Tiruchi, Ariyalur, Pudukottai, Erode and Nagapattinam, among others. Contact tracing of primary contacts of these attendees, and those still in Delhi, is underway. Of the remaining cases confirmed on Tuesday — those who did not attend the conference — one was a 43-year-old man who had travelled to Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, another was a 28-year-old man from Thiruvannamalai who is a co-worker of another patient who tested positive. There were also four persons from Chennai who did not have any travel history.“All the patients are stable and in hospital isolation,” a statement released by the state earlier on Tuesday said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-jamaat-congregation-attendees-test-positive-in-tn-515-put-under-quarantine/story-DgUlafDPuGrIouuHjCSReL.html
01-04-2020||India||Islamic missionary at centre of India’s Covid-19 outbreak||By early March, coronavirus disease (Covid-19 )cases were surging across the world. In India, where their number had just begun to rise, there was an air of caution though a lockdown was still several days away. Ignoring the pandemic, an estimated 2,500 Sunni Muslim men belonging to several nationalities, each identically dressed in a white gown and skullcap, checked into a five-storey establishment called Markaz in Delhi’s Nizammudin area, part of a yearly routine. Markaz is a clearing house for these committed teams of Islamic missionaries, known as the Tablighi Jamaat. Individual missions are small, consisting of four or five men, each booked on flights and trains to various states and countries. The building isn’t a mosque. It’s a facility with bare dormitories. “It’s actually a transit point, where logistics are planned,” said Navaid Hamid, president of the All-India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushwarat, a social organisation of the community.The authorities now fear the Markaz waypoint has become a coronavirus transmission hub, with 24 preachers testing positive in Delhi alone between Sunday and Monday.The Markaz facility is also known as the global headquarters of Tablighi Jamaat, a preaching movement founded in 1927 by Maulana Mohd Ilyas in Haryana’s Mewat. Tablighi Jamaat (Arabic for “group that propagates faith”) is one of the most widespread missionary movements in Islam globally but seeks to be low-profile. It is not a sect in itself. Members often describe the Tablighi Jamaat to be non-political, committed to nothing more than goading Muslims into following Islamic precepts. Participation is purely voluntary, and most members belong to professional occupations. “Our groups aren’t large. We can’t afford it. It’s at best three or four,” said Syed Irfan Malik, a resident of old Delhi, who travelled to Malaysia and Indonesia in 2017 as a preacher.Preachers usually stay in mosques and lecture people. They usually carry nothing more than foodstuff, sleeping bags, and cooking stoves.One key task is to make non-conformist Muslims ”return” to the faith. The missionaries frequently quote from the Quran, highlighting passages that speak of certainty of hellish punishment for sinners and rewards for the virtuous. Positive coronavirus cases among these preachers have set off alarm bells now, but the organisation contends its members were trapped because of the lockdown. The authorities made no arrangement to evacuate them in time, it said in a statement. “On March 21, 2020, a large group of visitors who had to depart by railways got stuck in the Markaz premises. On March 22, 2020, the Janata Curfew was observed and visitors were advised not to venture out until 9pm,” the statement said.According to the Markaz’s statement, on 24th March 2020, a notice was issued by the police, seeking closure of the premises. “The same was responded to on 24th March 2020, stating the compliance of the directions regarding closure of Markaz is already underway,” it said. However, a day before the notice, on March 23, around 1,500 preachers had already managed to leave for various destinations, leaving around 1,000 visitors “belonging to different states and nationalities inside the Markaz”, the organisation said.There were, however, at least three other Delhi government orders that the organisation appears to have violated -- on March 11, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal curtailed all gatherings to 200 people; on March 16, he brought this down to 20 and banned all religious gatherings; and on March 21, the Delhi government further brought down the limit on gatherings to five.A few of the preachers who left before the lockdown kicked in March 25 started developing symptoms, such as a temperature and cough, but nobody thought of the possibility of getting the coronavirus disease, a member of the Markaz said. Members continued to be locked up in cramped quarters because of the lockdown.Tablighi Jamaat has no central administrative structure and its activities are coordinated by volunteers. Without this, there were no general guidelines on Covid-19. An administrator of the Markaz house, however said: “During this entire episode, Markaz Nizamuddin never violated any provision of law. It did not let them (preachers) violate medical guidelines.”“Why did the authorities fail to move out the preachers to government quarantine facilities? Why were foreigners not separated from Indian nationals? The local magistrate should be sacked,” said Hamid of the Majlis-e-Mushwarat.Since the 9/11 attacks, the group has been under scrutiny everywhere, including in India, because members of terror outfits have been found to disguise themselves as Tablighi Jamaat members. “This is a conspiracy against us. Coronavirus is worrying but Allah will guard us,” said Malik, the former Tablighi Jamaat member quoted above.“The authorities seem to have failed to check the Markaz establishment for crowds because it is known to be filled with preachers in transit year round. It missed their radar,” Mohammed Akramuddin, a retired customs officer who resides in the area said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/islamic-missionary-at-centre-of-india-s-covid-19-outbreak/story-bS1Quwn15rD7MPUWF7KF8K.html
01-04-2020||India||PM relief funds to complement each other||The 72-year-old Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) has company -- the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM-CARES) fund, which was launched in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. The former has won a reputation as a well-managed entity that, while caring for the needy in times of distress, also made prudent investments. Both PMNRF and the PM-CARES are public trusts recognized as such under income tax laws; donations to both are tax-deductible under Section 80(G) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. And both funds can be used by the Prime Minister of India at his discretion.Established in 1948 by India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to assist people displaced from Pakistan after partition, PMNRF’s resources are to be used to “render immediate relief to families of those killed in natural calamities like floods, cyclones and earthquakes, etc. and to the victims of the major accidents and riots.” This clear set of purposes for which PMNRF can be used perhaps underlines the need for the creation of a separate fund to provide relief to those affected by the coronavirus or find themselves in similar situations of distress in the future.A quick look at PMNRF’s accounts over the years shows that it expenses are primarily under three heads: medical bills, natural calamity relief and ex-gratia payments for riot or accident victims.To increase its corpus, PMNRF also invests heavily in the debt market .According to its last available receipts and payments account, PMNFRF as of March 31, 2019 had a cash balance of Rs 1467.5 crore in banks. In financial year (FY) 2018-19, it invested Rs 250 crore in fixed deposits with IDFC Bank and also Rs 1301.3 crore in state development loans (SDLs) ,which are debt instruments issued by states to raise money.Between FY 2009-10 and FY 2018-19, PMNRF earned Rs 1,959 crore in the form of interest and dividends on its investments.In FY 2018-19, PMNRF paid Rs.160.8 crore of medical bills and disbursed Rs 51.6 crore towards ex-gratia payments to victims of accidents or riots.It also spent Rs 7.32 lakh on postage charges, as thousands of letters are despatched to beneficiaries and hospitals or other institutions.In FY18-19, PMNRF received Rs 534.2 crore in public donations, more than double the donations of Rs 236 crore in the previous year. An analysis of available data from 2009-10 to 2018-19 shows that the fund received its highest donation (Rs 608.6 crore) in FY 2014-15 when Narendra Modi came to power.During this National Democratic Alliance (NDA) era, the fund has been used for providing financial help to victims of acid attacks, floods, landslides and rail accidents. In 2009, it was also used for rehabilitation of some people affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami . In 2004, the PMNRF was used to provide relief to families affected by ethnic violence in Assam. A large part of the fund is used to pay the medical bills of poor people.While the financial results of the PMNRF for the current year will be made availably only after March, it started the current financial year with a total balance of Rs 486 crore in cash.HT spoke to two former officials who have handled the PMNRF is earlier regimes. Both said that it followed strict protocols on spending and top Prime Minister’s Office officials are often allowed to take decisions on behalf of the PM.One official maintained that a new fund was needed to pay for Covid-19 relief efforts because PMNRF funds are earmarked for other exigencies. The other official differed and said PMNRF could have been used for coronavirus relief efforts as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-relief-funds-to-complement-each-other/story-3SYDLlMgodRiP4DCYdmdRL.html
01-04-2020||India||17 Indian evacuees from Iran infected||As many as 17 Indian evacuees from Iran have tested positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) at the army’s two quarantine facilities in Rajasthan and admitted to hospitals in Jaisalmer and Jodhpur, two officials said on Tuesday on condition of anonymity. They are among 1,036 people evacuated from Iran in batches from March 15 and put under quarantine in Jaisalmer and Jodhpur. Of the 17 tested positive, nine are in Jaisalmer and the remaining eight in Jodhpur. Another evacuee in Jaisalmer tested positive a fortnight ago.Iran is one of the world’s hardest-hit countries from the virus. It reported 123 more deaths on Sunday alone.The officials said the preliminary screening of all evacuees was conducted at airports before they were moved to the quarantine facilities. The army calls the quarantine centres wellness facilities created under Operation Namaste.The armed forces operate six quarantine facilities across the country at Hindan, Manesar, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Ghatkopar and Chennai.Five hospitals run by the armed forces are equipped to carry out Covid-19 tests and six more would be added to the list soon. The armed forces have earmarked 28 service hospitals for managing Covid-29 cases.The army is an important institutional pillar in the country’s fight against the pandemic. It is also taking aggressive steps to tackle the spread of the disease within its ranks. Two soldiers, including an army doctor, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-indian-evacuees-from-iran-infected/story-5hNeHq90MfgONqfNPoQi0K.html
01-04-2020||India||Test results delayed, labs struggle with sample load||India may claim to be testing only at about 36% of its capacity, but government laboratories testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) seem to be already burdened by the sample load, with many hospitals saying that the lag time for receiving test results has increased to three days.“The time that it takes for a lab to return test results has definitely gone up; earlier the results would be back the next day but now it’s been three days and we haven’t received the reports yet,” a senior administrator at a prominent private hospital in Delhi said on condition of anonymity.The 130 functional government laboratories across India have tested 42,788 samples so far, of which 4,346 were tested on Monday alone. Of the 49 private labs approved for testing, 399 tests were conducted on Monday, and in total these chains have done about 14,00 tests since they were allowed to test, starting on March 21.“Most of our laboratories are quick to send out results; it was taking time earlier when National Institute of Virology was the main lab doing confirmatory tests but things have improved now. If any particular lab is taking time then it should be seen as an isolated case, not a norm,” said Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, chief of the epidemiology division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). All laboratories performing Covid-19 tests have a capacity of conducting 13,000 tests per day. The 49 private chains have around 16,000 collection centres. The government is also procuring more testing kits, including rapid test kits from Singapore that are expected to arrive by this weekend (April 5).Some states such as Kerala have already procured the rapid testing kits that have been validated by the ICMR to begin surveillance to know the extent of disease spread within the state.The government has also placed an order for more test kits, including rapid kits, also known as point-of-care kits. An expression of interest was initially sent out by the ICMR for one million antibody kits, which later had to be revised to 500,000 kits because of a shortage in supply world over.However, rapid kits are not the best way to diagnose a disease -- they track antibodies, which means they can only diagnose a person if antibodies are present in his system (this is usually well after the infection sets in). This also means they will identify people who have been infected in the past -- because the antibodies tend to remain in the system. “These kits are meant mainly for surveillance or research purposes in epidemiological studies. For diagnostic purposes PCR-based tests are preferred,” said Dr Gangakhedkar. PCR stands for polymerase chain reactionApart from the lag time in laboratory testing results, the ministry is also taking time in updating the daily tally of cases and deaths on its dashboard. “I don’t think there is any lag time as we usually update our data on a daily basis. If in the past sometimes there has been some delay in updating the data, it is because we have to independently verify every single case with their actual address to assign the state and begin contact tracing. At times, the address on the passport is different from where the person lives, and we have to be accurate” says Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry.The reporting of data also entails filling up of different forms in details and that usually takes long, especially now that the positive cases are increasing. “Despite the rising numbers, our data entry operates are working very hard to ensure all details are documented as early as possible, and with precision,” added Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/test-results-delayed-labs-struggle-with-sample-load/story-tVqCf5Zg0mhvfuQ7VaZvdO.html
01-04-2020||India||TB vaccine appears to offer protection against Covid-19||The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine to prevent tuberculosis, which has been given to Indian children since 1949, and which around 97% of the 26 million Indian children born every year received last year, appears to offer protection against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to US researchers who analysed the wide variation in the intensity of the disease in different countries. It also helps lower cases of Covid-19 in a country, the researchers found. The study, which will need large scale clinical testing, could, if it holds, explain why the spread of Covid-19 has been muted in India. The new study, by researchers at the biomedical sciences department, NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine at the New York Institute of Technology found Covid-19 cases and deaths are higher in countries that do not have or have discontinued universal BCG vaccination of children, such as the US, Italy, Spain and France, compared to countries with universal and long-standing immunisation policies, such as India and China.Covid-19 cases and deaths in the United States, Italy and Spain have outpaced China, which was the epicentre of the outbreak that was first detected in Wuhan city in early December.BCG vaccination significantly reduced deaths from Covid-19, with the strongest reductions in countries that established a BCG vaccination policy earlier, found the study, published in the preprint health sciences server, medRxiv. The BCG vaccination benefits held after factoring in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure.The study found a direct correlation between how early the policy was established and the elderly population that would be protected. “Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy, such as Iran in 1984, also had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also found that BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported Covid-19 cases in a country,” said the study titled “Correlation between universal BCG vaccination policy and reduced morbidity and mortality for Covid-19: an epidemiological study”.The study recommends BCG vaccination as a potential new tool in the fight against Covid-19.India started BCG vaccination of children in 1949, and currently 97% of 26 million children born in India receive the BCG vaccine free. India’s universal immunisation programme, under which the BCG vaccine is given, went up to the current figure of 97%, according to the ministry of health and family welfare data, up from 92% in 2015-16, as was recorded by the National Family of Health Survey 4. It is manufactured in India, and costs less than Rs 100 per vial in the private sector.“BCG coverage is highest among all vaccines given to children under five years under the universal immunisation programme. It’s given to newborn babies at birth, or up to one year if vaccination is missed at birth,” said Dr Pradeep Haldar, deputy commissioner (immunisation), ministry of health and family welfare. Vaccination is above 95% across all states, including the empowered action states with universal immunisation coverage of less than 85%.BCG vaccine contains a live, weakened strain of Mycobacterium bovis, a cousin of M. tuberculosis, which is the bacteria that causes tuberculosis.“The BCG vaccine is an immunomodulator that boosts immune response to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. Even more protective is a vaccine from Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), which has been isolated and sequenced in India at the National Institute of Immunology. It’s approved for use against leprosy and septicaemia, and PGI Chandigarh recently evaluated its translational application as an immunotherapeutic against severe acute respiratory syndrome (a coronavirus like Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19). The results have been sent for publication,” said Dr NK Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research.Australia, Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom have already announced that they will begin large-scale human trials to see whether BCG vaccination protects health workers from Covid-19 by triggering an immune response to reduce symptoms, prevent severe illness or prevent infection. Australia announced on Friday that it will begin BCG vaccine trials with around 4,000 physicians and nurses, who are at higher risk of becoming infected with the respiratory disease than the general population, and in older persons, who are at higher risk of serious illness.Netherlands has recruited around 1,000 health care workers in eight Dutch hospitals to either receive the BCG vaccine or a placebo.“BCG vaccination produces non-specific immune effects that have been shown to boost response against non-mycobacterial pathogens, and using it to improving innate immunity against Covid-19 would buy time to develop a specific vaccine against the disease,” said a scientist from the Indian Council for Medical Research who spoke on condition of anonymity.BCG vaccination significantly increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically IL-1B, which play a vital role in antiviral immunity.“BCG vaccination has been shown to produce broad protection against viral infections and sepsis, raising the possibility that the protective effect of BCG may be associated co-occurring infections and sepsis-related deaths,” said Dr Ganguly.The broad use of the BCG vaccine across a population could reduce the number of carriers, and combined with other measures, could act to slow down or stop the spread of Covid-19, according to the US study.The study answers why Covid-19 spread in China despite children getting BCG vaccinated since the 1950’s. “During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), tuberculosis prevention and treatment agencies were disbanded and weakened. We speculate that this could have created a pool of potential hosts that would be affected by and spread Covid-19,” said the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tb-vaccine-appears-to-offer-protection-against-covid-19/story-lHholAkFWyOW5HSWI3A4zM.html
01-04-2020||India||Long-term containment measures key as Covid-19 cases may rise after lockdown: Study||India needs to urgently think of long-term infection containment measures because the ongoing 21-day national lockdown is unlikely to be enough to reverse the rapid rise in Covid-19 cases and rate of transmission (although it will help), a new study has suggested.The paper, based on mathematical modelling of disease and demographic data by two researchers at the University of Cambridge, also concludes that old people in India are at particular risk of contracting the infection at home – more than global hotspots such as China and Italy – because of the high number of three-generational households in the country.The finding comes amidst a debate on whether the hard lockdown should be extended with the government clarifying on Monday that it had no immediate plans to impose further curbs beyond April 15.But that may be a mistake, the study suggested.In their analysis, the researchers found that while a 21-day lockdown led to an immediate decrease in the number of infected people, the number rose sharply after the curbs were lifted. A second scenario in which a 28-day lockdown was imposed after five days of easing also showed that the number of infected people rose once the second lockdown was lifted.But in two scenarios, the rate of new infections decreased. The first was a protocol of three consecutive lock downs of 21 days, 28 days and 18 days spaced with five days of suspension. If a single lockdown had to achieve the same impact, it would have to last 49 days, the modelling showed.“While these numbers are hypothetical, it underlines the need to think of different strategies of containment after 21 days of lockdown. It also shows that the rate of rise of infection is steeper than the rate of decrease and it takes less time for infections to double and more time for it to halve,” said Ronojoy Adhikari, one of the authors of the paper.“This essentially means that for every day of non-lockdown, we need more than one day of lockdown,” he addedThe paper, slated to be published in the Physical Review Research Journal, noted two big differences between India and other global hotspots such as China and Italy: the big numbers of three-generational families residing in the same homes and the large number of young people.Secondly, the model also showed that unlike Italy and China, the above-60 population and the below-30 population were in close contact at homes. Because the former demographic is high-risk for Covid-19, it made the home very important for anti-infection policy.“This indicated that social distancing and isolation protocols are not just for workplaces and public spaces, but also for homes. Because of India’s huge youth population, they are at greater probability of contracting the disease, and then bringing them into homes and transmitting it to older people, who have high fatality risk,” said Adhikari.The authors suggested three long-term responses: Social distancing and isolation to be practised in homes, especially by older people; a close watch on schools and colleges to check for young people catching the disease; and extensive testing to find out the extent of the outbreak.“We suggest that even when the national lockdown is over, we need to look at keeping schools and colleges shut for some time. Or look at local lockdowns in hotspots, determined by extensive testing,” Adhikari added.The study has made two important assumptions: that all cases of Covid-19 are symptomatic, and that the impact of the lockdown is instantaneous without any lag in implementation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-term-containment-measures-key-as-cases-may-rise-after-lockdown-says-study/story-78QNbNhiiqjszHhpbd8pBP.html
01-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Genesis of India’s biggest coronavirus hot spot||On March 25 as Indians woke up to the first day of a three-week lockdown to stave off the Covid-19 epidemic, disease surveillance officials in the national capital had just begun uncovering a problem that would soon turn into an epidemiological headache spanning 19 states: hundreds of members of a religious sect may have already taken the infection to far reaches of the country, sharing flights, buses, trains and community events even before the country could be shut down. Tips about an infection hotspot at the Tablighi Jamaat’s Nizamuddin headquarters began trickling in to the Delhi Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme office that week, leading the district surveillance officer (DSO) to dispatch a team on March 26. Six people were found with symptoms at the building, isolated and sent for testing. Click here for complete coronavirus coverageOn March 29, the six were confirmed as having Covid-19. A day later, the number grew to 24. The reports of the 441 people from the Markaz suspected to have the disease are still awaited. IMPORTED INFECTION?The origin of the infection in the sect possibly goes back to February 27, when 16,000 members began a congregation at the Sri Petaling mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Over four days, hundreds of worshippers prayed shoulder-to-shoulder inside a mosque complex similar to the one in Nizamuddin, while some guests posted selfies as they shared food, social posts from the event would later show. Among the attendees were those from China and South Korea -- two countries with high rates of coronavirus infections at the time. Two weeks later, Malaysia’s cases grew to nearly 670 -- 500 of these had been at the congregation, known as an Ijtema. As the foreign attendees headed back home, Brunei confirmed 50 cases linked to the gathering, Singapore identified five, Cambodia 13 and Thailand at least two.Around the same time, in mid-March, Indonesia cancelled a Tablighi Jamaat Ijtema, but not before thousands had already gathered on the Sulawei islands.In India, officials are now drawing connections to cases in these countries. According to immigration data accessed by HT, at least 227 foreigners were among the estimated 8,000 who had been at the Nizamuddin headquarters in March – overlapping with other visitors in the six-storey, hostel-like facility with common cooking and dining facilities.These foreigners included people from Malaysia and Indonesia (where large crowds had already gathered) and China, where infections had by then been widespread.A significant number of the international arrivals took place around March 10, according to officials in the Delhi Police. It wasn’t until later that the Indian government made quarantine mandatory for arrivals from China (March 13) and banned flights from Malaysia (March 17).Some of the people who arrived, either with the infection or were subsequently infected at the building in Nizamuddin, began travelling before the outbreak turned into a serious crisis for India. It is these people whose illness would later connect back to the building in Nizamuddin as disease surveillance officers in several states started separately sounding out their Delhi counterparts.THE INDONESIAN GROUPThe most important alert came from Telangana, where officials found a group of 10 Indonesians who had boarded the Andhra Pradesh Sampark Kranti in Delhi on March 13 to arrive at Ramagundam in Telangana the following day. From there, they group went to Karimnagar in autorickshaws, took part in an Ijtema a day later and spent nights at a local madarsa. Around March 16, some of their local associates noticed their symptoms – bringing to light what would be the earliest confirmed case linked to the Tablighi Jamaat’s Delhi centre.According to a health official aware of the contact tracing, the alerts were sent to the Delhi IDSP between March 20 and 24. “Our surveillance officers went to the Nizamuddin area last week to investigate after we received reports from several states that the people who tested positive there had a history of travel to the area. That’s when we discovered that there were so many people living in the compound and started screening them for symptoms,” said an official from Delhi IDSP cell. Another alert was sent from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh around the same time when a 52-year-old man tested positive; he had been at the Delhi building.In all, six of the approximately 12 people linked to the Tablighi Jamaat have succumbed to the infection in Hyderabad.“It was rigorous contact tracing exercise conducted by the Telangana government for a section of cases reported in their state that led to the zeroing-in on the infection source in Delhi. It was followed up here and the cluster was discovered,” said the official cited above, asking not to be named. KASHMIRI PREACHERThe second alert came from Kashmir. On March 25, a 65-year-old preacher who tested positive for Covid-19 succumbed to his illness in Srinagar. When health department officials worked back his travel history, they found that he had left the Tablighi building on March 9 after staying there for two days.The man then went to Deoband (March 9-11) – a town considered as being historically linked to the Jamaat – before travelling to Samba (March 12-16) and finally reaching Srinagar, where he was based and was known as a prominent Islamic preacher. According to officials, it was his reputation as a prominent preacher that came to attention when he died, triggering alerts that were sent to Delhi as well as Uttar Pradesh.ANDAMAN ISLANDSOn March 24, the day before the domestic flight ban kicked in, a man in his late 20s reached Port Blair and started showing symptoms for the disease. The individual tested positive on Sunday, triggering the contact-tracing exercise that placed him at the building in Nizamuddin a week ago.Routinely, officials alert their counterparts in other states if the contact-tracing determines that a Covid-19 patient was in close vicinity to others. According to disease surveillance official, he took a flight with a stopover at Kolkata. At least one other person who was with him on the flight has also tested positive.(With inputs from Reuters).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/genesis-of-india-s-biggest-hot-spot/story-uNnkA8Rb5ZJlUJ9meXhIPN.html
01-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: ICMR nod to 3 more private testing labs, total 29 now||New Delhi The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s apex biomedical research body, on Wednesday approved three more private laboratories to test for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), taking to 29 the number of private facilities that can collect samples at 16,000 centres.ICMR, however, has not expanded its criteria for people to be able to take the test. Experts have raised concerns over tests not being carried out aggressively or randomly enough, saying that a ramped up approach could stop a silent spread of the highly contagious pathogen SARS-CoV-2.“These 29 lab chains will add to the testing capacity as they have 16,000 collection sites across India,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry.On Wednesday, ICMR asked for bids for procurement of antibody (blood test) kits to scale up their testing. Through the day, sample collection and testing was slow because kits were in short supply and traffic movement was restricted due to a nationwide lockdown.“We’ve got the government approval and have the infrastructure and trained manpower in place. All we need now is an uninterrupted supply of diagnostic kits for us to begin testing,” said Dr Navin Dang, founder Dr Dangs Lab.Arindam Haldar, CEO, SRL Diagnostics, said: “…ICMR has chosen two SRL clinical reference labs, based at Mumbai and Gurgaon, to conduct these tests… We have initiated testing, but currently there is a shortage situation for approved commercial kits for testing and PPE for sample collection, and we are trying our level best to bring the supply situation to match possible demand... The commercial kits are in short supply...” However, ICMR has so far approved of three commercial testing kits that should be available in market in a few days.Neuberg Diagnostics Private Limited, a start-up in the segment, has also been approved for testing. “…Neuberg will be scaling up its capacity up to 2,000 to 2,500 tests per day as per ICMR guidelines by next week,” said GSK Velu, chairman and managing director.ICMR is in the process of fast-tracking approvals for commercial testing kits. “Our nodal laboratory in National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune is looking at the quality of kits… Apart from FDA and European CE approved kits, ICMR-certified kits will also be eligible to be used for testing in labs across India,” Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR, said recently.ICMR on Sunday had confirmed that close to 60 private laboratories had approached them for registration that is mandatory for being able to conduct Covid-19 tests.The primary criteria for the labs that will be approved is for them to have National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration accreditation, at least biosafety level-2 laboratory, sharing real-time testing data with the government and testing done only after there is a prescription signed by a qualified physician who has followed testing criteria laid down by the ICMR.There are about 116 government laboratories that ICMR has earmarked for Covid-19 testing, including 72 of ICMR’s own viral research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDLs). Thirty-one of the government laboratories have so far been approved for both preliminary and confirmatory testing across India.The base price should not exceed Rs 4,500, including 1,500 for preliminary testing and 3,000 was confirmatory testing, even though the government has asked the labs to offer the test for free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-nod-to-3-more-pvt-testing-labs-total-29-now/story-YjqLFWjm0h2mHFBmco89UJ.html
