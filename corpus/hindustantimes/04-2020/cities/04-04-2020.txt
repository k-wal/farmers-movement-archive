04-04-2020||City||Covid-19: Punjab announces Rs 50 lakh insurance for cops, sanitation workers||Chandigarh The Punjab government on Saturday announced Rs 50 lakh insurance cover to its police personnel and sanitation workers engaged in the front-lines in fighting covid-19. This follows the Centre’s decision to provide a similar cover to health workers. In an emergency meeting that chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh chaired through video conferencing, the cabinet also authorised its procurement committee for covid-19 to make all purchases for management of the outbreak on an urgent basis. The committee has been authorised to make spot purchases and exigency procurement, bypassing normal procedure, in exercise of powers under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005. The cabinet also allowed this committee to buy essential and emergent medical items at prevalent market prices, as these has risen substantially, due to widespread demand. The cabinet decided that licences of private hospitals denying treatment to covid patients would be cancelled. The health department informed the cabinet that testing will be far more rapid in the state, once these kits and final guidelines from the Centre arrived. Rapid testing will be done for symptomatic and asymptomatic cases at all hot spots, while symptomatic cases will be similarly tested in non-hot spot areas. The department said it had started community testing in hotspots. The cabinet has warned those with foreign travel history, who were yet to inform authorities, to come forward or face impounding of passports. All retiring health department employees were also granted extension by three months. The CM has also directed DGP Dinkar Gupta to security plan for smooth procurement of wheat. The CM emphasised that the state must procure every grain, though, in staggered manner. The cabinet also decided that details of procurement arrangements be notified by April 7-8.To stagger harvesting, combines will be allowed to operate from 6 am to 7 pm, a spokesperson said after the Cabinet meeting, adding that to ensure smooth and speedy operations, maximum number of labourers shall be permitted for unloading. The government is also working with arhtiyas and sheller owners to add 3,000 purchase centres this year to prevent crowding and follow social distancing norms. Coupons will be issued to farmers and others involved. The number of purchase centres will be 1,820. Submit proposals to cut expenditure by Apr 8, depts toldsThe Cabinet also ordered expenditure cut by all government departments and ordered them to submit detailed proposals for this by April 8.

Three firemen suffered minor burn injuries while dousing the flames. No other casualties were reported. According to fire department officials, the call came at 6.08pm from the security guards of the company where the blaze took place. A total of nine fire tenders were used to douse the flames in nearly four hours.Fire department officials identified the company as Vulcan Cold Forge Pvt Ltd, which manufactures nut bolts.Assistant divisional fire safety officer IS Kashyap, said that due to the 21-day national lockdown, enforced by the Central government to combat the spread of Covid-19, the establishment was locked from the outside and no employees were present in the building, barring two guards.“The fire broke out on the second floor of the building, the topmost floor. We had major difficulty in accessing the site of the fire and had to use a 42-metre hydraulic ladder to find our way inside. There was heavy chemical content due to which it took nearly four hours to douse the blaze,” said Kashyap.Fire department officials said the topmost floor of the building was also gutted, where packaging items, along with chemicals, to clean nut bolts were stored. However, there was no damage to the first and ground floors of the building.Kashyap said the electric panels of the building had been shut as no one was using the premises and it is highly unlikely that a short-circuit could have caused the blaze. He said that a high concentration of chemicals, used for ensuring nut bolts are rust-free, may have got mixed, resulting in a chemical reaction and causing a fire. However, work on finding out the exact cause of the fire is still underway.A total of seven tenders of the Haryana fire services – from Manesar, Sector 37, Bhim Nagar, Udyog Vihar, and Sector 29 – were pressed into service, while two fire tenders each from Honda and Maruti was also sent“The fire was intense; owners and guards of nearby factories also started panicking that the fire may spread to their establishment. We, fortunately, managed to control it within two hours. During the operation, the water which was being used by the firemen for dousing the fire, mixed with the chemicals resulting in the emission of chemical steam which led to three firemen suffering minor burn injuries,” said Kashyap.He said the three firemen, one from Bhim Nagar and two from the Sector 29 fire brigade, suffered minor chemical burns in their skin and as a precautionary measure were taken to a private hospital in Sector 5.Fire department officials said it is being verified whether the owners had procured a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the fire department. Kashyap, however, said all fire systems were found to be operational, prima-facie.He added that one fire tender has been put on stand-by at the site as a precautionary measure, as chemical-related blaze can result in the emission of sparks later on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-fire-in-manufacturing-unit-in-manesar-three-firemen-suffer-minor-burns-no-other-casualty-reported/story-kZqAkC912risrCrckXHapO.html

This is the second such incident in Basai in less than 30 days.On March 9, a fire had taken place within the Basai waste treatment plant, causing pollution in the area. The blaze had left a trail of smoke and fly ash over the skyline in the area, settling on rooftops, balconies, roads, etc.Spotted by residents from their balconies, many clicked pictures and shot videos of Thursday’s blaze, with trains passing through. They later shared these posts in a WhatsApp group for civil defence – a newly created social platform of volunteers and top officials of the district in view of the Covid-19 outbreak - with complaints raising concerns on air pollution. Some alleged that the blaze was caused by railway employees.The residents said they spotted the fire around 1.30pm and it lasted for five-to-six hours. They said a team of fire tenders reached the spot around 5pm and they took nearly 30-40 minutes to douse the flames.Harish Sharma, assistant sanitary inspector, municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG), said, “It took us half an hour to put out fire. We will inquire into the issue. Residents told us that fire incidents keep taking place in the grassland.”The residents said they are concerned about air pollution in the area and they want a proper investigation into Thursday’s fire incident and a lawful action against the culprits.“We requested the MCG officials to inquire into the fire incident and take action. Since October last year, fire incidents in the grassland in this area have taken place five times. This is an offence and we want proper action and a check on it,” said Yadvendra Singh, a resident of NBCC Green View residential society, Sector 37D.However, railway officials denied that the fire was caused by railway employees, when asked.“Our personnel did not set the grassland on fire. We got many calls from residents and we told them that this was not done by our men at all,” said a Railway official, requesting anonymity.The Supreme Court has banned burning of grass, leaves and other materials which might cause air pollution. The Haryana state pollution control board (HSPCB) is the nodal authority to take action and fine source generators.Shakti Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, Gurugram South, said, “I will speak with the Indian Railways regarding this, as well as the MCG and and the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and take action accordingly to make sure this does not happen again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-grassland-near-basai-rail-overbridge-set-on-fire-second-case-in-under-a-month/story-EmsVXnZQzo537MPYMJ0jzL.html

The woman and her son are currently undergoing treatment at Fortis Hospital, in Mulund.The Chembur-based family was plunged into uncertainty after the woman was diagnosed with Covid-19 on March 27. She had developed symptoms around March 19 and had intimated Kasturba Hospital twice, but the hospital refused to test her for the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 because she had neither the required travel history nor contact with anyone who had tested positive.“She went to a local physician who prescribed antibiotics that didn’t improve her condition, but did delay the diagnosis. Finally, on March 27, she approached a private laboratory that found her positive for Covid-19,” said her husband who went to Ghana for a business trip on March 9 and has been stranded there due to travel restrictions and the lockdown in the wake of the outbreak.After his wife’s diagnosis, health workers from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) tested the rest of the family and their close contacts. On March 29, their 14-year-old son, one domestic help and the woman’s mother were all diagnosed positive. “I was helpless as I was hundreds of kilometres away and I couldn’t do anything about it,” said the husband.At present, the woman is in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Fortis Hospital, where she has been kept on minimal artificial breathing support. The only silver lining has been that their nine-year-old daughter, who suffers from a rare neurological disorder that affects brain development, has tested negative. She is now in home quarantine, with one of the family’s domestic help. “She is at my mother’s place, who is 78 years old,” said the man. However the girl is struggling to adjust to these unfamiliar circumstances. “She is having seizures regularly as she can’t find her mother and brother. My wife, who is admitted in ICU, keeps worrying about her, which is also affecting her recovery,” said the husband, who has appealed to the ministry of external affairs and the Prime Minister’s Office to bring him home to his family. Family members have also started a petition, on change.org which has already received 9,000 signatures, in the hope of attracting the attention of the government authorities.“I know everything is closed down but still, the government is running emergency services across borders. I need passage to come back to my family who need me. This is a plea to the government from a father,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-remains-stuck-in-ghana-his-wife-son-battle-coronavirus-in-city/story-0rHE0KOdRUbo1L23VHe51L.html
04-04-2020||Gurugram||M3M Golf Estate: Expats, residents, staff unite to keep each other safe amid Covid outbreak||Seiko Uchida, a Japanese resident of M3M Golf Estate located in Sector 65, has been working hard to ensure the expat community of the society can reach out for help and support during the nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The condominium located on Golf Course Ext Road has clusters of communities from Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Uzbekistan, England, Italy and a few other European countries. Uchida, a member of the condominium’s volunteer task force, was put in charge of conveying messages to the expat community, which includes close to 50 expat families.“Due to cultural differences and language barriers, these people did not want to be added to the residents’ group. So I am passing on all messages to them via separate groups. I try to assist them as much as possible. Some of them don’t have drivers now, so I take them out for grocery shopping,” Uchida said. She added that before the Covid-19 outbreak, she wasn’t even aware of the presence of the large expat community. It was only when they were forced to form groups and exchange information that she came across them. The society, which started occupancy in 2017, has close to 490 families living on the property. Being part of a relatively new society, most peoples did not know their neighbours. But residents feel the pandemic brought the society together to actively fight as a community. The task force, comprising a group of 22 volunteers from 11 towers, was created in a few hours when the precautions to be taken during the lockdown were being decided. “Being a new society, we did not have any existing resident’s body. So forming one was an urgent requirement. Surprisingly, we were able to form one in a matter of hours,” Anindya Sarkar, a resident, said. The task force is responsible for extending emergency services to residents who are in quarantine and also to senior citizens unable to step out. The group includes resident doctors who provide consultations. The society set up two helplines, one for each tower and a central helpline for them to reach out for any support. Families in quarantine often use it to place orders for daily needs. The same can also be done via email, Sarkar said. To restrict the movement of staff, the society has accommodated close to 70 members of staff in vacant apartments. The staff is responsible for housekeeping, maintenance, security and horticulture. “We did not want the staff to increase the risk of bringing in the virus so we decided to provide them with accommodation inside. Selected members of staff who were living alone in the city were picked for this,” Arvind Kumar, head of facilities management at Golf Estate, said. He added that residents came forward to make their stay comfortable by donating mattresses, bedsheets and pillows. Each room houses only two members of staff. They have also set up a fund to provide monetary assistance to them and tied up with an NGO to provide relief to daily wagers.The in-house staff is being provided with food by the condominium’s club kitchen. The kitchen and its staff remain functional and are open to orders from residents who are unable to cook. “The kitchen provides three meals for the staff every day. In case any resident wants to, they can place an order as well,” Kumar said. While the condominium has no strict rules to stop residents from taking walks within the over 56-acre property, it does ask residents to maintain social distancing, even when walking with family members. Pet owners taking their dogs for walks have been strictly asked to not go beyond the pet relief area. During the lockdown, life has slowed down but residents say they are taking the time to observe the little joys of life. “The other day, someone shared pictures of birds that flew into their balcony on the WhatsApp group. People are finding the time to do these small things now,” Sarkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/m3m-golf-estate-expats-residents-staff-unite-to-keep-each-other-safe-amid-covid-outbreak/story-Wn6kGxon0ByEK3TI3OOKOO.html

Currently, exemptions are in place from April 1 to June 30 for residents of the 239 flats across seven buildings and one tower.“Citizens are already under tremendous stress. We did not want to extend this by asking them to incur additional expenses. Maintenance charges vary from building to building. We may consider extending these exemptions for another three months but the guidelines will be assessed once the situation is under control again,” said Ketan Jangla, chairman of the society. “While a majority of the flats had already been renovated, 50 flats were undergoing repair work. We were charging ₹6,000 per flat, so the repair work tally of ₹3 lakh has been entirely waived off,” Jangla said. Meanwhile, all common areas, gardens, and stairways are being sanitised once a week while lifts are sanitised daily. “Vendors selling daily essentials have been asked to bring their carts outside the society,” said Rajesh Shah, society secretary.Shah said four security guards have been provided temporary living facilities in one of the wings where cooking amenities are available. “Entry of domestic help has been restricted but they are being paid a full salary,” said Shah. Senior citizens living in the society have been asked not to leave their homes and volunteers are helping with their essentials, including medicines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-kandivli-society-reduces-stress-waives-maintenance/story-NVKwQlfmmxippGnS6hdi9K.html

Pet groomers believe the key is to keep pets engaged through the day. “Pet parents should find ways to keep their pets engaged in activities,” said Devanshi Shah, 27, founder of PetKonnect. “One can lay pee-mats or newspapers for the pet. In a day or two, the pet will get used to the change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pet-owners-from-sealed-buildings-are-in-a-fix/story-KFeRADdIHvdVudZzIfwyqK.html

Along with thirty-odd people, Devi, who is from Bihar’s Beguserai, had walked over five kilometres from Garhi Chaukhandi village to reach near a temple in Sector 61 after someone told them that a food distributing van that would pass by in the afternoon. Risking being corned by the police for venturing outside amid the lockdown, the group of migrant workers said they had no choice to reach the spot after failing to get any dinner the previous night. Soon, a police jeep arrived and the police officers questioned them why there were on the roads even when ration and meals are being sent to their neighbourhoods. Some workers mustered the courage to tell the police officers the ration and meals were not being served in their area regularly and even if the food van comes once in a while, it not everyone gets food.Meanwhile, a food distributing vehicle dispatched from the community kitchen at Sector 61, passed by and a bunch of policemen stopped. The police officer distributed the food and around 3pm, the workers had their first meal of the day.“Call 144 and food will reach your place,” a police officer told the workers and gave them the phone numbers of a couple of other helplines set up to provide food and shelter to those in need. Devi, however, was sceptical about how useful the helpline numbers would be for her and her family. “We have tried the helpline numbers a lot of times and it is a very long and complicated process to get food through them. Moreover, those who distribute meals sometimes do not visit, and sometimes when they do visit the staff insists that only those whose names are in the “list” would get the food. The ration is also only for those who have ration cards. The ration also doesn’t reach the beneficiaries despite requests,” Devi, who is stuck in the city with no work and little money, said.“Most of our have neighbours have left, my family and I couldn’t leave as we did not have enough money to make the journey back home. We don’t have land back in the village, and the contractor who got us job here at a factory in Sector 63 has said that we will get out due wages if we stay back in the city,” she said.The administration has set up more than 28 community kitchen across the Gautam Budh Nagar district that serve food and distribute it in vans to migrant workers, homeless people and those livings in slums, but many of the intended beneficiaries such as Devi said they do not get food regularly and are left out of the distribution loop.To avail the relief service the administration has set up, such providing accommodation at shelter home and giving food at community kitchens, the migrants call the helpline numbers but said the officials keep directing them to call another number and the loop keeps repeating itself.Shivani Shakya, a daily wage earner who is from Farukhabad lives in a shanty in Sector 68 with nine people including two children had also been battling hunger for the past few days.“We have been calling on the helpline numbers that the police officials gave us, and all we got was more numbers to dial. Sometimes they assure that food has been sent, but the food never arrives. The food van seldom visits our area and when it does, sometimes we manage to get meals, sometimes we don’t as they say that only those with their name in some list will be served,” Shivani, who works at a garment factory in Sector 65, said.According to the slum dwellers in Sector 68 no food had reached them till 3pm on Saturday. When HT called one of the helpline number released last month, which happens to be one of the district magistrate’s office number – 0120-2544700, the reply was: “Yes, we are helping, but its better if you call at the new toll free helpline 1800-4192211. They will definitely help.”Upon calling the toll-free, the operator said, “We will definitely dispatch food, but it would be better if you call 0120-2435027”. On calling the third phone number, the reply was,” The location in Sector 68 mentioned by you is near the community kitchen in Mamura. Give a call at 9205691572, the person who will answer the phone is managing the centre and the food distribution there and he will help you.”Officials at the community kitchen at Mamura, reached through the above-mentioned number, explained how the food was reaching everyone and then gave this reporter another number to get food distributed at Sector 68.“Dial 9971282306, he is the supervisor and will help. He had dispatched the food vehicle, and if you will inform him the said stranded labours in the area will also get the food,” an official, who did not wish to be named, said. “Food is being sent to all the areas, however, if anyone has behind they can call at the new toll free 1800-4192211,” said the supervisor and the loop did not end after the sixth call as well.After making a couple of more calls, the migrant workers at Sector 68 finally got the first meal in the evening around 5.30pm.When reached for a comment on the efficiencies of the helpline, district magistrate Suhas LY had first said he would speak on the matter at a later time, but despite repeated attempts remained unavailable till this story was published.Despite repeated attempts, additional chief executive officer, Noida authority, Praveen Mishra, who is in charge of the ten community kitchens in Noida, remained unavailable for comment as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/stranded-migrants-struggle-for-food-in-noida-despite-govt-assurances/story-HMJV0SKiGBzqkyRxtS3mmI.html
04-04-2020||City||Curfew: Ludhiana postal staff go the extra mile to help out needy||Amid the lockdown imposed by the government to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, different non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and individuals have risen to the occasion and gone the extra mile. The staff members of the department of posts, Ludhiana, are also among the brave warriors, who are not only facilitating the public with banking and delivery facilities, but also coming to the aid of the needy.The postal department began its social service in the district on Wednesday. The in-charge of a post office said they were taking the help of postmen to locate the needy people.Sarita Madaan, sub-post office master of the Rajguru Nagar branch, said, “Postmen are usually familiar with the area. They are assigned different beats where they go and deliver mail. Through them, we are able to learn about the condition of the people, especially those who are living without food. We are trying to help out such people.”“All the staff members in my branch have expressed the desire to contribute to the cause,” she said.“We are donating packets of the food items, including wheat flour, pulses, salt and cooking oil to the needy. On Saturday, our team distributed food items in a settlement near the Barewal Road and Guru Amardas Colony,” said Madaan.Similarly, Kamikar Singh, postmaster, Focal Point branch, said the staff, on field duty on a rotational basis, have been distributing food items among the people.“If any account holder with the post office is facing difficulties with withdrawal of money, the postal department is ready to provide them the money at their doorsteps after proper verification. From next week, we have planned to implement a new strategy where our staff can effectively do the social work while performing their official duties,” he said.The social work, being carried out by the postal department staff, was recently acknowledged by Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. He appreciated the postal department staff of Punjab for their philanthropic work at a time of crisis on his Facebook account.Senior superintendent of post offices Amanpreet Singh said, “The Indian Post has allowed the staff to carry out the philanthropic work while performing the official duty during the ongoing global health emergency.”“Postmasters of various branches are regularly updating me on the work that are carrying out. I have received the updates from post office branches of Focal Point, Rajguru Nagar, Sidhi Peeth Chowk, Dhandari Kalan and Lohara,” he said.“While I fully support the voluntary initiative taken by the staff, I ask them to take all the precautionary measures when they are on duty. I have asked them to purchase more masks and sanitisers on their own and send me a bill for the same, since the centralised procurement will take time,” he added.The head post office in Ludhiana covers 45 offices in the urban areas and 11 branch offices (BO) in 85 villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/curfew-ludhiana-postal-staff-go-the-extra-mile-to-help-out-needy/story-Y69rDpJaODPDJDHitQ9PdL.html

For this purpose, the authority has set up five community kitchens in Harola, Mamura, Sorkha, Bhangel and Sector 14A (near Shani Temple). To serve quality food to the needy, the authority staff are also having meal with the needy, the officials said.In this initiative, several NGOs and private companies such as Samsung, Akshay Patra, Ironman security firm, Rajasthan Kalyan Parishad, DLF, and Radha Swami society have come forward to help the authority, said the officials.

The Noida authority chief executive officer, Ritu Maheshwari, has directed the staff to ensure food is delivered to the right people.“We are maintaining a database of all those who are being served food daily. The Noida authority, along with NGOs, served food to 37,246 people on Friday.

After the residents got together and registered their protest, the builder said he would provide space for setting up quarantine facilities in other residential complexes that are completely vacant currently.The builder had requested the administration to converting vacant flats into a 100-bed quarantine facility to aid the government efforts to contain the coronavirus spread. The builder has offered vacant space on the ground floor of the housing complex, where at least 5,000 people are living. This project has 15 residential towers with 1,500 flats. At least 30% of these flats are lying unused.“We have written to district magistrate Suhas LY and the UP government to avoid converting our housing complex into a quarantine facility. The move will put at least 5,000 people living here at risk of contracting Covid-19 because the entry and exit will be common for all flats, be it occupied or vacant. We will not let it happen,” Brijesh Kumar Singh, an apartment owner, said.Apartment owners on Friday and Saturday came out of their flats and congregated on the road outside their complex to register their anger against the move.“The builder should have at least consulted us before asking the administration to use the vacant flats because we have a right over this complex. We hope that after our objections, the administration will stop converting the society into a quarantine facility,” Davendra Kumar, another apartment owner, said.Antriksh Group promoter Rakesh Yadav said the apartment owners do not need to worry at all.“We have vacant housing projects in Noida and Greater Noida sectors, where no apartment buyer has shifted as yet. We will provide vacant housing towers at other locations, including the ones in Sector 150, Noida, and Greater Noida West. In this time of crisis, we are ready to work with the government. We have pledged to provide space so that at least a 200-bed quarantine facility becomes ready. Apartment owners in Sector 78 need not worry at all. We will not convert vacant flats in Sector 78 project into a quarantine facility,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/residents-object-to-quarantine-facility-in-housing-tower-builder-agrees-to-provide-space-elsewhere/story-34rpomcolmRgPKXZSDwJGK.html

In this connection, the Ghaziabad health department Saturday opened a 30-bed facility at Muradnagar and shifted all Covid-19 patients from MMG Hospital to the new facility.Under the new system, the government has identified different health centres under L1, L2 and L3 levels with L1 catering to non-critical Covid-19 patients, while L2 and L3 will deal with more complicated and critical cases. “On the same lines, we opened up our community health centre after converting it into fully operational L1 facility for Covid-19 patients. Until now, these patients were admitted to the isolation ward at MMG Hospital. They all have been shifted to Muradnagar facility now. Next in line is the Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital which will come up as exclusive 100-bed L2 facility. We will also have five ventilators there,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, said.“The Sanjay Nagar Hospital will be ready to take in Covid-19 patients in another four or five days. It will deal only with positive cases with health complications. The other critical cases of Covid-19 will be sent to Delhi or to the L3 facility at Meerut Medical College. For isolation wards, we will be taking up hostels of colleges. A search is on to find such colleges,” Dr Gupta said.Once the three tier facilities come up, the isolation wards at MMG Hospital and Sanjay Nagar hospital will be freed up. The hospital will then return to attending general patients.Amit Mohan Prasad, principal secretary (health), said Saturday that a notification for six L2 hospitals in UP, including the one at Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital in Ghaziabad, has been issued.“For L3 critical care facilities, we have hospitals at Prayagraj, Jhansi, Lucknow, Meerut, Gorakhpur and Saifai. We have also identified 50 private hospitals that have been given five days’ notice to make arrangements for us to keep Covid patients. The CM is in the process of setting up a ₹100 crore Covid Care Fund for provision of equipment, testing facilities, face masks, sanitisers etc for the three-tier health facilities,” he said.The officials also said chief minister Yogi Adityanath Saturday spoke to former chief minister and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati and sought her help in persuading her MLAs to contribute towards the Covid Care Fund.Adityanath on Saturday evening also held a video conferencing with all MLAs and MLCs and requested them to contribute ₹1 crore from their local area development funds and also a month’s salary towards the Covid fund.“We need to strengthen the health system to deal with the coronavirus. At present, we have eight operational laboratories. We had zero before coronavirus came to light. We need to set up a series of L1, L2 and L3 facilities to deal with Covid-19 cases. We have also been successful in coming up with 24 L2 hospitals. Apart from MLAs and MLCs, I have also requested industries to contribute towards the Covid fund from their CSR (corporate social responsibility) funds. The fund will help us get more personal protection kits, three-layered masks, N95 masks and other items that our health professionals need,” Adityanath said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-tier-system-to-deal-with-covid-19-cases-in-up/story-VReEC8jewDRKxeO2C1bqyJ.html

Videos and photos of peacocks at the colony were circulated widely on social media.“There have been a few instances where people have entered the society looking for these birds. Alert residents have immediately asked the security staff to ensure they are taken outside,” said Karzan Engineer, a resident of Khareghat Colony. “People are not only endangering the lives of residents, but also their own by stepping out when the lockdown is in place,” he said.On Tuesday and Wednesday, two peacocks and three peahens were photographed by a Khareghat resident. The birds are frequently seen in the area, said residents, and last year, one resident had counted 32 peacocks across Doongerwadi. Resident Nariah Daruwalla said, “Owing to less vehicular traffic and noise pollution, the number of peacocks visiting at a time has increased.”Malabar Hill resident Darshan Khatau also spotted peacocks at his building. He clarified that the birds have always been visible around the Tower of Silence in Doongerwadi and Raj Bhavan. “Human inactivity combined with movement of insects, rats etc. allow these peacocks to move closer to residential areas for food. It is nothing new,” said Khatau.Environmentalist Rashneh Pardiwala said, “Not just peacocks, mongoose, monkeys and variety of birds are being spotted by residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/locals-violate-coronavirus-lockdown-orders-to-view-peacocks-in-south-mumbai-society/story-HodECAHkqeZDFAKskFSPmI.html

Earlier in the day, state energy minister Nitin Raut in a letter to the principal secretary, asked to co-ordinate with power companies to submit a plan immediately. The sudden drop in demand for nine minutes followed by the spike when everyone switches on lights could lead to a high voltage surge, which electric grids may struggle to handle. Officials said hydro-power is an important element in the grid management plan for Sunday night. Koyna Hydro and Tata Power Hydro will be fully available, with experienced operators in their control rooms, for system operation.On Saturday, Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (MSETCL), or Mahatransco, said it estimates the state’s electricity demand would see a drop in the range of 1700-1750 megawatts (MW) on Sunday night. MSETCL has prepared a 20-point action plan to mitigate any fluctuations. People are also advised to switch off only lights and leave on domestic appliances like fans and air conditioners.Officials from the state discom said it is easier to ramp up hydro-electricity compared to thermal power and Koyna has a capacity of close to 2,190 MW. “The hydro power plant is on alert to ramp back the load on the grid. So once the nine minutes are over, restart is quick,” said an MSEDCL official.State energy minister, Nitin Raut, on Friday urged citizens to only light candles and diya, without switching off lights as this could cause multi-grid failure. “It takes 12-16 hours to service one power station. If a grid collapses, it will take a week to restore things to normalcy. This will affect essential services,” said Raut. Vishwas Pathak, BJP spokesperson and a member of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, said “unnecessary doubts” are being raised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hydro-plant-on-alert-citizens-asked-to-switch-off-only-lights-maharashtra-prepares-for-pm-s-solidarity-call/story-9716MH8jzO5RiamP8sQtxK.html

Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday had announced that patients above 60 years of age will be shifted to five big hospitals, as the elderly and those suffering from comorbidities are at a greater risk of contracting the virus.The corporation said senior citizens and patients with comorbidities will be shifted to Kasturba Hospital, St George Hospital, Seven Hills Hospital, Nanavati Hospital and Saifee Hospital. Patients below 60 years as well as asymptomatic patients will be send to the Covid-19 isolation centres located at Nagpada, Bandra (West), Andheri (West), Borivli, Powai and Govandi. On Saturday, the corporation has set up 10 clinics in the densely-populated areas of the city as well as across more than 241 containment zones. The swabs of citizens will be collected for testing for coronavirus everyday at these clinics between 9am and 1pm. The decision to set up the clinics was taken by municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi in the wake of the substantial rise in the cases in the city.Mumbai recorded 99 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, taking the total number of positive patients in the entire Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) to 454. Two of these patients are from Dharavi. Until now, five people from Dharavi have tested positive for Covid-19 who have no travel history.Ninety-six other patients who developed symptoms have also been admitted to quarantine centres and their test results are awaited.

04-04-2020||Mumbai||Private doctors don’t need PPE kits, should open clinics: Tope||State health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday again requested private doctors to start their clinics and hospitals so that people do not have to face difficulties in getting treatment. He also said that private doctors don’t need personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and N95 masks to treat patients who have no symptoms of Covid-19 as chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has urged citizens to visit dedicated government hospitals if they show symptoms associated with Covid-19.“Private doctors do not need PPE kits and N95 masks to treat patients having no symptoms of coronavirus. The demand made by the private doctors is not fair. They can use triple layer masks and start their services for the people. The CM has also asked citizens not to visit private doctors and hospitals if they have symptoms such as cough, cold, fever and pneumonia and instead visit dedicated government hospitals for coronavirus,” Tope said.The minister said he feels stopping services to all patients based on apprehensions is unfair for a noble profession like doctors and urged all doctors to start their services again.The Ayush ministry has trained nearly 250 doctors who will now train 1.25 lakh doctors in how to deal with such situations. “The government wants to make available sufficient doctors and medical staff, and thus have given a week-long training to 250 doctors. They will now be giving training to some 1.25 lakh ayurved, unani and homeopathy doctors who can be used for an emergency situation,” Tope said.He asked ayurved, unani and homeopathy doctors to upload their suggestions about treating coronavirus on the Ayush ministry portal before suggesting the same to people. The minister reiterated that the government is considering lifting restrictions in phases after April 14 but added that this would only be possible if people follow the restrictions properly. “Rising number of cases is not in the interest of the state,” he said.Tope said the state has 25,000 PPE kits, 2.5 lakh N95 masks, 25 lakh triple layer masks and over 3,500 ventilators at government and private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/private-doctors-don-t-need-ppe-kits-should-open-clinics-tope/story-Mmyz8Fcdxh1F8DobTYkluI.html
04-04-2020||Delhi||Parents, kids get tips from Kejriwal, experts in live session||Creating awareness about the Covid-19 pandemic among children, engaging them in activities and sensitising them about their responsibilities towards the society were among the suggestions made by the Delhi government to parents during a session — ‘parenting in the time of corona’ — held Saturday.The live session, organised to help children and their parents cope with the ongoing lockdown, was chaired by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “It’s a challenging time for us all. But, we will have to turn this crisis into an opportunity in every possible way. Parents should try to take it as an opportunity to spend as much time as possible with their children. They should engage them in different activities to understand them better. They should educate their children about the prevailing situation,” he said.Kejriwal was joined by education minister Manish Sisodia, director of the directorate of education (DoE), Binay Bhushan, and experts, including educationist Seemant Dhadwal, as panellists. Parents and children were asked to send their questions via SMS, on WhatsApp groups to their school teachers or on Twitter accompanied by #parentinginlockdown. A senior government official said that they shortlisted the most-asked questions for the session.Responding to a question, asked by many parents, about tricks to convince their kids, as young as four to five years, to stay home, Kejriwal said, “Parents will have to make their children understand the nature of the coronavirus. They will have to tell them how it transmits from one person to another. It’s important that the children know that one person can transmit this virus to others, just by a touch or sneeze. This is how they can help their kids understand that they can also catch the infection if they go out and there is a need for complete social distancing in this prevailing situation,” he said.Many parents asked experts how to protect their children from the prevailing “sense of negativity” due to the pandemic. Educationist and chief executive officer of Meraki Foundation, Dhadwal, asked parents to ensure that their children take a break from social media every day. “All social networking sites are full of Covid-19 news items. It’s important that the kids do not read only about that throughout the day. Parents should engage their children in activities of their choice. They should regularly ask children how they feel about the lockdown. They should listen to their apprehensions and queries regularly, to avoid any long-lasting impression on their young minds. It’s important to create a positive environment at home,” he said.The panel suggested parents plan a daily routine with their children and participate in their activities. “Generally, both parents and children complain that they do not get enough time to spend with each other. This is the best opportunity for them to spend quality time at home and understand each other well,” Kejriwal said.Kejriwal also suggested parents to set an example for their children by helping those in need, including homeless people, daily wagers and domestic helps. Among other queries raised by the children were if their summer vacations would get compromised due to the lockdown, how to avoid boredom at home and ways to continue learning at home. Besides, students of classes 9 and 11 also asked about their pending exams. “We have already announced that we will evaluate students of these classes based on the exams we took before the lockdown and their internal assessments. None will be asked to write exams again,” Bushan said.Meanwhile, some parents also asked the government why private schools are charging a fee during the lockdown. Kejriwal said that he had also received messages from parents, saying that it’s difficult for them to pay the school fee during the lockdown. Sisodia said, “Parents need to understand that private schools pay the salaries of their staff from that fee only. We understand the challenges of parents as well, but they also have to think about those who won’t be get paid if the schools do not receive the fee. If parents have any suggestions regarding this issue, they can share it with us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/parents-kids-get-tips-from-kejriwal-experts-in-live-session/story-4mbDDzMN8s58yWic1GmhDJ.html

04-04-2020||City||Ex-hazoori ragi’s last talk with kin puts his treatment at Amritsar GMC under a cloud||An audio clip of former Golden Temple ‘hazoori ragi’ (traditional Gurbani singer) Nirmal Singh Khalsa’s last phone talk with family members alleging lack of proper medical care for Covid-19 patients, which went viral on social media on Saturday, has evoked sharp political reactions, including demands for an apology from the chief minister. In the audio, Nirmal Singh can be heard complaining of lack of proper treatment at Amritsar’s Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, which is a part of Government Medical College, and urging his family members to shift him to some other hospital. After developing Covid-19 symptoms, Nirmal Singh was admitted to the hospital on March 30 and he tested positive for the virus on April 1. He breathed his last at 4.30am the next day.In the audio clip of his last conversation, Nirmal Singh is poignantly telling his family that doctors were not giving him medicines and that he will rather commit suicide. His family members, especially his son named Amiteshwar Singh, is heard giving pep talk and even saying ‘I love you, daddy’, in a voice crackling with emotions.While confirming the authenticity of the touchy audio clip that has brought the arrangements to treat Covid-19 patients in the state under a cloud, his son said, “Poor arrangements were responsible for my father’s death. We kept on raising our concern before the authorities of the Government Medical College and they kept assuring us that my father will recover.”“I would like to raise another question that why have not any of my other family members, except my sister, diagnosed with Covid-19. My wife, my son, my mother, my grandmother and grandfather, who is 95, have tested negative despite the fact that we lived together. Doctors are not yet clear on my sister’s status and they will conduct a confirmatory test,” he said.He said the conditions at the hospital were unhygienic. “There was a great rush at the hospital and fungus could be seen on the beds for patients. I feel, he contracted the virus at the hospital. Negligence and poor medical arrangements killed my father not Covid-19,” he said.Notably, Nirmal Singh was asthmatic. One-and-half hour after the phone call, special chief secretary of Punjab Karanbir Singh Sidhu had shared on social media that “Bhai Nirmal Singh has been put on ventilator a few hours back in the hospital. His risk factor increased due to his bronchial asthama”.Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Prabhdeep Kaur Johal said she could not comment on the matter as the college didn’t come under her jurisdiction. GMC principal Dr Sujata Sharma, and medical superintendent of the hospital Dr Raman Sharma did not take the phone call despite repeated attempts. Meanwhile, Sikh activist Baldev Singh Sirsa lodged a complaint with Amritsar commissioner of police Sukhchain Singh Gill, seeking action against the alleged “negligence shown by the doctors of GMC that led to the death of Khalsa”. He also alleged that doctors of SGPC-run Guru Ram Das Medical College were also to be blamed as Khalsa was initially admitted there.Khalsa was given VIP treatment in special room: OP Soni Minister for medical education and research OP Soni said, “After Bhai Nirmal Singh Khalsa tested positive for coronavirus, he was treated in a separate room and not the isolation ward. He was given VIP treatment. He was given a dose of the medicine and next dose was to be given after four hours. However, Khalsa lost heart after coming to know that he was positive for the virus and that deteriorated his health.”He said that after the audio clip started circulating, he met college principal, doctors on duty and medical superintendent of the hospital to inquire into the matter in the presence of Amritsar deputy commissioner Shivdular Singh Dhillon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ex-hazoori-ragi-s-last-talk-with-kin-puts-his-treatment-at-amritsar-gmc-under-a-cloud/story-HEp3IIOWdJ1ixMZNqI1FON.html

04-04-2020||City||Amid curfew Bathinda villages launch war on drugs||Amid curfew in state to stop further spread of coronavirus, villagers of Bathinda district have launched war on drugs as well.Residents are resorting to putting up checkposts at entry points of the villages to stop suspected people from getting in to stop spread of coronavirus and drug smuggling.In the last 24 hours, at least four videos have emerged on the social media where villagers claimed to have apprehended drug suppliers and addicts.In a video from Bandi village, on Friday, at least eight persons were apprehended by residents for alleged drug consumption and supply. The accused can be seen confessing that they came to purchase drugs.In another video from Mansa Kalan village under Maur police station, villagers apprehended a Punjab Police cop and two others for allegedly trying to purchase drugs.In yet another video from Kaleke village near Rampura Phul, a man was apprehended by villagers for allegedly supplying drugs. A similar video emerged from Bhunder village where people claimed that a man in civvies (who is actually a Punjab Police cop) and his associates are involved in supplying drugs.Due to curfew in Punjab since March 23, drug supply has dried up and addicts are feeling the heat of the situation. Due to this, there is a considerable rise in addicts getting registered at OOAT clinics and approaching OPDs of the psychiatry departments of hospitals for drug deaddiction.Bathinda senior superintendent of police Nanak Singh said that people in the video from Bandi village are addicts and had come to purchase drugs. A case has been registered under the NDSP Act against the supplier and apprehended people in the video.Regarding the video from Mansa Kalan village, the SSP said that a case under NDPS Act has been registered against head constable Bhupinder Singh and others.He said that the accused cop is an addict and is being dismissed from service. He claimed that he is unaware of the video from Kaleke village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-curfew-bathinda-villages-launch-war-on-drugs/story-u5DLC8J9IrylfLZX47fmHN.html

04-04-2020||Gurugram||Better policies necessary to cure gender inequality||To commemorate International Women’s Day this year, Time magazine released 89 new Time covers to address the imbalance of the magazine over the years. Till 1977, the Time cover was even called “Man of the Year” which got replaced with “Person of the Year”. Even then men continued to dominate. This exercise conducted by Time is very significant and it got over 600 names from which the 89 were shortlisted. They include politicians, scientists, activists, sportswomen, artists and others who have contributed greatly in their fields and in many cases made a difference. All it took was the effort to look for them. This list is long overdue.Last week, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) shared the Gender Norms Social Index with data from 75 countries covering 80% of the world population that showed that there are deep ingrained biases against women across the world. The data shows that while men and women vote at similar rates, only 24% of parliamentary seats are held by women and there are only 10 female heads of government out of 193. Women in the labour market are paid less than men, and are much less likely to be in senior positions: less than 6% of CEOs in S&P 500 companies are women. And while women work more hours than men, this work is more likely to be unpaid care work.These facts are very interesting because they point to deep biases which will need a lot of work to get past. We all hold biases which we don’t question. The fact that Time did not have a woman on the cover for more than 75 years shows bias, because clearly it is not that there were no deserving women. Some of those included women who were well known even in their times – Virginia Woolf, Amelia Earhart, Frida Kahlo, Rosalind Franklin, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, Rosa Parks, Golda Meir, Simone de Beauvoir and Indira Gandhi. among others. The number of women hidden figures in Indian history is also a long list and we need to recover her-story as well.In India, the statistics on women’s equality and visibility are not very encouraging. Women represent only 29% of the labour force. More than half of the work done by women in India is unpaid, and almost all of it is informal.Though they comprise almost 40% of agricultural labour, they control only 9% of land. Further, nearly half of India’s women do not have a bank account and 60% of women have no valuable assets in their name. In addition, they are victims of violence with the rate of crimes against women at 53.9%.On the one side are these statistics on women’s equality and empowerment in India, while on the other side we are seeing changes in our cities.In Gurugram, women are visible in both in the formal and informal workforce. To increase these numbers, we need better policies as well as enabling conditions such as good public transport and safe public spaces. But good policies also need strong implementation. Last year, the education department announced free bus rides for all girl students of state government schools. Unfortunately, many schools did not send the requisite details about the girls to be able to avail of the benefit. Such a scheme, if well implemented, can lead to less female dropout from schools, which, in turn, can result in more girls in higher education as well as in the work force.In Delhi, the free bus ride scheme for women has resulted in increased ridership of women, particularly from the lower and lower middle classes. While no evaluation has yet been done, anecdotal evidence has been positive. Women workers in India are known to walk even up to 5km to access their workplace, as per the last census data.Gendered inequality is a global concern and it is estimated that, at the current rate of progress, it will take 108 years to achieve gender equality. I don’t think women are willing to wait another century for equality!@viswanathkv(The author works on issues of women’s safety and rights in cities)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/better-policies-necessary-to-cure-gender-inequality/story-fodlXlMMmeOue9LuKqPuIO.html

A total of 482 coaches with a capacity of 16 beds each has been allocated to CR by the Indian Railways and since last week, the process of converting the coaches into isolation rooms, has started. “Central Railway has been allotted a total of 482 coaches which are in the process of being converted into isolation or quarantine wards. The work began last week at Parel and Matunga workshops under CR and other than that at coaching depots which are based in Pune railway division, Mumbai, Nagpur, Bhusawal and Solapur. At each coaching depot, 25 such coaches are being made,” said CR chief public relation officer Shivaji Sutar. For making the isolation coaches, non-AC sleeper coaches are been used, while one Indian style toilet is to be converted into the bathroom. It is to be equipped with a bucket, mug and soap dispenser. The first cabin near the bathing room is been provided with two hospital or plastic curtains transversely in the aisle so that the entry and exit to the entire eight cabins can be screened off. This cabin will be used as store room and paramedics area. Two oxygen cylinders will also be provided by the medical department for which suitable clamping arrangement on the side berth side of this cabin is provided.“It is a contingency plan by the CR and will act as a support system to the existing hospitals. We have been given instructions by the central government about usage of these coaches whenever necessary. Once they are ready, it can be used whenever necessary,” added Sutar. Both middle berths are going to be removed in each cabin. Extra bottle holders are provided in each cabin for holding medical equipment, two for each berth. Extra three peg coat hooks, two per cabin will be provided. Also mosquito nets will be installed on windows and ensure proper ventilation too, added Sutar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/in-a-few-weeks-pune-railway-division-to-get-25-isolation-coaches/story-YOb1TPwnyBeUOupoGO9e1O.html
04-04-2020||Mumbai||Bandra, Kurla saw highest dip in transport-caused pollution||A study of pollution in Mumbai during the lockdown has shown that Bandra and Kurla, which generally witnesses high traffic congestion, has seen the maximum decline in transport pollution over the last two weeks.The study released on Saturday said that Bandra and Kurla, connected by Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), have improved air quality as most offices at BKC are using the work from home (WFH) model during the lockdown. Both areas have shown maximum reduction in nitrogen oxides (NOx) levels. From March 17 to 22, Bandra saw an 81% decline in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) while NOx levels in Kurla went down by 92%. Thereafter a steady decline has been observed till April 1.The details were part of an assessment of Central Pollution Control Board (CBCB) data prepared by anti-pollution campaigners Waatavaran Foundation. Vehicles and thermal power plants are major sources of NOx while vehicular emissions, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil contribute to NO2 pollution. Both gases affect the human respiratory system.The analysis calculated the percentage drop for five pollutants from March 17 to April 1 with NO2 levels falling by 87% over two weeks, PM2.5 by 72% and PM10 by 68.9%, NOX (calculated in parts per billion) by 88.39%, and carbon monoxide (CO) by 74%. All these major pollutants affect the overall air quality index (AQI) in the city. Borivli, Colaba and Powai had the cleanest air in the city. While Borivli’s monitoring station is located inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Colaba and Powai have a major advantage of sea breeze, the assessment said. The least decline in pollutants was observed across Sion and round the international airport in Andheri.“The unprecedented lockdown scenario has provided valuable lessons through the WFH model, which can be inculcated in the long run to help improve air quality,” said Bhagwan Kesbhat, founder, Waatavaran.On Saturday, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) also released its air quality assessment during the lockdown, which was similar to Waatavaran’s assessment as they both used the same data set. “Stringent travel, construction restrictions and shutting down of non-essential activities have led to an improvement in air quality. Particularly, contribution of re-suspension road dust has reduced PM2.5 considerably,” said E Ravindran, member secretary, MPCB. “Data from the lockdown period will be used for enhancing city action plans.” Pulmonologists said there was a significant drop in patients suffering from lung-related ailments during this period due to cleaner air. “Everyone is wearing a mask, which helps improve hygiene too,” said Dr Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist, Lilavati Hospital in Bandra.Meanwhile, between April 2 and 4, researchers identified a marginal spike in PM10 (breathable particulate matter of 10 micron size or smaller). “This is due to a rise in temperatures and increase in dust in the city’s air due to easterly winds. It will continue for at least two more days,” said Gufran Beig, project director, System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bandra-kurla-saw-highest-dip-in-transport-caused-pollution/story-iDNEO2yN4lxcoBfFSRhjmK.html

04-04-2020||City||Decongesting jails: Devender Pal Bhullar released on 42-day parole||In a bid to decongest jails following coronavirus outbreak, the Amritsar Central Jail authorities on Saturday released Devender Pal Singh Bhullar, convicted under the now-scrapped Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, in connection with a terror attack on the then Youth Congress chief Maninderjeet Singh Bitta in 1993, on a six-week parole. “Bhullar has been given early parole due to coronavirus. This leave will be deducted from his regular parole,” said Arshdeep Singh Gill, superintendent of Amritsar jail. Bhullar was convicted and awarded the death penalty in 2001 by a TADA court for triggering a bomb blast in New Delhi in September 1993, which killed nine persons and injured 17 others, including Bitta.Bhullar’s death penalty was commuted to life imprisonment by Supreme Court in 2014 after it concluded that there was an inordinate delay on the part of the President in deciding Bhullar’s mercy plea.This September 2019, the Centre decided to release eight Sikh prisoners, including Bhullar, on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. The government had said that it was granting special remission to eight prisoners.Opposing the release of Bhullar, Bitta in his petition alleged that Bhullar had been holding durbars within jail premises because of his political nexus.In December 2019, a bench of the Supreme Court led-by justice RF Nariman directed the Union government to maintain status quo on the release of Bhullar.“Till now, we have released 529 inmates and the process of releasing more is underway,” said the jail superintendent. Some of the inmates have been released on parole while some have been granted interim bails. Having a capacity to accommodate 2,200 prisoners, the Amritsar jail has 3,400 inmates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/decongesting-jails-devender-pal-bhullar-released-on-42-day-parole/story-FP1MvXZhMphlkIZ0DIjDgO.html
04-04-2020||Mumbai||Solapur man trains 2.5K teachers for online teaching amid lockdown||As thousands of government schools struggle to keep up with the demand for online learning during the lockdown, a Solapur-based teacher is offering a solution to the problem. Rajkiran Chavan, a 36-year old teacher who teaches at a government-aided school in Solapur is training nearly 2,500 teachers from across the state to equip them with the basic skills required for online teaching. Using social media platforms, the primary school teacher is trying to teach how to use a simple mobile phone to shoot videos, make small presentations and present academic content more effectively to make it interesting for students. “I had conducted sessions with teachers even in the past but the current situation was alarming because suddenly all learning had to stop because students from low-income families barely have any access to high-end technology. Even in places where they do have phones, teachers are not equipped to teach online. The idea was to ensure that teachers are not just trained but develop an interest in online teaching-learning,” he added. Chavan said that while most teachers can shoot videos, that alone does not ensure online learning. “Training to understand the technology is not enough to be a good online teacher. For that, one needs to understand how to present the topic in question using multiple techniques and mediums so that it doesn’t become boring. For instance, instead of showing a simple PPT on video, teachers can make an animated PPT which interests young students,” he added. Meanwhile, several teachers from civic schools in the city are now using messaging applications to conduct group videos to teach their students over the last few days. “It is the easiest thing to do considering most of us don’t have the necessary training to use more sophisticated applications. We have created a database of students and we call them for a half an hour class whenever possible to finish where we left before the lockdown,” said Aneesha Palite, a teacher from a civic school in Kandivli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/solapur-man-trains-2-5k-teachers-for-online-teaching-amid-lockdown/story-lxMtW6MO5Dp3FVqMXBZHHI.html

To fund important development work and also pay salary bills of its 2.7 lakh employees for March, the Himachal Pradesh government has raised a loan of Rs 453 crore from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), taking the total debt burden on it to Rs 58,253 crore. The total salary bill of the state government is around Rs 12,500 crore, which turns into a monthly cost of Rs 1,000 crore, on average. The state’s debt has doubled since 2012, when it was Rs 28,207 crore and has now translated into a a per capita debt of Rs 73,000 on each state resident. Dearness allowance is also payable to 1.8 lakh (around 66%) of employees. The state spends 32% of its budget on paying pension to its employees and another 10% on salaries. Another 15% goes in interest payments. Disbursal of loans to farmers takes up another 10%. Finally, only around 25% is spent on development works. Successive state governments have failed to mobilise resources and tax collection also dipped after the good and services tax (GST) was implemented across the country in July 2017. It will be a difficult climb back for the state’s economy after restrictions end, as the state economic survey, this year, had already predicted a slower pace of 5.6% from 7.1% in the previous fiscal. The only positive in the survey was the 6.6% increase (by approximately Rs 12,000) in per capita income in the state to Rs 1.95 lakh in 2019-20 over 2018-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hp-raises-453-cr-loan-for-development-paying-salaries/story-qrPsg5PiKStiRLAOEaDxQP.html

04-04-2020||Pune||Startup Saturday: Pune pivot-eers showing strong Covid form||Got you covered, forehead to neck... keep your game face onAnatomiz3D; founders: Firoza Kothari, Sohrab Kothari and Sagar Shah What it isSays Firoza Kothari “I have a degree in biotechnology and was working in sales when my brother and his partner, who run an engineering and architectural firm, saw that they were receiving a lot of requests from the healthcare industry.” “Basically we use 3D technology to assist the healthcare industry. If a doctor needs to do a surgery then we print 3D anatomical models that will help him get a better grip on his surgery landscape. We also make customised titanium implants for various purposes such as neuro and ortho, among others,” she adds.The Covid pivot - face shieldThe face shield is a little different from a typical face mask. It has a head gear made of acrylic attached to an elastic band that goes around the head. From the head gear falls a transparent PVC sheet that covers the entire face the forehead to the neck. Anatomiz3D was not into manufacturing protective gear, they certainly had the capability.Says Kothari, “We have laser cutters and injection moulding machines. So, when the hospitals we worked with asked us for masks, we thought why not use the same machines to make face shields?”Says Korhari, “Not just hospital staff, but policemen, civic workers, vendors who sell their goods on the streets, and customers, could make use of our face shields.”Says Kothari, “As of now we are supplying 5,000 face shields per day. If people become aware of this, I think Mumbai alone will need about 25,000 shields per day.”While demand exists will Anatomiz3D be able to supply? Kothari has thought this through. “As of now our capacity to produce face shields is 10,000 per day. However, should the demand increase further we can involve other players in the industry, people with injection moulding machines, laser cutters who can be roped in. I don’t think supply will pose a problem,” says Kothari.These masks can be sterilised and reused, though Kothari feels that if patients are being treated then it is better to dispose of the masks. She is pricing them at Rs 177 each which includes all taxes. “Given the severity of the situation we have priced this very low. In fact, we will be able to cover our operational costs only.” According to her USA alone has a shortfall of 91% PPEs (personal protective equipment).What about logistics? “That is a serious issue but many of the importers have said that they will take care of it. Even though all transportation is shut, we still have couriers like who operate every two to three days. It will be slow but goods are still moving,” says Kothari.Cash flowAnatomiz3D have poured Rs 4 crore since they started five years ago.“We invested Rs 20 lakh initially and over time have been putting in more money into the business. We have a strategic investor,” says Kothari. While the company still has to break even, (Rs 1 crore closed this year) Kothari says, “For India we are keeping our cost really low. The opportunity we see is in supplying to foreign shores.”Future without the virus?“We aim to increase our sales in two ways. One is to reach out to educational institutes where undergrads can learn more about the anatomy via our 3D printed ones. And the other is to create awareness in hospitals amongst surgeons that their efficiencies and accuracies can improve with our products,” says Kothari.Let AI do the lab work... in just ninety secondsDeep Tek; founders: Anirudh Pant, Ajit Patil and Dr A KharatWhat it isDeep Tek is a startup that has developed AI tools to help doctors in the imaging business. Says Dr Kharat, “Typically, a doctor does an X-ray, MRI or CT scan, and those reports have to be read. What we have done is used AI to help read those reports thus saving an already overburdened doctor time and improve efficiency.”Despite the AI reading the images these reports are ratified by the doctor. So far, the company has been doing this very successfully for the government of Tamil Nadu, where they have scanned over 75,000 patients in and around Chennai for TB. Deep Tek has deployed the tool in 40 hospitals in Pune.The Covid pivot – pneumonia test results in 90 secondsWhat this tool does is not only flag cases out of the hundreds that a radiologist would see at his centre, but also prepare the report. In a usual day what would take seven to eight minutes is done in one-and-a-half minute.“When this epidemic hit us we foresaw the situation that may develop. If the infection spreads then X-rays and CT machines will be widely deployed to find out if Covid-19 patients have developed pneumonia. In a typical situation a doctor at the radiology clinic will have his hands full. By the time s/he gets to the patient whose lungs are showing pneumonia on account of the Corona infection it may be a few hours. So, we thought why not use our tool to help doctors detect pneumonia developing in a Covid patient fast? Quick detection would mean quick treatment,” says Dr Kharat.Using their team of 50 people the trio worked tirelessly from their homes and via video calls to develop this AI-aided tool that can help a radiologist detect pneumonia. Cash flowDeep Tek is a company funded by NTT Data, Japan and have signed up with Medical Business Machine, a Japanese company, to use their solution in the machines MBM will manufacture. “Once our information is translated into Japanese they will be ready to start work with it.”In India and anywhere in the world, DeepTeck is willing to offer their solution for free. “One of our Japanese investors told us that this is something we should do and we agree. At a time like this when the world is caught in the vortex of this pandemic, this is the least we can do.”How will this be deployed across the globe? Says Kharat, “That should not be a problem at all. We can deploy it remotely anywhere in the world.” Earn while you burn? Yup. Even during lockdownStepSetGo; founders: Shivjeet Ghatge, Abhay Pai and Misal Surakhia What it isThere are fitness apps and then some more. When Ghatge launched his company last year, he had got his finger bang on people’s ‘excuse’ pulse. Says he: “People join a gym, make resolutions, buy outfits, shoes and even go to the gym. For a few months, weeks or days. After that everything goes kaput.”To tackle the lack of resolve, Ghatge created an app that was unlike the other apps available in the market. “Just counting your steps and calories was not enough to keep people motivated. Why not reward a person who exercises?” How? “We created a bazaar. This is a place where we ask vendors to register. They get visibility and can offer discounts or even freebies to our customers. It works both ways,” says Ghatge.In the second half of 2018 Ghatge and his co- founders Pai and Surakhia worked on the technical aspects of developing the app. “Brands like Bewakoof, Every A, Planet Super Hero, Avvatar protein powder, Burp and others saw the value in our proposal.”After an informal launch Ghatge saw 50,000 downloads and in March this year they had 56,000 downloads per day.When the pivot is a double-downAs of now the app has 5.1 million downloads. “I think students found it interesting that they could win prizes if they won a certain number of points. So if you walk 1,000 steps you win a coin. You keep collecting coins with which you can buy items from our curated bazaar,” says Ghatge.“Since we are committed to make people walk in the very least, we are coming up with newer forms of motivation. We have power hours in a day where if you walk in your house you will earn more points than usual,” says Ghatge. “At one point you could win a Bajaj Avenger bike for 9000 coins and three people won it last year in the duration of this six month campaign,” says Ghatge.Cash flowThe trio invested Rs 1 lakh, each, initially. “Later we borrowed Rs 7.5 lakh from friends and family,” says Ghatge. Revenues come from advertising generated by the brands on the bazaar. “So far we have tie-ups with 150 brands that include Bajaj,” he adds. StepSetGo has posted Rs 6 crore in turnover to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/startup-saturday-pune-pivot-eers-showing-strong-covid-form/story-2BDYBaO8RnCHdSf8pr120J.html
04-04-2020||Pune||NGOs in Pune grapple with how to help most vulnerable during outbreak||For many daily wage earners and construction labourers a 21-day lockdown means an abrupt pause in livelihood. However many non-governmental organisations (NGO) and social groups are working around the lockdown restrictions to feed the needy, however according to multiple NGOs, the outbreak challenges their work by increasing the demand for their services and lack of coordination.“Since the lockdown began we are trying to help the needy and till now we have provided essential food items and even cooked food packets to hundreds of families. However, there is a lack of coordination and trust issues between the social groups themselves,” said Vaishali Patkar, president, Aundh Vikas Mandal Organisation.She added, “As the number of people who need help is more, many organisations are coming forward to help. There is no coordination as most of the times repeated help is given to the same area or construction site and other areas are left out. It was also observed that people who were financially stable were also demanding essential goods, so it is necessary to verify the help provided is reached in proper hands.”Amit Dhole, trustee, Saad Pratishthan Pune Trust who is providing help to the needy said, “Currently we are cooked meals and raw food material to at lead 1,100 families. We have noticed that most people do not have ration card. They are homeless people from other states and do not reside within the city limits. We must also concentrate on providing help to those who reside beyond city limits. A lot of them are not listed in the official government lists and should be provided with help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ngos-in-pune-grapple-with-how-to-help-most-vulnerable-during-outbreak/story-AqrrrHL61DmHTOWIM5vTtN.html

With schools shut due to the pandemic, it is a challenge for most parents who are working from home to keep their children constructively occupied in a holistic environment and keep them safe.Announcing the session a day earlier, the Delhi government had invited questions from parents and children on how to cope with the nationwide lockdown. “Schools shut and kids at home. It’s indeed a challenging time for parents to help kids cope with the lockdown. So let’s learn new ways to sail through these times. CM Arvind Kejriwal and experts come together for a live chat with parents about - parenting in the time of corona,” Sisodia had tweeted.“There are 44 lakh students who are not going to school now and have many questions about Covid-19. I will answer as many questions as I can. Children are innocent. Most of them, specially the very young ones do not understand the significance of a lockdown or why they are being asked to stay at home. The aim of this session is to suggest ideas on how to utilize this time fruitfully,” Kejriwal said.Parents came up with a number of interesting questions which their children had originally asked them. The parent of a 5-year-old revealed that the child had asked him whether the entire population would die due to the disease. The Delhi chief minister replied, “The challenge is coping with little children who should not be frightened. It is also difficult to explain to them since they are too young and do not understand the precautions we need to take to fight Covid-19. They need proper explanations on why they cannot indulge in all the things they want to do outdoors.”Most parents, Kejriwal said, normally do not find the time to sit and interact with their children. So now is the correct time to spend quality time together. Despite the fact that most parents are working from home, they need to harness technology to keep their children occupied, the Delhi chief minister said.“Children spend too much time with gadgets. That access has to be given in limited measure and they need to be taught how to use certain gadgets for e-learning,” Kejriwal advised parents who had tuned in to the interactive session.Seemant Dhadwal, an expert attending the session on behalf of the Delhi government said most children wanted to know why they could not go outdoors and play in parks. “Children need to be told they cannot do things they like during the lockdown…they have to be engaged with the help of technology and imagination. For instance, they can build an imaginary park with the help of chart paper and colours and then they can pretend it is an actual park and be engaged for sometime every day. Parents too need to adjust with conflicting demands that children make,” he said.Along with Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, the Delhi CM was accompanied by other experts from the field of education.The country is under a 21-day nationwide lockdown that has been imposed to stop the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus. Schools, public transports, religious places and offices have been shut to break the chain and contain its transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/spend-quality-time-with-children-during-lockdown-delhi-cm-kejriwal-s-advice-to-parents/story-Pg19t5QnYxX8vgfXGLH9xJ.html

But I have not received the ration of even March. My family of six members is surviving anyhow on borrowed ration from neighbours,” said Kumari, a resident of Sukurhuttu village in Ranchi’s Kanke block.She is not alone but hundreds of beneficiaries are struggling due to alleged improper distribution of subsidised ration, especially in the time of lockdown where majority of poor and underprivileged families is facing job crisis, including in MGNREGA.“I have not got any job under MGNREGA this year. Now, all work under the scheme has come to a standstill due to lockdown. I am a widow and only bread earner for my three children. I have no money to even buy subsidised ration,” said Sukhmani Devi, an MGNRGA labourer from Kutte village in Latehar’s Manika block.She said the government had said the ration would be given free for two months but ₹1 per kg is taken by PDS dealer here.Similarly, Babita Devi, 25, a resident of Manjholi village in Palamu’s Chhatarpur block, is also struggling for the subsidised ration for last couple of months. “My husband is differently abled. I used to work in a crusher unit, which is shut due to lockdown. I am struggling to eke out two square meals for my two children and husband,” she said.The PDS dealers blamed the poor-supply system for the delay, while the food, public distribution and consumer affairs department alleged non-cooperation from some PDS dealers in proper distribution of ration.“The supply chain is affected due to shortage of labourers in godowns. There are 530 PDS shops only in Ranchi. But ration has reached to only 20% shops by now, while we had to begin distribution from April 1,” said Sanjay Kundu, general secretary of Fair Price Dealers Association (FPDA). He said few shops have received ration but only for a month.“There was an issue of labourer but that has been sorted out. We are receiving reports that some dealers are not distributing ration, despite its availability,” said Sanjay Kumar, food and public distribution director. “We have lifted the ration for April by 98.7% from the godown and it has already reached to dealers, while the lifting for May is 35% by now. The May’s ration will completed be lifted from godown in a week,” Kumar added.He said the department on Friday asked all the vigilance committees across the state to report against the dealers, who are not distributing ration to beneficiaries or practising unfair means. “The vigilance committee will face action if they fail on it,” he said.Over free ration distribution, he said consumers would have to pay nominal charge of ₹1 per kg for the ration they will receive in April. “But the two months ration, which will be allotted in May, will be free, as the Centre is providing it free,” he said. The state government has announced to offer two months’ ration to the beneficiaries enrolled under National Food Security Act (NFSA) and the people who are eligible for subsidised ratio but they do not have the ration cards.Around 2.64 crore people from 57 lakh households are covered under NFSA in Jharkhand. However, there are many who are still deprived of ration cards. More than 6.97 lakh applications for ration cards are pending with the department.The food, public and consumer affairs department has also allotted ₹30 lakh to each district to take care of the poor people. Besides, it has also directed the district authorities to provide 10kg rice to needy families, if they are lacking ration cards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/pds-beneficiaries-struggle-in-coronavirus-lockdown-many-deprive-of-ration/story-qCJCKmWJZQeaPJ4r1K5vlN.html

Calls can be made between 9.30am to 1pm.The details of the names of doctors, their disciplines and timings are awaited.The administrator was also informed at the meeting that the Central government had sent 1,000 personal protection equipment, 5,000 masks and hydroxychloroquine medication for use in the medical institutions.Dr Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research also stated that neighbouring states should not send suspected cases to the institute without first locally testing them to prevent overcrowding of Chandigarh facilities.Badnore on the occasion thanked nearly 50 NGOs, charitable organisations, gurdwara committees and temples serving food packets to people in need.Parida also stated that after initial hurdles in cremating people who had died from Covid-19, manpower had been arranged for and trained to dispose of the remains as per protocols laid down by the Central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-in-chanidgarh-telemedicine-services-at-gmch-gmsh-from-april-5/story-ws0V58MCYrVRLHCeqsgZiP.html
04-04-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown delays introduction of male tiger at Ludhiana safari||The 21-day nationwide lockdown imposed to arrest the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has also delayed the introduction of a male tiger at the Ludhiana Tiger Safari in Amaltas village near the Jalandhar Bypass. The last male tiger at the zoo, Mani, had passed away on March 7 at a ripe old age of 18. Meanwhile, the two three-year-old Bengal tigresses – Chirag and Inchara - were introduced to the zoo in the second week of January from Chhatbir Zoo remain without a mate.In 2013, the zoo had lost three tigresses - Mohini, Elaichi and Shanti - in a span of a few months, leaving only two male tigers Deepak and Mani in zoo. Both tigers and one of the deceased tigresses were diagnosed with leptospirosis, a bacterial infection that attacks the liver and kidneys. Subsequently, the state government had decided not to introduce any new tigers in the safari till the infection was completely wiped out.Deepak, had died on December 19, 2019, also at the age of 18. Zoo authorities say the lifespan of tigers in captivity is 15-20 years.Following the arrival of two tigresses, Mani had been housed in a separate gallery and not released in the safari as a precautionary measure.Mani was born at the Ludhiana zoo itself on June 23, 2002 to a tiger couple Pintu and Rita.Expansion on holdInitiatives to introduce a variety of bird species such as and bringing blackbucks from Abohar have also been put on hold.Zoo in-charge Narinder Singh says, “We have many interesting plans in the pipeline but they are on hold due to the lockdown. We hope the situation normalises soon and we are able to introduce blackbucks and new birds to the tiger safari.” The zoo authorities had to face some difficulties in arranging the animals’ feed during the lockdown, Singh says, “In the first two days of the lockdown, we had to sort out issues in the supply chain and had to seek travel approvals for transportation of feed.”“Nowadays, we receive supply of raw meat every three days. We also maintain a refrigerator with around three quintals of animal feed as a contingency. We have adequate fodder,” he said.Entry to the zoo had been restricted on March 17 in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak. Recently, an animal adoption scheme had been launched under, which any resident could adopt an animal or bird kept in the zoo by paying an annual care taking fee and could also avail a tax benefit for their trouble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-delays-introduction-of-male-tiger-at-ludhiana-safari/story-G6qWPV5O2Z85Q5dsy1cjGK.html
04-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus in Chandigarh: Contact tracing teams giving it their all to contain spread||His mother has been critically ill, his son wants hugs and his wife is worried sick about the work he does, but sub-divisional officer Vijay Bahadur hasn’t been able to give them the attention they need as he’s been at the frontline of the battle with Covid-19 since the first positive case was reported in Chandigarh.Heading one of the four teams constituted by the municipal corporation (MC) to track contacts of Covid-19 patients, he says it’s tough work.The team is called the moment a suspected Covid-19 case reaches hospital and given the address of the patient with details of contacts.About 30% contact details are given by the doctors examining the patient and the remaining 70% have to be traced by the team that goes meticulously through the movement details of the patients, says Bahadur.At 10am on Thursday, after getting information that a suspected Covid-19 case from Sector 35 had reached the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital in Sector 16, the team had reached the man’s residence by 10.30am.Wearing masks and gloves, team members advised the family members to stay indoors, handed over an advisory, assured them that their needs would be taken care of, pasted a home quarantine notice outside the house and cordoned off area.When they got to know later that the man had tested positive for Covid-19, the team members’ hearts sank.One big worry is of picking up the infection then as team members are the first ones to interact with the Covid-19 patient’s family, said Kapil Kisana, a 37-year-old firefighter.His family is based in Nawanshahr, he says. “They keep making video calls. My wife wants to talk to me at least 10 times a day to check if I’m wearing masks and gloves,” he adds.“We work with great enthusiasm and keep joking, saying ‘pata chale agli stamp saade laggi hove’ (who knows we might get the coronavirus quarantine stamp on our hand),” Kisana laughs, his eyes brimming over with laughter over the white N-95 mask.About four teams with 32 members were set up by Anil Kumar Garg, additional commissioner MC-cum-nodal officer contact tracing team. These included at least 17 firemen, police personnel, peons and MC staff. Each member was provided two kits of OT gowns, gloves, masks, protective eyewear and sanitisers.Two vehicles were provided to each team.“So far over 1,300 houses have been quarantined, including 305 contacts of coronavirus patients in Chandigarh,” Garg added.Things got ugly sometimes. “Some patients give us wrong leads and some are rude and refuse to be quarantined, saying they are asymptomatic,” said Bahadur.“Keeping the team motivated is tough, everyone’s afraid of contracting the disease. We are also humans and have families. But we can’t afford to let our spirits down so I start my day by giving a pep talk to the team,” he adds.Once home, Bahadur showers, washing his clothes in hot water before moving to his isolated room. However, he can’t sleep until he checks in on his bedridden mother (from a distance of course).Not many people know that firefighters are a part of the tracing team, a majority of them young men aged between 23 and 25.Among their tasks: Locating travellers in the travel history list and quarantining them, says firefighter Sukhwinder Singh, who is posted at the Sector 32 fire station. On a particularly tough day on March 20, he says the teams began the day at 9am and was working up to 1.30am the next day.“There are instances where people respond very aggressively and use harsh words. However, we don’t take their words to our hearts,” says Deepak, 23, another fireman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-in-chandigarh-contact-tracing-teams-giving-it-their-all-to-contain-spread/story-Z9hRHzom7R3B9eJBVmpP8J.html

Its move to opt crematorium of our village bypassing the city crematoria created fear and doubts in our minds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-boycott-verka-village-say-golden-temple-ragis/story-exD7S2KaKqdKYjNfxLuAyO.html

04-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus in Chandigarh: Serving people in quarantine a risky job for waste collectors||Collection of waste from the houses of people who are home quarantined in Chandigarh due to perceived coronavirus threat seems a daunting task. But the job gets done everyday albeit with a lot of hardship and caution.Everyday, 30 municipal corporation (MC) employees put their lives at risk and collect garbage from such houses, the number of which has increased to 700 in past two weeks.MC executive engineer Rajinder Singh, who is monitoring 15 garbage collection teams deputed for these houses, said, “Although everyone is a little worried, all sanitation workers are given proper protection. The collection is going smoothly. We update our list everyday and depute the staff accordingly.”MC supervisor dealing with collection, Atul Rana, explains that every worker is properly covered from head to toe in chemical suits at the time of garbage collection. Orange or green bags are used for collection from these households so that these are not mixed with other general waste.“Every day at the time of collection, one empty bag is given and then a garbage-filled bag is taken from them. Our workers don’t touch these bags. They receive it in another bag and then tie them up properly,” he added.“After collection, these teams go to the open dumping ground in Sector 25 where they dumped the bags in pits. We have permanently deployed a JCB machine there to dig up and then fill the pits with soil,” he said. Rana said even the chemical suits of the workers are dumped along with the daily waste, and they are given fresh suits and other safety gear. All vehicles used for collection are also sanitised in the evening, he said. MC junior engineer Vishavjeet Singh, involved in this process, said all collection vehicles are GPS tracked. “Although we have divided areas among these 15 teams, we make changes as new houses add up,” he said. Head of MC sanitation department, Dr Amrit Warring said that MC was properly adhering to the guidelines issued by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).“Collection of waste from quarantined houses is one of our major priorities and we are not leaving any scope for negligence. Every worker is given well-covered safety kits at the time of collection. Their health is monitored daily,” said Warring, adding that door-to-door garbage collectors have been strictly told to stay away from such houses.MOHALI MC TEAM TASKED WITH SAFE DISPOSAL OF TRASHThe municipal corporation (MC) has constituted a special team that is picking up the waste generated from around 400 houses wherein as many persons have been home quarantined for perceived coronavirus infection. MC commissioner of Mohali Kamal Kumar Garg said, “We have a list of people whose houses the team is visiting to pick up garbage once a day. The workers take proper precautions and the waste is buried deeply as per the norms.”Civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said, “A government-empanelled agency is disposing of the biomedical waste of our hospitals and dispensaries. The biomedical waste of Covid-19 patients and suspects is properly packed, sealed, and kept in a designated room. The agency collects it once a day in their truck and dispose it off as per Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016.”Presently, Mohali has 12 confirmed cases of Covid-19, out of which two are admitted at Fortis Hospital, Sector 62, Mohali, one in Max Hospital, three in civil hospital in Phase 6, and five at Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur. A 43-year-old doctor of Sector 49, Chandigarh , who is also confirmed Covid-19 patient, is admitted at Mayo Hospital in Sector 69.The Panchkula municipal corporation (MC) has set up a rapid action team to collect waste from the houses of persons who are home quarantined. Panchkula MC commissioner Sumedha Kataria said, “The waste is being collected in yellow bags and given to the biomedical hazardous waste collector of health department, which disposes it of at its centres.” Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said, “For isolation and other wards related to Covid-19, yellow double-layered bags are being used to collect the waste. It is being stored and labelled separately before being handed over to the bio-medical waste treatment facility.” As per the health department data, around 293 persons are home quarantined in Panchkula, 390 at temporary shelter homes and around 125 at facility quarantines at Nada Sahib gurdwara and Mauli village in Raipur Rani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-in-chandigarh-serving-people-in-quarantine-a-risky-job-for-waste-collectors/story-u5BQF6eS4hc2qJjxt58huM.html
04-04-2020||City||British PM writes Covid-19 advisory in Punjabi, Gujarati, Urdu||British prime minister Boris Johnson has posted letters to 30-million households across the UK, cautioning people: “We know things will get worse before they get better,” and to reach various communities, had it translated in Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu.Alongside the letter, residents receive a leaflet outlining official advice, with clear explanations of symptoms, hand washing guidance, rules on leaving the house, self-isolating in case there are symptoms and shielding vulnerable people.The United Kingdom has a 1.5 million-strong Indian diaspora. In the 2011 census, 273,000 people identified Punjabi as their first language; Urdu by 269,000 and Gujarati by 213,000.He wrote: “You should not meet friends or relatives who do not live in your home. You may only leave your home for very limited purposes, such as buying food and medicine, exercising once a day and seeking medical attention. You can travel to and from work but should work from home if you can.”“When you do have to leave your home, you should ensure, wherever possible, that you are two metres apart from anyone outside of your household. These rules must be observed. So, if people break the rules, the police will issue fines and disperse gatherings.”Johnson says in the letter that the more Britons follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner life can return to normal. But health officials have not ruled out further restrictions during the ongoing three-week lockdown that may last until September.Thousands of Indian-origin medical professionals are in the front line in the national health service (NHS), including those rejoining after retiring recently.“Thousands of retired doctors and nurses are returning to the NHS – and hundreds of thousands of citizens are volunteering to help the most vulnerable. It is with that great British spirit that we will beat coronavirus and we will beat it together,” Johnson wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/british-pm-writes-covid-19-advisory-in-punjabi-gujarati-urdu/story-451AUA2Etyzxvi1PsjBDxI.html

CSIR is India’s premier national research and development organisation, which operates a network of over 38 laboratories across the country.Institute’s director Dr Sanjeev Khosla said the institute was equipped to test around 100 samples a day, and the capacity can be increased when required. He said CSIR-IMTECH had the requisite BSL (biosafety level) 2 and BSL3 laboratories, along with manpower expertise, to carry out testing for Covid-19. “All mandatory approvals for testing clinical samples have been obtained to operationalise testing at the earliest,” he added.UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said the protocol for testing at IMTECH will be formulated after they officially receive intimation of the testing facility from the institute. As part of the existing protocol at PGIMER and GMCH, foreign travellers are tested if they have symptoms. All symptomatic people, who came in contact with a positive patient, or have severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) are also tested. Any other persons suspecting infection first need to contact the health department to allow it to establish if testing is required. Apart from testing clinical samples, IMTECH is also supporting healthcare professionals by providing Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) to safeguard them against infection while serving patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-csir-imtech-to-start-testing-covid-19-samples/story-avrlRIK7GMGJXRYBDuOSyO.html

Appreciating their efforts at keeping people indoors, often by putting their own health at risk, Agrawal said the cops have been working round-the-clock ever since the curfew has been imposed. “From implementing the curfew orders to making people aware about the virus to even distributing food among the needy, the cops have been at the frontline in this battle,” he said, adding, “Often in such a situation, they find it hard to take care of their own health and spend time with their families.” To help them beat the stress in these testing times, he orders his officers to make a list of all personnel on curfew duty and give them weekly off on rotation basis.He also advised them to take a 30-minute walk everyday to stay fit. He also said the police department has been ensuring that all cops on duty get proper meals and tea breaks. ‘HAVE NOT SEEN MY FAMILY IN 17 DAYS’For head constable Narvinder Singh, deputed at the Division Number 8 police station, his duty comes before anything else. The 31-year-old says that his parents and brother have been worried about him. “They live in Jeera of Ferozepur district and I the last time I met them was 17 days ago,” he says.Talking about his schedule, he says, “I have been working 15 to 18 hours a day so people remain indoors. I report to duty at 6 in the morning and come home only late at night.”“My mother has been calling me frequently but often due to my busy schedule, I am unable to attend her call,” she said. Narvinder joined the force 10 years ago and says this is the first time he has seen such a situation. ‘ REMINDS ME OF THE MILITANCY ERA’Assistant sub-inspector Sukhjinder Singh, who has been serving in the department for the past 30 years, says the curfew reminds him of the militancy era in Punjab.“It was a tough time back then but this is even more difficult,” Singh said, adding quickly, “But the police are in control of the situation,”Sukhjinder Singh belongs to Duburji village in Payal and has not gone home since the curfew was imposed in the state. He has been sleeping in Rose Garden police post.He says he has three children and makes sure speak regularly with them over phone. “For us our duty comes first and we available for the department in every situation,” he adds.‘HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO MY KIDS’ Inspector Pawan Kumar, Model Town station house officer, says, due to the increased working hours, he has not been able to speak to his children. “My duty ends late at night. By the time I reach, my two sons are fast asleep and since I have to leave early in the morning, I don’t get to speak to them at all,” he says. Kumar, however, makes sure to have frequent communication with them over the phone. “It is part of our job. When we joined the force, we vowed service to the people,” he says while appealing to people to follow government orders to win the battle against virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cops-on-curfew-duty-to-get-weekly-offs-in-ludhiana/story-DIUpnyxt3v6bl8RpyIsO4N.html

However, he finds himself being shooed away by police personal and struggling to earn a living since the lockdown was imposed. Before the outbreak, his daily routine involved picking up fresh green leafy vegetables from farmers of Ladiyan and Jassian Village at 7am and then selling them to residents in 20 lanes of Joginder Nagar.However, now despite the risk of getting infected, he has to deliver vegetables from door-to-door: “If I do not move out and sell vegetables than my family will have to sleep without food, so I must go out and sell vegetables despite the risk.”The task is rife with difficulties as cops are not allowing vendors to commute on the roads. Kumar says, “Though, vegetables are an essential commodity, cops are not supporting us and thrash us on a daily basis.”“Over the last 12 days, many people have stopped purchasing vegetables as they say the prices of vegetables have shot up. They all purchase small quantities after much haggling. I would earlier earn Rs 600- Rs 700 by selling vegetables such as spinach, radish, cauliflower and peas, now I earn Rs 200 per day, which isn’t enough to run my house,” he says. “We are a family of four and these days we are finding it hard to scrap two meals a day.

04-04-2020||Chandigarh||RBI clears Rs 22,936-crore CCL; Punjab govt to pay farmers through arhtiyas||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday cleared Rs 22,936 crore towards the cash credit limit (CCL) for Punjab for the purchase of wheat in the rabi marketing season.With this sanction for the month of April, the central bank has released bulk of the CCL of Rs 26,064 crore sought the state government for the purchase of 135 lakh metric tonne (MT) of wheat this season. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had on Wednesday written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking her intervention to direct the RBI for expeditious authorisation of CCL for the coming rabi season.“The state is facing unprecedented crisis due to lockdown in view of Covid-19 pandemic and procurement of rabi crop, which was due to begin on April 1, 2020, will now start on April 15 and this will be possible only if the RBI issues CCL authorisation,” he wrote. The CCL release would facilitate the Punjab government in making timely payments to farmers against wheat purchase in the rabi marketing season.Meanwhile, Amarinder asked the agriculture and food department to work out ways to procure wheat grain from within the villages that are located more than 1-2 kilometres from the mandis, to check overcrowding during the rabi season in view of Covid-19 restrictions. The CM was reviewing the wheat harvesting and marketing arrangements through a video conference with officials of these departments.‘AMEND RULES, KEEP DBT IN ABEYANCE’Amarinder also directed his chief principal secretary Suresh Kumar to get the rules amended to provide for payment to farmers through arhtiyas, saying that any changes in the system, including direct bank transfers, should be put in abeyance in the current circumstances. The system of direct transfer to farmers was to be commenced from this season, as was pointed out by food and civil supplies secretary KAP Sinha.The CM set up a committee of senior officers to monitor essential supplies on a day to day basis. He directed state police chief Dinkar Gupta to take strict action against those found guilty of hoarding of material. On the issue of procurement, while an Uber-type system of pooling farmers to the distant mandis, on the lines of the suggestion made by the Prime Minister, could be considered, the CM said he was open to accepting the proposal of the chief secretary to arrange for doorstep kind of procurement of the grain if comprehensive modalities could be worked out to ensure feasibility.While around 50% of the villages in the state are located in close proximity to the mandis and curfew passes could be issued to the farmers to go to the mandis in few numbers at a time, for the villages in distant areas, the chief secretary suggested sending officials to handle the procurement. Arhtiyas, who currently undertake bagging of the grain in the mandis, could be entrusted with the task of handling it in the villages itself, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rbi-clears-rs-22-936-crore-ccl-punjab-govt-to-pay-farmers-through-arhtiyas/story-4go1cxgxls2DsRkhtSj4bI.html
04-04-2020||Chandigarh||Lady Luck cold shoulders Chandigarh car dealers this Navratri||Navratri this year, failed to bring fortune to car dealers, with business hit hard by curfew restrictions in the wake of Covid-19 in the city. Dealers say that although it was unavoidable, the curfew couldn’t have come at a worse time, as it coincided with Navratri from March 25 to April 2, when most cars are sold. Dealers are reporting around 30% cancellation in bookings made for cars during Navratri, since March 24 when the curfew was imposed.As per records available with registration and licensing authority (RLA) and state transport authority (STA), More than 1,100 light motor vehicles were sold in the city this March before curfew was imposed. In comparison, during Navratri last year in October, more than 2,500 light motor vehicles were sold. Nitin Mehan, owner of Autopace Chandigarh, the dealership for Maruti Suzuki and Nexa in the city, said, “As if lack of sales wasn’t enough, about 30% bookings of cars wherein payment were made in advance were also cancelled. Some cars were to be wedding gifts but the curfew also prompted cancellation of weddings.”Mehan also said that even after the curfew is called off, it is unlikely that banks would easily give people loans for vehicles, so business is bound to suffer even further.President of federation of Chandigarh regional automobile dealers, Ronny Hoon, who also owns a Hyundai dealership, said with the curfew, automobile dealers are down and out. “We were aiming at selling nearly 300 cars during this time and had taken loans to procure enough vehicles. But there have been no sales. Between paying salaries and paying off loans, if finances of a dealership are not in shape, they may have to shut shop.”Unregistered BS-4 vehicles may face issue after curfew Former president of the association, Varinder Singh Saluja, who is a Ford dealer, said, “Buyers who purchased BS-4 engine vehicles before the curfew and didn’t get their vehicle registered on the spot may face issues after the curfew is lifted, as no BS-4 vehicles will be registered after April 31.” He also said that at his dealership, 50% bookings have been cancelled, especially for high-end cars. “After the curfew, people will first spend money on rebuilding their businesses rather than buy automobiles,” he said.Regarding two-wheelers, have been sold in the city since March 21, dealers of scooters, motorcycles and mopeds have been saved from the fallout of booking cancellations. Ronny Hoon, who also has a dealership for Honda motorcycles in the city said that two-wheelers were still being sold on the spot as there is no concept of booking them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lady-luck-cold-shoulders-chandigarh-car-dealers-this-navratri/story-noRSUjMjeQtz157P2nP8DI.html

In his satirical video, Bhalla is seen anthropomorphising rats and conveying that rats are safe when they are in their burrows.“I have attempted to convey a serious message through comedy so that people enjoy watching the video and also follow the message at the same time,” he says. “Social distancing is the only one way to fight the deadly virus and it must be followed within houses as well, “ says the comedian. “Otherwise after the lockdown is over, we may notice the birth of new members in the family,” he adds on a humorous note. Bhalla says the government is also encouraging social distancing and we must follow the rules.The artiste said that people usually follow actors, which is why he is making videos while staying at home and posting them on social media. As of now, Bhalla has posted four videos where he has highlighted different preventive measures, including avoiding shaking hands, making efforts instead of depending on prayers, keeping hands clean and maintaining distance from each other.Ask him about his daily schedule, Bhalla says , “These days, I wake up at 8.30am, perform yoga and meditation, followed by prayer recitation. During the day, I spend time with my family.”“At times, I call relatives and friends to enquire after their well-being. Later in the day, I work on videos for my fans and sometimes watch comedy movies to keep the environment around me positive,” he said.Bhalla, who is the head of department of extension education at PAU, says that in these difficult times, everyone should support each other and pray for each other’s well-being.“I have heard that many residents here are cursing out NRIs who have returned to their homes recently and were found to be positive for coronavirus disease. We should not blame them, but help them and support them,” he said. “NRIs have always contributed for the development of the state and we should encourage their efforts,” he added.Bhalla further appealed to the residents to not spread fake news on social media as it can lead to panic among people and mislead them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/life-in-the-times-of-lockdown-practice-social-distancing-says-comedian-jaswinder-bhalla/story-22I8zRYU11qi6MfNM6kbKJ.html

04-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 update: Lockdown sees fewer street crime, accidents in Delhi||New Delhi: Street crimes such as robbery, snatching, theft and molestation declined by up to 50% between March 15 and March 31 this year in the city from the same period last year, according to the Delhi Police’s fortnightly data released on Friday, as the city battled the spectre of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The number of fatal road accidents also came down drastically from 48 last year to 19 during the same period this year, the data showed.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe decrease in the number of crimes can be attributed to the nationwide lockdown that started on March 25 when the police kept a high profile to enforce that people stayed indoors, police officers said, requesting anonymity. Most public and private transport vehicles went off the roads, making for fewer accidents. The police officers said that a majority of the crimes were reported between March 15 and March 22, before prohibitory orders were first issued in Delhi. Later, the 21-day nationwide lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to prevent the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic. The police data, however, does not have the figures of serious crimes such as dacoity, murder, attempt to murder, and rape.“There has been a significant decline in all the crimes. The exact number of crimes that happened during the lockdown period, between March 25 and March 31, is not available. But as far as the trend of the reporting of crimes is concerned, the incidents of serious crimes have been very less. A majority of the cases (in data between March 15 and 31) were registered between March 15 and 22. Nearly 50% of the registered cases have already been solved,” said Delhi Police spokesman Mandeep Singh Randhawa.According to police statistics, 53 cases of robbery were reported during March 15 and 31 this year as against 109 during the same period in 2019. There were 294 cases of snatching in the same period last year, which declined by almost 39% to 181 this year.Apart from robbery and snatching, vehicle thefts also declined. Data showed that 1,243 vehicles were stolen in the city in the second half of March this year, whereas this number was 1,982 during the same period in 2019. In Delhi, on average, about 140 vehicles were stolen every day last year. However, due to the coronavirus effect, the average number came down to 73 per day, the data shows. The number of vehicles stolen after March 22, when restriction came into force, must be less than 200, a police officer said. Similarly, the police registered three extortion and 55 burglary cases between March 15 and 31 this year. The number was 13 and 126 respectively in that time ast year.The police data shows that molestation cases also declined by 50% to 72 in the period this year as against 114 in the last 17 days of March 2019.“As the lockdown has led to a sharp decline in vehicular movements in the city, there were only 19 deaths in road accidents between March 15 and 31 this year. Cases of simple accidents also reduced to 112 as compared to 216 reported in the second half of March last year,” said another police officer.As far as serious crimes are concerned, no case of kidnapping for ransom was reported in the second half of March as compared to one case that was registered last year during the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-effect-delhi-sees-decline-in-street-crimes-accidents-between-march-15-and-31/story-2yUrb7WP5dQkNa6tnxCuOJ.html

One death was reported in Mumbai and three in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), excluding Mumbai, and one each in Pune and Jalgaon. The first case in the state was reported on March 9. Under the cluster containment action plan, the flying squads conduct a survey in three-km radius of containment areas (where a person has tested positive or his close contacts live), if three or more Covid-19 patients are found there. However, the state health department has directed the local authorities to conduct surveys even if one patient is found in an area, said an official from state health department. In Mumbai, the worst hit in the state, 292 teams have completed a survey of more than four lakh residents, state officials said. State health minister Rajesh Tope said a flying squad is expected to visit an area for 14 days and prepare a list of people suffering with symptoms such as cough, cold, fever or respiratory problems. “If they don’t recover, they are referred to the government facility,” Tope said. “The squad is also being used for contact tracing, which plays an important role in containing the spread. They are also asked to create awareness among people about the pandemic.”Seven members – two each in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Ahmednagar and one in Hingoli district – who attended the Tablighi Jamaat event have tested positive. The state government could contact 1033 people of the 1,225 who went to New Delhi and has put 738 in government quarantine facilities, said an official.The wife of the second COVID-19 patient who died in Mumbai was discharged on Friday. According to sources, the deceased’s 32-year-old daughter, who was also found to be COVID-19 positive, has turned negative and would be discharged on Saturday. In another case, of the 40 quarantined medical staffers at Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli, 26 have tested negative. The reports of the remaining 14 are pending.In the state, 595 suspected patients are admitted in various hospitals across the state. Till Friday, of the 12,858 samples tested, 11,968 samples were found negative; while 50 have recovered. A total of 38,398 are quarantined at home and 3,072 are in government quarantine facilities.On Thursday, the health department announced the plan to start 30 dedicated government hospitals with 2,305 beds for patients. It also decided to start mass rapid tests to ascertain the level of infections among masses. Meanwhile, the state government has declared a financial assistance of ₹50 lakh to the kin of police personnel who die in the line of duty. Deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar made the announcement after holding a meeting with home minister Anil Deshmukh, health minister Rajesh Tope and other senior officials. Pawar has also requested the central government to waive GST and service tax on all medical equipment that are useful in the fight against coronavirus such as personal protective equipment kit, ventilators, testing kits, mask etc.Pawar in his letter to union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the demand for all these things has increased due to the worldwide outbreak. “Easy availability and also at cheaper rates of all these equipments is the need of the hour. Thus GST and service tax being imposed on them should be waived off with immediate effect,” states the letter.Government employees related to public health, medical education and police force would be given priority while paying the rest of the salary for March. The state government has announced payment of the salary for government employees and elected representatives in installments. In the first installment, the government employees will get 50% to 75% salary, while the remaining part will be released later in the coming months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-count-up-to-490-6-dead-of-coronavirus/story-Ffxe9YvcgQzGyOnXEY363M.html

She is married to a 28-year-old senior resident from the physiology department, who also tested positive for the viral infection on the same day.The boy is the first baby to be born to a Covid-19 positive mother in India.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe parents, the newborn, and his three-year-old sister are housed in the isolation facility in the new private ward of the hospital. The 28-year-old doctor’s brother has also tested positive for the infection, and has been admitted to the hospital. “The mother and child are both healthy and in the isolation ward. The newborn should be fine, but we will keep an eye on him for the infection. The mother was also not really symptomatic. She just developed a sore throat today,” said Dr Neerja Bhatla, professor of gynaecology and acting head of the department at AIIMS.The baby was due next week, but doctors decided to go for an emergency caesarean section to deliver the baby.Anticipating the challenge of a pregnant Covid-19 positive woman, doctors from the gynaecology department at AIIMS had already made arrangements for a temporary operation theatre (OT), which was built last week in the hospital’s new out-patient clinic department.The hospital is in the process of converting the Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre to a dedicated Covid-19 facility, with an OT for patients with the infection. In the meanwhile, doctors had to bring in OT light and anaesthesia table to convert the minor OT in the OPD block to a major one for the surgery.The building was empty since the hospital has stopped out-patient services.“The trauma centre OT for Covid-19 patients should open up soon. For the time being, we brought in OT lights and anaesthesia table from different departments to convert the minor OT into a major OT. Draping was also put up in the haematology department area of the OPD to create separate areas to put on PPE (personal protective equipment), sanitise, and take off the protective gear,” said Dr Bhatla.To prevent infections, staff entering the OT had to put on the protective gear — the full-body suit, goggles, shoe covers, and masks — before entering. All the blood collection and testing before the surgery was done once the pregnant woman was inside the OT, to judiciously use the PPE. Afterwards, the staff had to take off the gear properly, following a checklist and sanitise themselves before stepping out.Passageways were cordoned off and a green corridor-like clearance path was created to bring the woman in to the OT area.“Everybody worked well as a team, and we were able to pull this off without a hitch,” said Dr Bhatla.The authorities have been unable to trace the source of infection as the resident doctor did not have a history of travelling abroad nor had he treated any Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-positive-woman-delivers-baby-boy-both-are-out-of-danger/story-es1uVX4Ic4NdQvWdZsyYZO.html

04-04-2020||Mumbai||City’s Covid-19 fight goes into high gear||The worst Covid-19-affected city in India has activated 474 teams across 241 containment zones and checked more than 900,000 people as part of its plan to stop the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus through human-to-human contact. As of 9 pm on April 3, Mumbai had 278 positive cases and 18 deaths – the highest for any Indian city – according to data released by Maharashtra’s nodal state health department.Each team comprises two or three Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) staff members, and is mandated to identify a containment zone, conduct door-to-door surveys, and get a questionnaire answered by all residents in that zone. In Mumbai, a ‘containment zone’ is categorised as one if a single person from any area is tested positive for Covid-19. The patient’s family and the building are identified as a ‘cluster zone’ and at least four to five adjoining buildings on all sides are mapped in the containment zone, depending on the area’s population density. The greater the population density, the wider the radius of containment zone, a BMC health official explained on Friday.According to BMC protocol, the family and immediate neighbours of positive patients are tested, as they are considered high risk. Other residents of the building are considered low risk and are asked to be in home quarantine. They are also asked to keep a tab on their symptoms. Residents of adjoining buildings in the containment zone are also surveyed. Entry and exit from a containment zone is restricted and severe lockdown protocols are put in place.“Each of these teams identifies at least 50 high risk cases per day,” a senior BMC health officer said. “These high risk persons are direct contacts and who have fever, cold, cough, breathlessness, etc. Depending on severity of the symptoms, we advise testing and visiting the closest Covid-19 hospital.”City health officials said this protocol differs from the guidelines issued by the Centre for identifying clusters and containment zones on account of Mumbai’s high population density (32,303 persons per square km). A senior civic officer said, “BMC has been given permission to draw up its own guidelines.” Across all other districts in Maharashtra, however, clusters are identified if more than three persons are found to be Covid-19 positive in the area. Following that, an area of 3 sq km is screened.At present, BMC’s health officers said, 300 of the 474 teams are on the field at any given time.BMC said it is uses video analytics software on top of the live footage it receives from the 5,000 installed closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras across the city to monitor human movement in a containment zone. “No one is allowed to roam around in a containment zone,” said an officer involved in executing the containment zone strategy. “If the software spots any movement in the feed, the disaster control room is alerted. We are also updated on the instances of human movement and also crowding. We activate the disaster management team and they ensure that people don’t move out. If people move out regularly, we are mandated to take action against them. Food and essential items are being delivered to persons in the containment zone.”In addition to regulating movement, BMC said on Friday that it will start medical camps at the perimeter of containment zones. As no resident living in the containment zone is allowed to exit, any person showing symptoms of Covid-19 can approach the medical camp. “Patients with other illnesses can also approach the medical camp for a quick diagnosis, and referral to a hospital,” a health officer said. “This comes just days after reports such as the death of a senior citizen in Kurla (in central Mumbai) due to a stroke. The senior citizen was a resident of a building sealed by BMC after a positive case of Covid-19 was reported. The locals had alleged that policemen standing guard at the building did not allow the man to leave the premises for medical attention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/249-containment-zones-474-teams-mumbai-s-covid-19-fight-goes-into-high-gear/story-Bdj7bQ2sQkIloQdca4AyLJ.html
04-04-2020||Delhi||Watch out for the Covid Patrol: Cops on bikes make sure people stay home||In a congested lane of Zamrudpur in south Delhi, HT listens in to a conversation between a policeman on a motorcycle who has just stopped a man:“Why are you out of your home?,” asked the policeman.“Sir, I need to buy milk.”“Is it? Then you must be carrying cash. Show me the money”.No, it was not a demand for a bribe. The policeman was trying to ascertain whether the man had a genuine reason to be outside amid the 21-day country-wide lockdown that began on March 25.As it turns out, the man who we met earlier did in fact have the money and the policeman allowed him to pass with a reminder: “Stay home, stay safe.”“Fake excuses will not be tolerated,” another policeman announced through a loudhailer to a small group of people walking towards them. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThese policemen are part of ‘Covid Patrol’, an initiative of the South Delhi district police to penetrate densely populated neighbourhoods and ensure a strict compliance to the lockdown.Forty such motorcycles -- with ‘#COVID PATROL’ marked on red and blue tapes over their headlamps -- were rolled out on Wednesday. Each police station in the district would have two to three such motorcycles. “These motorcycle patrols will ensure police presence in areas that other police vehicles may not be able to enter. They will brief shopkeepers, keep the roads empty and also prosecute violators in areas where residents feel they may get away without a punishment,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP (south).To see the situations they face and how they tackle them, Hindustan Times on Thursday followed one such team of four policemen riding two motorcycles as they rode out of the Greater Kailash police station.“We will be taking rounds every hour. I don’t want to see you here when we return,” head constable Ravinder Singh told a man sweeping dry leaves outside a bungalow in Greater Kailash-1. The motorcycles raced ahead, but Singh kept turning around to make sure the man had gone back into the house.As they rode past bungalows in this posh neighbourhood, guards and men washing cars rushed toward their gates. “Wash your hands with soap before you enter the house,” constable Umesh Chaudhary, riding pillion on another motorcycle, told them.They ignored a small group of people outside a grocery shop, paused to see if another shop had the markings for social distancing among customers, and let an elderly man proceed home once he produced a medical prescription.As the motorcycle patrols reached a traffic junction, they bumped into a youngster riding a scooter. “I am a distributor with a spices firm,” the moped rider said. The policemen weren’t convinced and parked their motorcycle, bombarded him with a series of questions and checked his documents before giving him the go-ahead.Amidst the lockdown, only those exempted by the government as essential service providers, and those who have been issued curfew passes by the Delhi Police or the Delhi Government, are allowed to move on the roads.Until this point, the policemen had it easy. The roads were deserted and the policemen rode at a decent pace and routinely sounded their sirens.Scenes were quite different once they ventured into Zamrudpur. People here walked the streets, vendors sold vegetable and fruit, and children played in groups of threes and fours.The policemen parked their motorcycles and began rounding up those who appeared to be out without a reason. One man said he was returning home after giving lunch to his cousin who lives alone.“Tell him to cook at home or ask him to stay with you,” head constable Tara Chand said while taking down his contact details.Another man, Sanjeet Kumar, said he was walking to his friend’s home to ask for bank account details. “You think I am an idiot? Couldn’t you just call him? Next time I see you outside, you’ll be locked up at the police station,” Chand nearly screamed at him. The man ran off the moment he was let off.The policemen took down details of men who didn’t carry identity proofs, didn’t offer believable excuses and those who rode out together to buy groceries. “Are you hoarding that two of you are required to visit a shop,” Hawa Singh, a constable carrying an AK-47 rifle, asked two such scooter riders.“We remember your faces. I don’t want to see you again when I return,” Singh warned them.While these men escaped without any legal action on Thursday, the Delhi Police have been prosecuting hundreds of people every day for violating the lockdown, booking them under the Indian Penal Code or under the Delhi Police Act. On Friday alone, the police detained around 3560 persons who were loitering on the city streets without any valid reason or emergency. The policemen seemed helpless when it came to children playing in the streets. “Beta, go to your homes,” a policeman pleaded with them, while another asked around to know who their parents were. The children ran to continue playing elsewhere.The policemen then rode out to another part of Zamrudpur where the sound of the policemen’s loudhailer was drowned by a loudspeaker set up outside a shop. “House owners must not demand rent from their tenants this time,” the speaker bellowed. “The speaker is also set up by us,” HC Chand said enthusiastically.While they let vegetable vendors and shops operate without questions, they forced a man to shut his roadside stall selling masks. “Pack your shop and go into hiding. Masks are to be sold at medical stores,” HC Ravinder Singh, told the shopkeeper Shivam.“There is no point. These policemen will keep returning,” Shivam said, packing the masks in a bag.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/here-comes-the-covid-patrol-south-delhi-cops-out-to-ensure-lockdown/story-R5xrsLV6wUor76VIwVEJRJ.html

The Nuh police have identified as many 200 people, who attended the congregation, and collected samples of 25 of them for testing so far. The three infected patients are admitted in Nalhar medical college, while 25 have been put in quarantine at a polytechnic college. At least 200 others are in self-quarantine.The chief medical officer of Nuh confirmed the new cases and said the patients had visited from Kerala to attend the congregation of Islamic preachers held by Tablighi Jamaat. “We took samples of those identified by the police on March 31. They will be in quarantine for 14 days. Police has been deployed so that they do not escape from the quarantine facility. We have provided them safety kits too to prevent contamination,” said Dr Virendra Yadav, chief medical officer, Nuh. Police teams deployed at the hospital at Nalhar medical college and polytechnic college have been provided with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), which includes gear like zero power glasses, gloves, masks, shoe covers, headcovers, and hand gloves, to ensure their safety. Nuh’s superintendent of police Narender Bijarniya, on Friday said they are coordinating with the district administration and chief medical officer and are checking the travel history of people who had visited Jamaat and are ensuring that they are kept in isolation. “Samples of nine more people have been collected on Friday. The test results will come on Saturday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/3-tablighi-jamaat-attendees-from-nuh-test-covid-19-positive/story-26G4i3Nh5vybXMGQYzGw3O.html
04-04-2020||Delhi||Man lodges FIR against father for violating lockdown||A 30-year-old man on Wednesday lodged a police case against his father for allegedly not following the lockdown and repeatedly stepping out of their house in south Delhi’s Rajokri near Vasant Kunj.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had initiated a 21 day countrywide lockdown on March 23 to check the spread of Covid-19. So far, 386 people have tested positive for the virus in Delhi, with six deaths. On the man’s complaint, police booked his 59-year-old father for violating prohibitory orders. In his complaint dated April 1, the man — who works in an automobile company — alleged his father had been violating the lockdown often, police said.“On April 1, when the son called the police, a team was sent to his house. The police team found the son and his father standing outside the house, on the road. When the man asked his father to get inside, he refused. The man later also told us his father often stepped out of the house and roamed around in the neighbourhood despite the lockdown,” said a police officer. Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Devender Arya said as prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC is in place, a case under IPC section 188 was registered against the father on a complaint by his son at the Vasant Kunj (south) police station. A police officer said the offences under section 188, in a pandemic-like situation, may lead to six months of imprisonment or Rs 1,000 fine or both.The man who filed the FIR could not be reached for a comment.Since the lockdown was announced in Delhi, the police are regularly patrolling roads and bylanes of residential colonies, asking people to stay indoors and move out only in case of emergency. Regular announcements are also being made by the police to educate people about the risk of exposure to Covid-19 and on measures to avoid it. Violators are being prosecuted. On Thursday, police registered at least 174 cases till 5 pm against people caught violating prohibitory orders. A total of 3,663 people were detained and 443 vehicles impounded. On Wednesday, the police booked 249 people for violations, detained 4,053 people and impounded 515 vehicles. The action is also being taken against those who are caught violating the mandatory home quarantine. Delhi police spokesperson, Anil Mittal, said that a total of 33 FIRs were lodged till Friday against such people, of which 21 were in Dwarka. “They were all found deviating from home quarantine rules. The violators are being booked under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and section 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act. Apart from Dwarka, eight cases were reported from south Delhi, two from the north and one each from the northwest and central Delhi.The Delhi police have set up a 24x7 helpline, 23469526, to assist people to resolve issues related to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-lodges-fir-against-father-for-violating-lockdown/story-UJsTudkW1rPxe1lQtUcOMI.html
04-04-2020||Gurugram||Daily wagers write to Gurugram administration, say they are not getting food||A group of slum dwellers from Indira Awas Colony near Narsignhpur village complained to the district administration on Friday, alleging that distribution of food among them was scarce, leading to massive resentment.In the light of Covid-19 outbreak and after a nationwide lock down was imposed from March 23, the Gurugram administration has set up a relief camp at Kherki Daula (and at other places in city) to distribute food among daily wage earners living in villages and slums in the area. A team of officials from Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and some anganwadi workers have been engaged to distribute food materials — such as wheat, rice, daal, sugar etc — among people affected by lockdown. The complainant said that the slum dwellers have had to return disappointed from the food distribution centres empty handed so far and no official has reached out to them with supply. On Friday morning, the aggrieved group of people drafted a letter signed by 20 people and sent it through WhatsApp to Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri, seeking his immediate intervention. The letter stated that they are being deprived of food at Kherki Daula centre. The complainants, mostly daily wagers and domestic helps, wrote in the letter that they had run out of food at their homes too.One of the residents who has signed the letter, who wanted to remain anonymous, said, “Food material keep arriving at Kherki Daula community centre. The distributing officials told us on Thursday afternoon that there was a shortage and they asked us to come back at night. We were turned away during the night time too. We have returned disappointed many times ever since this public distribution system was started in light of Covid -19 outbreak. We finally decided to inform the administration on Friday.”Soon after their letter, they got calls from the officials in charge of the Kherki Daula food distribution camp.“Two three hours after our complaint to the deputy commissioner, we got a few calls from officials asking us for our address and they assured us that we will be getting food materials today ,” said another resident. Till late Friday evening, the food relief hadn’t arrived for the slum dwellers.The administration has set up camp to track daily wage earners living in villages and slums, who might be running low on food and money after the lockdown enforced.Khatri said, “I will look into the complaint and take appropriate action if the food distribution is not proper. We have a large team working in food distribution in the entire district and I will get this complaint checked. People can also call 1950 if they do not get food or they want to know their point of distribution in their respective area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/daily-wagers-write-to-gurugram-administration-say-they-are-not-getting-food/story-yuZsUqt45PA0lmdgiRHlEP.html
04-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s Silver Oaks puts needs of the elderly first amid the lockdown||One of Gurugram’s oldest condominiums, Silver Oaks, in Sector 26 has adopted an elderly-first strategy as part of its plan to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). While almost 50% of the residents at Silver Oaks Apartments are senior citizens, who are at a high risk of contracting the infection, the condominium is exercising special caution to keep them safe and has formed a volunteer network to cater to the needs of the elderly.Tariq Raza, president, Silver Oaks Condominium Association, said a team of volunteers had been constituted to look after the needs of elderly residents. “ Children of many senior citizens don’t live with them here. We are being extra careful about such people so that they don’t face any trouble. We have appointed volunteers to take care of senior citizens with health conditions. The volunteers ensure that in the absence of domestic help senior citizens do not face difficulty of any kind,” Raza said. The condominium has been under lockdown since March 17 and has restricted the entry of all outsiders. The entry of part-time domestic help, drivers, gardeners, and car cleaners among others has been barred with some exceptions such as those assisting the elderly. While delivery of vegetables, groceries, and medical supplies by e-commerce outlets is allowed til the entrance gates, agents of food delivery services such as Zomato and Swiggy are not allowed into the condominium. Out of the 15 gates, entry and exit of residents is allowed only through four gates since the condominium went into lockdown three weeks ago. “Unlike other condominiums in the city that have only have one or two gates, Silver Oaks has 15 gates. We have closed all gates except four and these gates are being manned by guards. Social distancing is our priority at the moment and unless absolutely necessary, all movements have been curtailed,” said Raza.Residents are required to collect deliveries of essential goods from the gate. All persons entering the building are required to use hand sanitisers at the gates. The management has placed tissues the lifts which can be used by people for pressing the buttons without directly touching them.Hand sanitisers have also been placed at the entrance of various towers. The condominium has also roped in the services of a professional service that disinfects and sanitises the towers, lobbies, and lifts after every three days.The condominium has reduced the strength of the essential staff by half to cut down exposure from the outside world. The rest of the staff has been given accommodation inside the complex. Mask and disposable gloves have also been given to security guards and housekeepers. Prior to the lockdown, residents had been advised to give paid leaves to all domestic help“About 25%-50% of the staff that lives within premises is on duty. They do not step outside and hence there is no fear of exposure for anyone of us. We have provided the staff with bedding and given them allowances for food. They stay here and cook,” said Rupali Jain, general secretary, Silver Oaks RWA ( resident welfare association). Jain said a vegetable vendor runs a store within the society and caters to the everyday needs of people. the residents buy other groceries and essential items from Qutub Plaza which is located in close proximity to the complex. “ The vegetable vendor and staff within the premises have been made aware of the need of practicing social distancing. They keep reminding people to abide by distancing norms while purchasing items. People are asked to stay at a distance of 6 feet from each other. They can only enter the shop one at a time,” said Jain.While the condominium had a strong volunteer network in place to cater to residents, the functioning of the network will have to be streamlined more if the lockdown is extended, Jain added. “We have issued 35 critical care passes to part-time helpers for senior citizens. However, some domestic helpers have stopped coming to the society in light of the pandemic. If the situation persists, the volunteers will have to take more responsibility and deal with the situation. We can work on arranging food or ensure that one volunteer is attached to one senior citizen if the lockdown is extended,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/silver-oaks-puts-needs-of-the-elderly-first-amid-the-lockdown/story-KMAdnbYTPqaDcueRkL7T3M.html
04-04-2020||Noida||RWAs to be booked if imposing ‘weird’ restrictions on residents: Noida police chief||Residents of several housing societies in Gautam Budh Nagar are in a dilemma — whether to follow the lockdown rules of the government or the diktats arbitrarily imposed by various residents’ welfare associations, many of which fly in the face of the orders issued by the government and health officials for the 21-day nationwide lockdown. Sample this message that several residents got from their RWA. “Request we keep strict quarantine with nothing coming into the house from outside — no milk, no bread, no vegetables- nothing at all - for the next 2 weeks. Please. Namak ajwain ki roti with water, agar provisions khatam ho jaaye, is preferable to inviting the virus home. Please do cooperate. Aur, steam inhalation n saline, warm water gargles 3-4 times a day for all, even if one does not have too big an irritation in the throat. Abhi season change ho raha hai. People may come in for a cold n cough. Do not panic. Could be seasonal cold/flu n nothing more serious. Do contact your doc in case these symptoms come with high fever. May God bless us all.”Not to be outdone, other RWAs had even more unscientific diktats, “Newspapers are not allowed in the society, as it may spread coronavirus”, another bulk message to residents read. Some did not want residents to even eat vegetables or dairy products. “Doctors have confirmed that all the dairy products and green vegetables available in the market carry coronavirus, so these products are not allowed in the society,” a message said.These separate rules and regulations, many of them baseless and panic inducing, have been devised by RWAs and apartments owners’ associations (AOAs). Recognising the negative impact of these orders, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration and the police have finally decided to take stern action against these residents’ bodies.“No individual or group of individuals are allowed to impose such restrictions. Stern action will be taken against them,” district magistrate Suhas LY said.Commissioner of police Alok Singh also said guidelines for all RWAs and AOAs are being issued. “They can’t impose weird rules on residents. I have asked officials to keep constant watch on all such associations. If they are found guilty of imposing unnecessary restrictions , they will be booked,” he said.In Sector 77, Rajesh Kumar Singh, a Supreme Court lawyer and a resident of a high-rise there, said the administration has become a mute spectator before the whims and fancies of these associations. “These RWAs and AOAs do not have any legal right to issue such messages. They are supposed to take care of maintenance only. But, since the district administration and police have no time to look into these matters, they are imposing their own sets of rules,” he said.In Singh’s society, none of the residents is allowed to take four-wheelers out of the society, unless they belong to a company which falls in the category of essential services. Hence, to do grocery shopping, one has to walk to the market and haul the items back home. “ How would senior citizens in my society do this? There is no provision to deliver essential items to their doorstep,” SIngh said.In Arun Vihar, Sector 29, the RWA issued a strange notice Friday. “They will allow us to go out only for three hours — between 6am and 9am. If all residents start moving about at the same time, how will we ensure social distancing? It will be futile stepping out at that hour as not many shops before 9am. The administration must take punitive action against these RWAs that don’t know the difference between making rules and breaking them,” one of the residents, preferring anonymity, said.In Sector 21, the RWA has closed the dairy and vegetable booths.However, the umbrella associations to which these RWas belong do not support these restrictions. PS Jain, president of Confederation of NCR Residents’ Welfare Association (CONRWA), said he has been asking all RWAs to follow restrictions specified by the government. “But, they are proceeding as per their will. These whims will land them in trouble,” he said.Colonel (retired) Shashi Vaid, the reporting authority of all RWAs in Arun Vihar in sectors 29, 30 and 37, said such restrictions was brought to his notice. “If anyone is doing so to create panic, it is highly condemnable. I’ll look into these matters,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/rwas-to-be-booked-if-imposing-weird-restrictions-on-residents-noida-police-chief/story-ec10csVWGLEUk1IiRhSbYK.html
04-04-2020||Delhi||Cops seek CCTV footage of Markaz, register of attendees||The Delhi Police has sought details of the number of CCTV cameras inside the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin, which has emerged as the single largest source of Covid-19 infections across the country. The police also asked Tablighi Jamaat’s head, Maulana Saad, to preserve the footage. Saad and six other top management officials of Tablighi Jamaat are currently facing a probe for defying restrictions on gatherings. In the first information report registered by the crime branch, Saad and others have been accused of defying the state government’s orders of March 13 and 16.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe state government, on those dates, had banned all gatherings, including religious ones.Other details sought by the investigating officers pertained to the “original register/data/and records maintained by the management of the Markaz” with regards to those who participated in the congregation since March 12, including foreigners. Question number 17 in the police’s letter is related to details of the action that the management took to disperse the gathering after the government’s order on March 13.Saad’s lawyer, Fuzail Ayyubi, said they would send a reply to the police at the earliest. He also denied reports on social media that Saad was absconding or had been summoned by the police. “Police have requested us to provide answers to some questions, under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code. We are filing the questionnaire and will provide a detailed response. We are complying with the police’s directions and will cooperate. The maulana is in self-isolation, as advised by the doctors. He is not absconding.” Also Read: Lack of PPE, poor infection control put medical staff at risk of Covid-19The total number of positive Covid-19 cases increased from 293 to 386 on Friday, of which 259 are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat that took place in Nizamuddin early March. The death toll went up from four on Thursday to six on Friday. Three of the six deaths were linked to the Nizamuddin Markaz, the biggest hot spot of the Covid-19 infections.Meanwhile, the police, along with the Delhi government and the ministry of home affairs, is identifying the places where those who attended the Markaz might have visited. District administration officials said the list of people, who could have come in contact with those who tested positive from the Markaz, is being prepared by the Central government. “They do the first round of contact tracing and send us the list. We then execute the standard operating procedure, which is to go to these people and quarantine them accordingly. In the process, we might find more people who could have come in contact,” a senior official said. Also Read: India’s coronavirus cases hit 3,000; two die in DelhiAnother official said a tracking centre has been set up in Laxmi Nagar, from where the list of contact tracing is generated and sent to all districts in the city. “The local police and the district administration get these lists and, then arrange home visits and calls,” the official said.“In this case (of Markaz), we are mostly testing all those who possibly came in contact with those who tested positive. Some, who were in close proximity to the Markaz, have been advised home-quarantine,” the official said. A senior official said the local administration is deploying civil defence volunteers to assist Delhi Police to reach out to all the contacts. “The process has taken us a lot of visits and it is still on. We are also getting inputs from other states, where people from the Markaz have tested positive. So, they are being asked to identify the places they visited and the people they met. Based on their responses, the respective state governments give us additional input and we send out teams there,” a third official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cops-seek-cctv-footage-of-markaz-register-of-attendees/story-CqT69RPnwXCT3XFAs2pv7I.html
04-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 update: Shelters make do without thermal sensors in Delhi||Until early Sunday, Delhi witnessed a mass exodus—thousands of migrant workers on their way back to villages and towns hundreds of kilometres away—either in buses arranged by other states or on foot.By 7am Sunday, the state borders were sealed and orders were issued by the central government directing states to screen all migrants including both groups, the one that was part of the exodus and the other that stayed back in government-run shelters.The screening required thermal scanners—a device that accurately records and reflects a careful analysis of body heat, an indicator that can be used to test an individual for potential infection of Covid-19, the disease that has claimed thousands of lives across countries.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“But, in Delhi, at such short notice, logistics are a problem,” a senior government official said.So the 234 night-shelters in Delhi—which are currently occupied by around 8,000 homeless persons and 12,000 migrant workers who became homeless due to the 21-day lockdown imposed last week to prevent the spread of Covid-19—are currently managing with ordinary mercury thermometers for this purpose, a government official said.Also Read: India’s coronavirus cases hit 3,000; two die in Delhi“We have procured 1,200 thermometers so that each night shelter gets at least five. The teams supervising these shelters have been instructed to assess body temperatures only by putting the thermometers in the armpits of the inhabitants of the shelters, not their mouths. After each reading, the thermometer has to be disinfected,” Bipin Rai, member of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, said.Rai further said, “Thermal scanners may take time to reach the shelters considering logistic issues during the lockdown. We have asked the revenue department to provide us with at least one thermal scanner per night shelter. Till then, we shall have to use thermometers and maintain records.”A senior official in the Delhi chief secretary’s office said: “Yes, logistics are currently a problem. But we are doing our best to provide thermal scanners in these shelters. Currently, the government quarantine centres have them.”“Traditionally, body temperature has been measured using contact thermometers that are placed on the forehead or in the mouth, ear, armpit or rectum. Non-contact thermometers allow a person’s temperature to be taken with minimal (tympanic) or no (non-contact infrared thermometer [NCIT], thermal scanner) contact with the person. This means the temperature can be measured without the discomfort of having to sit still with a thermometer in the mouth, armpit, or rectum long enough to obtain a correct temperature reading,” Satender Singh, a doctor at Delhi government’s GTB Hospital, said.Also Read: Lack of PPE, poor infection control put medical staff at risk of Covid-19He further said: “The lack of contact also means the disinfection process of thermometers is minimal or unnecessary, allowing for easier and faster use when screening large numbers of people in settings such as airports or border crossings. The main types of non-contact thermometers are non-contact infrared thermometers, tympanic thermometers, and thermal scanners.” “As far as accuracy is concerned, there is not much difference in case of a thermal scanner and a thermometer when placed in the armpit or below the tongue. It is only the rectal reading that provides a better assessment of core body temperature.

Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe total number of positive Covid-19 cases increased from 293 to 386 on Friday, of which 259 are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat that took place in Nizamuddin early March. The death toll went up from four on Thursday to six on Friday. Three of the five deaths were linked to the Nizamuddin Markaz, the biggest hot spot of the Covid-19 infections. Between Thursday and Friday, 77 new positive cases from the Markaz were reported in the Capital. Kejriwal, during his daily media address, urged people not to panic over the surge in the number of Covid-19 cases and asserted that Delhi is still safe from the community transmission. Also Read: Scientists, regulators do double shifts to keep up“It (the number of cases) looks worrisome at first. Of the total cases in Delhi, only 38 are local transmission cases. These patients got the virus after coming in contact with the 58 foreign travel patients who tested positive. This figure of local transmission cases has remained almost constant for a while now, which gives us hope that there is no spread of corona in Delhi,” he said.Kejriwal said it is vital that everyone follows the 21-day national lockdown, to control the spread of the disease, which has killed at least 51,000 people worldwide. “We have to learn from other nations and, follow social distancing and lockdown norms stringently,” he said. Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Friday reiterated the message in his daily meeting with the CM, ministers and bureaucrats. Emphasising on social distancing at all hunger relief centres (HRCs), Baijal also asked the police and revenue officials to keep a strict vigil on all 20,232 home-quarantine cases, and take deterrent action against the violators. “Commissioner of police, SN Shrivastava, said that technology and human intelligence are being used effectively to systematically trace all contacts of patients and suspects. Ninety-five persons who have violated home quarantine have already been booked,” the L-G’s office said in a statement. Also Read: Lack of PPE, poor infection control put medical staff at risk of Covid-19To engage with parents and schoolchildren, who are at home throughout the day since all educational institutions are shut, the CM said he would hold an interactive session at 3pm on Saturday, to bust some of the myths related to coronavirus and also tell them about the Dos and Don’ts. “Delhi has around 44 lakh students studying in government, MCD and private schools. I am sure they have a lot of questions now that they are sitting at home. Tomorrow at 3pm, Manish Sisodia, a few experts and I will interact with all students and parents of Delhi. Children have many questions about the corona, its symptoms and nature. We will address the children and parents on ‘parenting in the time of corona’ and try to clear their doubts,” he said.An official in deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s office said that the experts would comprise medical practitioners and child psychologists. Introducing a Covid-19 helpline chatbot, the CM anyone can initiate a conversation by sending “hi” or “hello” to a WhatsApp number — 8800007722.Also Read: India’s coronavirus cases hit 3,000; two die in Delhi“The Delhi government is issuing a WhatsApp number today, which will provide you with all information related to Corona. A menu will appear when you message ‘Hi’ to this number on WhatsApp. Information on hunger relief centres, Covid-19 symptoms, measures taken by the Delhi government to deal with the pandemic and other reports can be gathered from this number,” he said. In other relief measures, Kejriwal said that 60% of the 71 lakh ration cardholders have received 7.5kg free ration for this month, while the distribution for the rest is underway. The chief minister also said his government will start distributing ration to those without cards in about a week. Earlier in the day, he held a meeting with all MLAs and asked them to draw up a list of the applicants in their constituencies. The MLAs were also asked to continue supplying ration and meal packets in their areas, while ensuring adequate resources are available at the hunger relief centres. On his announcement of doubling the pension for widows, senior citizens and the differently-abled, he said Rs 5,000 has been disbursed to the 8 lakh beneficiaries and another Rs 5,000 will be credited to their accounts in a week.“To ensure no person in Delhi goes hungry, 1780 HRCs have been opened in Delhi, where lunch and dinner are being provided. Yesterday (Thursday), these 1,780 HRCs provided lunch to 652,850 people and dinner to 630,000 people. 328 shelters have been opened in Delhi for migrant labourers and those from other places. These shelters can accommodate 57,270 people, and 11,443 people are living in them. So, we have an excess of food and shelter arrangements as of now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-calls-for-calm-amid-spike-in-cases-to-interact-with-students-launches-helpline/story-ETfMQdsbHs7mg2tPGWwPhL.html
04-04-2020||Gurugram||Experts press on need for increased testing as Gurugram sees relative success with contact tracing, vigilance||Despite a surge in the number of Covid-19 (coronavirus disease) cases from 10 to 15 on Thursday, following a week’s lull when the city did not report any new cases, Gurugram’s numbers remain lower than that of Delhi and Noida-- 386 in NCT and 54 in Gautam Budh Nagar, respectively. While this trend has been of some comfort for residents, experts and officials cautioned that Gurugram has, conversely, reported the highest number of cases in Haryana. They added that it also has all the makings of an infection ‘cluster’, given its jet setting population, connectivity with the IGI Airport and the national capital. As uncertainty looms over the spread of Covid-19 in the district, experts said they can only ascertain a clearer picture of an outbreak, if any, in the region by rapidly scaling up testing. But, for now, India is only testing symptomatic cases because of a shortage in the number of kits, which are in high demand globally, said the Indian Council for Medical Research.Though the country has sought to buy more testing kits from the international market and the Central government is mulling adopting a new method of testing, an expert HT spoke with said a large number of cases in Gurugram simply may not have been captured as they remain asymptomatic and, thus, have not been tested. Health officials, however, said the low numbers were because of the containment measures adopted. “It is due to efficient contact tracing and isolation of suspected cases and foreign travellers that we have not seen the numbers go up,” chief medical officer Dr Jaswant Singh Punia said. Dr Punia added that a total of 5,000 people with recent international travel history were monitored aggressively to contain the spread of Covid-19 in Gurugram. “About 1,000 of them have finished their quarantine period (mostly at home) and 4,000 are still under observation,” he said.SCALING UP TESTING Testing capabilities in Haryana, like the rest of the country, are low. Only about 150 samples are being tested per day in a state with an estimated population of at least 25 million. From Gurugram, which has an estimated a population of about 15 lakh people, anything between 30 and 80 samples are sent for testing per day. “However, by April 10, the state will increase its testing capacity to 500 samples per day,” said Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, the nodal officer for Covid-19 in Haryana and the head of the department of pulmonary and critical care at PGIMS-Rohtak. On Wednesday, April 1, Dr Chaudhary had said the state has enough kits to last it 10 days, but could not provide the number of PCR kits it would receive from the ICMR. He added that availability of kits aside, the lab in Rohtak can only process 70 samples a day due to limited resources. Similarly, a government lab in a Sonepat medical college has been testing about 70 samples per day.“While we have adequate resources for the next 10 days, we have ordered additional machinery and resources to speed up testing in the days to come. The Haryana government is also tying up with a private company to manufacture reagents required for testing,” he said. In Haryana, two government labs (PGIMS-Rohtak and Bhagat Phool Singh Medical College in Sonepat) and five private labs have been allowed to take samples for Covid-19 testing. Of the latter, only SRL Limited and Core Diagnostic have started taking 20-30 samples per day starting March 31. On March 29, state health minister Anil Vij had said new labs would be opened in Karnal, Nalhad, Agroha, Hisar and Panchkula to increase the testing rates for Haryana. However, officials did not clarify by when would these labs become operational. HOW MANY SHOULD WE TEST?Given the limited capacity to test for Covid-19, Dr Chaudhary said, “We have to be reasonable about whom we test. A specific group has to be identified as having high probability of contracting the virus, such as health workers or direct contacts of those who have already tested positive.” He added that most samples in Haryana are coming from Gurugram since it is one of the most affected districts compared to others. From Gurugram, each day 30 to 80 samples are being sent to the Rohtak lab. Since February, 647 samples (about 10% of total persons screened) have been sent for testing. “Initially, we were sending samples to AIIMS-Delhi. But from March 14, we shifted testing to the Rohtak lab. We get test results within a day now instead of the Two-day waiting time earlier,” the CMO said, adding that presently, results are awaited for 48 samples from Gururgam. By comparison, Delhi has sent over 2,000 samples for testing, while Noida has sent over 700. Other experts, too, were in agreement with Dr Chaudhary about the need to test cautiously. Dr Prabhakaran Dorairaj, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, said, “Indiscriminate testing is simply not feasible, but we must test more liberally while continuing to ensure prevention. Health workers and people showing mild symptoms must be tested on priority instead of waiting for their symptoms to become severe. Even some asymptomatic patients linked to positive or suspected cases can be included to widen the net.”However, experts were reluctant to prescribe an ideal rate of testing. A community health specialist affiliated with a university in Delhi, seeking anonymity, said, “In Korea, 6,000 people per million have been tested, while in Japan only 100 people per million have been tested. Despite the difference, both countries have seen similar patterns of outbreak and ‘flattening of the curve’, so it is difficult to prescribe an ideal rate of testing. But yes, testing needs to be more.” ASYMPTOMATIC CASESAnother possible reason for Gurugram’s low number of Covid-19 cases, so far, is that most people who may have contracted the novel coronavirus remain asymptomatic. “It is entirely possible that these cases have not been tested and therefore, not been found. This is yet another reason to ramp up testing, to include even those who may not be showing signs of illness,” said Dr Dorairaj. It must be noted that most cases of Covid-19 from Gurugram are not repoted to have not shown any major symptoms.VIGILANCE AND SPREADMeanwhile, health officials were also quick to point out the absence of any Covid-19 hotspots in Gurugram as opposed to Delhi and Noida, where the Tablighi Jamaat and a fire-safety company have become hot spots. Of the 15 cases reported among Gurugram residents, nine have recovered and been discharged from hospitals, leaving six active cases. Of these, only one is linked to the Tableeghi Jamat congregation in Delhi. Speaking to HT on Thursday, CMO Dr Punia said, “The first two positive cases we saw in Gurgram were linked to people travelling from Delhi, who were working in MNCs. We immediately ordered all MNCs to let employees work from home to curb the inflow of people from Delhi. Gurugram became vigilant even before the lockdown began.”However, the search for potential infection clusters in Gurugram is underway. Health officials said they have collected samples from slums to check the extent of the spread. “In one of the Covid-19 cases (reported March 20) we were suspecting a maid to be Covid-19 positive. Thankfully, she was not. But we visited the area where she lives and took some 50 samples from the community to check to see if any cases emerged from there,” said an official, who preferred not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/experts-press-on-need-for-increased-testing-as-ggm-sees-relative-success-with-contact-tracing-vigilance/story-8Xrw0nDLi7UlGcAKmU31qM.html

04-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad: 8 booked for non-disclosure of participation in religious congregations, 177 in quarantine||The Ghaziabad police has booked six Nepalese nationals and two clerics of a mosque in Pasonda for staying at the mosque and not revealing the information to the local administration. The eight persons were earlier picked up by the health department on April 1 and confined to a quarantine facility.According to police, the six had come from Nepal in March and stayed at Kaila Bhatta area from where they moved to the mosque in Pasonda on March 21. The police said the FIR was registered under the IPC and provisions of the Epidemic Act and the Disaster Management Act at Tila Morh police station.“The six persons did not disclose their whereabouts and had come to the mosque to attend a Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation. The mosque in Pasonda is a sub centre of the Jamaat. The two clerics also did not disclose anything about the Nepali residents and all of them were staying at the mosque. All eight were found during a search and sent to quarantine facility. An FIR against them was registered on Friday,” Rakesh Mishra, circle officer (Sahibabad), said.The health department officials on Friday evening said they have picked up 177 persons in Ghaziabad who had attended different religious congregations, including the one held at Nizamuddin in Delhi in March.They further added that temporary sealing of the Savior Park high-rise in Mohan Nagar, where a couple had tested positive for Covid-19, was extended and it will remain sealed until further orders. The high-rise has about 500 families.“The building was sealed after a couple tested positive for Covid-19. They have 93 contacts within the building and 27 people from the high-rise are still in quarantine. The building will be sealed till further orders from the district administration,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, said.The woman who tested positive is an employee of Noida-based company Ceasefire, which has reported several Covid-19 cases. She had passed on the infection to her husband, the officials said.“A 30-year-old male employee of the company and his two contacts, a 29-year-old woman employee of the same company and another man from Duhai, have already contracted Covid-19. The surge in cases in Ghaziabad is due to employees of the Noida company or their contacts and also due to people who have attended religious congregations,” Dr Gupta said.“The district magistrates and police chiefs will monitor quarantine facilities and they will be held responsible in case there is any lapse in safety and security at these centres. To enforce the lockdown, the state police has also been asked to make use of drones for surveillance activities,” UP principal secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad said.During the ongoing countrywide lockdown, the UP police till Friday afternoon has registered 7,662 FIRs and booked 24,537 violators of lockdown norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-8-booked-for-non-disclosure-of-participation-in-religious-congregations-177-in-quarantine/story-cvfuhCDJY8kMyVHutZG1qO.html

04-04-2020||Pune||With 61 positive cases, Pune is Maharashtra’s 2nd Covid-19 hotspot||On Friday, 25 days after the Maharashtra’s first Covid-19 case was detected in Pune, the district reported 61 positive cases, which include two persons who died in Pune city and those who were discharged in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.A few sporadic cases of community transmission were also reported in the city wherein the patients had no history of foreign travel or known contact with a positive patient.The first case, reported on March 9 and identified as ‘zero patients’ for Covid19 was that of a husband-wife couple who has returned from Dubai. This couple was not screened at the airport as Dubai, then, was not in the list of high risk countries.Pune, with 61 positive cases, has recorded the second highest number of cases in Maharashtra, after Mumbai (235 cases).Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said that the containment plan is in place in almost all the areas of the city.“Since the first case was recorded in the city on March 9, we put in place the containment place as prescribed by the government. Currently almost the entire city is covered. We started with containing the areas of about 1 to 3 kilometres of radius where a positive patient is found,” he said.A notification from the ministry of health & family welfare said, “The cluster containment strategy would be to contain the disease within a defined geographic area by early detection, breaking the chain of transmission and thus preventing its spread to new areas. This would include geographic quarantine, social distancing measures, enhanced active surveillance, testing all suspected cases, isolation of cases, home quarantine of contacts, social mobilization to follow preventive public health measures.”As of now, a few areas where multiple cases have been identified include, Sinhgad road where the Dubai return couple resides, Kondhwa, where people had returned from the Tablighi event in Delhi and Ambegaon where woman who was admitted to Bharati Hospital lives. The woman who was critical eventually recovered.Pune also saw a few possible cases of community transmission of patients with no foreign travel history or direct contact with a positive Covid-19 case.The city recorded two deaths, the first on March 30 when a 52-year-old businessman with multiple ailments from Thane was declared dead at a city hospital while the second death was reported on Thursday at the Sassoon Government Hospital of a 50-year-old woman with no other health condition. The city also saw the miraculous recovery of a 41 year old aanganwadi worker who was admitted to Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital on March 16. She tested negative, twice, for the virus on March 31 after being on the ventilator for almost 11 days. Area sanitisation by Pune municipal corporationThe Pune Municipal Corporation has been spraying a solution of 1% sodium chlorite as a part of area sanitisation of localities where a positive patient was found. Such sanitisation has been done in 16 locations in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-61-positive-cases-pune-is-maharashtra-s-2nd-covid-19-hotspot/story-A7eZcXJpw4qvNP0NMkCP3J.html
04-04-2020||Pune||Covid-19: Biggest challenge in this disaster is absence of private doctors, says Shantilal Muttha||Pune-based businessman and philanthropist Shantilal Muttha, founder, Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana has a history of undertaking relief work in every major disaster that has struck India in the last 30 years- be it the 1993 Latur and Bhuj (2001) earthquakes or the 2004 tsunami in southern India.This time round, the Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana founded by him has launched 11 mobile clinics in Pune city and a Maharashtra-wide blood donation drive. This is besides creating quarantine facilities for 2,000 patients at the Wagholi Educational and Rehabilitation Centre. Muttha spoke to Abhay Vaidya on the challenges of undertaking relief work during the current Covid-19 crisis.How do you compare the Covid-19 disaster to the other major disasters such as the Latur and Bhuj earthquakes and the 2004 tsunami in which you had led the Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana in the relief work?I have undertaken disaster management work on a number of occasions in the last 30 years and in all those disasters, we never faced any restriction on the movement of our relief workers.In this disaster the situation is that most of our volunteers are unable to step out of their homes. Our challenge is to do the work from home. Some amount of work has to be done on the field; there is no alternative to that. Our relief workers have shown that they have the capacity to take this life-threatening risk.I have been appealing to doctors that I can provide them with relief assistants, but I need them too.We have launched 11 mobile clinics in Pune city; we have the entire support staff but are having great difficulty in getting doctors to go with these mobile clinics. What should the common man do if even doctors are unwilling to step out for relief work? This is the biggest difference that I have seen in this disaster and the previous ones.In any case, we are expanding this mobile clinic service and in the next three days you will see another 30 mobile clinics in other parts of Maharashtra.You have introduced 11 mobile clinics in Pune and a blood collection drive across Maharashtra. What were the trigger points for zeroing on these initiatives?I have always tried to anticipate and focus on what would be needed most- especially in the coming days and weeks, after a disaster strikes. What is it that is likely to be neglected?The government is pre-occupied in dealing with the immediate crisis at hand. The first thing I did was to offer our entire educational complex at Wagholi for creating quarantine/isolation facilities. We have 250 rooms there with attached toilets and a capacity to house 2,000 patients. Each of these rooms have been equipped with beds, mattresses, hot water for bathing, drinking water and basic infrastructure. Government can use this facility as quarantine centre.I focused on the blood donation drive because a massive need for blood will arise after April 14. We won’t realise this now. All the surgeries which have been put on hold will begin. With the resumption of traffic, there will be road accidents and overall, there will be a high demand for blood. We have prepared for that situation.  How are you ensuring the safety of your relief workers who are on the field? We are maintaining social distance, and all have been provided with masks, sanitisers; our vehicles are being sanitised daily. All precautions are being taken. As we are aware, the relief work is happening on a massive scale. Where do you see the gaps in this relief work?Covid-19 is a health related crisis. The food and nutrition of the people have to be taken care of. One of the biggest gaps I see is the unavailability of private doctors in this crisis. This is the time when they need to step forward and participate in the relief work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-biggest-challenge-in-this-disaster-is-absence-of-private-doctors/story-KWb4xMMKboydKnqEz2asFL.html

The ministry has also said that patients should use their hospital papers as pass to commute to the dialysis unit, said Prof Arvind Gupta, head, nephrology department, MLN Medical College, Prayagraj.“Chronic kidney disease stage-5 patients on dialysis are also vulnerable because of their existing co-morbidities, repeated unavoidable exposure to hospital environment and immune-suppressed state. These patients are therefore not only more prone to acquire infection but also develop severe diseases as compared to general population,” he added.The guidelines said the dialysis units should have a signboard posted prominently in the local language as well as Hindi and English asking patients to report any fever, coughing or breathing problem in dialysis unit and waiting area.All hemodialysis units should educate their personnel, including nephrologists, nurses, technicians and all patients undergoing treatment along with their caregivers about COVID-19, it said.The 7-page guidelines also recommends that every patient should be asked about symptoms suspected of COVID-19, history of contact with a diagnosed case of coronavirus infection and history of contact with person who has had recent travel to foreign country or from high COVID-19 prevalence area within the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/centre-to-states-earmark-one-hemodialysis-facility-in-every-districts/story-ajnkkkFgYlyTb41OmddXsI.html

Kadhe explains over WhatsApp his days and nights under lockdown.The player admits that he sleeps early only when training is going on. He is adjusting to the home-bound lifestyle by learning a few things that he could not earlier because of time crunch.“It is a rough schedule nowadays, but the good thing is that unlike my training period that was like clockwork, now I have a luxury to pick and choose my workout time.Morning sessionI wake up at 9am and do yoga, eat breakfast and relax.

I know to prepare pasta and continental, but Indian food is something which is missing from my menu card till now.Afternoon sessionI generally relax till 3.30-4pm and then head to the parking space of my residential complex for workout. I do band workout or stairs workout. As I reside on the sixth floor of our seven-floor building, I climb up and down the stairs 10 times.Gaurav (Nijohn), my trainer, has given me a programme like free weight strengthening and balance core. I have a programme set for me that I follow every day.Evening sessionOnce the workout is done, I have my dinner and then TV shows and a bit of reading. I also spend time with my family.New apparatus for gymAs we are not allowed to hit the gym during the lockdown period, so I am using kitchen supplies like 10kg wheat bag and my suitcase filled with stuff for squats.HobbyCooking is on my priority list.

04-04-2020||Mumbai||HC refuses to discharge SBC Bank officer in Hasan Ali Khan money laundering case||The Bombay high court (HC) has refused to discharge an official of the SBC Bank at Singapore, booked for allegedly aiding Pune businessman Hasan Ali Khan who is accused of laundering over USD 8 billion in foreign banks. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has claimed that Vishwanathan Venugopal, the SBC Bank officer, helped Khan in opening an account with the foreign bank and thus committed an offence under section 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.The agency, in January 2007, registered a case against Khan for allegedly laundering crores in foreign banks. The ED, at the end of the investigation, concluded that Venugopal, being an account opening official in SBC Bank at Singapore, had aided Khan in concealing his crime-tainted money.The ED then filed a plea, requesting the special PMLA court in the city to take cognisance of offences committed by Venugopal and 10 others under section 3 of the PMLA - direct, indirect involvement in concealing proceeds of crimes or aiding or assisting any such activity.Venugopal moved the high court after the special PMLA court on November 22, 2018, issued process against him based on ED’s plea and also summoned him.The SBC bank employee argued in the HC there was no material on record to even remotely indicate that process could be issued to prosecute him under section 3 of the PMLA. He also contended that the order under challenge was passed by the special PMLA court “without application of mind”.Justice Sadhana Jadhav, who was hearing the case, refused to accept Venugopal’s contention. The judge said that it is not appropriate for any court to undertake a roving enquiry into the investigation at this initial stage. “All that is expected by the court is to ascertain whether prima facie a case is made out against the accused,” said the judge.The HC also noted that Venugopal had opened an account with the SBC Bank in Singapore based on forged documents and this has been confirmed by the principal accused Khan, and other accused Kashinath Tapuriah and Amlendu Pandey.The HC then rejected the bank officer’s plea, stating that it could not be said that ED had filed a complaint without any material evidence and therefore the agency deserved an opportunity to substantiate the allegations by adducing substantive evidence and the documents collected during the investigation.The court said it can’t be oblivious to the fact that this is an economic offence affecting the society at large. “It affects the economic health of the society as well as national economy and therefore, it would not be appropriate to quash the order of issuance of process at this stage,” said the judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-to-discharge-sbc-bank-officer-in-hasan-ali-khan-money-laundering-case/story-c49glxNmNEnM3ZrpMzVnvL.html

In case of any violation, strict action will be taken by the administration under the law,”said UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida.People under quarantine are in no way supposed to move out of their location. Notices have also been put up outside their residences with the names and number of quarantined people in the house. Their status is also stamped on the back of their hands.“There have been reports from police and neighbours about people not following all the laid down conditions of quarantine. In one case, questions were raised over the efficacy of the present measures in maintaining quarantine when the notice outside an IAS officer’s house was torn off. So it was decided that services of telecom operators would be requisitioned to track their movement,” said a senior UT official privy to the development.States asked not to send patients without PGI consentThe administration has requested counterparts in neighboring states not to send any patients without consultation and consent of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). This was decided to ensure that PGIMER, which has been declared a dedicated Covid Wing (Nehru Extension) can devote its full energy and resources to fight against the outbreak. Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER, clarified that there was no shortage of funds for medicines and equipment in PGIMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/telecom-operators-to-track-people-under-quarantine-in-chandigarh/story-BZpV8rMbdxFt1fNIiVNbvI.html

The total active cases in the city has now reached 15, of whom nine have recovered and are in home quarantine for 14 days.While the four residents include a 45-year-old man from Sun City who had travelled to Bombay, his 70-year-old father and two 22-year-old private hospital nurses from Jharsa, the 38-year-old is one of the 25 people confirmed to have attended a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in March in Delhi.The Tablighi Jamaat religious group is now feared to be driving the outbreak in the country. The country’s overall number of confirmed cases crossed the 2,000-mark, also soaring by a record number. The national surge too was largely driven by Tablighi Jamaat-linked infections from states such as Tamil Nadu, where all 75 new infections were linked.In all, about 9,000 members of the Islamic group have been quarantined or are being sought out to be isolated after they attended events at the Delhi building that is believed to have turned into a hotbed of the infection this month.Haryana’s health minister Anil Vij on Wednesday, had said at least 524 people who attended the congregation were traced in Haryana, which has formed a special task force with 500 personnel for this task.On Thursday, police said 22 of 25 identified persons were sent to a quarantine facility in Sector 9. Two persons are yet to be traced, the police said.Police commissioner Muhammad Akil on Thursday saidareas in which the suspected people live have also been sealed.It could not be confirmed from the health department if disinfection of these areas, in old Gurugram, had started Thursday.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, said, “We have taken samples of those identified by the police and sent them for testing to Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma PG Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak. They will be kept in the quarantine facility in Sector 9 for 14 days. Police teams have been deployed so identified persons do not leave the centre. The police personnel have been provided with safety kits (eye gear, masks, gloves and overalls) to prevent infection.”District sealed“Gurugram borders connecting Jhajjar, Rewari, Delhi, Nuh and Palwal are no longer open for people except for those supplying essential commodities or those with medical emergency. We are even checking the ambulances plying near the borders to ensure no affected person takes advantage of the situation,” Akil said.33 test negativeAccording to the CMO, 27 persons from Pataudi and six from Dhankot, who were put under quarantine at the Sector 9 facility, tested negative for Covid-19 on Thursday. “We are taking precaution to avoid community transmission,” Punia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/five-new-covid-19-cases-reported-in-gurugram/story-rsWsw1f0nPJGVMPEv530iL.html

04-04-2020||Gurugram||Life in lockdown: Gurugram’s Emaar Palm Drive’s network of volunteers tends to its needs||Emaar Palm Drive in Sector 66 is channelising community spirit to deal with the ongoing nationwide lockdown that was announced to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The condominium has created a network of volunteers and tower champions who tend to the needs of both residents and staff members as they stay confined to the complex.Wing Commander (retd) Amit Chowdhury, president, Palm Drive Condominium Association, said that the condominium had appointed a champion for each tower block, who was responsible for catering to the needs of residents of that tower. “The tower champion takes care of everyone residing in a particular tower. (S)he caters to the needs of senior citizens, people who are sick, or anyone requiring any other assistance. They coordinate the garbage collection drive and ensure that food is delivered to residents, among other chores,” Chowdhury said.The condominium has been under lockdown since March 23 and has restricted the entry of all outsiders and part-time staff, except in cases of emergency. The entry of part-time domestic help, drivers, car cleaners, dog-walkers, among others has been barred with some exceptions as in the case of senior citizens who require assistance. “There are two apartments in our condominium inhabited by senior citizens who can’t keep a full-time maid. We have allowed part-time help for them as an exception. As per the directions issued by the MCG, we have secured curfew passes for their help,” Chowdhury said.The entry of external vendors such as food delivery agents, courier services, newspaper vendors, among others has been restricted to the tower gate of the condominium. Residents are required to collect the deliveries from the gate. All persons entering the building are required to use hand sanitiser and get their temperatures checked. The condominium has one dedicated lift for people coming from outside. Residents using the other lifts have been advised to sanitise themselves before and after using the lift. All lifts and buttons are sanitised with disinfectants twice a day.On routine days, the apartment requires the services of around 300 staff members but has cut down the strength to 90 because of the lockdown. “All 90 members have been housed inside the complex. We had arranged for mattresses and other bedding requirements early on. We have set up a kitchen for them that is fully manned by the staff living here. No member of the staff steps out,” Chowdhury said. The staff has been given accommodation inside a school building within the complex to cut down exposure to the outside world. “While moving in and out of the complex has been curtailed to cut down the exposure, we also factored in the fact that most of the people here are migrant workers living away from family and would find it challenging to take care of themselves while handling work. We are supporting them while they continue to work,” Chowdhury said.The condominium has also been collecting funds from residents for running boarding and lodging facilities for security, technical support, gardening, and housekeeping staff staying on the campus. “People are contributing in cash and kind. They are providing ration and paying for the cooks and other staff working here,” Chowdhury said.Since March 13, the condominium has been taking a disclaimer from people coming from outside. Residents are required to share their travel history and declare if they are coming from any affected countries. In case of travel history, the RWA informs the MCG, which follows up with self-quarantine posters.A shopping complex within the premises is catering to the everyday needs of people, who are supposed to abide by social distancing rules while purchasing commodities. Residents have been advised to wear masks and sanitise their hands before entering and after leaving the shop. No more than two residents are allowed inside the shop at a time. Shopkeepers have been asked to ensure that no more than five individuals (including shop staff) are allowed inside. “We are ensuring that every person entering the shopping complex wears a mask. We have circled markings on the floor at a distance of five-six feet from each other so that people maintain a gap while standing in the queue,” Wing Commander (retd) Baljit S Ahluwalia, a resident coordinator, said. Ahluwalia said that the condominium was observing a total lockdown and was toying with the idea of providing services until the doorstep as the next step. “We are observing a total lockout where residents are not allowed to go out unless absolutely necessary. We have requested residents to stay indoors and even skip their morning walks or jogging schedules,” Ahluwalia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/life-in-lockdown-emaar-palm-drive-s-network-of-volunteers-tends-to-its-needs/story-y9CCUztO061N78RP6vpcWP.html

This Sunday, Tellis, an impassioned biker and the proud owner of a 10-year-old Yamaha Virago, decided to get together with a few like-minded friends for an early morning ride on the eastern express highway, en route to Nashik. “We flagged off at 6am and rode for a magical hour-and-a-half and then decided to break for coffee, before riding back,” he says, adding, “In fact, there are so many passion points that one can still pursue during this time of social distancing, such as cycling, running or walking…”Thanks to his break from work, Tellis also plans to catch a healthy dose of the big, wide open later this week, when he will drive down en famille, to his weekend home in Pawna. “My 25-year-old son said a very interesting thing recently: he said the pandemic is making us re-evaluate our lives, introspect on our values and prioritise on what really matters,” says Tellis, adding, “Many of us on the fast-track never had the time to do that. It’s a great time to pause and take stock.”But even through this hiatus, Tellis will be seen and heard.

Others in the 9-part series are VJ Gaurav Kapur, actress Dia Handrich and Kubra Sait.Currying FavourThe week saw Bangkok-based chef Gaggan Anand join fellow celebrity chefs such as Massimo Bottura and José Andrés to make a plea for the F&B industry, especially small and local restaurateurs impacted severely by the current coronavirus pandemic.Anand took to social media to post his heartfelt message. “We are at the edge of losing many restaurants with incredible chefs. All foodies in the world, I understand you are in the crisis of humanity. I beg you all… give business to your local chefs and your restaurants. Every one of them needs your support”, he shared.The past week had been particularly busy for Gaggan, as he went ahead with the opening of his newest restaurant, a characteristic quirkily named ‘Ms Maria and Mr Singh’, which he describes enigmatically, as “a casual curry house with Mexican influences.” The restaurant opened its doors over the weekend in the property that had formerly housed Gaggan’s steakhouse Meatlicious (which had closed earlier this year). “Finally my curry house dream has crashed into Mexico,” he said.The eatery, we are informed, will serve dishes such as Papdi Chaat, Chicken Liver Curry, Prawn Balchao and Tenderloin Biryani.Tweet TalkI asked the Yes Bank accountant to tell me about his balance sheet. He told me “On the left side nothing is right, on the right side nothing is left.”Industrialist Harsh GoenkaStretching It In StyleSinger and yoga instructor Shweta Shetty is a tad disappointed that her upcoming supper club event with Dalip Tahil and Roshan Abbas has been cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The three of us were working hard on it and it had to be pulled back at the last minute,” says the attractive songstress.Meanwhile, Shweta is concentrating on her personal yoga routine in the confines of her home. “Yoga relaxes me,” she says, adding, “The pranayama is especially useful in calming one down. There is a barrage of alarming messages from everywhere. But after a one-hour routine of yoga, I feel immensely restored and even optimistic about the future. Whether I’m doing Surya Namaskars or meditating, I manage to shut out the world and find my centre.”This adopting of a disciplined practice to combat negative thoughts and anxiety comes effortlessly to the daughter of a 95-year-old father who until just a couple of years ago would clock in a two-hour daily yoga routine, which saw him through many a health crises and life struggle, she says.“Rich or poor, we’ve all been brought down to our knees by nature; everyone has their anxieties: rents to be paid, bills have to be footed and people are unable to get out of their houses and attend to work. And nobody knows how long this is going to last. But if you let it get to you, it can get out of hand. That’s where yoga comes in,” she says, signing off with what appears to be yogic buoyancy: “It’s not World War 3. And we’ve had many such contagious viruses before – SARS, Ebola etc – and we’ve survived. This too, shall pass. And when it does, we’re all going to be hungrier, and we shall rise again, higher than we’ve done before.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/malavika-s-mumbaistan-easy-riders/story-arCT54I5ESo30HyHi23MsL.html
04-04-2020||Gurugram||Forgotten history of Spanish Flu-the epidemic that shook Gurugram in 1918||The Haryana government has declared coronavirus disease (Covid-19) an epidemic, and we have started limiting our travels and public gatherings. We need to be aware that almost 102 years ago, Gurugram was one of the areas that faced the much severe calamity of the influenza or Spanish Flu — one of the most devastating pandemics ever recorded in the world history.This pandemic that shook the world and India in 1918 has been quoted in several news features, but its significant impact on Gurugram is lesser-known to us. Caused by the H1N1 virus, it spread worldwide between 1918 and 1919, although its point of origin is still debated. Unlike the coronavirus of 2020, the influenza virus impacted the mortality rate of young people between 20 and 40 years of age rather than older people.It entered India via sea route in Bombay in July 1918, where it was initially called “naya sardi ka bukhar”. Like any virus, it spread, following the path of its human carriers, along trade routes and shipping lines, as the air routes were fairly new at that time and there was none for India. The Spanish Flu, so named because of the higher number of causalities in Spain in the initial phase, swept through parts of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Brazil and the South Pacific.Laura Spinney, author of Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World, mentions how this disease claimed between 50-100 million lives worldwide, possibly more than both the world wars combined and how India bore the greatest burden of death — almost 1/5th of the entire lot in the world. Though the statistics for mortality are too wide-ranging and debatable, it is accepted by all that the Indian subcontinent was the focal point impacted by this pandemic. Researchers Siddharth Chandra, Goran Kuljanin and Jennifer Wray have calculated mortality from the influenza pandemic in India, using panel data models and data from the Census of India. This counters some of the overly stated ones recorded by Davis in 2018. Statistics apart, some of the most painful experience of this epidemic comes up in the narration of the famous Hindi poet Nirala, who lost most of his family members in the epidemic.This impact of the Spanish Flu in Gurugram is available in research works by Ruby Bala in the proceedings of the Indian History Congress published in 2011 along with some mention by Biresh Chaudhari in his writings on Nationalist Movement in Delhi 1911-32.Initially when this influenza reached Gurugram in the then Punjab Province by August 1918, it was not taken seriously and was passed off as a casual fever since the mortality rate was low. But in the span of next 3 months from September to October 1918, the then Gurgaon district became the worst-affected region in the Punjab province resulting in 63,071 deaths, which was almost 9% of the total district population at that time.In the words of the sanitary commissioner of the Punjab government, “the province was infected from Gurgaon to Campbellpur”. The mortality rate in Gurugram was the highest, followed by Rohtak, Karnal Ferozepur and Hisar. The initial brunt of this influenza was on the postal and telegraph systems, the railways, and the returning military officials because of the nature of their services that required travel and greater interaction. But in the next two months, it spread across the entire population of Gurgaon district and the Punjab Province including the rural areas. It is recorded that from October 15 to November 8, 1918, the entire Punjab province was literally a cemetery or a cremation ground with burials of bodies and burning pyres.Biresh Chaudhari mentions that the pandemic was aggravated in Gurugram due to the skyrocketing hike in the prices of necessary articles, such as salt and flour. In fact, a few historians also attribute the increased momentum of the nationalist movement to the impact of this pandemic in India.This important event in Gurugram’s history should better our understanding of survival through difficult times such as today, so that we can tackle the present situation with the responsibility to support our government in their efforts to control this pandemic.(Shikha Jain is state convenor, INTACH Haryana Chapter and member of Heritage Committees under ministries of culture and HRD.
