The IIA is taking feedback from its 40 chapters across the state through webinars.“List of problems is being prepared and apprehensions of industrialists are being dispelled,” said Pankaj Kumar, national president, IIA.“From Noida to Varanasi, we are in touch with our members in 40 districts across the state. We have conveyed that industrial production will resume from May 4 onwards. So, they have started taking adequate measures,” added Kumar.Major problem before industrialists is getting back the adequate workforce and resumption of inter-state transport services.“We are ready to employ migrant workers if our labourers do not return. The MSMEs do not have any objection in hiring migrant workers,” said Manmohan Agarwal, general secretary, IIA.Various lobby bodies of industrialists have conveyed to the state government that maintenance of supply chain was essential for smooth operation of industrial units.“For this, the government will have to make sure that both intra-state and inter-state transport services remain smooth. Availability of raw material and market place for goods manufactured is must for smooth functioning of industrial units,” said Agarwal.The state government has already issued directives for reopening of all industrial units in rural areas.At present only around 7000 MSMEs listed under the ‘essential goods’ category are operational while there are around 9.5 lakh MSMEs in Uttar Pradesh registered with the IIA.Issues passes but ensure sanitization norms are fulfilled: CSLucknow: Chief secretary,Rajendra Kumar Tiwari on Tuesday sent a letter to all the district magistrates (DMs) directing them to arrange early operation of rural micro and small industries situated outside the containment zones/hot spots in rural areas. He asked them to provide permission for operation of all such rural industrial units. Tiwari, however, asked DMs to ensure inspection of such industries by deputy directors, district industry centres and doctors from time to time for compliance of social distancing and sanitization norms. The CS said employees of all such industries must pass through thermal screening and their RT-PCR test should also be done as extra precaution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-seeks-plan-for-reopening-of-msmes/story-9UqKpzmgYZbCtVy08bcP5J.html

28-04-2020||Chandigarh||Migrants workers mortified about going home empty-handed||Ratan Lal, a 24-year-old migrant labourer from Bihar eagerly awaits to go back to his home in Bettiah, as he has not yet seen the face of his infant son, who was born amid the lockdown about 20 days ago.“I want to see my son and wife. My son is 20 days old today, and I haven’t even seen him. Can you imagine how desperate I am to be with my family,” says Ratan, wiping his tears. However, he regularly phones his wife, who is at her mother’s house and does not have an internet-enabled cellphone to send him photo of his son. “I have named my son Krishna, and I pray every day for this lockdown to end so I can meet them.”Ratan and his four friends, who are construction workers in Chandigarh, reached Karnal on March 29 and are waiting for Bihar government to ferry them home.This month, more than 700 labourers have been sent home, but 41 migrant labourers are still awaiting their turn Karnal’s shelter home. The place still reverberates with painful stories of the struggle of migrant labourers. Most of them earn less than ₹500 a day and have left families back home, to come to other states to earn a living.Ruhideen Khan, another Bihari labourer wishes to reach home before his sister’s wedding on May 20.“I promised her I would make it to the wedding, but I am stranded here. Now nobody knows when we will reach home,” he told HT.Most people left in this shelter home are daily wagers and live alone in other cities as they cannot afford to keep their wives and children. Now their biggest problem is that they have no money as they couldn’t work amid the lockdown.“My wife and three children are worried as I could not send a single rupee this month,” said Nawab Singh of Karauli of Rajasthan. Nawab and three other labourers from his hometown worked as masons in Zirakpur, Punjab, and they decide to reach home on foot on March 27. However, they were stopped by police in Karnal the next day and were sent to the shelter home in Kunjpura. “We pass time playing ludo on the cellphone and talking to each other. Although our lives are already full of trials and tribulations, this lockdown is the worst period I have experienced,” said Sonu Sharma, a youth from Khyala in Delhi, who sells sarees in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/migrants-workers-mortified-about-going-home-empty-handed/story-drCPjYT5WBJmLqNrYmL56M.html

Chandigarh has been declared a hotspot (red) zone by the Centre.In a letter to UT finance secretary, association president Pankaj Khanna Khanna said, “Let it not be a trade-off between life and livelihood. Government should do whatever it takes to contain the disease. However, the same sensitivity should be shown towards hand holding the industry in its gravest hours as well.” “The industry is facing its death-knell due to mounting fixed costs including interests, wages, utility bills, taxes and statutory dues. The entrepreneurs here are now defaulting on every statutory financial obligation and there is a dire need for an immediate fiscal stimulus from the Centre,” he added.“As far as rebooting local industries is concerned, it is possible only if parameters of hotspot zones are tweaked by the MHA. If this is done, it would be appropriate to start ‘activities’ permitted by the government in the whole country. Starting these industries in a uniform, hassle-free manner, would be the first ‘tiny’ step in the direction of reviving industries,” Khanna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-industries-body-demands-reassessment-of-preventive-measures-calls-for-fiscal-stimulus/story-JGjVU1Ssp5ptIHCV80dY6H.html
28-04-2020||Mumbai||Difference in Covid-19 case count: Maharashtra government and BMC blame system||An anomaly in the cumulative and daily counts of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, collocated separately by the state health department and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), has raised several questions about data discrepancy. The BMC is out of sync with the state health department over data on Covid-19 infections in the city but has claimed that this is due to 851 duplications of names in the count. The discrepancy has been evident since the day the state and city agencies started releasing Covid-19 data. For instance, the state health department on Monday said the number of infections rose to 5,776 in Mumbai, however, the BMC recorded 5,589 cases during the same period.Civic officials have attributed the discrepancy to the system adopted by private laboratories which have been permitted to conduct tests on suspected Covid-19 patients. Private laboratories report their numbers to the India Council of Medical Research (ICMR) following which the BMC adds them to its tally. The state government receives the private lab data from ICMR but also gets BMC’s count. This often leads to duplication while collating the data, say civic officials. The civic body is now planning to reduce the city’s Covid-19 count, stating that it has detected dual entries in the case of 851 patients. Mumbai municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said, “Duplication of names is one of the reasons behind the confusion over data. By Monday (April 27) we identified 851 duplicate names on the list of Covid-19 positive patients. Now the process of identification and elimination of duplicate names is on. After readjustment of data, the city’s final count will be reduced.” He added that he had discussed the issue with concerned authorities and assured that the collation system will be streamlined within the next two days.Another senior civic official said private labs were to blame as they delayed submission of reports. “Recently, the BMC served a show-cause notice to one of the private labs for the delay in submission of reports on samples of coronavirus cases tested. Many times, cases tested earlier by private labs were added to the fresh lot, which led to data discrepancies,” the official said.As per officials from the state health department, numbers are reported only after coordinating with municipal corporations and receiving ground-level confirmation from districts. “We collect daily information from respective districts, municipal authorities, and private laboratories by 2pm, as we have to process the data. Cases detected after 2pm are added to the tally the next day. There were some discrepancies,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.The discrepancy between the health ministry and BMC data can be resolved by following a uniform data capturing method. Considering this, the state health department has decided to collect data from ICMR’s website. “Now we have decided to follow data on ICMR’s website as a base and after processing. After minimising duplication we will declare the data on a daily basis,” said Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner, National Health Mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/difference-in-covid-19-case-count-maharashtra-government-and-bmc-blame-system/story-FrYpqpmCSue7D4gJc0xpvJ.html

Addressing mediapersons, Surjewala said the state government has amended its procurement policies at least six times in just nine days. “This reflects an anti-farmer mindset. Till April 27, only 21.6 lakh MT of wheat had been procured in Haryana, whereas 91 lakh MT of wheat was procured during the same period in 2019,” he claimed. The Congress leader said the farmers were facing problems as their hard-earned produce was lying in the grain markets.Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja also said that inadequate arrangements for crop purchases have put farmers in deep trouble. “The government had promised to pay farmers for their crop within 24 hours, but not a single farmer in the entire state has been paid even after several days. Seven days have passed since the beginning of the wheat procurement, but payment has neither been made to the farmers nor the arhtiyas,” she alleged. Meanwhile, in a statement, additional chief secretary, agriculture, Sanjeev Kaushal, said about 30.67 lakh MT of wheat has been procured from 3.54 lakh farmers in last nine days. He said that 4.12 lakh MT of wheat was procured on Tuesday. He added that about 2.98 lakh MT of mustard has also been procured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bjp-jjp-govt-betraying-farmers-says-surjewala/story-df0NODivOjllwiP8350V7L.html

28-04-2020||City||Sisodia asks MHRD to promote all students of classes 10 and 12 based on internal exams||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Tuesday asked the Union human resources development ministry to promote all students of classes 10 and 12 on the basis of their scores in internal examinations, just as it had done for students of classes 9 and 11. The government has also asked the ministry to provide Delhi government teachers slots on Doordarshan and AIR [All India Raido] to broadcast classes, amid the Covid-19 lockdown. Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia made the requests during a video conference with Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal. Pokhriyal had convened the meeting with education ministers of all states to take stock of the status of online classes for students amidst the lockdown.“It’s not feasible to conduct the remaining exams for class 10 and 12 students anytime soon. The CBSE should follow the same process it is adopting in case of Class 9 and 11 and promote them on the basis of their internal marks,” Sisodia said in a statement issued after the meeting.Explaining the rationale behind the suggestion, Sisodia in his statement said, “Other states have their own state boards but Delhi has CBSE [Central Board of Secondary Education] as its board. Most CBSE students come from Delhi. Therefore, I appeal to the Union HRD minister that the CBSE is asked to take a similar route for promoting the students as it proposed for classes 9 and 11. In these uncertain times, I don’t know if we will be able to conduct examinations again, so on the basis of same formula like internal assessments, papers already conducted, and others, the students of class 10 and 12 too should be evaluated. This will help us not waste our students’ time and help us not push their academic cycles further and get their studies hampered. The HRD ministry had, earlier this month, announced that all students of classes 9 and 11 will be promoted based on their scores in internal assessments. Sisodia further recommended that the NCERT [National Council of Educational Research and Training] and CBSE reduce the syllabus in the next academic cycle by 30% across classes. “All assessments should be conducted from the truncated syllabus. The same reduced syllabus should be the basis of entrance exams like JEE, NEET, etc, in 2021,” he said.Sisodia further requested the HRD minister to help the Delhi government get Doordarshan and AIR airtime to broadcast their classes live. “We are using the online medium and collaborating with the best organisation (in the education domain) to conduct online classes for our students. But I further want to request the MHRD to provide us with Doordarshan and AIR slots to broadcast our own classes. I would request you to give us separate slots for elementary, secondary and senior secondary education. If you grant us the slots, we will have our teachers on board to conduct the classes and air as per our lesson plan,” he said.The minister said that only 68% of students in the national capital’s government schools have access to smartphones at home. “It is very important for us to reach the parents and the students through Doordarshan and All India Radio with our classes and content.”In Delhi, while are no examinations pending for class 10 students, as many as 12 examsare yet to conducted for those in class 12, including business studies, geography, Hindi, sociology, home science, computer science, information technology and bio-technology, among others.In northeast Delhi, where board exams were suspended mid-way through owing to the communal riots in the last week of February, six exams are pending for class 10, including Hindi, English, science and social science. For class 12, as many as 11 exams are yet be conducted in northeast Delhi.Pokhriyal told the officials and state ministers present at the video-meeting that the ministry would extend its support to all states in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-asks-mhrd-to-promote-all-students-of-classes-10-and-12-based-on-internal-exams/story-38OqCgLAmb6tLrNo2YLeWL.html

28-04-2020||Delhi||Tuition fees of schools should not be exempted: HC||The Delhi High Court has said that the tuition fees of the schools should not be exempted since education is being imparted online. As students continue to avail the benefits of classes, schools cannot be treated as “closed”. In a judgment passed on April 24, a copy of which was uploaded on the official website on Tuesday, a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar said that the expenditure incurred in disseminating education online may conceivably be greater than that involved in imparting classroom teaching.It also said that providing online education is no child’s play and not allowing schools to charge to tuition fees would be “bordering on absurdity”.The court’s decision came while it was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Naresh Kumar who had challenged the April 17 notification of the Delhi government wherein it had directed schools to not charge anything except the tuition fees in the wake of the lockdown. The plea had also sought that the fees for the lockdown period be waived off and parents not be coerced to pay the fees. However, the court dismissed the petition and said, “While there can be no cavil, to the proposition that the requirement of payment of school fees would, necessarily, become enforceable only where the fees are payable, i.e., where the parents are physically in a position to pay the school fees, we cannot agree that, during the period of lockdown, or during the period when online education is being provided by the schools, and availed of, by students, tuition fees should be exempted. “So long as schools are disseminating education online, they are certainly entitled to charge tuition fees. Rather, the expenditure involved in disseminating education online may, conceivably, be much greater than that involved in classroom teaching. Providing e-education is no child’s play, and involves the requirement of extensive infrastructural adjustments, including all incidental expenses in arranging access to online platforms, over which education could be provided, and in actually providing such education. To suggest that, having made all these arrangements, schools should not be permitted to charge tuition fees, would be bordering on absurdity [sic],” the bench said.The petitioner had sought that the April 17 notification of the Delhi government be modified by granting complete exemption from payment of any fee, including tuition fee, at least for the period during which the lockdown continues to be in place.However, rejecting his plea, the court said the Delhi government has correctly analysed the situation, by distinguishing between the expenditure incurred by schools “on co-curricular activities, sports activities, transportation, other development-related activities, etc.” and expenditure incurred on “salary, establishments and curricular activities”. “The impugned order, however, does not exempt students from the requirement of payment of tuition fees, for the simple reason that tuition fees cover salary, establishments and curricular activities, the expenditure where on continues to be incurred by schools, even during the period of lockdown, and before they can resume normal work. “Money does not grow on trees, and unaided schools, who received no funds from the Government, are entirely dependent on fees, to defray their daily expenses. We, therefore, find that, in allowing unaided schools to charge tuition fees, whereby expenses incurred on salary, establishments and curricular activities may be defrayed by them, the impugned Order dated April 17, 2020, strikes a wholesome balance, with which we are ill-inclined to interfere [sic],” the bench said.The court also noted that painstaking efforts are being made by schools and teachers to provide education and hold classes vis online platforms. It said that the effort in physically teaching students, in a regular classroom, cannot even remotely be compared with the effort that the teacher has to expend to provide education online.“It is a matter of common knowledge that, in doing so, the effort required to be put in, by the teacher, and the strain to which the teacher subjects herself, or himself, is tremendous, and the efforts of teachers – referred to, often, as the noblest among all noble professions – require to be commended in the highest terms. We unhesitatingly place, on record, our wholehearted appreciation, of the efforts of teachers, and schools, towards this end,” the court said.The bench said that the idea of the petitioner was “fundamentally misconceived” and the city government has already taken care of the action to be taken against the schools indulging in any other misdemeanour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tuition-fees-of-schools-should-not-be-exempted-hc/story-xYKZ6sqJ1vtJ9qHi8gNtEO.html

In the letter, Nizam has said the state needs a stable government as it is facing a public health emergency.“Article 163 clearly states that the Governor is required to exercise his functions on the aid and advice of the council of ministers. Further, it is important to note that Maharashtra is in a state of a medical emergency and has the highest number of Covid-19 cases. There is every reason to ensure a stable government, as the current one, is in place and at the helm Uddhav Thackeray as MLC and a chief minister. Hence, my client humbly prays that the nomination of Uddhav Thackeray by the state council of ministers pending since April 10 is allowed at the earliest in the spirit of democracy, rule of law and justice,” states the letter. Thackeray, who was sworn in as chief minister on November 28 last year has to get elected to one of the two houses of state legislature within six months, else he will have to resign. In that case, the entire cabinet will have to resign. The six-month period in Thackeray’s case is ending on May 28.Thackeray had planned to contest a by-election to the legislative council, but it got postponed due to Covid-19 outbreak.The governor has powers to appoint people on 12 seats that come from various walks of life such as arts, culture, literature and social service. Of them, two seats are currently vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lawyer-writes-to-governor-president-on-cm-s-mlc-nomination/story-NSWomvAL5CQiSgOIR3RA5L.html

Further, the department had allocated responsibilities to nodal officers for monitoring and ensuring that lessons are delivered to students without fail, he said, adding that teachers will be relaying feedback about the e-lessons to school heads, who will be sharing the information with the nodal education officers. Guidelines had been issued to ensure efforts as part of the remote learning campaign materialise. Teachers have also been told to maintain a log of students’ feedback. For this, the department is in the process of starting an e-platform where students will be able to ask teachers their doubts during a dedicated hour. A WhatsApp number from the Directorate Office in Panchkula will be shared with students for the same.While the lockdown continues, the department will also be carrying out activities related to state-level basic skill competency programme Saksham. A meeting with district and block education officers is slated to be held on Wednesday for discussing the results of Saksham exam, which took place in February and the district-wise progress made by students under the remote learning education campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nodal-officers-appointed-to-check-learning-among-students-e-portal-in-the-works-so-students-can-clarify-queries/story-J35JbVY7n3WTqArrJH6UzN.html
28-04-2020||Gurugram||Welfare scheme beneficiaries urged to not visit banks||The district administration on Tuesday urged beneficiaries of various government welfare schemes to avoid visiting banks to collect their due financial assistance. The administration officials said that the money was being directly deposited into the beneficiaries’ bank accounts and they need not come to the bank. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, said to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease it is important that people do not rush to banks, and hence all monetary benefits were being directly transferred into the bank accounts of the intended beneficiaries of these schemes. Khatri appealed to the people to call the bank helplines instead of rushing to the banks to check whether they had received the money or not.Over thirty-four banks, including public sector banks and private banks, have set up helplines in the district for the beneficiaries who can check their balance and inquire about information about money transfers over the phoneBank officials said instead of visiting bank branches, the customers and beneficiaries should use ATMs to withdraw money, and get in touch with bank appointed associates and relationship officers over the phone to check their balance and for other enquiries.Administration officials also reiterated that beneficiaries need to be worried about their money as many people wrongly tend to believe that if the money is not withdrawn quickly from the bank accounts then it would be returned to the government. “This is a wrong notion and only a rumour. People should not pay any heed to this,” said Prahlad Singh Godara, district lead bank officer.Financial assistance is disbursed under various central and government welfare schemes.Under the Mukhya Mantri Parivar Samridhi Yojna (MMPSY), the state government will provide financial assistance to over 12.50 lakh families registered under the scheme through direct bank transfer (DBT). Financial assistance of ₹1,000 per week is also being transferred into the bank accounts of over 3.50 lakh registered construction workers, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/welfare-scheme-beneficiaries-urged-to-not-visit-banks/story-7cDPtNHIrfNUDwLX3Yzo9J.html

The decision was taken after the KDMC health department found that there were some who contracted the novel virus despite the 14-day quarantine.“There were a few cases of those who had a travel history or those who had come in contact with Covid positive patients had symptoms after the 14-day period. This prompted us to take the decision to extend the quarantine period. All those who were in contact with Covid positive patients in KDMC jurisdiction will now have to self-quarantine themselves for 28 days,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner, KDMC.KDMC has 143 Covid positive cases. Dombivli has the highest number of coronavirus patients at 85.“As per the state government’s interim guidelines, the quarantine period can be extended to 28 days. A team of KDMC health experts found some showing symptoms and testing positive even after 14-day quarantine,” said Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmc-extends-quarantine-period-for-contacts-of-covid-19-patients-to-28-days/story-VXGXIqrNDlOgcF3Mk3UzgO.html

I had started this NGO with five of my IIT alumni friends to provide free of cost education to underprivileged students preparing for these exams. Considering students’ plight amid the lockdown phase, we have started free of cost online coaching for them.”He said that they are providing online coaching for Class 11 students from 9am to 12am and Class 12 students from 3pm to 6pm.As many as 46 out of 48 students enrolled in the ‘Super 100 Programme’ had cracked the joint entrance examination (JEE Mains) in January this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rewari-based-ngo-starts-free-online-coaching-for-underprivileged-students-preparing-for-iit-jee-neet/story-pzjjlWGV4eQVDwsWa4lB7L.html
28-04-2020||Gurugram||Wait likely to get longer for industries in unauthorised areas||The wait for industries located in non-conforming or unauthorised areas to start manufacturing operations in their units is likely to get longer as the district administration has put their applications on hold.The industry and commerce department said that the industries in the unauthorised areas can’t reopen yet as the current guidelines of ministry of home affairs (MHA) issued on April 15, do not permit these industries to resume operations.Digvijay Singh, joint director industry and commerce department, Gurugram, said, “The 15(1) clause of the MHA guidelines clearly states that industries operating in rural areas outside the municipal limits can be allowed. These industries are located within the municipal limits of Gurugram. Secondly, clause 15(2) states that industries in planned townships, SEZ etc can be allowed to operate. These industries do not fit this parameter either.”However, the government granted permission to some industries in these areas that were manufacturing essential goods. “We have granted permissions to some industries manufacturing essential goods in these areas,” said Singh.A non-conforming area is one where industrial buildings have come up without building plans approved by a competent authority and industries are run without the approval from the industry and commerce department of the state government.In Kadipur, Basai and Daulatabad, more than 3,000 small and micro scale industries are located, while 6,000 odd industries are located in the conforming zones such as Udyog Vihar, Manesar, Sector 34 and Sector 37.Associations of Kadipur, Basai and Daulatabad met Singh on Monday, seeking approval for the resumption of their industries. “We have applied for allowing the resumption of work on the Saral Haryana portal and applications have been accepted by the industry and commerce department of the government. If the MHA guideline is the base, the department should have rejected our applications. And if we are in a non-conforming zone, then why are factories producing essential goods allowed to operate? The industry and commerce department of Haryana government is doing a survey to declare these areas industrial and we have been paying tax to government as industrial parameters,” said Shripal Sharma, Basai based industry owner.Umesh Dwivedi, Daulatabad-based industry owners, said, “We supply our products to big industries which got permissions. If our factories are shut any longer, there is possibility that we will lose our clients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/wait-likely-to-get-longer-for-industries-in-unauthorised-areas/story-HogQfJcCoK3gvPPDSy5LiK.html
28-04-2020||Gurugram||Medical tourism in Gurugram grinds to a halt amid Covid-19 crisis||Medical tourism in the city, as with the rest of the country, has ground to a halt in view of the Covid-19 outbreak in India. Proprietors of several medical value travel (MVT) companies in Gurugram and Delhi-NCR said the industry is “on the verge of collapse”, and that large scale job cuts in coming months could be inevitable.Gurugram, according to MVT company owners, is India’s largest medical tourism hub. “In the last financial year, India issued close to 168,000 medical visas. Of these, assume that only half were patients, who travelled with attendants. In any given year, about 45% of patients coming to India seek treatment in Delhi-NCR. Of these, about half are treated in Gurugram, which sees more international patient inflow than any other city,” said Dalip Chopra, president of the Foundation of Healthcare and Wellness Promotion (FHWP), India’s largest association of international MVT facilitators. With business dependent on international travel, and with no new patients expected to arrive in the country anytime soon, revenue streams are expected to remain dry for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, MVT facilitators are straddled with the costs of paying wages and renting office space (in India and abroad). Ancillary services provided by vendors -- transporters, guesthouses, language interpreters and those involved in post-operative care -- have also come to a standstill. Abhik Moitra, president of a private MVT player operating in Gurugram, said: “Even if the lockdown in India is lifted entirely within the next couple of months, the regions from where our clients come -- Africa, Central Asia and most of West Asia -- are still in early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. We have no idea when things will get back to normal.” However, Moitra and others said that they were expecting business to resume, albeit at a greatly reduced capacity, by September. As per a presentation made by the FHWP to Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) earlier this month, the industry would need a bailout package of ₹300 crore “to sustain our businesses for at least 4 months.” The FHWP has also, through FICCI, appealed to the ministries of commerce, finance, and tourism, seeking financial assistance during the ongoing crisis. “The 60-odd leading MVT players in India together earn about $370 million annually. Ninety percent of this goes towards salaries, rents, managing overseas offices, marketing and work related travel. Our average expense for four months works out to approximately ₹850 crore. We are requesting about 35 percent of this expense as a bailout, to be allocated mainly towards salaries and essential expenses, hoping that we will manage other expenses once we receive pending tax refunds and are able to recover pending dues from hospitals,” Chopra explained. Praveen Mittal, a director at FICCI overseeing the MVT industry, said, “We have made a representation last week to the ministry of finance emphasising the need for assistance required by about 60 industry segments, including medical value travel, which is valued at between $ 5 to 6 billion annually in India. It is a crucial business which brings in large amounts of foreign exchange. No bailouts have been announced yet, but it is certainly needed to help MVT facilitators tide over the crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/medical-tourism-in-gurugram-grinds-to-a-halt-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-zeufvHLhYvT33Dpg9ol5oJ.html
28-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Without rapid testing kits, health dept races against time to check Covid-19 spread in Jharsa, Sec 39||The containment zones of Sector 39 and Jharsa village, which account for the highest number of cases in the city, have become critical hot spots as they are inhabited by health workers employed at the Medanta Hospital, which is barely 500 metres away. Six hospital employees who live here had tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on April 24. Of them, four were asymptomatic, making the health department officials race against time to trace those who may have contracted it from these silent carriers.In this backdrop, Medanta Hospital, too, has restricted the entry of all its staffers from these areas, which includes junior nurses and sanitation staff.“Medical staff from Jharsa has been restricted from coming to the hospital. We are managing with limited staff to prevent further spread and contamination,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care, Medanta Hospital.The hospital refused to disclose how many members of its staff life in these containment zones.“We recently collected samples of all the medical staff on duty in the Covid ward and other wards of the hospital. Test results showed that senior doctors, nurses and health staff in the Covid-19 ward were negative. The staff who tested positive were junior nurses and paramedical staff of other wards,” Dr Mehta said, adding that these patients may have contracted the disease locally in Jharsa, which was declared a containment zone on April 9. “They might have contracted the virus from their area or any other source while commuting,” he said.Of the 51 cases reported in Gurugram till now, at least 9 cases are reported from the two containment zones. Out of these, six are health care workers.TROJAN HORSE EFFECTDr Dhruv Chaudhary, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Haryana, said any asymptomatic case is like a Trojan Horse. “Coronavirus in an asymptomatic patient works in concealment. A person can remain asymptomatic throughout the 14 day quarantine period, but he can easily transmit the virus to others in this time frame. In all likelihood, the other person who contracts the coronavirus might get influenza-like illness (ILI) or get critically unwell. The concern is to trace this Trojan Horse.”Usually, symptoms of Covid-19 start developing after 5-6 days, but patients can remain asymptomatic or show very mild symptoms for up to 14 days.According to Dr Chaudhary, the state is adopting two epidemiological strategies to trace asymptomatic cases. “To trace asymptomatic cases one of the ways is contact tracing and the other is selecting containment zone residents randomly for sampling and testing,” he said.Dr Chaudhary added that random testing cases through antibody testing kits, which is currently on hold due to faulty kits, was a useful tool. “Since we are waiting for the approval from ICMR on the use of rapid testing kits (RTKs), teams deployed on ground are going door-to-door and visiting the same house every fourth or fifth day to check whether the asymptomatic case has developed any symptoms. If required, samples are being taken.”The health team, engaged in contact tracing, has mapped 1,900 houses in the 1km radius covering a population of more than 8,000 people, and is now going to each house. A mobile van to collect samples for RT-PCR has also been stationed for easy collection of samples.Gurugram chief medical officer Dr Jaswant Singh Punia said, “We are taking the samples of all suspected cases through this van to trace maximum cases in limited time. We have also increased the number of teams doing surveillance in the area. Our ASHAs/ANMs are visiting every household enquiring about ILI symptoms in all families.”RAPID TESTING ONLY WAY TO CHECK ASYMPTOMATIC CASES Public health expert Dr K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), agrees that RTKs are required for tracing asymptomatic cases through random sampling in hot spots.“Random sampling is done for profiling the disease in a particular area. By doing door-to-door surveillance we are only tracing symptomatic cases with ILI but we are missing out on asymptomatic cases. To trace a proportion of the population in a hotspot zone, who are exposed to the virus and are not aware of it, RT-PCR testing is expensive and time consuming. Rapid testing helps in validating such asymptomatic cases while being less time taking and cost-effective,” said Dr Reddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/without-rapid-testing-kits-health-dept-races-against-time-to-check-covid-19-spread-in-jharsa/story-zQ5aU3qlL9nzjN8xZrUd8H.html

But first, we are providing it to those working on the frontlines as per the protocol prescribed by ICMR.” Asked if the civic body will start giving HCQ to slum dwellers, Kakani said, “We are yet to make a decision.”On Tuesday, the civic body issued a circular of do’s and don’ts, which stated that frontline workers, while takin the HCQ, have to ensure use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and triple-layer masks.Doctors, nurses, members of squads going for tests, close contacts of Covid-19 patients, and hospital staff working in areas where there are positive cases can be given the tablets. While those suffering from hypertension, cardiovascular diseases must consult their doctors before taking the pill, patients with retinopathy and hypersensitivity should not take HCQ. Dosage for health workers involves 400 mg twice a day post lunch/dinner on day one. From the second day to seven weeks, it’s 400 mg, once a day, post lunch or dinner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-distributes-1-7-million-hcq-tablets-as-preventive-medicine/story-fuTTJW97yZ1H8DSp7tG9JN.html

As per the health department officials, another Tablighi Jamaat man was discharged from the civil hospital, Sector 6, Panchkula, after the report of his second test came as negative on Tuesday. This comes day after two Jamaat men, aged 18 and 27 and hailing from Banoi Khuda Baksh village in Pinjore , were discharged from the hospital.Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said, “A 20-year-old Jamaat man from Nava Nagar in Pinjore has recovered after being tested negative for coronavirus for two consecutive times. The man has been discharged from the hospital, she added. Dr Kaur further said that with this, a total of four Jamaat men have so far been discharged while three are currently admitted in the hospital.The case of this 20-year-old Jamaat man was the last to be reported in eight days in Panchkula. The district count presently stands at 18. On April 26, seven family members of the positive Sector-15 woman were discharged from Maharishi Markandeshwar Hospital, Mullana in Ambala, where they were admitted after being tested positive on April 16. The 44-year-old woman however is admitted in a private hospital in Sector 21, Panchkula, with her husband, and will remain under clinical observation. On April 20, a 37-year-old Jamaat man was discharged. While on April 11, the first two positive patients in Panchkula, a woman salon worker and a staff nurse were discharged.Till April 1, Panchkula only had two cases, which later reached to five on April 9 with three Jamaat men testing positive. Later, Panchkula witnessed spike in cases after the 44-year-old woman of Sector 15, Panchkula, tested positive on April 14, followed by her husband and then seven family members. Following this, four Jamaat men tested positive till April 20, taking the count to 18.However, with sudden spike in cases, Panchkula also witnessed 72.2% recovery rate so far with 13 patients being discharged from April 11 till Tuesday. Panchkula deputy commissioner (DC) Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said although most of the cases in Panchkula have come from a specific area, around 22 teams of the health department with over 400 personnel are working vigorously day and night. “The health department teams have so far screened over 41,000 people in several sectors and villages included in the containment zone,” he added.Dr Kaur said that first, the work on the containment plan was started and sampling was continued. Also, to keep the district’s security cycle strong, 12 new mobile medical teams have been activated, which are engaged in completing the survey work besides providing health care to every household, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-on-path-of-recovery-as-another-jamaat-man-discharged-active-cases-drop-to-5/story-Jo1qOORbrHSG2TiRWmPaeL.html

He later revised the directions and issued an advisory to such commuters to leave Ghaziabad borders by 9am and return after 6pm daily.“As per the decision taken on Tuesday, the details as well as the vehicle numbers of all such commuters who arrive at borders after 9pm will be noted down and an officer will send these details to their respective departments. This will help their departments realise that their employees are coming late to office and not adhering to duty timings,” a spokesperson of the district magistrate said.“There were frequent verbal altercations between commuters and the police. We will allow such commuters to proceed to Delhi after 9pm, but their details will be communicated to their respective departments,” the spokesperson said.The administration claimed that a number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad had connections to Delhi. Two more cases were reported from Ghaziabad on Tuesday which took the tally of Covid-19 positive cases to 60. “Press briefing regarding coronavirus cases is done at the state level every day. All CMOs are requested to inform the media through respective DMs only,” the CMO texted when his comment was sought.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to repeated calls on Tuesday.The officials from the health department and the district administration however said that one of the two cases was of a bank employee in Loni and he is stated to be resident of a high-rise near Mohan Nagar.“The sample of the bank employee was taken on April 26 and he was tested positive on Tuesday. Seventeen other employees of the branch were also sent to facility quarantine as a precautionary measure. His other contacts are being traced besides his family members,” a district administration officer from Loni said.A health department official said the second case was related to a pathologist who is resident of Vaishali and has a job in Delhi.“He visited a private hospital in Kavi Nagar and the staff members of that hospital were also sent to quarantine in two hotels. Another man, a resident of Meerut, also tested positive. He is a contact of a Covid-19 positive man and was sent to Meerut. The count of this man is not added to the tally of Ghaziabad,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-to-send-details-of-late-govt-officials-to-their-offices-in-delhi/story-78bn5sKqFUXfx1MejkIFbI.html
28-04-2020||City||Case registered for seeking money through fake duplicate Facebook profile||A resident of Greater Noida has alleged that someone created a fake account using his name and photograph on a social media platform, and tried to dupe his friends and acquaintances.The complainant, Arjun Singh Rawat, a resident of Jaypee Greens, lodged an FIR in Sector Beta 2 police station on Monday.Rawat said the suspect took his profile picture from his Facebook account. “The suspect made an account similar to mine on Facebook and sent requests to some of my friends. The suspect then started asking people for money, claiming a medical emergency during the lockdown,” he said.Rawat got wind of this fraud when one of his friends, Vivek Bansal, informed he had transferred Rs 2,500 to the account number the suspect had given him.“Rawat told his friend that he had not made any such request. His friend then told him that he received a request on Facebook and transferred the money accordingly. Later, the complainant found out that somebody had made a duplicate profile and was asking people for money,” said Sujeet Upadhyaya, station house officer, Sector Beta 2 police station. The victim then filed a complaint in the local police station.Police have registered a case against the suspect under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 67 of the IT Act. “We do not know the number of people the suspect has cheated. We have contacted the cyber cell to trace the suspect using the IP address and bank account details. The suspect will be arrested soon,” Upadhyaya said.The Gautam Budh Nagar police department had, last week, issued an advisory and urged the public to be wary of cyber fraud amid the ongoing lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/case-registered-for-seeking-money-through-fake-duplicate-facebook-profile/story-3EEpHFJF4dDUlMZRn1KTtK.html
28-04-2020||Noida||Migrants ready to leave Noida at the earliest opportunity||Over 35 days into the lockdown to tackle the coronavirus crisis, stranded migrant workers in the district are still willing to risk their health to return to their home towns.A three-week nationwide lockdown was first announced on March 24, later being extended up to May 3. Shortly into the lockdown, there was a rush across state borders as migrant workers scrambled for ways to reach their home towns.Although state governments had come up with shelter homes and hunger centres for daily wagers, migrants preferred to walk hundreds of kilometres back to their homes, after public transport was discontinued.“I got my salary this month but my husband, who used to work in a factory, has lost his job. The contractor doesn’t even bother to pick our calls. We could not survive on my salary alone and were forced to seek help from others, who were kind enough to give us enough ration for almost 10 days. We are running out again and are unsure if we would get help again. Had we gone back home, we could have lived with either of our families, which would have been preferable to our present condition,” said Rukmani, a domestic help from Ranchi who lives with her family at a shanty cluster near Sector 75.If given a chance, the family is ready to leave the city to return home.The district administration, on March 28, had instructed landlords not to evict tenants, especially those from low-income groups, if they were unable to pay rent.The order, however, did not stop scared tenants from moving out.“We used to live in Mamura earlier. We did not know that the government had made a rule about rent. We just knew that we would not be able to pay our monthly rent of ₹5,500 and so, moved to an empty plot in Chhajarsi earlier this month. I work as a security guard but I would love to send my wife and kids back home as soon as travel is allowed,” said Abbas, who moved to Gautam Budh Nagar from Deoria district.In some cases, migrants are risking violating the lockdown guidelines to reach home and are purchasing bicycles for the purpose.The Noida police has arrested one cycle shop owner and booked at least one other for selling cycles. The Phase-2 police booked a shop owner, after police intercepted four migrants on bicycles, on their way to Bihar this Sunday.Also on Sunday, another person was arrested by the Sector 39 police for secretly selling a cycle from his shop in Chhalera village. Upon questioning him, they found that he had sold four cycles earlier this month, the police said.Migrants were also caught while travelling through fields of Jewar and Dadri last month.With no clarity about future travel, going back home is not just important from an economic perspective for some migrants, but also about being with their family.“My parents, siblings, their families and in-laws are in Siwan. We have been in Noida for five years now. We could not go home this year for Holi, but now, we wish more than ever that we had gone. We are anyway not working and are dependent on either the government or the generosity of other people for food. Had we gone home, it would have been much easier. Even talking to them daily is not an option. Last month, an acquaintance in Sector 27 had recharged our phone. We don’t know how we will manage going forward,” said Sarita, a resident of Atta, who used to run a tea stall in Sector 18.Officials said that migrant movement is under control at present. “The situation is nothing like what we had seen in the initial days (of the lockdown). There are a few isolated incidents where people are still trying to move to other states. Whenever such migrants are found, they are transferred to shelter homes after explaining the rules and possible solutions to their problems, such as food or medical services. However, if anyone tries to violate guidelines despite warnings, we can take legal action against them,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police.Violators can be booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/migrants-ready-to-leave-noida-at-the-earliest-opportunity/story-PEupdC4BCznf3ktU1HCiUJ.html
28-04-2020||Noida||35 days on, only Covid-19 patient to develop pneumonia yet to be discharged||A 39-year-old employee of Ceasefire company in Sector 135, Noida, is yet to be discharged from hospital, even after spending 35 days there, getting treated for Covid-19. The man says since April 16, three of his blood samples have been collected for testing, but he is still awaiting the reports without which a call on his discharge cannot be taken.According to health officials, the man and his 33-year-old wife tested positive for Covid-19 on March 25. The couple was admitted to the Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute in Sector 30 and they were later shifted to Sharda Hospital after the man’s condition deteriorated and he developed pneumonia.The Ceasefire employee is the only patient to develop pneumonia, which is serious complication in those with Covid-19. He had to be put on ventilator support, doctors said. His wife got discharged on April 16 while his three samples have been collected since then but he has not been informed about the results. His last test result, on April 14, was positive for Covid-19, doctors said.“I am waiting for the results to know if I am still positive. I was among the first patients to be admitted for Covid-19. I have seen people leaving in 10 days after completing the treatment, but I am stuck here even after 35 days,” said the 39-year-old Ceasefire employee.“Doctors have collected three samples of mine since April 16 and no result has come so far. I have recovered but still I have to share the ward with around 30 others who are infected. Even if I am positive, they should tell me. I am tired of waiting,” the Ceasefire employee said.A senior government official deployed at Sharda hospital said the Ceasefire employee was the only patient to develop pneumonia.“It has taken a lot of effort to save his life. He is getting impatient to get discharged as it’s been over a month since he was admitted. Three of his reports are delayed. We need to receive two negative reports before we can discharge him,” a senior government official from the district health department, on condition of anonymity, said.The chief medical officer was unavailable for comments on the issue.There are hundreds of incidents wherein people under institutional quarantine and the positive patients have to wait for days to receive the sample reports which has been leading to panic among people. On April 12, a 32-year-old man who was under quarantine at the Galgotias hostel in Greater Noida jumped to his death and later, he was found negative for the infection.On Tuesday, five more Covid-19 cases were reported in Gautam Budh Nagar. The total number of cases has reached 134 in the district. The new patients include a 45-year-old man from Sector 34, an 18-year-old woman from Sector 50, an 18-year-old man from Sector 15, a 71-year-old man from Sector 93 A and a 50-year-old woman from the Begumpur area of Greater Noida.There are 50 hot spots, of which 16 have completed the quarantine period and are to be eligible to be declared as green zones as no new Covid19 case has been reported from these areas in the past 28 days. A total of 10 hot spots have entered the orange zone, as no new case has been identified in these areas in the past 14 days, while 23 hot spots are still in red zone as new cases have been reported from there in the past 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/35-days-on-only-covid-19-patient-to-develop-pneumonia-yet-to-be-discharged/story-R5GWI07htL9QaiS8QKIHOM.html
28-04-2020||Noida||GB Nagar district administration refuses to allow NSEZ to operate despite govt orders||The entrepreneurs of the Noida Special Economic Zone (NSEZ) of Gautam Buddh Nagar district are unhappy with the district administration’s decision of not granting them permission to operate despite notifications from the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and the state government to allow the operations of industries. Although the district administration has pointed out that the area falls under the containment zone, the entrepreneurs say that the administration has given permission to 13 units in the same area that are involved in the manufacture of medical items, such as PPE kits, sanitisers and masks. As a result of this refusal, the SEZ units are staring at heavy losses. Ajay Goel, the president of NSEZ entrepreneurs’ association (NSEZEA), said that while the units are closed in this country, the export markets are still open. “Even amid Covid-19 crisis, our overseas customers are eagerly waiting for supplies from India. Our competitors from China, Vietnam and Malaysia are open, which are successfully diverting our orders, subsequently forcing the Indian exporters to suffer losses both in revenue and orders,” he said.He further said that the MHA had issued an order, allowing the SEZ units to operate, provided that the employees of these units use dedicated vehicles and the units have only 30 to 40% occupancy. “Even the state government has issued an order to allow the SEZ units to operate, provided that Covid-19 norms are followed. But, when it came to district administration for taking a call, it outrightly refused, saying that the SEZ falls under the containment zone,” he said.Echoing similar views, the NSEZEA vice-president Puneet Kapoor questioned the set of rules made by the district administration in declaring any area as containment zone. “The administration has its own whims and fancies in demarcating the areas around the hotspots. The gates of NSEZ are at least 1.5 kilometres away from the nearest hotspot (Kendriya Vihar-2 in Sec 82), but it falls in the containment zone. On the other hand, Swarnim Vihar that shares boundary with the same hotspot and the nearby market do not fall in the containment category,” he said.Kapoor further said that most of the NSEZ units are on verge of losing their customers permanently if the exports orders are not fulfilled by these units. “We are unable to understand the administration’s logic behind this refusal. NSEZ has high boundaries and custom-controlled gates. Many units want to keep their employees quarantined within the closed complex during this period. Since all movements of persons and goods are regulated by the security officials of government of India, there is no scope of adversely affecting the Covid-19 crisis,” he said.Vilas Gupta, regional chairman (north), Export Promotion Council of EOUs and SEZ, also said that the NSEZ has over 262 units engaged in export business. “Presently, they are passing through a very difficult phase and are scared about the shipments that are ready in their units as well as future business. Overseas buyers are cancelling their orders and there is a lot of fear among businessmen over heavy losses that they might face if the shipments are not sent immediately. Despite advisories from the MHA and the state government, the district administration has not allowed units to start operations even with less than 50% strength of 50,000. If the units don’t start operation soon, it may lead to mass unemployment soon,” he said.LB Singhal, the NSEZ development commissioner, said that the district magistrate is the final authority to take any call in such pandemic situation. “If the entrepreneurs’ appeal doesn’t appear permissible in such pandemic situation, he may reject their request,” he said.Singhal further said that sudden flow of workers, who are mostly from adjoining areas, may put adverse impact on Covid-19 situation in the district, which is improving now. “Only 13 manufacturing units of health products like masks, sanitisers and PPE kits have been permitted by the administration and they are operational,” he said.Despite repeated attempts via the phone and text messages, district magistrate Suhas LY did not respond to comment on this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-district-administration-refuses-to-allow-nsez-to-operate-despite-govt-orders/story-T051WqoxPRyaQ04FPsfKvL.html

For she is the youngest member at the quarantine facility in Ghaziabad. Immediately after her birth on April 16, the newborn and her 25-year-old mother, who tested positive for Covid-19, were sent to the Covid hospital where they were kept separately. The baby was later handed over to her maternal grandparents who are presently admitted to the quarantine facility in Dasna. Doctors said the newborn’s Covid-19 test results are yet to come.The child’s mother got discharged from the ESI Hospital in Sahibabad on April 27 and was sent home to Kaila Bhatta locality after her two successive tests came negative for Covid-19. “She is my daughter’s first child but her in-laws did not visit my daughter from Meerut. It is due to their demands of dowry that the relations have turned sour and we have also filed a case of dowry harassment. She is my only daughter and I gifted her every household item after her wedding. But her in-laws later demanded a car, something that I could not afford. This is why she was sent home six months ago while she was three month’s pregnant,” girl’s maternal grandfather, who works at a small oil processing factory in Ghaziabad, said over the phone.“My daughter is now eager to see her baby and hold her in her arms. Both of them have been separated as doctors told us that the baby needs to be away from her Covid-19 positive mother. The staff members at the quarantine facility are helpful and they have arranged her milk and even diapers,” he said.The man is however annoyed with the health department team which came to his house after his 25-year-old daughter tested positive for Covid-19.“They told all of us that we need to go along with them for two hours for testing purposes. But, they got us lodged at the quarantine facility in Dasna. The mother is yet to breastfeed her child as she hasn’t seen the baby since her birth. The health department has taken samples of the baby girl also. We are awaiting reports and will rush back home to look after my daughter as she had Caesarean delivery and has stitches,” he added.Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said, “She was under treatment at different private facilities before and during her delivery and it is likely that she picked up the infection from one of these hospitals. Although she has been discharged after her test reports came negative, it will take another couple of days for the reports of her infant daughter and her parents to arrive. We are trying our best to ensure that the infant gets every facility in the quarantine and is able to see her mother soon,” A part of Kaila Bhatta locality in old Ghaziabad city is already sealed by the administration after the 25-year-old woman tested positive. Her father is now worried as she is alone at home.“No one is allowed to come out of their homes in our locality and I cannot even ask anyone to help out my daughter who is alone at home and yet to recover from the C-section surgery. Despite my meagre earnings, I tried to give her best treatment at private hospitals but she ended up contracting the Covid-19,” her father said.According to the records of the Ghaziabad health department, a total of 99,311 persons are under quarantine, including 86,026 in home quarantine and another 759 in facility quarantine till April 27. The facility quarantine is meant for people who are close contacts or relations of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/newborn-girl-is-the-youngest-in-ghaziabad-quarantine-facility/story-ZREGB73IAKmipjj98Yy4bJ.html
28-04-2020||City||Two men travel over 2,000km from Karnataka, Telangana to their homes in Loni, Ghaziabad||His desperation to return home was so high that a 40-year-old man, working as supervisor at a construction site in Karnataka’s Davanagere, undertook an arduous journey spanning 2,000km to reach his home town in Loni, Ghaziabad, during the nationwide lockdown. He walked some of the distance, sought lifts from several truckers, before walking some more. It took Ram Vir almost 10 days to traverse the distance Karnataka to Ghaziabad.He was not the only one unable to resist the call of home. Nehruddin, who works in Hyderabad, Telangana, reached his home town in Ghaziabad after traversing a distance of over 1,500km in about 14 days. While Ram Vir reached Ghaziabad on April 26, Nehruddin reached home on April 27. Both men are now in a 14-day quarantine at Tronica City, health department officials said.“I had gone to Karnataka about a month and a half ago but all my work was cancelled after the lockdown was announced. It was on April 17 I decided to return home, but there were no buses or trains running. So I decided to take lifts from trucks and also walk as much as I could. I reached Loni on the evening of April 26 after entering NCR from Faridabad. I then crossed over to Delhi and from there to Ghaziabad,” Ram Vir, a resident of Jawahar Nagar in Loni, said.The man said he sought rides from about six or seven truckers he met on the way. The driver asked him to pose as a cleaner.“I chose trucks which had only one or two persons, besides the driver, as such vehicles are not stopped by police during the checks. I travelled through Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, before finally reaching Faridabad in trucks. Some truckers, in order to avoid police checks, asked me to pose as a conductor/cleaner,” he added.He said he also walked about 10 to 15 kilometres each day, especially to avoid checks in border areas.“Each day, I stayed at roadside dhabas or in vacant places where truckers stopped to sleep. Then again the journey would start. Most of the truckers from whom I sought lifts did not charge me money. During the entire journey, I was not caught by police even once. Otherwise, I would have had to stay in quarantine in those states. I was happy to return home, but am yet to meet my wife and three children,” Ram Vir said.He said he worked as supervisor at construction sites and was engaged in supervising the drill machines at a site in Davanagere, Karnataka.After he reached Loni around 4pm on April 26, the man went to a hospital for a checkup and the doctors finally sent him to the nearest police post from where he was taken to the quarantine facility.“The man is stable and has no symptoms of Covid-19 but we have got him admitted to our Asra-2 quarantine facility in Tronica City. When we spoke to him, he told us about his journey from Karnataka to Loni. We also have a 32-year-old man, Nehruddin in quarantine who undertook a similar journey from Hyderabad, Telangana. He too is stable and reached Loni on April 27,” Dr Rajesh Teotia, superintendent of Loni’s government community health centre, said.Nehruddin he worked in a company that installs mobile towers in Hyderabad. The man is a resident of Purana Check Post area in Loni.“He started his journey by foot about 14-15 days ago and reached Loni on April 27,” Praveen, his mother, said.“Every officer who interacted with these two persons was awed by the determination they showed in reaching their home towns after traversing about 2000km from Telangana and Davanagere. Both are in quarantine and their families have been informed. We are also ensuring that ration and other items of need are given to their families and tat their children are taken care of,” Khalid Anjum, subdivisional magistrate (Loni), said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-men-travel-over-2-000km-from-karnataka-telangana-to-their-homes-in-loni-ghaziabad/story-lVZfAHRX0K00VkQxejbFwN.html

28-04-2020||Mumbai||Private labs can’t collect samples from home: BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to stop the collection of medical samples from home by private laboratories for Covid-19 testing. Citizens will now have to go to fever clinics or visit private laboratories to get tested.Till now, people could either call the helpline number of the BMC seeking requests for Covid-19 tests or get in touch private laboratories for the collection of samples from home. However, there have been complaints that the private labs are not submitting reports on time. Apart from this, the BMC has received several other complaints about violation of testing rules, leading to the decision to stop the home collection facility.“We are going to stop home collection of samples. Now, fever clinics will collect samples from suspected patients if they show any symptoms or have comorbid ailments,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC.According to the BMC, under the new plan, any symptomatic person; high-risk patients on dialysis or chemotherapy, and women who are over 36 weeks pregnant can call the BMC’s helpline number, 1916 and get directed to a fever clinic.“If the doctor at a fever clinic thinks the individual requires testing, the medical staff will collect the samples and send them to our laboratories for testing. This will be free of cost,” said Kakani.People who want to opt for a private testing facility and pay the charge of ₹4,500, can visit private laboratories directly. After scrutiny, if the person falls into the criteria for testing, the lab will collect the samples.Though the BMC has put a cap of ₹4,500 on tests, private labs charge around ₹7,000, inclusive of the cost of personal protective equipment and service charges.78% cases diagnosed via contact tracingAccording to data provided by BMC, almost 78% of the city’s Covid-19 patients were diagnosed through contact tracing Till Monday evening, over 5,700 people in Mumbai were diagnosed with Covid-19, of which around 4,500 were identified through contact tracing of infected people “We have so many asymptomatic patients because we could identify them before they started showing symptoms,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/private-labs-can-t-collect-samples-from-home-bmc/story-lF59ltA3bnjJzeMP6IdYIM.html

Her two sons are stuck in other states due to the lockdown.“I have been hearing stories about corona warriors and people selflessly working to help others,” said Devi, “Our desires are endless, but at this time of distress I just wanted to make a contribution to help the coronawarriors, who are fighting in the field,” she added.She withdrew the ₹5,000 she had saved for a rainy day and walked at least 3km to reach the Palampur sub-divisional magistrate Dharmesh Ramotra.The SDM, who was hearing people’s grievances, thought she had also come with some complaint.He, however, was moved when Devi told him that she works as a MGNREGA labourer and wanted to contribute in the fight against the virus.Given her humble background, the SDM urged her to donate a small token amount and keep rest of the money.However, Devi told the officer that she wanted to donate all the money she had brought.Her gesture did not go unnoticed, on Monday evening, she received a call from governor of Himachal Pradesh Bandaru Dattatreya who thanked Devi for her generosity and service to humanity.The governor also sent her a pack of sanitisers and masks as a return gift. “The amount I donated was not much. I wanted to give more but it was all that I could manage,” Devi said.Meanwhile, she expressed delight that the authorities recognised her contribution and the governor himself called her.Former chief minister and veteran BJP leader Shanta Kumar, too, hailed Devi for her compassion. “She reminds me of Bindo Devi, who donated ₹11,000, she had saved by working as domestic help, for Vivekananda Hospital,” said Shanta.Meanwhile, the Palampur SDM said Devi’s donation will inspire many others to contribute to the fight against Covid-19.The SDM also handed her a commendation letter on behalf of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/palampur-mgnrega-labourer-donates-5-000-to-cm-s-covid-fund-gets-a-call-from-guv/story-FIpJXIhdNb80ukTrvF9dcO.html
28-04-2020||Chandigarh||Kotkhai custodial killing: Zaidi seeks 60 days bail from HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday sought a response from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on a plea seeking 60 days bail by Himachal Pradesh’s senior IPS officer Zahur Haider Zaidi in the 2017-Kotkhai custodial killing case.The high court bench of justice Alka Sarin has sought a response from CBI by May 1.Zaidi had pleaded he was suffering from hypertension and not keeping well otherwise, too. In view of the Covid-19 outbreak, he had pleaded for bail saying he was susceptible to the infection. His petition seeking restoration of bail is pending before high court, but could not be taken up due to the epidemic.Zahur Haider Zaidi, an IGP–rank officer, is an accused in the Kotkhai custodial death case and was taken into custody in January this year, after Chandigarh CBI court cancelled his bail for attempting to influence the trial.

28-04-2020||Delhi||Two held for robbing people on their way to Ghazipur mandi||The Delhi Police Tuesday said they busted a gang of robbers that robbed at least four people in the past one week in Shahdara, taking advantage of the deserted roads due to the lockdown. Senior officers said the robbers used to target those who were either going to or returning from Ghazipur Mandi after buying essentials. Four cases have been solved so far, police said.The two men who were arrested are Balbeer Sharma, previously involved in 23 cases of robbery, and his associate Monu, who had five robbery cases registered against him.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahadra) Dinesh Kumar Gupta said on Sunday, a resident of Jwala Nagar reported that when he was going to Ghazipur Mandi to buying vegetables, early morning, when two men approached him on a white scooter on the pretext of having a conversation with him. They overpowered him and robbed him of ₹2,000. “A case was registered in Vivek Vihar police station to probe the incident. On Monday, another resident of Jhilmil reported a similar crime. He said he was on his way to the mandi, when two men on a white scooter robbed him of ₹7,000 at knifepoint. Our inquiry revealed that two other similar robberies were reported in the past one week, all in the vicinity of Ghazipur Mandi,” Gupta said.The DCP said several pickets were raised on the stretches around the mandi and policemen were deployed in plainclothes to collect information about suspects. The CCTV footage was also checked to identify them and trace the scooter.“While our staff were on duty, around 2.30am Tuesday, we got information that three men, who have robbed a person in Krishna Nagar and also stabbed him, have fled on a white scooter towards Cross River Mall. Our team rushed to the crime scene while another went after the suspects,” the DCP said.Gupta said his team managed to spot the suspects near Yamuna sports complex and they were about to stop for checking. “However, seeing the police team, the trio sped away. Our team gave chase and managed to catch two of them, while one escaped. We recovered from them three stolen mobile phones, ₹2,000 cash and a knife they had used to stab a victim. During interrogation, they said they used to target people early morning to avoid being seen by anyone. They said because roads are empty, it was easy for them to escape after committing the crime,” he said.Efforts are on to arrest their third associate, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-held-for-robbing-people-on-their-way-to-ghazipur-mandi/story-fw22CKPWsTOJ9FLS8G1DjP.html
28-04-2020||Delhi||Teachers’ of Delhi govt fully funded colleges in DU observe hunger strike from home over “delay” in release of funds||Teachers from the 12 Delhi government colleges under the Delhi University (DU) on Tuesday observed a day-long hunger strike from their homes alleging that the government had not released funds for their salaries. The government has denied this charge.Extending solidarity with the faculty members, teachers from other colleges too joined the hunger strike.Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) president Rajib Ray said that nine out of these 12 colleges used students’ funds and other savings to pay salaries to their staffs’ salaries for the last month. “Some of these colleges broke their Fixed Deposits (FDs) to pay the salaries. But at least three colleges -- BR Ambedkar College, Keshav Mahavidyalaya and Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences -- have not been able to pay for March because they don’t have enough funds,” he said. DUTA had written to the Delhi government last week over the issue. “The colleges who have managed to pay last month’s salary won’t be able to pay for April if the government doesn’t release the funds immediately,” he added.Officials in Maharaja Agarsain College said, “Our requirement is ₹13 crore (for the quarter January-March). But the government had issued only ₹6 crore.”When contacted, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said, “No salary funds are pending for March. All were paid. For April, the payments would be made on time.”Ray said that the amount released by the government was insufficient to pay the salaries for March.An official at the Keshav Mahavidyalaya College said, “Our file for the sanction of funds was referred back to us seeking details of joining dates of teaching and non-teaching staff.”Subodh Kumar, president of Maharaja Agarsain College Teachers’ association, said, “Because of the lockdown, we decided to protest from our homes. The hunger strike began at 9am. All the teachers shared videos and photos on social networking sites and WhatsApp groups,” he said.At around 4pm, the protesting teachers connected through a video conferencing and sung songs of protest. “Many of our colleagues have loans to pay. Some have major health issues. The teachers are constantly working amid the lockdown. We are taking online classes, preparing e-notes and assignments. Despite the lockdown, it’s like normal working days for us,” Kumar said.The Delhi government had been at the loggerheads with the DU adminstration over the issue of governing bodies (GB), which are yet to be formed in its partially and fully-funded colleges. The government had earlier said that it will not release funds to colleges without governing bodies. Rajesh Jha, member of the DU’s Executive Council, said that the Council had approved the names of GB members sent by the Delhi government. “It’s been more than one and half months but the University administration has not yet sent these names to the colleges yet for the formation of governing bodies. That’s why there is a delay in the formation,” he said.A senior University official, requesting anonymity, said, “Due to the lockdown the University could not complete the procedure of GB formation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/teachers-of-delhi-govt-fully-funded-colleges-in-du-observe-hunger-strike-from-home-over-delay-in-release-of-funds/story-xTVjAuhAwb4iqva2KBCIRM.html

28-04-2020||Chandigarh||Don’t treat Chandigarh as single unit for Covid-19 restrictions, says Congress leader Pawan Kumar Bansal||Former Union minister and Congress leader Pawan Kumar Bansal on Tuesday in a statement demanded that Chandigarh should no longer be treated as a single district for Covid-19 restrictions. Instead, he said, the existing subdivisions under SDMs should be considered for the purpose.Areas reporting any case should be placed in the red zone and dealt with as per the Centre’s guidelines, including sealing like that of Kachi Colony in Dhanas, Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 30, etc. On the other hand, areas with no case should be opened up, he said.Bansal said the fact that 20% of those who tested positive in Chandigarh were healthcare workers highlighted the issue of the lack of quality PPEs available with hospitals. He demanded that the healthcare workers be provided quality certified PPEs first, lauded and honoured later.He also hit out at the UT administration saying the present system of universal screening in the city was casual and needed to be done more effectively with all-out testing in affected areas.In the case of factories, Bansal said those with upto seven workers should be permitted to run with three workers; and others with not more than half of the total strength of staff. All commercial establishments should be exempted from payment of water and the minimum electricity charges for the period of lockdown and a month thereafter, he said, adding that the liability to pay excise license fee by restaurants et cetera should begin from the date of reopening after the lockdown.Bansal said an important aspect being overlooked while distributing ration ration to the needy was that those who are not registered under the National Food Security Act did not even have the right to stand in the queues. They should be catered to under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana or on an ad hoc basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/don-t-treat-chandigarh-as-single-unit-for-covid-19-restrictions-says-congress-leader-pawan-kumar-bansal/story-9eUyCXeJPt3LUArqetqW9O.html

28-04-2020||Lucknow||Kota mission a success, says Yogi after Nitish objections||A day after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar purportedly objected to the UP government’s move to bring back about 11,000 students from Kota in Rajasthan, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the decision was taken in coordination with the centre and the Rajasthan government.He also said his government was holding consultations on lifting restrictions in a phased manner after May 3.“There was opposition to the UP government’s move from many quarters. But we coordinated with the union and Rajasthan governments and brought you (students) back to Uttar Pradesh,” Yogi said while interacting with some of the students who have returned from Kota.Although Yogi did not name any individual or government for objecting to the move, he was purportedly referring to observations made by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar about Uttar Pradesh’s move at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference with chief ministers on Monday.Kumar had said that it would not be possible to bring back anybody, including students, from places such as Kota, and migrant workers stranded elsewhere, till the central government amended or issued fresh directives in this regard.Replying to questions from the students, Yogi said his government was holding consultations with the council of ministers and the centre about lifting restrictions in a phased manner after May 3 in areas that have no cases of Covid-19. He admitted to the students, too, that there were objections to his government’s move to bring them back.“There were objections from some quarters. But the state government decided to bring the students back,” he said while replying to a question from one student named Nidhi of Varanasi.The chief minister said his government was sensitive to problems of people and the decision to bring back students was a success story for the administration and families of the students.He said the government would complete the process of sending students stuck in Prayagraj back to their homes by Wednesday. He asked the students to adhere to social distancing norms during home quarantine.“We are working on a programme to ensure that UP’s students are able to prepare for competitive examinations,” said Yogi.He also briefed the students about how UP was better than other states in checking the spread of crornavirus. “UP has the largest population in the country. But we have been able to check the spread of coronavirus vis-a-vis some states where the virus is spreading at a faster pace,” he said.Meanwhile, Yashvir Tyagi, former economics professor of Lucknow University, said: “The Bihar chief minister has no reason to object to the state government’s decision to bring back its students when the Rajasthan government was ready to send them back. Moreover, this was in coordination with the centre and the step has been taken with a specific purpose. Youngsters are future of the country and the government, too, cares for them.”“Besides working on options of taking help of retired teachers, the state government should get in touch with leading online coaching institutes and also subsidise the fees. Attention should be paid to bringing about an improvement in internet connectivity for those living in rural areas,” said Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/kota-mission-a-success-says-yogi-after-nitish-objections/story-tg0S5JklCaiGXNH5cUcqZM.html

The courier companies given vaccines after removing these from storage at a regulated temperature move them to the ice box. These vaccines have to be delivered within the stipulated period not beyond 48 hours.” He says he is getting enquiries about the supply of medicines, “but we cannot assure them delivery. There is a need to allow operation of courier services to facilitate transportation of life saving drugs.”MOVEMENT OF EMPLOYEES ANOTHER PROBLEMC&F owners also complain that their employees are facing problems moving around the city despite having curfew passes. “They are being stopped despite having passes for various reasons. Chandigarh police is not allowing staff to come to Zirakpur so we are writing to the authorities in Chandigarh to ensure that at least those with passes are not stopped,” says Jain.The employees are not only needed to maintain the supply chain but also to ensure optimum temperature for storage of vaccines. “We are working with skeletal staff but they are facing a lot of problems reporting for work,” he adds. The association has also written to the Punjab government to provide insurance cover to the pharma C&F owners and staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-courier-firms-close-supply-of-life-saving-drugs-from-zirakpur-warehouses-to-northern-region-hit/story-53NLKoEnABdWsZ7rXdgODO.html

The family had managed to leave the city based on a permission letter issued by a senior official, which is currently under investigation. The ED, while probing money laundering allegations against Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor, was scheduled to arrest the brothers after their quarantine period. However, fearing arrest the duo had moved an anticipatory bail plea before the special PMLA court on April 22.The two had raised several grounds, including the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown situation in the city along with the merits of the case, pleading that their custodial interrogation is not required. The plea was objected by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh and Arvind Aghav who represented the ED.After the rejection of their plea, the defence lawyers representing the Wadhawans sought protection from arrest for the Wadhawan brothers till they approach the higher court. The said plea, too, was rejected by the special PMLA court.Meanwhile, the brothers have already been arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Sunday evening and are currently under CBI custody, which ends on Wednesday.According to the CBI FIR, between April and June, 2018, Yes Bank invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). In return, Wadhawans allegedly “paid kickback of ₹600 crore” to Kapoor and his family members in the form of loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd.Meanwhile, ED is probing the allegations of money laundering against Rana Kapoor, co-founder of Yes Bank who had allegedly sanctioned loans worth ₹30,000 crore, of which ₹20,000 crore turned NPA. It is also claimed that Yes Bank, during Rana’s tenure, had sanctioned loan to RKW Developers, where Dheeraj is a director, and the whole amount was siphoned off by Kapil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-special-pmla-court-rejects-pre-arrest-bail-plea-of-wadhawans-in-ed-case/story-TZSn3NSM5oCdjS23S52lXL.html

Each day a new subject is covered and sometimes two, depending on length of the topic,” she said.Asgar said that the classes are conducted by expert faculty of the government schools. “The lectures are recorded in the studios of the DIPR,” she said, adding they are working on to start tele-classes for the students of other classes as well.The information department also handles the post recording job to fine tune the presentation. Director school education, Kashmir, Mohammad Younis Malik, said the lectures also include tips about the preventive measures against the spread of coronavirus. “The initiative has received an overwhelming response from the students and parents,” he said.Many schools in the valley are also sending the lectures to the students on WhatsApp and Youtube these days. “But it takes hours to download a five minutes video due to 2G internet speed,” a doctor in Srinagar said.The students have been complaining that they could not attend online classes due to poor internet speed in the Valley. “Though the government has introduced ‘Zoom’ app for online classes, but it is of no use until high speed internet is restored in the Valley,” said Gazi Muzzamil, Jammu & Kashmir Students Movement president.Earlier this month, scores of female teachers of a reputed private schools in Srinagar have reportedly refused to conduct online classes using ‘Zoom’ video conference citing privacy concerns associated with the application. With the security concerns with Zoom app, it has left the school education department in catch-22 situation. The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) has also warned against the use video-conferencing application stating that the platform is not at all fit and safe for use by government officers/officials for official purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-govt-starts-tele-classes-for-valley-students/story-TPEti3YV33R44IlhArCWuO.html
28-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh residents’ welfare body writes to UT adviser over domestic help issue||The Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) has written to UT adviser Manoj Parida on Tuesday regarding the movement of domestic help including maids and gardeners in various sectors of the city.At a time when the number of Covid-19 positive cases have crossed 50 and the authorities are trying to ensure there is no movement between sectors, domestic help including cooks, gardeners and maids have been seen moving within sectors of the city.The issue was highlighted by general secretary of the Sector 33-B residents’ welfare association (RWA) Kuljinder Singh Sra. “Sector 33B mostly has retired army men who live alone or with their spouses, and are dependent on servants. Most help is hired from Burail village in Sector 45, but they had stopped coming due to the curfew. However, around 20 gardeners, cooks and other servants can be seen in the streets daily now. I have spoken to the beat police officers and asked them to set up a naka between Sector 33 and 45 to stop their movement.”Other sectors around Sector 45 have reported the same issue. President of the Sector 44-B RWA Swadesh Talwar said that he had received calls from various residents about the movement of servants in their sector and he had them to inform the police.Chief patron of CRAWFED Major (retd) DP Singh said a similar situation was seen in Sector 38 as well. “In my lane itself I see that around four maids have started coming to work again. They come from Sector 25 or Dadumajra village and I have asked residents to be more responsible and ask their maids not to come till the situation comes under control,” he said.Chairman of CRAWFED Hitesh Puri said, “Many positive cases have come up in the colonies of the city where most of the domestic help comes from. The matter is serious which is why we have written to the authorities and asked them to book these domestic helpers for violating curfew orders in order to discourage them from coming. The residents also need to understand the importance of curfew, and should report their neighbours if their servants continue to come during the curfew.”Police officers deployed in these sectors said they were aware of the matter and had set up a vigil around the villages to ensure that those moving without permission are booked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-residents-welfare-body-writes-to-ut-adviser-over-domestic-help-issue/story-5GTXeJsniuuYoge82n7SwM.html

I am doing night duty now, but this is the best one can do in a crisis.” Yes, women do want a little time to themselves after marriage, she admits, “but my little contribution to work can help.”Being at the forefront of the battle against the virus is service to the nation, “which we are doing with an indomitable spirit,” says the medical officer.Tackling the virus is a new experience for her, so she has to be careful as it is highly contagious, “but yes, we are taking extra precautions as medical staff is more exposed and at a higher risk to more viral particles than the general public,” she says.Admitting that her family is “a little scared as the civil hospital is the main hospital in the district to treat Covid-19 patients, and doctors can be a little vulnerable than normal because of a combination of stress and long hours,” Kaur feels devotion to duty makes things easier.Dr Manjeet Singh, civil surgeon, Mohali, who is monitoring the entire healthcare system in the district says, health professionals are the ones, who shoulder most of the weight during a crisis such as pandemics. “These people are working non-stop to manage hospitals and are surrounded by patients in pain constantly,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-young-bride-and-medical-officer-is-back-at-the-covid-19-battlefront-5-days-after-wedding/story-hShyl6EQXRjeWaLIHBS2EI.html
28-04-2020||Mumbai||CR’s special parcel trains help cancer, heart patients||Central Railway (CR) came to the rescue of two patients requiring critical medical supplies from Mumbai. A cancer patient and another heart ailment patient received their medicines through special parcel trains.The zonal railway also assisted in the transport of camel milk from Falna in Rajasthan to Secunderabad in Telangana.Amruta Chaurasia, a cancer patient who had gone to attend a wedding in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, was left with a limited supply of medicine after the lockdown was announced. Chaurasia’s son, Sandeep, a resident of Thane, tried to find a way to courier the medicines to her. When he contacted India Post on Twitter, he was directed to get in touch with the railways.After Sandeep contacted the CR, a railway officer from Mulund collected the medicines and they were taken to Kalyan railway station on April 18. As the railway does not operate a direct parcel train from Mumbai to Gorakhpur, a connecting train from Nagpur was used to transport the medicines.“The medicines were packed at Kalyan railway station and transported to Nagpur by a parcel train and then on to Gorakhpur,” said a Central Railway official. The medicines reached Chaurasia on April 21.Similarly, the CR on Monday made an unscheduled halt of a parcel train at Chiplun railway station to deliver medicines to a heart patient who was staying in the area during the lockdown. Railway personnel collected the medicines from the patient’s residence at Vikhroli and transported them from Panvel railway station to Chiplun.“Central Railway continues to deliver medicines, masks, hospital items, and other medical commodities through its time-tabled parcel services to strengthen the government efforts in managing the challenges and adverse impact of the coronavirus in the country,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, Central Railway.Railway authorities also assisted in providing a transport link for camel milk from Rajasthan, for a two-year-old in Secunderabad. With no direct train between Falna in Rajasthan and Secunderabad in Telangana, the Central Railway on Sunday transported the camel milk from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus(CSMT) to Secunderabad within 28 hours.The railway had earlier also launched a helpline portal SETU to assist people in booking supply of essential commodities through parcel trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cr-helps-deliver-medical-supplies-to-cancer-heart-patients/story-lXajEYHPjhOlgym9Z3NLCI.html
28-04-2020||Mumbai||Startup uses genomics to trace Covid-19 transmission||A healthcare startup incubated at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B), is using genomics (the study of genomes) to trace the transmission of Covid-19 in the country. A platform launched by HaystackAnalytics demonstrates contactless contact-tracing and epidemiology of the Sars-Cov-2 virus (coronavirus).In simple terms, a genome is the genetic data of any organism. By sequencing the genome, one can get around 30,000 data points per sample about the organism’s genome. Therefore, a genome sequencing of the virus helps better understand the virus transmission. The opensource platform available on the website (https://haystackanalytics.in) helps understand the epidemiology of the virus in different places within the country. This will help map the contacts of those affected by the virus without having to physically canvas a large number of households. “Contact tracing has emerged as the backbone of all efforts to prevent the transmission of Covid-19 in India. But, current Covid-19 epidemiology, using community healthcare workers for undertaking extended interrogation of Covid-19 patients and extensive on-foot contact, significantly increases the risk of disease for health workers, and can also make them as carriers of the disease,” said Anirvan Chatterjee, founder of HaystackAnalytics. The startup incubated by the Society of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE) has proposed prevention of Covid-19 transmission, based on genomics and geospatial mapping.They have used the Covid-19 global genomics data (https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global) to build analytics for performing contactless contact racing. “We are using the DNA fingerprinting most recent common ancestor analysis. Theoretically, we can draw the entire trace of the virus back to Wuhan. This means that the transmission chain can be drawn out,” said Chatterjee.For instance, a global analysis of the data shows that the transmission patterns in say Washington state (in the United States) is different from that in Italy. While Washington State witnessed a clonal outbreak — every patient can be traced back to a single patient in the state, Italy reported multiple transmission events where a high number of cases were found in particular areas. “Now that the virus is in India, we need to understand how it spreads between states. This will help us strategise our actions against Covid-19. For example, if there is a cluster transmission in a place, a complete lockdown may not be necessary and containing the virus in the cluster will do,” said Chatterjee. “We were able to clearly differentiate four distinct Covid-19 transmission patterns in the data, which enable four different containment strategies. These four are — community transmission, local transmission, cluster transmission and travel transmission.Chatterjee said that they are in talks with government bodies to use the platform in their fight against Covid-19. “We have kept the platform open source. We are encouraging more people to use the platform and populate it with more data,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/startup-uses-genomics-to-trace-covid-19-transmission/story-3bJzVaLolrD5GNXHxeEWJN.html

28-04-2020||Chandigarh||From 30 years, demand for construction of tunnel at J&K’s Sadhna Pass falls on deaf ears||The residents of Karnah town in north Kashmir have been protesting for the last 30 years to press for their demand for construction of a tunnel at the Sadhna Pass on the Kupwara-Tangdhar highway, which has emerged as a ‘death trap’ over the years.More than 200 persons have died in the last six years due to massive avalanches at Sadhna top.The construction of the Sadhna Pass tunnel will provide Karnah, a far-flung area near the Line of Control (LOC) in Kupwara district, all-weather connectivity with the rest of the state.“Due to the lockdown enforced to contain coronavirus, we could not hold a protest, but once it is over, we will again protest until our demands are met,” said Raja Abdul Hamid, sarpanch of Dildar village in Karnah tehsil.He said that every year the residents hold a protest in Srinagar and Karnah to press for their demand. “We have been doing it for the last 30 years and will continue to do so,” he said. A former professor from Karnah Jahangir Danish said that every winter season it snows heavily at Sadhna and the Kupwara-Karnah stretch becomes highly vulnerable to avalanches and landslides. It gets disconnected from the rest of Kashmir for around six months creating shortages of essential and medical supplies.”He said that they have taken up the matter with the administration, but to no avail. “For the last four years, we are only being told that a detailed project report (DPR) of the tunnel is being prepared but no one knows the reality,” he said.Mohammad Kazafi, a member of the Karnah Residents Welfare Association, said, “When it snows, we have to carry patients on our shoulders and trek to reach the hospitals in Kupwara or Srinagar as we don’t have any medium of transport.”Former MLA of Karnah Raja Manzoor Ahmad said “In 2018, I met Union minister Jitendra Singh in Delhi who assured us that he will look into the matter. Then the government invited tenders from consultancies for providing feasibility and technicality for the tunnel and approach roads. Later, due to a political spat between the PDP-BJP government, the project didn’t see the light of day.”Speaking on the matter, Karnah SDM Bilal Mohiuddin Bhat said, “As per the communiqué between the Centre and Border Road Organisation(BRO), the work couldn’t commence due to the shortage of funds.”Last week Karnah sub-divisional magistrate along with his security guard and driver were rescued by the army after the vehicle they were travelling in came under an avalanche at Sadhna Pass.Karnah remains cut off from the rest of the Valley from December to April every year, as the Kupwara-Karnah road gets blocked due to the accumulation of 20 feet snow at Sadhna Pass, which is over 11, 000 feet above the sea level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/from-30-years-demand-for-construction-of-tunnel-at-j-k-s-sadhna-pass-falls-on-deaf-ears/story-HdoE1wzRy3LQ27aGssoalJ.html

In some cases, this renewal has been left in the lurch due to the ongoing situation, leaving employees worried. Thus, some college managements have decided to keep payments going, even for those on contracts. “There would be a handful of people who fall into this category but even if their contract hasn’t been renewed on paper, the college is making sure their salaries are not withheld,” said Parag Thakkar, principal, HR College, Churchgate.“Everyone, including the security and housekeeping staff, has received their salaries and our management has clarified that the lockdown will not affect their monthly payment,” said Parag Ajgaonkar, principal, NM College, Vile Parle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/college-managements-ensure-salary-staff-pools-in-money-for-contact-employees/story-ZjdMmQU5aHcN4fxFWkPeBL.html
28-04-2020||Mumbai||Teachers ask education department to come up with backup plan||With uncertainty over schools reopening in June, teachers have urged the state education department to look come up with a contingency plan and consider the idea of using television for teaching in case schools cannot open in June. A teachers group has sent a letter to education minister Varsha Gaikwad on the same. “Even as the government has announced a lockdown up to May 3, in areas such as Mumbai, Pune and other red zones, which still have new cases coming up, this will most likely be pushed further. In such a case, it might not be possible to reopen schools as per the usual schedule in June. Anticipating this, the government needs to have a plan in place for learning after the vacation period is over,” said Anil Bornare, president, BJP teacher’s wing, which has written to the government on Tuesday. An official from the education department said talks are on with different stakeholders to ensure some slots are made available on UGC’s TV channel for remote learning. “This content will be made available soon,” said the official.“We have to anticipate the issues that might arise in future or else a lot of time will be lost. Even in places where there is poor internet connectivity, TV is available,” said a teacher from a suburban school.While the state education department has started circulating online learning material from the beginning of this month, it is yet to begin with online teaching. As vacations were announced for schools after April 15, teaching has not begun yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/teachers-ask-education-department-to-come-up-with-backup-plan/story-tAFckPHeEQFhPy4qIGf7jN.html

28-04-2020||City||Working in the Times of Pandemic: People digging into their savings to meet expenses amid lockdown, says Ludhiana-based banker||The coronavirus lockdown has brought a lot of financial distress with people digging into their savings, closing recurring deposits (RDs) and fixed deposits (FDs), says Savleen Kaur, who works as a single window operator with Punjab National Bank’s Haibowal branch. “Around 20% of the requests we receive on daily basis are ones wherein people want to withdraw money from the deposits they had been adding money into for years,” says the 29-year-old banker.Kaur, who is mother of a two-year-old girl, says that performing duties while taking all the precautionary measures remains a challenge for the bank employees as many visitors have an unheeding approach towards social distancing. “These days, we only allow four-five people to come inside the bank at once, but asking the elderly, who largely come to withdraw their pensions, to wait and follow the social distancing is quite a difficult task for us,” Kaur said.‘CUSTOMERS DEMANDING NON-ESSENTIAL SERVICES’While the banks are largely providing basic services, the bankers are still receiving requests for non-essential services from the visitors, including entries in passbooks. “People are used to get entries in their passbooks whenever they visit banks. Even these days, every second visitor asks for the passbook entries, but we politely turn them away as a safety measure and inform them about several digital features that are made available by the bank for their convenience,” banker Kaur said.On the Union finance ministry’s proposal to deposit Rs 500 in the bank accounts of women who are beneficiaries of ‘Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana’, the city banker said that many account holders are yet to receive the amount. “The relief of Rs 500 that the government had announced last month is leading to a major confusion and chaos among the beneficiaries as many have yet not received the amount in their accounts. The beneficiaries are visiting the banks seeking information about the credits everyday,” she said.‘LIFE HASN’T SLOWED DOWN FOR ME’ Though life has slowed down for many amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Kaur says she remains occupied throughout the day. “I am working on a tight schedule these days and it has not been easy. As no helpers are coming to work these days, I do all the household chores on my own after coming back from work. Besides, I help my daughter, who had joined a preschool last month, with her homework,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/working-in-the-times-of-pandemic-people-digging-into-their-savings-to-meet-expenses-amid-lockdown-says-ludhiana-based-banker/story-ZK2e9jTJRFtmjryqJE61tN.html

The court held that the lockdown should not be a hindrance for the father to meet his children. While hearing a plea in a matrimonial dispute filed by a woman, justice S J Kathawalla was informed that family court had granted custody of the children to her and had directed timely access to the father too. However, the order was stayed after the woman filed a contempt petition citing breach of order. The man then approached the HC and got a stay on the family court order and asked the couple to resolve the issue and appointed a mediator in December. The mediator was to also help the couple decide on the issue of custody and access of the children.On April 24, the estranged husband told the court that due to the lockdown he was unable to meet the children in person and hence some alternate arrangement should be made for him. While directing the woman to make arrangements for her estranged husband to see their two minor children thrice a week on Monday, Thursday and Sunday through video conference between 5 and 6 pm and this arrangement would continue till the lockdown was lifted in Mumbai.The court further said, “If the children have any difficulty to come on-line at the time specified, the parties may mutually fix the time when the father can have access to the children,” implying that the father had a right to see the children and could not be denied the same regardless of the circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-upholds-man-s-right-to-see-children-in-lockdown-asks-wife-to-arrange-for-video-conferencing/story-xoyVA2NQgL0S9LenU0QAAI.html

28-04-2020||Chandigarh||Prospects dim for HP growers as cherry harvesting begins amid Covid-19 lockdown||Cherry harvesting has begun in Himachal Pradesh amid the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 with growers not hopeful of getting good profits as most markets remain closed.It has been a double whammy of sorts for growers as untimely rain and snow in the higher reaches in the first two weeks of April first impacted fruit development due to a sharp drop in temperature. Just 50% yield is expected this time as against last year’s bumper cherry crop, which was almost 60% higher than that of the previous year, at 225 metric tonnes, which led to a drop in market prices.Another factor that growers are worried about is that Delhi’s Azadpur Market, from where many of them market the produce, is now a major Covid-19 hotspot. Jahangirpuri, another hotspot, is also facing a labour shortage, because of which traders in the Capital have informed growers in HP about their inability to buy the fruits.“We are engaged in cherry cultivation and harvesting has already begun. We have been holding discussions with Azadpur traders with whom we have a longstanding agreement for fruit procurement,” said Deepak Singha the general secretary of the Kotgarh Horticultural and Environment Society. Desperate for help, the growers have now approached buyers like Reliance and Big Basket for purchasing the highly perishable fruit.The society has also suggested that the government allow major companies to send their air conditioned trucks up to Theogh for transporting the produce out of the state. Much of the produce is sold in Punjab and Shimla. “Since Punjab is under lockdown and tourism season has gone for a toss, it’s going to be very difficult to sell the produce,” said Anup Bhailak, a grower in Kotgarh. More than seven varieties of cherries are grown in the mid- and high-altitude regions of Shimla, Kullu, Mandi, Chamba, Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti districts. At least 10,000 small farmers grow cherries in nearly 550 hectares of the total fruit growing area with 75 % cherry cultivation done in Shimla district.Cherry is now considered by some farmers as a better alternative to apples. Apple trees take 10 years to grow whereas cherry trees grow in three years.Red , Black Heart, Durane Nero, Stella, Celcier, Bing, Merchant and Sunburst are some of the commercial cherry varieties grown in Shimla district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/prospects-dim-for-hp-growers-as-cherry-harvesting-begins-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-LPTlPApFa4R29ugwIAtN8J.html

This will help us to contain the spread of Covid-19 cases.”Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said, “It is a welcome move by PMC. In most of the Covi-19 deaths, it was found that the oxygen level in the blood was very low. Mainly senior citizens and people will comorbid conditions like diabetics, blood pressure, heart and kidney-related ailments are vulnerable and such preventive steps will help save lives and stop the spread of the Sars-cov-2 virus.”Mhaisekar said, “Senior citizens and people with comorbid conditions should cooperate with the civic official teams.”All the 350 teams formed by PMC are well equipped with pulse oximeters and thermometers, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/350-civic-teams-to-measure-oxygen-levels-of-vulnerable-groups-in-pune-containment-zones/story-xYmVduQz0EFDaYVtAONW1H.html
28-04-2020||Mumbai||College principals can serve beyond 5-year term as HC quashes clause in UGC regulations||College principals can now continue to hold their posts till retirement, as the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday quashed a clause in the University Grants Commission (UGC) regulations, 2010, that converted their permanent posts into term posts of five years. A bench of justices ZA Haq and Manish Pitale struck down clause 5.1.6(d) of the UGC regulations, stating it was “manifestly arbitrary.”UGC amended the regulations in 2016 and introduced the clause which capped the term of college principals to five years. It is extendable to another five years, provided the incumbent successfully undergoes the selection process and an external peer review.Twelve college principals, from Vidarbha region, had moved HC challenging the clause’s validity. They argued that the amendment arbitrarily curtailed the age of superannuation of college principals and because of it they will be unemployed once their 5-year tenure ends. UGC responded to the petitions, contending that the concept of term appointments and external peer review was well-founded and was based on an internationally accepted practice. It stated that the clause’s introduction had become necessary to keep principals on their toes so that they excel both in academics and administration.The bench, however, refused to accept the justification.“It is difficult to accept the contentions of the UGC that only by introducing such curtailed tenure of appointment...the incumbents would be kept on their toes and that only by such method they would excel in academic and administrative fields,” stated the bench.“If the management finds a person appointed to the post of principal not performing...steps can certainly be taken against such a principal. But by introducing the aforesaid clause and virtually converting a permanent post into a tenure post, the action is rendered arbitrary and unsustainable.”It added that when a person joins a particular service, the age of retirement is known and based on experience and addition of qualifications, such a person expects his/her career graph to move in a particular direction.Upon the introduction of the clause, the span of service of principal stood curtailed and the incumbent was to be discontinued from service much before the age of retirement, the bench stated. “This is an assault on the legitimate expectation of petitioners and other similarly situated persons. Therefore, it can certainly be held to be an unreasonable restriction on such persons and their expectation of career progression,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/college-principals-can-serve-beyond-5-year-term-as-hc-quashes-clause-in-ugc-regulations/story-t1rNk4IOzpRJFjYcVZY8KI.html

We have given them identity cards, masks, sanitisers and face-shields. Within the next few days, we are aiming for 5,000 SPOs. We ensure that these are people without any political connection or criminal record,” said additional CP Morale.The micro-clusters are places with high population density and over five positive cases. These were identified after scanning of addresses and whereabouts of positive cases in the city.Among the 120 micro-clusters, where the SPOs are helping out, are Tadiwala road, Patil estate, Lakshminagar, Parvati Paytha, Lumbininagar and Bhagyodaynagar.Sujit Yadav, 48, an SPO working in Tadiwala road, said, “We work is done in three shifts of four hours each. We wear a forearm band which has a Maharashtra police logo on it. The police have provided us with a sanitiser, face mask and face shield is provided. We deliver everything from groceries, chicken, eggs, vegetables among others. People pay through cash or transfer money online.”“There is a fixed time table for everything from use of public toilet to delivering groceries. This has helped in isolating people inside their homes to contain the spread of Sar-Co-2 virus,” he said.“These SOPs are from the same areas. We have made a pyramid structure and WhatsApp groups to keep a track. They send pictures with time and location every day,” said senior PI Shrikant Shinde of Bundgarden police station.Other SPOs in the city include secretaries of housing societies, social workers, and young volunteers.

28-04-2020||Mumbai||After GP’s death, Mumbai’s pvt doctors seek life insurance||Although it has been days since a 36-year-old general physician (GP) succumbed to Covid-19, which he may have contracted from the Covid-positive patients he had been treating, the state health department is yet to declare any compensation amount for the GP. The GP was a private practitioner. Private practitioners have demanded that the life insurance scheme announced by the Union health ministry should be extended to doctors with private practices who are treating Covid-19 patients.The doctor, who passed away on April 22, used to run a clinic in Shivaji Nagar, which is a hotspot for Covid-19. He was among those who kept their clinics open as per the protocols of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. The deceased doctor’s brother said, “I haven’t received any call from the state health department or the corporation [BMC] about any insurance or compensation.”Private medical practitioners have alleged a bias against private doctors on part of the government. In early April, the Union health ministry had announced a Rs 50 lakh insurance cover for doctors, nurses and other frontline medical workers. It remains unclear whether the insurance cover will be offered to private practitioners who are treating Covid-19 patients.Former president of the Mahim-Dharavi Medical Practitioner Association Dr Sanjeev Khosla said, “In a pandemic situation, where doctors are being asked to open up their clinics without proper source of protective gear, the government needs to bring private practitioners under the insurance schemes.” He further added that private practitioners were among “the most vulnerable group” as many infected patients approach these doctors first and are then referred a hospital dedicated to treating Covid-19.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) instructed private clinics to remain open, as per the conditions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, since there is a shortage of medical professionals. On Monday, the civic body requested the Mahim-Dharavi Medical Practitioner Association to open 350 clinics to screen and identify possible patients in Dharavi, where almost 300 Covid-positive cases have been diagnosed.So far, five more medical professionals have tested positive for the virus in Shivaji Nagar and around 500 clinics have been forced to shut down in the ward because the doctors don’t have protective gear.“In the state, 80% of patients are asymptomatic, so we don’t even know if the patient is infected. This is a pandemic situation and even private non-Covid doctors are indirectly standing at the frontline, getting exposed to the virus,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, state president (Maharashtra) of the Indian Medical Association.Despite repeated calls, Rajesh Tope, the state health minister, could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-gp-s-death-city-s-pvt-doctors-seek-life-insurance/story-vtLU8ryk39eHhk8tPXXEbK.html
28-04-2020||Patna||82 arrested in Bihar for trying to spread communal disharmony through social media||Around 82 people have been arrested in Bihar for spreading communal disharmony through rumours, malicious and defamatory messages on social media relating the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), officials said on Tuesday.Most were arrested when they tried to defame people of a certain community by exchanging baseless and inflammatory messages through social media, including WhatsApp and Facebook, said sources.Police have also lodged 153 cases in the last one month since the first Covid-19 case was reported on March 22 in the state, officials added.“All the 153 cases have been lodged under different sections, including the information technology (IT) act, the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the disaster management act,” said Jitendra Kumar, Bihar’s additional director general of police (headquarters).The number of cases had gone up from 104 on April 20 to 153 on Tuesday, he said.“The Muzaffarpur and Shahabad range of deputy inspectors general of police account for 17 such cases each, followed by Saran, which reported 13 cases till April 20,” said Kumar.The police also arrested some who tried to spread misconceptions about the ongoing nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were initially imposed for 21 days on March 25 and extended on April 15 for another 19 days till May 3, to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.For instance, in Katihar, the police had arrested an individual running a portal for propagating a fake video about a Covid-19 patient moving around unattended in a government facility, said sources.In Bhojpur, police had lodged cases against those who shared inflammatory WhatsApp photographs, including some who commented branding members of a particular community as carriers of the virus, the source added.Those fanning baseless messages about the Tablighi Jamaat through social media had also been punished, the source said.Police had also acted firmly against those trying to portray women in poor light.“It’s our fervent appeal to the people to be wary of messages circulating on social media. They should not forward them without proper verification. We take them very seriously,” Kumar said sounding a note of caution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/82-arrested-in-bihar-for-trying-to-spread-communal-disharmony-through-social-media/story-Xj7SRxtW4JrLbOYZIgaJvO.html
28-04-2020||Pune||Families in Pune struggle to mourn death of loved ones in the time of Covid-19||The month of April usually brings more business for Javed Kazi, an electrician by profession. This time though it was a double whammy for Kazi as Covid-19 (coronavirus) killed his 50-year-old mother on April 14.“The virus did not just take away my mother, but everything from me. Post her death, we (the family members) were tested and found positive for Sars-Cov-2 virus,” said Kazi implying that he didn’t even get time to console for the loss of his mother.The story is no different for the 26-year-old resident of Hadapsar who works at a multinational company in the city. The youth, who requested anonymity, lost his 73-year-old father at Nobel hospital on April 8, six days after he was hospitalised for respiratory illness and tested positive for Covid-19.Though none of the other three members from the family of deceased tested positive, they had to be quarantined as they were in contact with 73-year-old.“It was tragic as we could not be on the side of our father when he passed away. Moreover, due to government guidelines, we could not attend the final rites of our father,” said the eldest son of the deceased.For most who lost their loved ones, their lives have now turned upside down. “The tragedy took away everything from us. I am the sole breadwinner of my family and the lockdown has prevented me from stepping out, leaving me in a difficult position at home to manage finances,” said Kazi, who also could attend final rites of his mother.In most cases of Covid-19 related deaths in Pune, which has seen 75 deaths till Monday afternoon, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) along with a couple of NGOs have been helping cremate bodies.Razi Khan, a member of the Popular Front of India whose volunteers are closely working with the civic administration to perform last rites of Covid-19 victims from the Muslim community, said till now they have buried 20 bodies in the city.“We are burying the bodies which are not claimed by their family members as they are either quarantined or are kept in hospitals. In some of the cases, we managed to make the bereaved family members part of the last rites rituals through video calls,” said Khan.In another case from Baramati, when 30-year-old Sameer Bagwan lost his father, a vegetable vendor who died at Sassoon hospital in the city, the shock was so that he did not share the news with mother for next few days. “Most of our family members were tested positive after my father’s death and we were put under quarantine. We were unable to perform the last rites of my father. However, we decided to be strong to overcome the crisis,” said Bagwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/families-in-pune-struggle-to-mourn-death-of-loved-ones-in-the-time-of-covid-19/story-7dwsIXhi22CoRnvF2hGJTO.html

28-04-2020||Pune||Pune district admin to fund treatment of Covid-19 patients in private hospitals using govt schemes||The Covid-19 (coronavirus) patients will be treated free at private hospitals, according to a decision taken during a meeting held on Monday of representatives of private hospitals and the Pune district administration.Patients undergoing treatment for Covid-19 in the dedicated Covid-19 heath centres and dedicated Covid-19 hospitals can avail these benefits.The district administration on Monday announced that the payment of patients will be covered by the civic body and district administration or under government schemes.The cost of the treatment, according to officials, which goes into lakhs into private hospitals had become a point of conflict between patients and private hospitals.Shekhar Gaikwad, PMC commissioner, said, “The expenses of treatment of Covid-19 patients who are being treated for Covid-19 at private hospitals will we borne by us. We will sign a memorandum of understanding soon. The treatment cost will be charged under the scheme and the charges will be defined in the MOU too, the remaining charges will be borne by the PMC.”“We are trying to take over more private hospitals to include more patients, the city hospitals must keep us updated as to how many beds are available with them on a daily basis for isolation purpose and for ICU if need be,” he added.The civic body had earlier requested the state government to chalk out a referral policy for private hospitals as far as critical COVID-19 patients are concerned.Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director at Sahyadri Specialty hospital, said, “At the meeting it was decided that there should be no inconvenience to the patient whatsoever. Those who have medical insurance, the insurance companies have agreed to bear the cost of treating Covid-19 positive cases although the real questions is about the patients who do not have insurance cover and cannot afford to pay lakhs.”“We have been asked to charge no bill to the patient and the money should be retrieved through the various government schemes like Mahatma Jyotiba Pule Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana or PMC’s urban poor health insurance scheme,” said Dr Rao.While these government schemes pay only about Rs 35,000 to one lakh, for the remaining amount there is not clear answer yet, said private doctors. “We have been asked to not focus on the money and instead ensure that the there is no convenience to the patient. Also regarding shifting patients, only those who are stable have to be transferred but not the critical patients,” said Rao.According to divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar private hospitals are prepared to treat Covid-19 patients looking at the current condition of the city which may worsen in future“With regards to the remuneration of the bill of Covid-19 positive cases, it will be done as per the rules and treatment of the patient, the administration will support private hospitals,” said Mhaisekar.“The administration has also decided to pool in the money from the district planning committee, for those seeking treatment in urban, rural and the three cantonment areas and Rs five crore has already been reserved for the same,” said district collector Naval Kishore Ram.Dedicated Covid-19 health centresDr Naidu HospitalRuby HospitalJehangir HospitalInlaks BudhraniColumbia Asia HospitalKEM HospitalSahyadri Hospital, KarvenagarSahyadri Hospital ,KothrudSahyadri Hospital, BibvewadiNoble Hospital, HadapsarDeenanath Mangeshkar HospitalSassoon General HospitalAundh Civil HospitalBharati HospitalSymbiosis Hospital, LavaleDedicated Covid-19 hospitalsSassoon General HospitalSymbiosis HospitalBharati Hospital||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-district-admin-to-fund-treatment-of-covid-19-patients-in-private-hospitals-using-govt-schemes/story-hiIUaXk7VfVPD49uW3mKWN.html
28-04-2020||Jaipur||Jaipur surgeons question non-sterile PPE kits; administration points to cost factor, supple delay||Surgeons in Rajasthan’s Jaipur have raised an alarm over the supply of non-sterile personal protective equipment (PPE) kits that are being used in operation theatres (OTs). The administration of the SMS Hospital, the premier institution in the state, has said on its part that procuring sterile kits will add to the cost and lead to a delay in supply so they were getting non-sterile kits that can be sterilised in OT sterilisation units before use.“I noticed today that the PPE kits given to us are non-sterile. I checked with the supplier and he confirmed that he was giving non-sterile kits to the government. This is grave because use of non-sterile kits will expose patients in OT to infections,” a surgeon at SMS Hospital in Jaipur said requesting anonymity.Another surgeon, who also didn’t want to be identified, said he also noticed that the PPE kits were non-sterile.“When I reached out to the hospital administration, they said the OTs were being supplied both sterilised and non-sterilised kits. But I am yet to verify this,” he said.PPE kits in Rajasthan are procured by the Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation for use in government hospitals. According to a corporation official, it was getting the kits from four suppliers.Sunil Ramchandani, one of the suppliers based out of Jaipur, said sterilisation will disturb delivery schedules.“Sterilisation takes around 10-12 hours and in our plant and we can put about 100 kits in one lot. So for the supply of 50,000 kits, we need 5,000 hours. The government wanted us to stick to delivery schedules and we wouldn’t have been able to do that if we sterilised the kits,” he said.SMS Hospital’s superintendent Dr DS Meena said every operation theatre has a sterilisation unit and that the kits should be put through them before use.“There are ETO machines in OTs that should be used to sterile the PPE kits. Some OTs have plasma machines. All these are used to sterile equipment. The kits should also be put through them,” Dr Meena said.He said he was unaware about surgeons’ concerns but said they should be aware that a non-sterile item should be sterilised before use.When asked why hospitals don’t procure sterile kits, he said the sterilisation process will add to the cost and delay delivery. “We use around 1,500 kits a day and only 50-60 of them are used in the OTs. So our focus is on cost and timely delivery,” Dr Meena added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/jaipur-surgeons-question-non-sterile-ppe-kits-administration-points-to-cost-factor-supple-delay/story-jxBHLVRMHpcB9E8wDuBfEM.html

28-04-2020||Lucknow||UP govt nod to corona test labs in Bareilly, Budaun||The state government has given its nod to a proposal to set up biosafety laboratories for Covid-19 test at the district hospital in Bareilly and government medical college in Budaun.At present, testing of human samples for Covid-19 collected from Bareilly and neighbouring districts is done at Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) only.“The state government has given us the nod for setting up of a bio-safety laboratory level 2 for testing of samples for Covid-19. We intend to set up the lab at the old operation theatre building here,” said Dr TS Arya, chief medical superintendent, district hospital, Bareilly.Once they start functioning, these two laboratories will decrease the waiting time of the Covid-19 test reports. For instance, patients in Budaun will also be able to get report the same day. Besides, the number of people being tested daily for Covid-19 will also go up.“After approving a bio-safety laboratory level-3 here, the state government also sanctioned a budget of Rs 4.5 crore on Friday. We will now invite tenders to select a firm that will set up the laboratory. It will take over a month for the laboratory to become functional,” said Dr RP Singh, principal, Budaun government medical college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-nod-to-corona-test-labs-in-bareilly-budaun/story-FhFw91fqhFYDubCQXj4eBN.html
28-04-2020||Lucknow||Muslim woman donates blood to Hindu patient after first ‘roza’||Twenty nine-year-old Alisha Khan displayed a rare show of humanity and brotherhood, when soon after her first ‘roza’ (fast during Ramzan) she decided to donate blood to Vijay Rastogi, one she hardly knew.On Saturday, Jaspal Singh Pali who runs an NGO, under the aegis of Shahid Bhagat Singh Nishwarth Seva Samiti, to help those in urgent need for blood approached her.She was well-aware that her ‘O-negative’ blood group was rare to find, so without paying even a little attention towards the identity of the person, she told Jaspal to just wait till she is done fasting. And just as promised, immediately after completing her fast she reached the district hospital herself. Tripti Awasthi, a social activist said, “Vijay Rastogi, an inverter-battery shop owner was suffering from serious liver infection since long. A few days back his condition deteriorated with a sharp decline in hemoglobin level. The doctor advised his family members to arrange for blood at the earliest but despite several efforts at various blood banks in Kheri, they couldn’t get ‘O negative’ blood.”They then approached Jaspal, and also posted on social media, requesting people with the same blood group to help. Jaspal said when he came to know about the requirement he looked at the list of blood donors with him and found Alisha with the desired blood group.“When I talked to her and told her about the situation she readily agreed. She was rather happy that her blood was going to help a person in the holy ramzan month.” Rastogi’s family members were all praise for Alisha Khan and expressed immense gratitude.

28-04-2020||Lucknow||Gorakhpur reports first covid-19 patient who arrived from Delhi||Gorakhpur, which had so far managed to retain its green zone tag, reported its first Covid-19 patient on Sunday. The patient had traveled to Gorakhpur in an ambulance from Delhi with two co-workers and was admitted to BRD medical college where he tested positive.The man employed with a private company lived with two colleagues in Delhi. On April 19 he complained of chest pain after which he was rushed to Delhi’s Sarvodaya Hospital located in Sector 8. From there he was referred to Safdarjung Hospital the same day. However, for some reason, his two colleagues hired a private ambulance to take him to Gorakhpur instead. By the time the trio reached Gorakhpur on April 26, the man’s condition further deteriorated following which they called 108 ambulance and rushed him to BRD medical college where he tested positive. After this, the two men who traveled with him from Delhi to Gorakhpur, went missing. The police are trying to locate them.“The 50-year-old man who came from Delhi has been tested positive at BRD Medical College. He was already suffering from cardiac disease and high blood pressure. The 108 ambulance first took the trio to the district hospital from where he was referred to BRD Medical College. The two colleagues who accompanied the man from Delhi were being traced while the two Delhi hospitals where he was initially admitted have also been alerted,” Commissioner Jayant Narlikar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/gorakhpur-reports-first-covid-19-patient-who-arrived-from-delhi/story-1BBma5bKkosn0C1uYbde7N.html
28-04-2020||Lucknow||Police station in Sambhal ‘relocated’ after area declared hotspot||An entire police station in Sambhal district has been temporarily shifted to another location after the area was declared a corona hotspot by the district administration, said a senior police official.This happened after a 35-year-old man in the area tested positive for Covid-19 last week. The police station is located just opposite the house of this man.“We have shifted computers, wireless set and other equipment from Rajpura police station to the Ganvan outpost on Sunday where we have set up a temporary police station. We have also leased a room at the Rajpura sugar mill nearby as living quarters of the cops,” said superintendent of police Yamuna Prasad.The SP said the man had taken his mother for treatment to Delhi and then to a hospital in Moradabad. “After we got to know about his travel history, we put them in quarantine and sent their samples for testing. Once the man’s report came positive the administration declared the area hotspot on Saturday and then we decided to relocate the police station. Today, (Monday) even his mother has also tested positive,” said the SP.However, the SP said two policemen with safety gear have been posted at the abandoned police station for security purposes.

28-04-2020||Kolkata||Museums, zoos and science centres take virtual route during Covid-19 lockdown||With no visitors during the lockdown period, science centres, zoos and museums across India are opening up their galleries and enclosures on the internet for people to see them while staying at home.While some are hosting live streaming of animals 24x7, others are allowing citizens to take a virtual walkthrough of the museum galleries. Some are organising sky observation programs where visitors can log in to observe celestial events like the Super Pink Moon, which appeared on April 8.The Alipore Zoo in Kolkata, the oldest in India, launched a mobile application to help people take a virtual tour last week. Citizens can see a panoramic view of the zoo, check photos and videos in their enclosures with a voice-over option to know more about a particular animal they are interested in.The Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai was the first in India to start live streaming of animals in their enclosures, almost two years back. Its webpage is now getting almost 60,000-80,000 views every day during the lockdown period.“The page views have increased several times because of the lockdown. We now have live streaming of 14 species including tiger, lion, and hippos. There are 180 cameras installed in the zoo and animal enclosures,” Sudha Ramen, deputy director of Anna Arignar zoo, said.“For the lockdown, we have added an extra special feature in which we are focusing one animal at a time to show some particular activity of the animal. Say for example an elephant enjoying a shower,” Ramen said.Even though the pan-India lockdown had started on March 25, almost every zoo and museum had closed down much before that.The Indian Museum, the oldest and largest multi-purpose museum in India, is going to launch a virtual walkthrough very soon, said its director-in-charge Arijit Dutta Choudhury. Among its exhibits is a 4000-year-old mummy.“For now, people can see some of the most important collections, some of which are a few thousand years old, including statutes and coins. We have also started a program titled cultures of the world. We will soon start a virtual walk-through of the museum,” he said.And it’s not just the galleries and enclosures. Science museums and centres are also holding live shows and competitions too.“The lockdown came as a new challenge for the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) which has a network of 25 science museums and centres spread across the country. We decided not only to make people aware of coronavirus but also started organising various online programs and activities to connect with the visitors,” SN Singh, NCSM’s spokesperson, said. Since the lockdown began various science museums and science centres such as the National Science Centre in Delhi, Regional Science Centre in Guwahati, Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum in Bengaluru, Nehru Science Centre in Mumbai and the Science City in Kolkata all have opened up their galleries in the virtual world.There are panel discussions on Covid-19, DIY activities, celebrations of commemorative days like the World Earth Day and sky observation programs.“The program organised on April 8 to observe the Super Pink Moon by Birla Industrial and Technological Museum in Kolkata, Nehru Science Centre in Mumbai and National Science Centre in Delhi had more than 80,000 views of the live session through the Facebook Page,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/museums-zoos-and-science-centres-take-virtual-route-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-Vi6xtSHtLvTzKDDCFVu11L.html
28-04-2020||Chandigarh||Post-Covid, India set to emerge as world food factory, says Harsimrat Kaur Badal||Amid the coronavirus-enforced lockdown since March 25, Union minister of food processing industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal has been pulling out all the stops to deal with the most critical challenge on her plate: keeping the food supply chain up and running. Responding to a set of questions from Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak, Shiromani Akali Dal MP from Bathinda on Monday outlined her priorities, sounded optimistic on India’s post-Covid-19 potential in global food exports and sharply criticised the Capt Amarinder Singh government’s handling of the crisis in Punjab. Edited excerpts:When you look at the nationwide essential supplies people need to sustain themselves under lockdown, what share does the food processing industry have in that big piece?The priority of the government was to ensure food security in the face of all challenges and disruptions. In this regard, the role of the ministry of food processing industries (MoFPI) is the most critical. Any disruption in the availability of food will lead to what are called ‘food riots’. Nutritious food helps the immune system to fight infections. This crisis has come in the middle of the harvesting season for crops such as wheat and perishable crops like tomatoes and mangoes. The processing of crops extends their shelf life and ensures food security. We are experiencing a realignment of the global supply chains in the wake of the Covid crisis. The Indian food processing industry is gearing up to be the food factory of the world as new opportunities are emerging for export of Indian products.Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who has been practising social distancing in the past also, has failed to lead from the front by assessing problems and providing solutions.What are the challenges for the food processing industry at different levels of manufacturing, storing in cold chains, transportation and distribution?One of the major challenges faced by the industry has been varied interpretation of directions of the central government by the local authorities at the ground level. This has led to the disruption of raw material supplies, consignments being held up and industries not being able to operate.To resolve these issues, my ministry has set up a Covid helpline to address industry problems. Nodal officers have been assigned to coordinate with the state authorities to resolve the issues faced by the industry. I speak to state food processing ministers every week to get feedback on the ground situation.What steps are you taking to keep prices under check?We are working with the industry to ensure full capacity utilisation by resolving problems faced by them at the local level. We have aligned the infrastructure of cold storage and warehousing created by 800 plus projects supported by the MoFPI with the food processing industry and the ministry of agriculture to provide adequate storage of perishables in the medium term.Would you say that it is boom time for the food processing industry, given that consumption has continued, if not increased, and anxious buyers are lapping up the goods?This is a time of conservative optimism for the industry. It is a fact that the food industry is better placed than other sectors of the economy as far as demand is concerned. New avenues are opening up in the export sector as well. The challenge is to ensure that the fruit and vegetable crop of the farmers is purchased and that there is adequate supply to the units processing these products. In addition, uninterrupted supply of ancillary inputs like packaging material has to be ensured and the logistics for retail has to be made completely operational. In the words of the Prime Minister, this is a time to “reform and transform” to cater to the new normal.The Punjab government is creating a smokescreen by harping on a central package to divert attention from its failures. Lies are being spread about the central aid to the state.Since flights, both domestic and international, have been suspended, what impact is it having on the export of these food items, or import of ingredients used in manufacturing?In my interactions with food product exporters, concerns have been raised about factors delaying export consignments. These are being caused due to restrictions the world over. I have already taken up the issues with commerce minister Piyush Goyal. The government has ensured a seamless supply chain for perishable goods such as milk, meat, fish, vegetables and fruits. Indian Railways has been running freight trains for perishable goods from the producer to the market. The civil aviation ministry has operated special flights on both domestic and international routes.Is anxiety about the transmission of Covid-19 through food items throwing up any challenges in terms of the acceptability of Indian products in the international market? After all, India exports a lot of meat products.The handling of the Covid-19 threat by the Indian government has been appreciated by global agencies such as World Health Organisation. As a result of the proactive steps by the government, today we are in a much better position than even developed countries. Post-Covid, India is emerging as an alternate destination for the world to fulfil its food needs. Some exporters are already looking at opportunities beyond traditional markets. We will emerge stronger as a result of our efficient handling of the crisis.What kind of horizon are you envisioning for the food processing industry in the next 30, 60 and 90 days?Within the next 30 days, our aim is to work towards full capacity utilisation of the food processing industry within the norms of social distancing. We are making all efforts to ensure that perishables from the ongoing harvesting season are preserved by leveraging the infrastructure. In two months, I’ll be working towards policy interventions to make the industry ready for challenges and opportunities in the post-Covid scenario. Our long-term vision is to take up opportunities that have become available as a result of the realignment of the global food supply chains.How will the global crisis impact foreign direct investment in the food processing sector in India?In the short term, there may be certain changes in the pattern of fund flows across the globe. In the long run, the Indian food industry will become a favoured destination for global capital as we are the largest producers of food in the world and are capable of fulfilling global food needs.What is your assessment of the handling of the corona crisis in Punjab?Well, the Punjab government has failed on all parameters. The average Covid-19 mortality rate in the state, which is nearly 7%, is among the highest in the country. The state has failed to instil confidence in health workers by failing to provide them adequate PPE kits. Testing is still lacking. Patients have been complaining about hygiene and treatment in government hospitals. Farm labourers and daily wagers have not received any benefit. Health workers have not been encouraged with double salary, something like what Haryana has done. There is no relief from power bills for the common man or the industry. The poor are suffering due to the politicisation in the distribution of central food relief. If not for gurdwaras and NGOs, there would have been food riots. Even now farmers are undergoing extreme hardship in mandis.First, the e-pass system collapsed. Now lifting is not taking place. This is clogging grain markets. Political will is needed in this time of crisis. Sadly, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who has been practising social distancing in the past also, has failed to lead from the front by assessing problems and providing solutions. The Punjab government should have come out with a post-Covid plan to instil confidence in people and the industry to revive the state’s economy.What is your view on the Amarinder government’s demand for a special central package to tide over the crisis?The Punjab government is creating a smokescreen by harping on a central package to divert attention from its failures. Lies are being spread that the Centre has given only Rs 71 crore on account of Covid. The Centre has given Rs 112 crore under the National Health Mission, including Rs 71 crore for emergency measures for Covid. The government has been able to spend only 37% of the Rs 71 crore sent to it for emergency purposes. Besides this, the state has received Rs 247 crore under the state disaster management fund. Why has this money not been used till now? Also, the state has an accumulated amount of Rs 6,000 crore under the disaster management fund with it.The Centre has sanctioned use of this money to combat COVID-19. Why isn’t the state using this amount? This is not all. Punjab has also received close to Rs 4,000 crore under GST compensation. The government should use this money to counter Covid immediately. The Centre has given direct relief to the people by allocating 5kg wheat and one kg pulses per month for 1.4 crore people which is half the population of the state.How will the Corona crisis change the contours of politics that has always centred on mobilisation and grassroots rapport with people?There will be a huge overall change in how politics is done in the next two years. I think future elections will be fought on credibility and performance. Governments and parties will be measured by how they reached out to people during the present times and whether they succeeded in mitigating their problems or not. Since rallies and mass programmes will be out, leaders will have to reach out to people through social media. Social distancing will continue for a long time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/post-covid-india-set-to-emerge-as-world-food-factory-says-harsimrat-kaur-badal/story-HLnOA8NdeqkVZs9bNLPmRN.html
28-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s JJ Hospital to soon test 2.2K samples for Covid-19, highest in India||The laboratory at Mumbai’s Sir JJ Hospital will soon be able to test 2,200 samples every day, making it the largest testing facility in India. The upgrade will take the daily testing capacity to over 12,000 in the state, the highest in the country.Currently, JJ Hospital is testing 100 samples every day and the capacity will be upgraded by the end of the month. The testing capacity of the elite National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune is 800 samples daily. The other two government-run hospitals – GT and St George – have already been turned into Covid hospitals.“We are setting up a mega RT-PCR laboratory at JJ hospital to conduct more tests. In the first phase, within 2-3 days, the lab will be upgraded to test 1,000 samples,” said an official of Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD).The MEDD held a meeting on Monday evening. An official who was part of the meeting said, “The kits required to push the capacity to 2,200 are not available in India. We have sent a request to the ICMR who will procure it for us. So, it will take 15 days to upgrade the lab to mega lab.”Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is highly infectious and since it a new virus, there is no cure, vaccine, or widespread immunity to it. Finding the infected and isolating them until they can no longer spread the disease is the only way to contain the spread.Maharashtra has already increased its testing capacity to over 10,000 per day. So far, the state has 48 laboratories, including 29 in government set-ups and the 19 laboratories run by private companies. After Monday’s meeting, the lab strength went up to 50, as two more government labs have been added.Maharashtra has become the first state in India to get permission from ICMR to run 50 labs, followed by Tamil Nadu with 30 testing labs. “South Korea was widely praised for running 10,000 tests every day. [At present, the country is conducting 20,000 tests]. Now, with the addition of the new upgrade, we will be able to touch the mark, but we are in the process to add more labs,” he said. “We are the only state in India which has tested over 1 lakh people since the outbreak,” he added.The state is focusing on PCR tests which directly detect the presence of an antigen, rather than antibodies. The process detects the virus RNA which develops in the body before the formation of antibodies or development of symptoms of the disease. It helps in early detection of the presence of virus in the body.The waiting period for permission, too, has become shorter as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Nagpur is now an approving agency. All scrutiny for validation is being carried out either by NIV or AIIMS, Nagpur. “Since reporting the first positive case in the state (March 7), we have added one lab almost every day in the state to do as many tests as possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-jj-hospital-to-soon-test-2-2k-samples-for-covid-19-highest-in-india/story-hPNWKz4Eor4ktnVRDmewBN.html

28-04-2020||Pune||This Pune medical officer stays by the deceased in their final journey||What is it like to oversee and ensure the burial and cremation of those dead from Covid-19? Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) Assistant medical officer, Dr. Kalpana Baliwant, knows. It is what she has been doing in these unprecedented times in a city besieged by the pandemic.As of April 24, 68 patients have died of Covid-19 in Pune district. “It was very difficult for me in the initial stages when the relatives would not come forward to take charge of the dead body. Even the civic staff was fearful and had refused to perform the final rites,” she said. “In the case of Muslim families, there were challenges with regards to the burial of the dead patients as the families were either unwilling to come forward or were themselves under quarantine.”An MD by qualification, Dr Baliwant earned her MBBS degree from Mumbai and her post-graduate degree from Pune’s BJ Medical College. She has been working with the PMC for the past 27 years and heads the Births and Deaths registration department.In the case of Muslim patients, the PMC successfully tied up with two Muslim organisations, whose volunteers came forward and helped the municipal corporation in performing the final rites.Used to regular office hours in the municipal corporation, once the Covid-19 deaths started, Baliwant was on duty round the clock.After office hours, her bedroom became her control room. “I had to personally coordinate with the ambulance, the staff at the crematorium, and the doctors and ensure that the burial or cremation happened properly. Even the civic staff at the crematorium was reluctant to handle the dead bodies, but eventually they overcame their fears,” said Dr Baliwant.Pune has 33 crematoriums. Of these, 17 fall in the areas which are designated hot spots of the disease. It was therefore decided to do the final rites in the periphery areas and six crematoriums were identified for this.The crematoriums were linked to specific hospitals for better coordination. However, in some cases, relatives had their own preferences and the civic staff had to deal with them firmly, if necessary.“We increased the staff at the crematoriums, which helped us to streamline the process and ensure that the protocol was followed,” she said.As the head of the Births and Deaths registration department in the civic body, Dr. Baliwant has also been responsible for supervising the final rites of orphans and those of unclaimed or unidentified dead bodies. To assist citizens who needed the death certificate urgently, she introduced an online facility so that visits to the PMC were not required and the certificates could be emailed.Dr. Baliwant’s husband is also a doctor and is employed with the Pune Cantonment Board where he has been treating Covid -19 positive cases. “In fact, he has direct contact with positive patients and has to take far greater precaution than me,” she said.While their elder son is in the US, the younger one is at home and both Dr Baliwant and her husband are deeply concerned about his safety.“We take adequate precautions while on duty by wearing masks, hand gloves and using sanitiser. Since my husband is treating Covid-19 patients, he is required to use personal protective equipment (PPE),” she said.Positive and optimistic about the future, she said, “It’s a challenging situation for all of us and we will definitely overcome it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/this-pune-medical-officer-stays-by-the-deceased-in-their-final-journey/story-9iT9suLJZr7tE4rS1QnuVO.html
28-04-2020||City||Distancing a luxury for underprivileged kids in Ludhiana as they queue up for food||With household fast supplies drying up and parents out of work amid the lockdown, it is the children of the underprivileged who are the worst-hit in these times. Barely managing two square meals a day, social distancing is a luxury they cannot afford as they are forced to stand in long queues for hours on everyday for a pack of roti and dal. And that for them is no less than a daily dose of chocolate, ice-cream or noodles that their more privileged counterparts seem to enjoy.At ward 76, where councillor and Punjab Small Industries and Exports Corporation (PSIEC) chairman Gurpreet Gogi has established a ‘Roti Bank’, several children, as young as five, can be seen waiting for food in the long queues. Gogi too says that he has noticed a sizable presence of children in food distribution queues.A six-year-old girl who was seen waiting in a queue at Ghumar Mandi said, “My mother asked me to come here and fetch food as there nothing to eat at home. I like noodles and chocolates but I am really hungry and have no choice.”Another nine-year-old girl who was standing in the queue said, “My mother, who was working as a domestic help, has lost her job and is sitting at home. My father, a construction labourer, has also been thrown out of his job. There is no money and the owner of the room is pressing us to pay the rent. I was hungry since morning. I saw many children of our locality standing in the queue to grab a meal. So I have also decided to come here too. I hope that I also get food to eat.”That the kids are left to fend for themselves is also evident from the fact that of the 200 distress calls the childline has received in the last one month, at least 90% is regarding shortage of food. Though the childline fears that complaints of abuse and violence will start surfacing once the lockdown is lifted, at the moment they are doing their best to mitigate the food crisis. Arshdeep Singh, coordinator, Ludhiana district, said all calls related to help for food were from the migrant labourers residing in different areas of the district. “When our team visits the house of the caller to provide them food, we first check the quantity of ration being stored by them, number of children in the house and provide them food accordingly. We also check the availability of food in the nearby houses also where migrant workers are residing and provide them ration. During the visit to these houses we also counsel the children,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/distancing-a-luxury-for-underprivileged-kids-in-ludhiana-as-they-queue-up-for-food/story-B7bYxOpOxeIpssrcqEYPWO.html
28-04-2020||City||Besides improved air quality, Ludhiana sees record drop in temperature||The lockdown has not only improved air quality in the city, but it has also led to dip in the usual temperature during April. While the air quality index (AQI) of the city was recorded at 64 points, the overnight 3.4mm rainfall smashed the 34-year temperature record of April 27.While the maximum temperature was recorded at 29.4 degrees Celsius (C), the minimum was 20.6 degrees C. The plunge in the maximum temperature on April 27 was last recorded in 1986 when the maximum temperature was recorded at 27.3 degrees C.On April 26, the temperature was recorded at 31 degrees C, while on this day in 1982, the temperature was recorded at 28.5 degrees C.From April 14 to April 20 (barring two occasions), the average maximum temperature should be 35.2 degrees C, whereas it was recorded at 34.3 degrees C.On the other hand, it was only in 1982 that the city had witnessed a drop in temperature and the average temperature of 32.1 degrees C was reported during this period.Similarly, from April 21 to 27, while the average maximum temperature should ideally be around 37 degrees C, the city recorded 32.2 degrees of average maximum temperature during this period.This phenomenon was last witnessed in 1982, when the city had recorded an average maximum temperature of 32.8 degrees C during the same period, said Dr Prabhjyot Kaur, head of the department of school of climate change and agricultural meteorology at PAU.As per the weather expert, it is for the first time in a decade that the temperature in April will not touch 40 degree Celsius.So far, only on two days, the mercury had touched 38 degrees C on April 14 and 15. While on April 24, 2019, the city had recorded 41 degree Celsius temperature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/besides-improved-air-quality-ludhiana-sees-record-drop-in-temperature/story-ldP0Yc3UiViXD1NaHk5cpL.html
28-04-2020||India||Celebrations amid lockdown: Cops make birthdays and anniversaries unforgettable||Those born in the month of April and May must be feeling a little odd this year considering the Covid-19 lockdown would have spoiled their plans of celebrating their special day. Neither can these people — who have their birthday or anniversary or any other occasion — can go out and party nor can they meet their friends. But, in times like these, it’s the cops who are helping the families of birthday girls and boys or couples, to celebrate their special day. And in GK, @DelhiPolice wishing people Happy Birthday 🥳 ... pic.twitter.com/hjalNbeZifApparently, the trend started from USA, where a bunch of police vehicles halted on the street in front of a house and cops sang happy birthday for a youngster. Soon cops in India followed suit. Bollywood actor Riteish Deshmukh shared a video on his Facebook, and wrote, “What a good gesture. In USA, a father called police and told it was his son’s birthday and no one came due to Covid-19. See the amazing response for police.”  What a good gesture.In USA, a father called Police and told it was his son's Birthday and no one came due to Covid-19. See the amazing response from Police! pic.twitter.com/CFmsD9TNVJThe kindness act was soon followed by Punjab Police, too. Punjab Police cops drove their bikes, and paused to sing the birthday song while handing a gift pack to the mother of the birthday boy. Their coordinated act was quite well performed, and drew much applause from social media users the world over.  Kindness, home-delivered! #IndiaFightsCorona Policemen in Mansa, #Punjab surprised baby Maira and her family by delivering a birthday cake. Share stories of champions near you, using #CoronaWarriorsIndia. 📽️- @PunjabPoliceInd pic.twitter.com/py66wagVogWhen a number of forces, worldwide, have been doing their bit to make people feel happy on their special days, how can Delhi Police be left behind. The men in khakhi not only celebrated the birthday and cut a cake for a couple, but also wished them a very happy marriage anniversary in a unique way — they offered the couple a plant and wished them a happy life ahead. Well, it certainly takes some strength to maintain the law and order in a city while practising kindness and mindfulness in the fight against coronavirus pandemic.

28-04-2020||City||Ludhiana childline received 200 distress calls in first month of lockdown||The Ludhiana childline (1098) has received and responded to around 200 distress calls in the last one month since the curfew was imposed. This is a five-fold increase for the childline, which receives 40 to 60 calls a month in normal times.Of the total, 90% of the calls were related to shortage of food. The childline officials are, however, anticipating more cases of child abuse and violence to surface once the lockdown is over. “Earlier, almost all the calls were related to missing or abused children. But, this time, around 90% of the callers were those who were facing a shortage of food while 5% of callers demanded education-related services,” said Kuldeep Singh Mann, director, Childline Ludhiana.He added that the childline had also received some panic calls during the initial stage of lockdown. “Some were silent calls and 1% of the calls related to violence on children.”Arshdeep Singh, coordinator, Childline Ludhiana district, said, “The calls about help for food were from the migrant labourers residing in different areas of the district.”About help for food, he said, “When a team visits the house of the caller to provide food, we first check the quantity of ration being stored by them, the number of children in the house and provide them food accordingly. We also check the availability of food in nearby houses before providing ration. During the visit to these houses, we also counsel the children.”The Childline of Ludhiana Railway Station is also extending help to the district Childline during the lockdown.Kulwinder Singh, coordinator, Childline Ludhiana Railway Station, said, “During initial days of lockdown, there were some distress calls from children of well-off families and these children were counselled. The children were anxious and annoyed as they were forced to stay home.” “The children from poor families, who knew about the Childline and had taken help earlier also, demanded stationery items for school projects,” he added.‘CHILD ABUSE CALLS MAY INCREASE AFTER LOCKDOWN’Childline director Kuldeep Singh Mann said, “Many children must be facing violence nowadays but, as they cannot move out of houses and are staying 24 hours with parents and guardians, they may be not able to call for help. If domestic violence, as reported, has increased by over 20% during the lockdown period, it means that the mental health of those children, witnessing violence at home, is also being affected. So, when lockdown is over, it is likely that there will be a sudden increase in the number of complaints regarding child abuse or missing children.”“A special workshop is going to be conducted soon to guide the coordinators about the steps to be taken to counsel the children and the family members,” Mann added.He added, “At present, there are 20 employees of then Childline in the district (including Childline of Ludhiana Railway Station) and, apart from them, there are around 65 volunteers. So, there is enough strength to deal with cases if these complaints will increase in coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-childline-received-200-distress-calls-in-first-month-of-lockdown/story-hFkGxKGPfDGe0nrhWY0wsM.html

I put on my uniform to convey a message to the nursing fraternity that I’m one of their own. I interacted with the nursing staff to encourage them in their valiant fight against the pandemic. These are hard times. We need to stand by each other to fight this pandemic together,” she told HT.“She went to the hospital today and offered to work but she is 57 and thus cannot serve as a nurse. Nevertheless, she has signed up saying she would like to join if needed,”said a senior Shiv Sena leader.On Tuesday, Pednekar plans to make a similar visit to the BMC-run Sion Hospital. Pednekar had quarantined herself at her official residence in Byculla for a week after 53 journalists were recently tested positive for Covid-19 at a health camp organised by the BMC, which Pednekar also had attended. She had announced that she would quarantine herself at home for two weeks, but cut short the isolation after her test came negative for the second consecutive time.“I stepped out after both my swab samples tested negative. I’m Mumbai’s first citizen and I need to work for the Mumbaiites,” she added.Pednekar, who was born to a mill worker father, started her career as a nurse before she took to politics and joined Shiv Sena’s women’s wing in 1992. Initially, she worked for the Sena in Raigad and Sindhudurg districts. She was elected a BMC councillor in 2002 was re-elected in 2012 and 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-mayor-dons-nurse-s-uniform-again-visits-nair-hospital-to-encourage-medical-staff/story-RwWvthpOUdNEOXY8B7hifM.html
28-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Cabinet to ask governor to nominate CM Uddhav Thackeray as MLC at the earliest||The Maharashtra cabinet, in a meeting presided over by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Monday, decided to write to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari reiterating its earlier recommendation to process the nomination of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to the legislative Council at the earliest. The CM was not present for the meeting. “A decision was taken to reiterate the recommendation to nominate Uddhav ji to the legislative Council. A reference to the recommendation of the cabinet will be made in the new letter. Keeping politics aside, the Governor should nominate the CM to the upper house,” a cabinet minister said.Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers said that Pawar will write to the Governor to speed up the procedure as there should be no political or constitutional uncertainty in the state at a time when it is fighting coronavirus. “The state is fighting Covid-19 and the government and administration are working round-the-clock. The situation is aggravating day-by-day. At this stage, the uncertainty should be eliminated and the honourable Governor should take a decision at the earliest on our recommendation,” Pawar said in a statement after the cabinet meet.Meanwhile, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Thackeray and Ajit Pawar reportedly had a meeting at the mayor’s bungalow late on Monday evening. State NCP chief Jayant Patil, revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and transport minister Anil Parab were also present at the meeting.The meeting assumes significance in the wake of the current political situation. The leaders are said to have discussed the issue of the CM’s nomination. Thackeray, who is not a member of either house of the state legislature, took oath as the CM on November 28 and as per Article 164 (4) of the Constitution states, could lose the post if he is not elected with six months (May 27). As the polls for the legislative Council, scheduled for April 24, were postponed due to the outbreak, the cabinet had on April 9 recommended the Governor to appoint Thackeray as a member of the legislative Council (MLC) to avoid a constitutional crisis. However, the Governor has not taken a decision so far, leaving the three-party MVA alliance of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress government on tenterhooks.The Shiv Sena has been building pressure on the Governor. Sena leader Sanjay Raut in his weekly column on party mouthpiece Saamana had on Sunday said, “If the Governor decides to sign the nomination file, he can do so instantly. But he would have to ask the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leaders in Delhi.” Thackeray also had said that politics should be kept aside during the ongoing war against Covid-19.

28-04-2020||Mumbai||Every day comes with a new challenge, says DCP enforcing lockdown at Asia’s largest slum||Dharavi has many claims to fame — Asia’s largest slum; once a hub of gangsters; the setting of the Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire; home to an underground hip-hop movement. It’s also one of the Covid-19 hotspots in the city and since April 9, the neighbourhood has been sealed to contain the outbreak. Ensuring the lockdown is observed in this densely-packed slum settlement are officers of Mumbai Police, led by 37-year-old deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Niyati Thaker Dave.The 2.1 square kilometres of Dharavi are home to approximately 8 lakh people from all over the country. An estimated 1.5 lakh are in containment zones, which means they cannot leave their homes and essentials must be delivered to their doorstep. Mumbai Police has 230 men and women at Dharavi police station and another 180 at Shahunagar police station. State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) personnel have stepped in to help as have 100 others from Mumbai Police’s headquarters. “What we’ve learnt is that every day is different with a new task in place,” said Dave. Originally an electronics engineer, Dave gave up her job with Tata Consultancy Services in 2008 and joined the Indian Police Service (IPS) in 2010. Dharavi has been in her jurisdiction since July 2019.When the Covid-19 outbreak reached the slum, Dave knew it would be a massive challenge. “It was very difficult asking people to stay inside in a place like Dharavi where people cannot walk without getting touched. We tried to enforce the law, but people were not ready to listen,” said Dave.She realised her strategies had to be adapted to the ground reality of the slum, which is organised like a labyrinth. “The number of by lanes within the area is huge and it was not possible to track each one,” said Dave. She turned to community leaders and started making announcements in Hindi and Marathi. “We contacted [local] associations, like those [for communities from] Tamil, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Christian and Muslim associations and leaders, as well as social workers,” she said. Dave organised teams of volunteers in each chawl and building in Dharavi. These volunteers accompanied police personnel, informed locals of the do’s and don’ts, and requested people to stay home.The police also had to ensure access to food, oversee sanitisation and set up schedules for when locals doctors could visit people in need of medical assistance. “For the first time we were doing a job that was very different from our mandate,” said Dave.Dave arranged for 20 t0 25 community kitchens to be set up inside Dharavi. “We had to ensure people are not hungry and get at least two meals a day. We roped in NGOs and started distributing food,” she said. “Instead of 1,000 people gathering to collect food packets, we asked volunteers in each area to deliver food to people’s doorsteps,” said Dave, adding that most of those queuing for food were unemployed migrant workers.With additional commissioner of police (central region) Veeresh Prabhu, Dave talked to civic officials to ensure toilets in Dharavi were sanitised properly. “Dharavi has 180 public toilets and 4,000 makeshift toilet booths. This was a major challenge and the need of the hour was for these toilets to be sanitised and disinfected on a daily basis. With the help of civic authorities, we managed to get it done,” said Prabhu.Dave’s working hours have become longer during the outbreak. There are times when she returns home at 1am only to head out for work at 7am. It’s hard for Dave’s family, particularly her seven-year-old daughter. “There are times when she tries to stop me from going to work,” said Dave. “It’s a tough task to convince her how my job is different from those of other parents.”Mumbai Police believes Dave’s strategies are working in Dharavi. Last Monday, Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh carried out a flag march in the area. “The march was to encourage policemen on duty who are doing a brilliant job serving the masses. I was happy to see the people supported the police by staying home,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/every-day-comes-with-a-new-challenge-says-dcp-enforcing-lockdown-at-asia-s-largest-slum/story-lcPnxuhetRkeVzA7KXnlAI.html
28-04-2020||Chandigarh||In 40 days, Covid cases in Haryana cross 300 mark||It took just about 40 days for Haryana to cross the 300 mark as the state registered five new Covid-19 cases on Monday.It was on March 16 that state’s first positive case was reported from Gurugram. With the state government launching a search for Tablighi Jamaat attendees and their contacts from March 31, a spurt in new cases was seen, which reached 96 by April 6. The next day, the count swelled to 119 and by April 10, it was 162. By April 16, the tally had crossed the 200 mark. The next 100 cases surfaced within next 11 days only. Among the five new cases reported on Monday, one is from Jhajjar, the district which had so far managed to keep itself virus-free, but now lost its ‘green zone’ tag. The remaining infections were reported from Sonepat (2), Ambala (1) and Faridabad (1). Notably, though state health bulletin mentioned only one case from Jhajjar, the local administration confirmed five cases.Jhajjar civil surgeon Dr Randeep Punia said among those infected are a pharmacist from Bahadurgarh, a vegetable seller and three family members of an infected Delhi constable, who hails from Saloda village in the district. Jhajjar DC Jitender Kumar said all of them have a Delhi connection.In Sonepat, whose tally is now 22, civil surgeon Dr BK Rajoura said, one of the patients is a man from Khubdu village who had come in contact with an infected Haryana policeman of the same village, while the other is a Haryana cop, a resident of Nuh, who was posted at Kakroi checkpost. Ambala CMO Dr Kuldeep Singh said, “A 63-year-old woman from Ratangarh area has been tested positive for the disease. She is diabetic and has been suffering from some kidney-related ailment for last three years for which she undergoes dialysis twice a week. She is admitted to GMCH-32 in Chandigarh.” Ambala has so far recorded 14 Covid patients, of whom three are undergoing treatment at Chandigarh, while one died earlier this month. VIJ FOR SEALING BORDERS WITH DELHIHealth minister Anil Vij said the state government, which had sealed its Sonepat district borders with Delhi, was seriously contemplating to seal the Jhajjar, Gurugram and Faridabad borders with the national capital as well. “It is clear from the Covid-19 cases reported from Sonepat and now Jhajjar that all these patients have a Delhi connection. They were either themselves working or frequenting Delhi or were in contact with Delhi residents,” Vij said. Referring to virus spread in Haryana, he said, “The Delhi administration should itself have immediately quarantined the Tablighis and stopped them from going to other states.”RECOVERY RATE OVER 70%Though there have been 301 positive cases in Haryana, the number of active patients is 85 and the recovery rate is 71%. Till date, as many as 213 patients have been cured. On Monday, 14 persons walked out of hospitals, including eight from Faridabad, five from Nuh and one from Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-40-days-covid-cases-in-haryana-cross-300-mark/story-jbyfu8bpa0nFneKYFWuTcO.html
28-04-2020||Mumbai||Nursing homes to face action for remaining shut||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will issue license suspension notices to 428 nursing homes that remained shut despite repeated warnings and advisories from authorities to keep clinics open to treat non-Covid-19 patients. In a statement issued on Monday, BMC said it will issue notices to around 25% of the total 1,496 nursing homes in the city asking them why the nursing homes should not lose their licenses. Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had last week directed the public health department to issue advisories and guidelines to reopen nursing homes and private clinics. BMC said nursing homes, polyclinics and dispensaries, which are reported to be shut despite the warning, will face action.Last week, BMC had also warned housing societies to not object to reopening of private clinics in their premises and had also requested private clinics to practise tele-medicine facility, if possible. Thousands of citizens are not getting medical aid and treatment for non-Covid-19 ailments as many private clinics, nursing homes have shut shop. With 369 more people testing positive cases on Monday, the total count of cases in the city is now at 5,776. The death toll has also increased to 219 with 15 more people dying of Covid-19 on Monday, according to the state health department.To tackle the rising number of cases, BMC has decided to set up additional 500 beds for quarantine and isolation facilities in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) at MMRDA grounds. Pardeshi confirmed the development. The civic body has also set up a 1,200-bedded quarantine facility at Nesco exhibition centre, Goregaon (East). Of the 1,200 beds, around 1,000 beds will have oxygen support attached to the beds.The civic body also appealed to those recovering to opt for plasma donation for curing those who have tested positive of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nursing-homes-to-face-action-for-remaining-shut/story-FqhzyR0UIeqt9ceDtnlDWL.html

The panel has not given specific dates, but adds that schools must be the last to open. The committee that former state chief secretary KR Lakhanpal headed has also recommended that the state government has to bite the bullet to cut expenditure by considering the freezing of Dearness Allowance (DA) and wages for the current year. While recommending this, the panel said that this will bring pay parity with Haryana and the Centre as Punjab employees drew 25% more pay. The report also recommends that liquor vends should start immediately to check loss of revenue, adding that it was even being sold illegally during curfew. The Centre, however, has disallowed all states from doing so; even a specific request from Punjab was turned down. “The state will have to redraw its budget in view of covid-19 and give more relaxation to industry to kick-start the economy, while ensuring more testing and upgrade of health infrastructure,” the report notes, adding that the lockdown exit strategy be divided into health and non-health related objectives. Expressing fear that Punjab’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) may contract for the first time in 40 years, the panel recommends that the arrears of GST, VAT may be cleared and also allay the fear of FIRs being registered against industrialists. Another recommendation is that Public Distribution System (PDS) may be made universal and extended to non-ration card holders, initially for a period of six months. Migrants must be included as beneficiaries, the panel adds. The panel adds that the state must conduct, on priority, current semester/year exams for final year (graduation/post-graduation) students to help them explore educational/ job opportunities in July/August, 2020. It adds that the results of Classes 5, 8 may be declared based on examinations already conducted and students be promoted in next class. The Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) may allow schools to declare the results of Class 10 based on the pre-board exams.OTHER MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS•To facilitate construction activity, entire supply line such as stores/shops supplying hardware, paint, cement, electrical goods, wood, glass, iron & steel, cement etc. should be allowed to operate.•Ensure social net benefits, including old age pension are delivered to eligible persons at doorstep. •Public Distribution System (PDS) may be made universal and extended to non-ration card holders, initially for a period of six months. Migrants must be included as beneficiaries•The PSEB may consider holding examination of remaining subjects by creating additional centres to ensure social distancing•To ensure delivery of books, printing presses need to be allowed to be opened as a special case||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/open-industry-agriculture-in-first-go-freeze-da-punjab-panel-on-lockdown-exit/story-X1kCP6evSNBIwAFUUmKCmI.html
28-04-2020||Chandigarh||High mortality rate of 5.7% continues to hound Punjab||With seven deaths over the past 15 days taking the number of casualties due to covid-19 to 19 in Punjab on Monday, the high mortality (death) rate continues to hound the state. Of 330 patients, the death of 19 means a mortality rate of 5.7%. The national mortality date is 3.1% (886 deaths of 28,380 cases).These figures put Punjab among the category of states having the highest mortality rate in the country. The number of tests the state has conducted to date is 15,516. On April 15, HT had highlighted that the mortality rate (then nearly 7%) was double the national average at the time. The figures change daily. Even as the state is blaming testing hurdles during the initial days of the pandemic for the higher rate, neighbouring Haryana, where the testing has followed a similar trajectory, has a much lower mortality rate of 1%, with three deaths of 301 cases. It has conducted 22,993 tests to date.If states test aggressively, chances are high that the infection could be controlled as a large proportion of the cases are found in asymptomatic persons,experts say, adding that the isolation of such patients could stop the ‘silent spreading’ of the disease.Last week, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had ordered a detailed audit of each covid death by experts to understand and check the high mortality rate. The UT of Jammu and Kashmir, which has 546 cases, has recorded seven deaths to give a mortality rate of 1.2%. The state has done 14,988 tests.“The high death rate is a cause of concern. Delhi, with a lower population than Punjab, has more number of deaths, but its mortality rate is lower, as their testing is far higher. In Punjab, our testing, because of few impediments at the start, has got a major push only two or three days ago. Our mortality rate has decreased since,” said Dr KK Talwar, former director PGIMR Chandigarh, who is heading Punjab’s group of experts tackling the covid-19 crisis. The group comprises Dr Raj Bahadur, vice-chancellor, Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot; Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head, school of public health, PGI, and experts from PGI and John Hopkins University, US.Dr Talwar also listed the large number of foreign visitors including NRIs, visiting Punjab just ahead of the lockdown as another factor contributing to the high mortality rate. “I am not saying anything against the arrival of such persons, as they are part of us. Nobody, however, knows what sort of viral load these travellers were carrying when they visited Punjab. There is no data available to map the viral load of this virus,” Dr Talwar said, adding that the presence of co-morbid diseases among those who died and their late detection was also relevant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/high-mortality-rate-of-5-7-continues-to-hound-punjab/story-HZo59BodamDjz97QZW59IP.html

28-04-2020||City||Tarn Taran loses green tag with 6 cases as Punjab tally up by 9||One of the three districts in Punjab with zero Covid-19 cases, Tarn Taran lost the green tag with six positive patients, five of them pilgrims who had returned from Hazur Sahib in Maharashtra’s Nanded. Now, out of 22 districts in Punjab, Bathinda and Failka are the only ones with zero coronavirus case.With nine new cases and one death, Punjab’s tally of positive cases on Monday reached 331. Eight of nine cases belong to Sikh pilgrims who were stranded in Nanded of Hazoor Sahib in Maharashtra after the lockdown. Three cases were reproted from Kapurthala.The state recorded 19th death linked to the virus in a 63-year-old woman who died at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Patiala on Monday. The woman, a resident of Rajpura, had tested positive on April 16, following which she was admitted to the intensive care unit of GMCH. She was the first Covid-19 case reported from Rajpura, which is now a hotspot with 42 positive cases.The five pilgrims are from Sursingh village that falls under the Bhikhiwind sub-division. They had returned from Hazur Sahib about a week ago. The sixth patient is a woman, nearly 30, of Basarke village who recently delivered a baby at the village’s government hospital. “The tests were done on Saturday and the report came on Monday,” said deputy commissioner (DC) Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal. The patients from Sursingh village are in the age group of 45 to 65. The DC said the woman had gone to her maternal home in Lohka village soon after delivering the baby. “Lohka village is also being sealed and the woman and her newborn are being shifted to Tarn Taran civil hospital’s isolation ward.”According to the people of Sursingh village, the five are among 80 people who had returned from Hazur Sahib in parts in the last ten days. “A group of 80 people from our village had gone on the pilgrimage in the first week of March in a truck. First, they had attended a Hola Mohalla (a Sikh religious fair in Anandpur Sahib). After this, the group went to Patna Sahib in Bihar before visiting to Hazur Sahib,” said Lakhwinder Singh, former sarpanch, of the village. The five men who tested positive had returned in a private car around a week ago, he said.However, the district administration has said it was a matter of investigation to know that when the five men had returned. The DC said they have home-quarantined the immediate contacts of those tested positive. Those who had gone to Hazur Sahib have also been home-quarantined in Sursingh village.

28-04-2020||Mumbai||How Dharavi started to report cases||At a time when even medical staff faces stigma, how has the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) managed to report cases from Dharavi, one of the country’s biggest slums where fear was a major factor, showing that it was one of the hotspots in the city?The team of private doctors and BMC officials, who are doing the rounds of ground zero daily, say getting slum residents to share information or symptoms with the authorities has not been easy. Dharavi residents started to report symptoms only after the first lot of quarantined patients were discharged. In the past 10 days, the slum sprawl, which is home to around an estimated six lakh citizens, has recorded more than 150 positive cases. A senior BMC official, who is part of the team of 24 private doctors, and around 10 to 15 civic officials told HT that getting accurate information was among the most challenging task in managing the outbreak, as residents didn’t want to divulge the truth fearing stigma. Since April 9, the BMC has screened nearly 50,000 citizens so far; 275 people have tested positive, 14 have died and 10 patients from the slum have been discharged so far after their cure. Tejaswi Kakade, 27, a medical officer with the BMC’s G/North Ward under which Dharavi falls, said, “We have been tracing high-risk contacts of those testing positive. We met with a lot of reluctance initially, but later trust was built between us and the residents. There was lack of awareness among citizens, but with the issue being highlighted everywhere, citizens now call us and inform us that they have developed symptoms.”Kakade the joined BMC on March 9, just as the first case of coronavirus was reported in the state. Barely a week after she joined, the outbreak was evident in the city and she was assigned on the team. “It is difficult for us to go out in the heat wearing the personal protective equipment (PPE), ensuring we take enough precautions. It was also difficult to convince my mother. She is worried all the time, but my father is supporting me to screen more and more people. We are also planning to shift out of our house, and stay in separate accommodation provided by the BMC, considering we cannot risk the lives of our family members, even if there is a minimal chance of transmission.”Another medical officer Nazish Shaikh, 33, who is involved in screening of residents in Dharavi, said, “It is not easy to screen those residing in narrow lanes, while maintaining social distance. We had to seek help of locals as Dharavi is a maze, and there are chances of us getting lost. There are certain pockets where residents can speak only their mother tongue. We had to rope in someone who could translate for us.”The BMC is now relying on around 350 private clinics opened in the area for the people to report the symptoms themselves. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “We are going to keep around 350 private clinics open, where citizens will definitely come with their illness, and from there, we have developed a mechanism to trace positive patients.”Dr Anil Pachnekar of Dharavi-Mahim Medical Practitioners said, “It is very difficult to go door to door in this heat wearing PPE, and hence all private clinics now will be opened up. If we come across any suspects, they will be referred to the BMC for testing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-dharavi-started-to-report-cases/story-P5iBer33VR6G0J96kubbKO.html
28-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid-19 case tally likely to touch 10,000 by Apr 30||Maharashtra on Monday reported 522 fresh coronavirus cases, taking the tally to 8,590. With the state seeing an average of 500 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily since April 19, the bleak 10,000 mark is likely to breached by Thursday (April 30).According to official figures, the state has recorded 4,946 cases in the past nine days. Maharashtra took 30 days to cross 1,000 cases, after the first patient was reported on March 9. Since then, it has been a steady increase in numbers, said officials. The trends also showed that Monday was the 24th consecutive day the number of new cases has been in three digits, which is why 8,292 cases have been registered in April alone.On Monday, the state has also completed 35 days of lockdown that began from the midnight of March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was partially lifted on April 20 in areas where there were no cases or were minimal in number. In Mumbai, the case count has gone up to 5,776 as 369 new cases were reported.However, officials said that the situation is still under control as most of the new cases are from traced contacts. “We can say that the situation is under control as we are aggressively doing contact tracing and most of the new cases are those who have been traced, following detection of Covid 19 cases,” said Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). ”It is true that we were expecting a decline in cases from April 21, which is not happening, but the rise is also not exponential and now we will have to wait for another incubation cycle of 14 days, which is ending on May 3, before reaching to any conclusion, Dr Lahane said. Two 14-day incubation cycles were completed on April 20, after March 22, when international traffic was stopped. Meanwhile, the health department has conducted 1,21,562 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 1,12,552 people tested negative. The death toll of the state also went up to 369 cases as 27 fatalities were registered on Monday. Of them, 15 are in Mumbai, six in Amravati, four in Pune and one each in Jalgaon and Aurangabad. With this, Mumbai’s toll also increased to 219.Of the 27 deaths, 22 patients had co-morbidities. Of them, one was affected with HIV and another was suffering with cancer, said health officials.The mortality rate of the state has significantly dropped to 4.24% (342 deaths till Sunday) from 7.41% (148 cases) on April 13. However, it continued to be higher than the national mortality rate of 3.13% till Sunday, stated the data of the state medical education department.As the cases are rising, the number of cases recovered so far also jumped to 1,282 as 94 patients recovered on Monday.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state is prepared for any situation. “We have set up 1,677 Covid-19 dedicated hospitals, where 1,76,357 isolation beds and 7248 ICU beds are available. These hospitals are divided into three categories — between asymptomatic, mild and serious cases. We also have around 3,000 ventilators, around 80,000 personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and 2.82 lakh N95 mask,” he said.The state currently has 572 active containment zones. Around 7,861 survey teams, comprising doctors and assisting staff, have screened more than 32.28 lakh people. It has also kept 9,399 suspected patients at government quarantine facilities, while 1,45,677 are home quarantined, stated health officials.Meanwhile, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Monday appointed four IAS officers — Anil Kawade, cooperation commissioner; Saurabh Rao, sugar commissioner; Sachindra Pratap Singh, animal husbandry commissioner and Kaustubh Diwegaonkar, director, Ground Water Survey and Development Agency (GSDA), who will help in planning preventive measures and their implementation to arrest the spread of coronavirus cases in Pune, where 1,027 cases has been registered so far.The state government has also allocated Rs1,275.25 crore to distribute among poor, weak, deprived, widow and handicapped sections of society, who are beneficiaries under many government welfare schemes. The beneficiaries will get an advance pay of three months, considering lockdown restrictions, which led to loss of income. Of them, Rs130 crore has been received from the Centre while the rest of the amount will be paid from the state exchequer, said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-case-tally-likely-to-touch-10-000-by-apr-30/story-BiWTWoXifPQX5x8KtGWfAK.html
28-04-2020||Lucknow||BJP MLA wants back money he donated from his MLA fund||Days after the Uttar Pradesh unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party served notice to its lawmaker for mocking Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to people to clap for corona warriors, another BJP lawmaker embarrassed his party by asking that the money he donated from his MLA fund to assist in fight corona be returned. Shyam Prakash, MLA from Hardoi’s Gopamau (reserved) assembly segment, had sanctioned ₹25 lakh from his local area development fund to buy equipments and other things to aid the fight against novel coronavirus that has forced the country into an unprecedented lockdown. He has now sought a refund alleging corruption in purchases made by health department in Hardoi. This is the first time any MLA has forwarded such a request. The Yogi Adityanath government in UP has decided to freeze the local area development fund of MLAs for a year. In his missive to chief development officer (CDO), Hardoi, the BJP lawmaker said officials haven’t cared to tell him about how his MLA fund amount had been used. Additionally, he said, he had come to know through media reports that there had been corruption in purchase of health equipment in Hardoi and claimed he had come to know that commission and corruption were taking place even in use of MLA fund. “Yes, . Since I haven’t got a response to how my fund was being used, I havI have written a letter to the CDO. As a public representative it’s my duty to ensure that the money I have cleared for use in the fight against coronavirus is used for the purpose intendede asked that the amount be diverted back to the fund so it can be put to better use,” the lawmaker said. Calls made to the health department authorities in Hardoi and Lucknow didn’t evoke any response. The development came days after the ruling BJP served a show-cause notice on its lawmaker from Sitapur (sadar) Rakesh Rathore over a viral audio in which the MLA in a telephonic conversation with another party leader was heard making fun of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to clap for frontline corona warriors. “Now, it’s the BJP lawmakers themselves who are increasingly speaking out on one issue or the other. What could be more embarrassing for a government,” asked Samajwadi Party leader IP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bjp-mla-wants-back-money-he-donated-from-his-mla-fund/story-rsLfAI6ecrFpCW9nFYLKAJ.html

28-04-2020||Mumbai||Three police personnel on duty in Dharavi test positive for Covid-19||A police inspector and two constables posted at Dharavi police station tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), with the help of local police, has begun contact tracing of the three policemen.According to Dharavi police, all three had shown Covid-19 symptoms like fever and body pain and were subjected to medical tests.

28-04-2020||Gurugram||Several ₹50, ₹100 & ₹500 notes found on Pataudi road||A resident found several ₹50, ₹100 and ₹500 notes on a road in Balewa village, Pataudi, on Sunday night. A crowd gathered around the money but no one touched the notes due to the fear of contracting coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The notes were collected only when the police arrived after the village sarpanch approached them. Darshan Kumar, the village sarpanch, said, “Around 9pm, a resident called and informed me about the notes. A security guard and I immediately reached the spot and I instructed him to stay there to keep an eye on the money. I then went around interrogating whether someone had lost their money but could not find anyone. When I returned to the spot, there was a crowd of around 25 to 30 people gathered around the money.” He added that none of them touched the notes as they feared contracting Covid-19. According to the police, they received the information regarding the incident around 10.30pm and a team of officials went to the spot and dispersed the crowd. Suresh Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Pataudi police station, said, “When we did not find anyone to claim the cash, we decided to collect the notes and take them away. The village residents did not touch them as they feared getting Covid-19.”The village sarpanch had clicked a picture of the abandoned notes and uploaded it on his instant messaging application. “On Monday morning, the relative of a village resident contacted me and told me that the cash belonged to him,” he added.Vishnu, a resident of Bhagwanpur village, said that he had come to Balewa village to check on the sick mother of his relative. “My relative had asked me to visit as his mother was very ill. While I was returning home on my scooter after the visit, I accidentally dropped the cash (around ₹4,500). It was only when I reached home that I realised that the pocket of my pants was empty. I did try to find the money but could not,” he added. Vishnu said that he approached the sarpanch when he saw the image of the money that he had uploaded earlier.“On Monday, we went to the police station together and asked the officials to return the money. However, they said that I will get it through the court after the lockdown,” Vishnu said. Researchers and doctors have indicated that Covid-19 could be transmitted through contact with dry surfaces. However, no study has shown that the virus can spread through currency notes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/several-50-100-500-notes-found-on-pataudi-road/story-Bov2s9PzskRnhB9iZLqmJL.html
28-04-2020||Delhi||10 speed challans issued every minute during lockdown, essential service providers fined multiple times||Around 10 vehicles, on an average, were fined every minute for speeding in the national capital during the nationwide lockdown that was put in place by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to contain the spread of Covid-19. The prime offenders — essential service providers, some of who were fined multiple times in a day. According to Delhi Police data, many of these challans were issued to repeat offenders — some getting prosecuted multiple times in a period of days with a few even getting fined multiple times in one day. A doctor, for example, was caught speeding seven times between March 14 and 30 and has to pay a penalty of Rs 14,000. The fine for speeding is Rs 2,000.The data collected is for the period between March 23 and April 26.A large number of motorists who were fined are essential service providers, many of whom had not taken well to their unforgiven challans. “Obviously, I broke the speed limit in my rush to attend to my workplace...can I get some relief from these fine,” one such healthcare provider asked the Delhi Traffic Police on Twitter.Unsatisfied with the police’s response, which asked him to visit the traffic headquarters after the lockdown, the man vowed not to attend duty anymore till the lockdown was lifted. “Can’t risk another challan as it is a sizeable amount of my salary,” he wrote back.The man, like many other violators, is, however, unlikely to get any relief, HT has learnt. Taj Hassan, special commissioner of police (Delhi Traffic Police), said that the law doesn’t allow any exemptions. “No one will be exempted. The speed trap cameras do not distinguish. The speeding challan is a habit reforming fine and motorists should follow the rules,” said Hassan.On Twitter, a lot of essential service providers expressed anguish over being challaned multiple times, some within a short span of time. One man posted a medical slip to say that he was obliging a police team by rushing an unwell person to a hospital. He was caught speeding twice within a period of 24 minutes in north Delhi .Yet another doctor took to Twitter to tell the police that while he was risking his life by reporting to work and the police was thanking him in the form of challans. A woman healthcare professional travelling from Delhi to Gurgaon invoked her work to protest against the multiple challans. “...my only commitment is to reach the hospital as soon as possible,” she wrote.But Piyush Tewari, founder of NGO SaveLife Foundation which works towards preventing road accidents, said that “providers serving Covid-19 issues can’t claim allegiance towards one health issue while ignoring another grave one”.“More than 115 lives have been lost due to road accidents across India even during the lockdown. Around 10% of these accident cases were reported from Delhi . This goes to show how dangerous our roads are even when there is minimal traffic...Traffic rules have to be followed, no matter what, to keep each other safe. Only emergency medical response vehicles, rushing to immediate life-threatening situations, can be given some relaxations,” said Tewari. Taj Hassan, meanwhile, maintained that getting captured for speeding by multiple cameras in a day will mean multiple challans. “Some people drive fast as a matter of habit. They’ll get captured several times along their route and they’ll have to pay fines for each of those offences,” he said. Special commissioner Hassan said that In 35 days of the lockdown, these cameras have noticed a total of 5,07,563 speed violations. That roughly translates to 14,500 violations every day. In the 10 days before the lockdown, there were 5,11,577 such speed violations, translating to about 51,157 such offences every day, at a rate of 35 fines a minute, on an average. “There are no jams on the roads. Some motorists are using the empty roads to speed,” said Hassan.Most of these speed detection cameras were installed only last year because of which there is a massive difference in the number of cases of speeding when compared to earlier years, said Hassan. In 2019, for example, there were just about 386 challans for speeding daily, on an average. All those violators were caught by cameras installed in interceptor vehicles, which are manually manned by traffic police personnel. The speed cameras, on the other hand, are automatic and can detect violations even in the dark. There are 236 speed-cameras that have been installed in various parts of the city.The officer added that despite roads being empty, fatal accidents continue to occur in the city. “There have been 13 fatal accidents during the lockdown. Speeding is a major reason for that,” said Hassan.The 13 dead people include an MCD hospital doctor, who run over by a car in Malviya Nagar while he was cycling back home from work earlier this month. Last year, there were about four fatal accidents every day on an average.The speed violations were caught by cameras installed at 100 points and 34 junctions. “Each junction has a total of four cameras, there are a total of 236 speed-detection cameras doing our job,” said Hassan.Since many motorists choose to slow down when nearing a camera and speed up immediately after, the traffic police have also decided to deploy manual cameras at certain places. But these manual cameras are able to detect only a limited number of violations and data on offenders prosecuted with their help was not immediately available with the traffic police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/10-speed-challans-issued-every-minute-during-lockdown-essential-service-providers-fined-multiple-times/story-rB0XGhNngkn3Dydo5VytzO.html
28-04-2020||Delhi||AIIMS begins plasma therapy, 200 Tablighi members begin donation||After Lok Nayak hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is set to begin plasma therapy for those with severe Covid-19 infections. The collection of plasma from over 350 eligible members of the Tablighi Jamaat started on Monday at the Covid Care Centres in Sultanpuri and Narela. Twenty-five donations have already been received. Convalescent plasma therapy uses a blood component called plasma—which contains virus-fighting antibodies—from people who have recovered from the infection to treat those who are severely ill with Covid-19.“We have collected plasma from a couple of donors already and now we are looking for a suitable recipient for the therapy—someone who is admitted to the intensive care unit, yet can tolerate the therapy,” Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of AIIMS, said.The therapy is usually administered to those with a respiratory rate higher than 30 (normal is 20), with an oxygen saturation of less than 90% (normal is 95% to 100%), or to those who have pus in their lungs.Patients suspected to have Covid-19 are being admitted to the new private ward in the hospital, those with mild symptoms are being moved to AIIMS Jhajjar and those with severe symptoms to the AIIMS trauma centre. “The plasma can be collected at any of the three places, but will be administered only at the trauma centre where the really ill patients are admitted,” Sharma said.In the absence of a vaccine or drug, hospitals are looking at plasma therapy for the treatment of critical Covid-19 patients. So far, at least six people have received the therapy via these trials at Lok Nayak hospital. The government currently has limited approval to conduct a randomised control trial of the therapy upon 20 critical patients, half of whom will receive antibody-rich plasma and the other half a placebo (which is devoid of any therapeutic value). This will help test whether the plasma actually helps heal those with Covid-19.“Delhi needs to have a bank of around 200 Covid-19 plasma donations; we cannot wait for a donation when a sick person comes to the hospital. Anybody who has recovered from the infection—meaning two consecutive samples have tested negative—and has completed two more weeks of quarantine can donate plasma.

The permission to resume operations was granted following a notification issued by the ministry of home affairs (MHA), relaxing lockdown regulations for industries. More than 300 industries in the district that received permission to resume operations last week haven’t been able to start production yet. Suman Chawla, an industry owner, said, “We are allowed to work with 25% workers. Some of our senior employees reside in Delhi, Faridabad and Noida. They are unable to reach office. We are into leather business and mainly export to foreign countries. Although we got permission to resume work on April 22, our company has not been able to start production as there are no raw materials, few available workers and senior staff members, and disruptions in the supply chain. Our last production day was March 21. Our losses are in crores. I believe that it may take several months for our production to get normal,” said Chawla.Due to continued labour problems, a looming fear of Covid-19 transmission and MHA’s strict guidelines, some of the industry owners are mulling to shut their plants again indefinitely.Kusum Danglay, another industry owner in packaging production at Manesar, said, “We are unable to run the plant in such a difficult condition. Workers are eager to leave the city for their respective states and we cannot retain them in the current scenario. With only a handful of workers available, we are just cleaning our tools and machines, disinfecting the plant, carrying out thermal screening etc. And we believe that such a critical situation will last for many months. We may have to shut our plant after May 3 if the situation does not improve.”An industry owner in Sector 37 said that nuts and bolts and other parts to repair machines are also not available because hardware shops and auto markets are shut.“I am in the packaging business and have a small plant. We have been allowed to resume operations with 10 workers, of which three are engaged in implementing the standard operating procedure (SOP), like disinfecting the plant, manning entry gates etc. I have not been able to carry out any production at all since April 22,” said Rakesh Vohra, an industry owner, adding that he is unable to pay wages to his workers.Maruti Suzuki India Limited had also said last week that they would only carry out maintenance in their Manesar plant while the production was still on hold. “Maruti Suzuki India Limited got permission a week ago but production has not yet started,” said a senior executive of the company.Many industries, which are still shut, are unwilling to even apply for permission.Sanjiv Bansal, a Basai-based industry owner, said, “I will start operations only when the situation becomes normal, workers are willing to rejoin work, markets are open and the supply chain is restored. I cannot take risk when Gurugram has still Covid-19 cases coming up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/disrupted-supply-chain-labour-shortage-major-challenges-for-industries/story-vLYjCoRE92pLgtr9zpHtUM.html
28-04-2020||Gurugram||Hunger hotspots not targeted, ration tokens immediate need: Gurugram civil society group||The Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch (GNEM), a civil society group involved in food distribution across the city, has released a report stating that the administration has not addressed the hunger crisis in the district adequately and relief measures were yet to reach most people, especially in industrial pockets.The report, ‘Taking Stock: Assessing Distribution and Distress in Gurugram during the COVID-19 Lockdown’, released on Sunday, stated that while coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hotspots had been meticulously mapped by the administration, hunger hotspots were not specifically and systematically targeted by the administration for food relief. “The administration’s focus on mapping and intervening in coronavirus hotspots through the establishment of containment zones and enhanced screening is duly announced and reported on a regular basis. However, hunger hotspots that emerged clearly in our data, especially in clusters around industrial pockets like Dundahera, Sarhaul, Manesar, Dharuhera, Khandsa, and Naharpur, do not find mention in any official announcement,” stated the report.The report said that hunger had not abated despite the collaborative efforts of multiple civil society organisations since the government’s response was slow. Based on data analysis of the group’s operations, the report said that there was a substantial gap between demand and supply. The group had served close to 4 lakh cooked meals since the first week of April but had only managed to meet 74% of the demand. “Even with nearly 10,100 ration kits delivered until April 21, which provided food security for 40,400 people, the GNEM has only been able to cater to 68% of those in need,” stated the report.It also mentioned that food-related distress had peaked in the second phase of the lockdown. The number of daily calls received by the group multiplied exponentially from eight calls a day to 60 in the second phase of the lockdown, the report stated. The extension created panic among people with no income, negligible savings, and rising debt, as per the group’s assessment. The report also said that while distress ration coupons had been announced, the process of coupon distribution remained “unclear and entirely opaque”. The report has recommended that ration coupon distribution be made public to increase transparency, cash relief of ₹1,000 be reopened for daily wagers, and a single helpline and grievance portal be put in place.VS Kundu, additional chief secretary, said that the number of people requiring food was gradually expanding since many families who were able to sustain themselves in the first phase were running out of resources. “We are aware that hunger distress is escalating since the lockdown has been extended. The number of people requiring food is increasing since people who earlier had resources are gradually running out of resources and savings,” Kundu said. He added that the report prepared by the group had been shared with him and he had passed it to the officers in charge.He also said that the administration was carrying out household surveys to assess the requirements of those in need following which people without ration cards would be provided with food tokens which would allow them to receive ration for three months, including April. “It has taken a couple of extra days for the survey but we are aiming to provide ration by this week,” Kundu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hunger-hotspots-not-targeted-ration-tokens-immediate-need-gnem/story-xo2NzQexiGzH6n14OIhweO.html
28-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi converts OTs to ICUs, plans to get 500 ventilators as Covid-19 cases rise||To increase the capacity to treat critical Covid-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU), the Delhi government is looking to buy around 500 ventilators for its hospitals. Currently, the city has 1,106 ventilators—306 in government hospitals and 800 in private ones—according to a report by the five-member committee advising chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Covid-19.“We are looking at different ventilator manufacturers—including Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL)—to procure around 500 ventilators,” a senior official from Delhi’s health department said. Currently, the specifications and the make of the ventilators offered by various manufacturers are being examined by Lok Nayak Hospital before an order is placed. It is the biggest Covid-19 hospital in the city, managing 165 patients with severe symptoms. A ventilator augments the breathing function of a person whose lungs are compromised, a condition common to Covid-19 patients as the disease moves into a serious stage. Delhi has already reached the first of three scenarios that the five-member panel had advised to prepare for—100 cases being reported a day. The number of cases spiked on Sunday, with 293 people testing positive.Now, in preparation for the second scenario—500 cases being reported in a day—the two dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in Delhi are looking at converting their operation theatres into intensive care units (ICUs) and adding oxygen support to all the beds. This is one of the measures suggested by the five-member panel.“We have to operationalise 125 intensive care unit beds. And—as the committee rightly recommended—the operation theatres that already have gas pipelines in place are the easiest to convert into ICUs. Each of our OTs will have two beds. The post-op area of the surgical block will also be used,” a doctor from Lok Nayak Hospital said on condition of anonymity. The hospital has 18 operation theatres, some of which are likely to be reserved for surgeries on Covid-19 patients. The hospital currently has 64 ICU beds.The other 1,500 beds in the hospital will all have the facility to provide oxygen support to patients. “The casualty wards, new medical block, some parts of the gynaecology block and paediatric block, as well as the OT block already have gas pipelines, so oxygen therapy will not be a problem. For areas such as the orthopaedic block that do not have a gas pipeline, oxygen cylinders will be used,” the doctor said.Of the 1,987 active cases—those who still have the infection—42 are admitted to the ICUs of the nine Covid-19 hospitals and 11 are on ventilator support.“According to the data, there is just a handful of people on ventilators right now. The proportion of people who need ventilation is very little and as the private sector is involved, Delhi currently has enough facilities to handle all its cases. However, just to be prepared, the government is looking at purchasing more ventilators,” another senior official involved in Covid-19 preparations said.Delhi is preparing for the worst-case scenario of having to deal with 30,000 active cases at one time.“Assuming that for every 1,000 cases, 50 need ventilators—and that is a very high estimate—we still have enough ventilators in the city as of now. The infection is here, nobody can stop its spread, but we have to reduce the number of deaths from the infection,” said Dr SK Sarin, chair of the five-member panel and the director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, which is the first in the city to start plasma therapy trials for Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-converts-ots-to-icus-plans-to-get-500-ventilators-as-cases-rise/story-NS0LC674KBu3EPYUxBkLAM.html
28-04-2020||Delhi||HC directs Delhi govt to file detailed report on supply of rations through PDS||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the Delhi government to file a detailed status report on the supply of rations through the public distribution system and other mechanisms, such as e-coupons, in response to a plea filed in this regard.The plea sought effective and time-bound redressal of complaints pertaining to non-supply of rations and the urgent need for transparency in the distribution of foodgrains through the PDS and other mechanisms.Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh sought the report on a plea filed by Rozi Roti Abhiyan Adhikaar, stating that people are not being able to get ration from fair price shops, which have shut due to non-availability of stock.The plea also contended that due to the absence of any information in the public domain on the distribution of rations — in terms of who all have availed of the stipulated quantity — there is no way to determine whether stocks of ration have been provided to the targeted persons or if there has been any diversion.Appearing for the Delhi government, additional standing counsel, Anuj Aggarwal, told the court that the Delhi government has been providing rations to 700,0000 cardholders and 300,0000 others, who do not have a card. He said that the fair price shops are open all days, during the designated time.He also said that 100,0000 people are being given cooked food twice a day at the hunger centres. He submitted that volunteers are also deployed at fair price shops along with a representative of the local MLA.The court asked the Delhi government to ensure that these steps are continued, and sought a detailed status report in this regard.Justice Mridul observed that the distress caused to the residents of the city, by the ongoing lockdown imposed in order to contain the spread of the Covid-19, has been further aggravated by the stated denial of access to food grain to the poor, underprivileged and marginalised sections of the populace, even though the Delhi government is undertaking steps to alleviate their suffering.The court also said that the government shall ensure that all ration shops remain operational and disburse food grains, in accordance with the policy formulated by the Centre and state government. It called for disbursal of the requisite food grains from PDS from 9am to 1pm and 3pm to 7pm on all days of the week.“The Delhi government shall also ensure that food grains are distributed to the poor, needy and marginalised non-PDS residents from the PDS, as well as, other distribution centres stated to be set up by them, for the said purpose. It shall further ensure that the subdivisional magistrates of each district carry out strict and regular monitoring and oversight of the distribution of food grains, as afore directed and upload the details of the shop-wise distribution of ration to both the PDS and non-PDS residents on their official website, at the end of every day,” the order stated.The plea also contended that the state government has failed to put in place a statutory grievance redressal framework, despite repeated orders of the Delhi High Court. The petition also sought the resumption of the midday meal scheme, which is a lifeline for children even under normal circumstance.The court directed the government to immediately post grievance helpline numbers on their official website as well as publicise them through the print and electronic media, to enable members of the public, who may be aggrieved due to a lack of distribution of the food grains, to seek redressal of their grievances, by contacting the nodal officers concerned.The court said that the nodal officers shall address the grievances and mention the steps taken to resolve problems on the website.The next hearing in this matter is scheduled for May 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-directs-delhi-govt-to-file-detailed-report-on-supply-of-rations-through-pds/story-3t3FL86iH0H2g4NcdL8DtM.html

We owe these families not just our gratitude but support in every possible way,” Raghavendra said.The additional seats will be introduced in all disciplines, including engineering, management, law and applied sciences for the academic year commencing 2020-2021. Applicants to the multi-disciplinary university will also be eligible to apply for merit-based fee concessions/scholarships. The university’s faculty and staff had earlier donated their one day’s salary amounting to a total of ₹4.33 lakh to the PM National Relief Fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/university-announces-additional-seats-for-children-of-covid-19-warriors/story-HHYf2UwboWDiOdMMzzo25L.html
28-04-2020||Delhi||One in every 15 Covid-19 cases in Delhi is a healthcare worker||Over the last two weeks, clusters of Covid-19 cases have been reported from hospitals across the city, with the Delhi government-run 100-bed Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial hospital in Jahangirpuri reporting the highest number of cases. So far, at least 65 healthcare workers—including doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, and hospital security staff—have tested positive for the infection in the hospital. So far, at least 226 healthcare workers from 21 hospitals and several clinics across the city have tested positive for the infection. Almost all of these healthcare workers were not posted to the Covid-19 wings of the hospitals or the dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. This accounts for approximately one in 15 of the total number of cases—3,108—reported in Delhi till Monday. Why are so many doctors testing positive? It is because they are the ones still going out and meeting people—some infected—during the lockdown. “During the lockdown, people are not stepping out and meeting others. Healthcare workers, on the other hand, are going out and treating several patients a day, which puts them at risk of getting the infection. Globally, it has been seen that healthcare workers are at the highest risk of getting the infection,” Giridhar R Babu, professor and head of life-course epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), said.HT had earlier reported that hospitals are now becoming hotspots for new infections in Delhi. Thirty-three healthcare workers tested positive for the infection over the last two weeks when the hospitals started actively testing its staff. “Max Healthcare has instituted mandatory Covid-19 testing for over 24,000 members of its staff and all the patients admitted in its hospitals. This will lead to a greater number of Covid-19 patients being identified, isolated and treated. We believe this is the best way to fight the pandemic,” the hospital said in a statement.At least 60 healthcare workers have tested positive for the infection across nine Max healthcare hospitals in Delhi-NCR, Punjab and Uttarakhand. Refusing to give out a break-up of the cases, the hospital said in the statement that 2% of the 3,000 people across these nine hospitals had tested positive. At Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini, at least 29 healthcare workers have tested positive. At least 57 people were quarantined after they came in contact with a 40-year-old woman from Jahangirpuri suspected to have the infection. A week ago, 14 people working in the non-Covid-19 paediatric ICU of Lady Hardinge Medical College had tested positive for the infection. Before that, in the first couple of weeks in April, a cluster of 26 healthcare workers with the infection was found at Delhi State Cancer Institute. Four cancer patients and one of their family members also contracted the infection, with two of the patients succumbing to it. The government’s denial of community transmission is also responsible for the explosion of the cases among non-Covid-19 healthcare workers, according to experts. “This is a fallout of the government’s denial of community transmission. If they had warned healthcare workers that community transmission was happening, they would have treated all their patients as potentially infected and would have been more cautious about infection control measures,” Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology department at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said.He added that the government should have admitted to community transmission and broadcast messages accordingly as soon as cases where the source of infection could not be traced started being reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/one-in-every-15-cases-in-delhi-is-a-healthcare-worker/story-7XNAutTfAz56l6jBPrI3JN.html
28-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram to restrict entry of people with flu-like symptoms from Delhi||Haryana police decided on Monday to step up surveillance on borders with Delhi, after the state’s home and health minister Anil Vij called for the sealing of all entry and exit points it shares with the national capital, where 3,108 cases of Covid-19 have been reported so far. The move comes after Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad districts of Uttar Pradesh sealed their shared borders with the capital last week.Vij said that at least 15 people who tested positive for the coronavirus disease in the state recently had contracted it in Delhi. He said the Haryana government had asked its Delhi counterpart to provide accommodation to Haryana residents who work in the capital so they don’t have to commute, posing the risk of spreading the infection in the state, but is yet to receive a response.Gurugram police said the movement of essential workers into the city will not be stopped for now. The police will check the temperature of every commuter coming from the capital and will not allow their entry if they are found to have flu-like symptoms.The police said they will wait until Wednesday to check if there will be a total suspension of movement across the state borders, which depends on the status of positive cases in the state. The district administration is yet to receive any directive from the government on a ban on the entry of people coming from Delhi.Faridabad police also said that they would allow the movement of only workers engaged in essential services and that requests for movement to Delhi for medical reasons will not be entertained.“At least 15-16 coronavirus cases recently reported in Haryana have links to Delhi. Our chief secretary has interacted with the Delhi government on the issue, asking it to restrict the movement of commuters from Delhi to Haryana’s adjoining districts,” Vij, who is also the health minister, told HT.“We have asked them to limit the passes and arrange staying facility for the essential service providers and employees who are doing daily up-and-down (commutes) from districts adjoining Delhi,” he said. The cases linked to Delhi are in addition to the 120 cases traced to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation inDelhi’s Nizamuddin Basti last month.Haryana has reported 301 cases till now. Gurugram accounts for 51 cases and Faridabad 46 cases.“We have not yet received any response from the Delhi government on the issue till now. But the police deployment has increased at the border and checking will be increased,” Vij said.Mohammad Akil, the commissioner of Gurugram Police, said that the department had deployed 630 personnel at the 11 border points with Delhi. “The personnel have been directed to check each and every vehicle and to ensure no one enters the city casually. If anyone is found to have a fever, they will not be allowed to cross the border, despite having permission,” he said.Around 5,200 police personnel are deployed on Covid-19 duty across the city, in three shifts.Faridabad has sealed the borders with Delhi, after two cases, including that of a 50-year-old chief executive officer of a health institute in Delhi, a resident of Sector 28, were traced to Delhi. Four members of his family have been quarantined and isolated. He reported running a fever last week and has been admitted to the ESI Hospital in Faridabad since, the police said.KK Rao, the commissioner of Faridabad Police, said, “The new cases are of those who had visited Delhi. So, we are taking precautionary measures to ensure that the infection does not spread,” he said.The police said that people will not be allowed to cross the border for medical emergencies. “Those going to Delhi every day can shift there temporarily. They will not be allowed to move in and out of the city every day. Essential service vehicles will be allowed, but only those who have valid permission. All drivers have to necessarily undergo Covid-19 test to ensure they are safe. Their test reports will be checked before allowing them to enter the city,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ggm-to-restrict-entry-of-people-with-flu-like-symptoms-from-delhi/story-LpyIWtFqBIqNsHtWBhQf4L.html

28-04-2020||Noida||Covid-19 lockdown: Man in debt ends life||A 45-year-old man in debt allegedly took his own life on Monday morning by hanging himself from a fan at his house. Even though the police did not recover a note from the spot, they suspected (based on the family’s testimony) that the man’s financial troubles could be the reason as to why he killed himself. The man was from the Badaun district and was employed with a private company in the Phase 2 area. Due to the nationwide lockdown, the company had shut its operations.“According to a family member, he had borrowed money from a few people last year to get his daughter married and was in debt. He had been depressed for a while because of the loan,” Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, station house officer (SHO), Sector 49 police station, said.The police were unclear about the amount of debt. The said he was further troubled because he was unable to pay off the debt due to the lack of work during the lockdown.“The family was at home at the time of the incident on Sunday night. They were asleep. The man was in a different room. When everyone woke up on Monday morning, they found him hanging from a fan, after which they called the police helpline. A team was rushed to the spot. The body was brought down, taken in custody and sent for an autopsy,” the SHO said.The body was handed over to the family after the autopsy. No complaints have been filed in this case so far.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations.

28-04-2020||City||8 health workers among 14 new Covid-19 cases in GB Nagar, suspected patient allowed to leave with infant’s body||Noida: Gautam Budh Nagar on Monday reported 14 new Covid-19 cases, including eight health workers, taking the total number of positive cases to 129 in the district.The new patients included a 23-year-old man from Jaunchana village in Jewar who, despite being a suspect, was allowed to perform last rites of his 4-month-old son who allegedly died of pneumonia. The alleged lapse by the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) led to the sealing of the whole village, while over 1,500 persons were home quarantined on Monday, officials said.Of the eight health workers who tested positive – six are from Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute in Sector 30, and one from the district hospital in Sector 39 who lives in the Nithari area and one from the ESIC Model Hospital in Sector 24. The medical staff include a doctor, a nurse, a plumber and five ward boys.The remaining five patients are -- 30-year-old pregnant woman from Kulsera village, 9-year-old boy from Aichhar village in Greater Noida, 45-year-old man from Pi 1 in Greater Noida, 36-year-old woman from Chotpur area of Sector 63 and a man from Chauda village.“We have shut the emergency and OPD services of the hospital after six of our medical staff have been found positive for Covid-19. Around 26 others have been quarantined. Only the patients who are undergoing treatment are present in the hospital, and the Covid-19 ward will continue functioning,” said Dr DK Gupta, director of the paediatric hospital.The Jaunchana patient had gone to the GIMS on the morning of April 25 after his son allegedly showed pneumonia symptoms. Authorities at GIMS had collected the samples of the child, the man and his wife as the baby was a Covid-19 suspect, the officials said, adding that the baby was ‘brought dead’ at the time of admission. The sample reports of the couple were pending, but they were allowed to leave on ‘humanitarian grounds’ to perform the last rites of the baby on April 26, the officials said. On April 27, the man was informed that he was found positive for Covid-19, while his wife is negative. The officials also said that the baby’s test reports was negative for Covid-19 and the cause of death is unknown as no postmortem took place as per the wishes of the parents. Over 50 persons attended the funeral of the baby, they said, adding that samples of many people who had come in contact with the couple were collected for testing.However, the child’s father, who has tested positive, said that on April 26, he was told that he and his wife were negative and allowed to leave with the body. “We were told that the baby was dead. Officials took samples of three of us and we stayed there for a day. On April 26 around 8am, I was given test reports which showed us negative. The doctors told us that three of us were negative for the infection, so we could leave,” said the 23-year-old Covid-19 patient from Jaunchana village.However, the GIMS officials have denied the man’s claim about the test reports. “He, along with his baby and wife, came to us on April 25 around 10am. Their samples were collected. The baby’s test was done on a priority basis as he was brought dead. He was found negative and the reports of the couple were pending. We allowed the couple to leave with the body on humanitarian grounds. He was found positive on Monday morning, and has now been admitted in the hospital,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS.The Jaunchana patient said that if he knew that he was positive, then he wouldn’t have even touched the body to avoid spread of the virus among the villagers who attended the funeral.“They have not collected my sample again, which means I was positive when I was allowed to leave. I have put lives of others in danger unknowingly. Why were we allowed to leave? Now the whole village is upset with us,” said the patient.When asked, Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “I will look into the matter to find out the exact sequence of events. I will speak with the officials concerned at GIMS.”The incident has created panic among the people living in Jaunchana and the nearby villages.“I have been getting frantic calls from the people living in other villages as the Jauchana patient’s family members had gone there for some work. An inquiry should be ordered in the matter if the man was allowed to leave after his samples were collected. I am collecting facts on the incident and will inform the state government about the same,” said Dhirendra Singh, MLA, Jewar.By Monday night, the health department collected a total of 3,530 samples. A total of 129 cases have come out positive, while 75 patients have been discharged. Currently, there are 54 active Covid-19 cases in the district.

He said he spoke to about a dozen students to know the issues the students have been facing while taking classes online.“I have written to the state government recommending advancing of summer vacations. I have also spoken to some students over the phone about the issues they are facing while continuing with online studies. The recommendation will be sent to the government for all schools, including CBSE, ICSE and government schools, in Uttar Pradesh,” Ghaziabad DM Ajay Shankar Pandey said.According to officials, they have been receiving complaints from parents, students and parents’ associations about the effect on children from taking classes online for long, which are currently on during the lockdown period.“First, the children have to keep sitting in front of computers for several hours and many are even glued to their mobile phones. The parents also have to sit along with the children and their office work is also getting hampered. There are many areas where internet speed is slow. With long periods of exposure to computers and mobile phones, children are also facing issues of irritation in the eyes and headaches,” said Vivek Tyagi, spokesperson of the Ghaziabad parents’ association.“Generally, summer vacations are in May-June and there have been requests from all quarters to get the vacations preponed this year,” he added.A majority of private schools are imparting online classes to students while the state government has directed for online studies in UP government schools during the ongoing lockdown period, imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.DISTRICT LIKELY TO BE MOVED TO ORANGE ZONE FROM RED IN A WEEKMeanwhile, state officials said that the coronavirus situation in Ghaziabad is likely to improve in another week and the district is likely to be moved from the red zone at present to the orange zone if lockdown norms are strictly followed.Sudhir Garg, UP’s principal secretary (forests), said that more strictness in terms of lockdown enforcement is required in some areas. Garg has been sent as a special officer to Ghaziabad for supervising various aspects of lockdown, isolation and quarantine centres, as well as enforcement activities taken up.“We now have a unique trend in Ghaziabad where the number of active cases has fallen below the number of patients who got discharged from various hospitals. This trend is encouraging. It is our assessment that more reports are expected soon and the city may move from red zone to orange zone within a week. This has happened as a result of enforcement, lockdown of borders in order to avoid any medical infection and also due to support of residents,” Garg said.Garg, along with other officers from the UP and Ghaziabad administration, inspected different areas in the district.“There were instances where we saw people moving about in parks, defying lockdown norms. They will be dealt with strictly and surveillance in these areas will also be taken up with the help of drones. The parks need to be shut and no public should be allowed. We have also observed in some areas, including hotspots and containment zones that people are moving about in lanes and bylanes. If need be, we will get their houses sealed with wooden planks. Such people must understand that the lockdown will benefit them,” he added.In Ghaziabad, there are 17 hotspot areas which include Vaishali, Masuri, Pasonda, Loni, Nandgram, Muradnagar, Indirapuram, Islam Nagar and Khoda under the red zone; Raj Nagar Extension, Duhai, Vasundhra, Bhopra, Skardi Greens (near NH-9) under the orange zone; and Kaushambi, Sahibabad and Mohan Nagar which have been moved to the green zone.The red zones are areas where positive cases have been found in past 14 days while the orange zones are the ones where no new positive cases have emerged in the past 14 days. The green zones are the areas where no new cases have been found in the last 28 days.ALL PARKS SEALEDOn the directions of the principal secretary (forests), the Ghaziabad administration and the police on Monday afternoon directed for closure and sealing of all parks.“We have directed the Ghaziabad development authority, the municipal-corporation and the UP Avas Vikas to lockdown parks in their jurisdiction areas. If anyone is found roaming around, legal action under IPC Section 188 will be initiated. The resident welfare associations (RWA) should also ensure that there is no movement of the public in parks inside their societies. If anyone is found violating orders, the concerned RWA will be held responsible,” district magistrate added.“The SHOs of concerned areas have also been directed to ensure that all parks in their areas are closed and there is no movement of locals. The RWAs of highrises should also ensure lockdown directions,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, Ghaziabad.Till Sunday evening, the number of Covid-19 positive patients stood at 57 in Ghaziabad and 17 of these were already discharged from different hospitals. The health department on Monday said that 14 more patients will be discharged from the district hospitals in Muradnagar and Sahibabad.“A total of 14 persons turned negative for Covid-19 on Monday and they will be discharged after police verification. All of them have received two successive negative reports. Several of these include people who have attended religious congregations and we need the police to verify if they have any cases or not. So, our active cases will be about 26 once the 14 patients move out after formalities. It is for the first time in the district that the number of active cases has gone down as compared to the number of patients getting discharged,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-amid-lockdown-summer-vacations-may-be-advanced/story-3ZxjxQOC8sYAu2Sc9wajLK.html

The authority will also select an ‘employee of the month’ to honour those who are working tirelessly to contain the Covid-19 spread.“This initiative is to express our gratitude towards those staff members who are working day and night without caring for their own safety. They are the real corona warriors because they are on the ground and working for the safety of all,” Deep Chand, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority, said.There are at least 500 staff members who have been working with different departments daily. They are engaged in food distribution to the needy and providing civic services across the city. The authority has expressed their gratitude to all permanent and contractual employees that include drivers, security guards, sanitation workers, gardeners and sweepers, among others.“We cannot honour our staff members with prize money owing to a fund crisis. We took a decision to express our thanks towards them and expect that society should also respect them as corona warriors, same as how we respect our health workers fighting against Covid -19. We believe that the government staff who are looking after civic services and food distribution are also corona warriors,” another Greater Noida authority official, requesting anonymity, said.The authority said its staff is disinfecting around 40 sectors and an equal number of villages daily to contain the spread of Covid-19. So far, it has distributed around 9 lakh food packets since March 25, 2020, officials said.“We have been successful in arranging and distributing food to the needy only because of the support of our staff and voluntary help from society,” the second official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-motivate-staff-greater-noida-authority-to-hand-out-corona-warrior-tags/story-BB4ZZVrrnt3WKLkuuM6k8N.html
28-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi slams Haryana’s ‘attitude in difficult times’||The Delhi government slammed its Haryana counterpart, saying that its statement was against the guidelines of the Central government. The Aam Aadmi Party government said that Covid-19 patients in Delhi belong to different states of the country and that the national Capital “took care” of them and provided “state-of-the-art quarantine facility” to each one “without discriminating” on the basis of their home state. “We are shocked by their response. They should understand that we are one country and Delhi and Haryana both belong to India. The high number of corona cases in Delhi is not their own doing. It is because large number of Indians living abroad were brought back to India in February and March,” stated a statement issued by the chief minister’s office to HT. “Today, Delhi is suffering much more than other states because most of the international arrivals at that time landed in Delhi because we are the national Capital. We did not complain,” it stated.Calling the attitude of the Haryana government as being “against the spirit of India”, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said, “It is against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s endeavour to take the whole country along. Life of every person in Haryana is as precious for us as that of a Delhiite. We hope the Haryana government will change its attitude in these difficult times and not cause harassment to these employees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-slams-haryana-s-attitude-in-difficult-times/story-R4tVZzBgIFcfU7Yo8wcsqM.html
28-04-2020||Mumbai||Mahim Kabrastan buries those who die of Covid-19 in coffins||The Mahim Kabrastan trust announced on Sunday that they are burying bodies of Covid-19 patients in coffins, contrary to the Muslim practice of burying the dead by wrapping them just in shrouds. The Mahim Kabrastan is one of the 15 cemeteries in the city which are taking bodies of coronavirus patients.This is in accordance with the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines which insist burial of affected patients in coffins. The development comes almost three weeks after Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) allowed burial within the city, provided the ground is large enough to ensure no threat of transmission to the area’s residents.According to the data provided by the BMC, there are 20 Muslim cemeteries in the city, of which 15 have space available for fresh burials.At Mahim Kabrastan, the authorities said that they can accommodate 50 bodies, of which they have already received seven and two were expected on Monday.Suhail Khandwani, chairperson of Mahim Sunni Muslim Kabrastan trust, said they held a meeting with Dr Mudassir Lambe, chairperson of Maharashtra State Board Of Wakf (MSWB), which covers Muslim properties in the state, and BMC officials to decide on treatment for Covid bodies. Following which the decision was taken to bury these bodies in coffins.“Special coffins are provided because we need to consider the safety of those burying the body, as as result of which there is zero manual intervention. Sanitation is also done before and after the burial,” said Khandwani.Earlier, a dead body used to be lowered in the grave wrapped in a cloth and would be a wooden framework around the grave.The authorities also decided to conduct burial free of cost for Covid patients.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, said that the BMC had not issued any guidelines to bury the bodies in a coffin.“There is a World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline which insists on burial in coffins. However, we haven’t asked any cemetery to do that. This might be one of the first Muslim cemeteries to carry out coffin burials,” said Dighavkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mahim-kabrastaan-buries-those-who-die-of-covid-19-in-coffins/story-TvhrqYRQ5hoMQPJIDustRL.html
28-04-2020||Chandigarh||Panic among doctors as 75% health staffers tested positive in Chandigarh were on non-Covid emergency duty||There’s reason to worry. Twelve healthcare workers from two prominent hospitals — Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH-32) — have tested positive for Covid-19 from April 1 to April 27. Nine (75%) were working in ‘emergency’ areas dealing with non-Covid-19 patients.Four fresh cases were reported on Monday, all from GMCH-32. Three doctors from the anaesthesia department worked at the emergency OT and a 28-year-old staffer was in the housekeeping department. A 26-year-old PGIMER nurse who tested positive on Sunday was working at the emergency OPD.This has pushed GMCH-32 to relax strict adherence to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines to provide PPE kits and testing only for high-risk zones. “From today, every health worker in the emergency will get PPE kits,” BS Chavan, director principal, GMCH-32, told the Hindustan Times.UT adviser Manoj Parida has also tweeted that the UT administrator will hold a meeting on Tuesday with the heads of PGIMER, GMCH-32, Government Multi Specialty Hospital-16, and the health secretary to discuss safety protocols within the medical campuses. Staffers want PPE kits, mass testingMany staffers are now starting to panic and demanding personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and mass testing of all health workers.The first health worker to contract the infection (April 1) was a 31-year-old nursing officer from PGIMER working in the emergency section.Two others, however, who worked in close proximity to Covid-19 patients and tested positive were attendants in the hospital’s communicable disease ward. The next day, a cook at the institute’s advanced paediatric centre was found to have contracted the infection.However, even as the PGIMER cases seemed to be plateauing, health workers at GMCH-32 started getting infected.Then, on April 24, as a 30-year-old attendant at the hospital’s emergency OT was tested positive, Bapu Dham Colony, where he lived, was declared an “affected area.” Two others from the same OT, a 35-year-old ward boy living in from Mauli Jagran and a staff nurse from Sector 32, tested positive on April 25 and 26, respectively.“So many of us have tested positive and we have treated patients, interacted with staff members. We could have spread the infection to others, so test us,” says a health worker. Most of them are wary of disciplinary action so don’t want their names disclosed.“Patients undergoing surgery should also be first tested for the virus,” he adds.Even sanitisers are in short supply, staffers complain.“There is only one hand sanitiser bottle for the entire OT with a staff of 40. Everyone uses one bottle and by the evening we have no sanitiser left. We are asked to use soap but while treating patients in emergency one cannot keep rushing to the washbasins to use soap,” says another health worker, also wishing to remain anonymous.“We also need PPE kits and hazmat suits as we work in the emergency section and don’t know if a person is Covid-19 positive. Today I saw a person collecting samples and he was not wearing a hazmat suit,” he adds.Doctors’ concerns being addressedMeanwhile, with so many workers testing positive, BS Chavan said boosting the morale of doctors was the biggest challenge. They had their valid concerns, which were addressed, he said. Health workers will be screened if there is a slight chance of their getting infected even if they are asymptomatic. “So more testing will be done,” Chavan added.All precautions will be taken in surgery presuming patients could be Covid-19 positive and those going in for elective surgery will be tested first.Chavan also denied any shortage of sanitisers or PPE in the OT.‘How can you prove chain started from me?’The 30-year-old OT attendant who was the first in GMCH-32 to be tested positive, in the meantime, says there is nothing to prove that the chain started from him. “GMCH-32 authorities are bluntly saying that I am the first to get infected and chain of transmission started from me. But so many staff members tested positive in such a short time. The real source of infection should be investigated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/75-health-staffers-found-covid-infected-in-chandigarh-worked-in-low-risk-areas-source-a-mystery/story-FUFAhs4oPS9w4eZZUvm4ZN.html
28-04-2020||Delhi||Most of Mehrauli to become a containment zone after two food distribution volunteers test positive||Large parts of the Mehrauli neighbourhood in south Delhi are set to become containment zones after two volunteers who were involved in distributing free food and ration to the poor in the area tested Covid-19 positive on Monday.Also, on Monday, two more containment zones were notified in the Capital, taking the total to 99.“A containment plan has been worked out for Mehrauli. Areas where surveillance will be scaled up include Motilal Nehru Camp, Kishangarh car market, Church Road in Vasant Kunj, and Pehelwan Dhaba in Mehrauli,” district magistrate (south) BM Mishra said, adding, “Food distribution centres in the district are functional. But there are several volunteers involved too.”He confirmed that the two volunteers were engaged by an MLA in the area but refrained from naming any party.Mehrauli MLA Naresh Yadav, a leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, did not respond to calls and messages for comment.Health officials, however, said that the individuals have been quarantined but contact tracing can be a massive task as the two used to volunteer in several food distribution sites, which were frequented by hundreds of homeless people and migrant workers left jobless by the lockdown.On Monday evening, the order to notify one such containment zone in Mehrauli was issued by the government, citing cases found in Ward number 1 of Mehrauli, but it was yet to be included in the official list of containment zones updated every 24 hours.“These areas comprise densely populated clusters and the risk of transmission is high,” Sonalika Jiwani, sub-divisional magistrate of Mehrauli, said.Other parts of south Delhi, closer to Hauz Rani, Malviya Nagar and one belt in the Mehrauli neighbourhood, were sealed on Monday after being notified as red zones. They include Nirankari lane, Naala Boring gully, Ravan-Wali gully, Jameela Basjid Baoli, Gurudwara gully, Thane-Wali gully and Terminal lane.The other containment zone was Pillanji village under New Delhi revenue district, government officials said. It was declared a containment zone after five Covid-19 positive cases were reported from the area between April 17 and April 25.Containment zones comprise apartment blocks, gated communities, slums and streets. They may even cover entire neighbourhoods. It is a complete quarantine zone and no one is allowed to step out even to buy essential goods such as milk, vegetables, fruits etc. All entry and exit points, even internal lanes, are barricaded in containment zones. South Delhi’s Mehrauli has been on high alert and district officials are in a contact tracing frenzy after a vegetable vendor and a nurse residing in different parts of the neighbourhood tested Covid-19 positive last week. Both cases related to essential services and the individuals continued to work until the flu-like symptoms manifested and got themselves tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/most-of-mehrauli-to-become-a-containment-zone-after-two-food-distribution-volunteers-test-positive/story-bfb3dbvO0ZlInVcJreBzMM.html

THEFT ACCUSED SHIFTED TO ISOLATIONOn the other hand, no one came to take Saurav Sehgal, a theft accused who was found positive for the virus and has now recovered from the ailment. The health department and police contacted his family again and urged them to take Saurav from the hospital, but their efforts bore no fruit as his kin even refused to visit the hospital stating that they have snapped all ties with him. Saurav was caught on the charges of theft on April 6 and later found to be Covid-19 positive.Besides, the municipal corporation (MC) carried out screening of around 1,000 sweepers in Zones A and C. MC health officer Dr Jasvir Kaur said that during the screening, none of the sweepers showed any symptoms of the virus. The screening drive will continue on Tuesday, she said.1,800 TESTED SO FARDeputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal said that till Sunday, 1,839 samples had been collected in the district out of which reports of 1,505 have been received and 1,484 samples have tested negative. “Of the total samples, 21 were found positive, including 18 from Ludhiana and three from other districts,” he said, adding that five people have lost their lives, while seven patients (six from Ludhiana and one from Jalandhar) have fully recovered so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-coronavirus-patients-test-positive-again-in-ludhiana/story-NhjcPBUCTUOys4hoHcmbdN.html

I am thankful to the state government for arranging a bus for the stranded students.”Another medical student, Parkash Kumar, from Haria village, Ludhiana, said, “I was residing in a paying guest accommodation and before lockdown, I was getting three meals a day. But gradually I started getting only two meals a day. Due to lockdown, we had to face difficulties in getting sufficient food.

Karan, who won the battle against cancer on April 24, finally went back to his village with his parents after undergoing chemotherapy sessions for six months at the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) here.Karan was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a cancer that starts in the lymphatic system and occurs when the body produces too many abnormal lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells. While his condition was detected in September last year, his chemotherapy sessions started on November 26.His father, Suresh Kumar Bansal, who runs a small cosmetic shop in his village, said he, along with his wife Raj Rani, was always with Karan in Ludhiana while his two daughters Khushi and Dwanshi stayed back with their grandmother Urmila in the village.“These six months were the toughest phase of over lives. Only a parent can understand how it feels when you learn that your four-year-old son is in the fourth stage cancer. But I’m glad that all that is over now and my son is healthy, laughing and playing with his sisters,” said Bansal. After completing his session on April 18 and follow-up on April 22, he was given clearance by the team of doctors, who had been treating him, last week.The curfew, imposed by the government to contain the spread of coronavirus, has also affected Bansal family and their small business, but the joy of having their son back has overshadowed every distress for now.“Due to my son’s treatment, I have kept my shop closed for the past eight months. We have already exhausted all our savings and are surviving on the money that we borrowed from our relatives. We are in a tough spot, but the joy of having our son back after winning a battle against cancer has overshadowed even the distress caused by the pandemic. We thank God every day for healing our son and also the hospital staff and NGO, CanKids, that helped us financially and emotionally throughout the whole process,” said Suresh.Karan also celebrated his 5th birthday by cutting a homemade cake made by his mother.“On his birthday, Karan wanted a bicycle, but due to lockdown and our current financial condition, I can’t afford it, but he is a really sweet kid. He was happy with cake and balloons and being back with his family,” Suresh added.For people suffering from coronavirus, Suresh said recovery from all deadly diseases depended on willpower.“Faith in God and strong willpower are the strengths in such times. Even though my son was fighting cancer, his smile and our faith in God were our strengths. I want to advise the Covid-19 positive patients not to lose hope and keep fighting with faith in God,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/recovery-of-5-year-old-karan-from-cancer-gives-mansa-family-a-reason-to-cheer/story-7OCMGv3io8Hboa5LjMgWEJ.html

All these tournaments are important for players as it gives them an opportunity to get selected for state teams,” said Andekar.“Even one-day tournaments were scheduled during Gudi Padwa, Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti. These local tournaments help players to prepare for bigger tournaments,” said Andekar, who also coaches at Shahu College campus in Parvati.The association has advised its players to maintain a fitness regime and perform drills at homes to maintain their fitness level.“Right now we are not conducting any sessions on social media, but there is a one-on-one consultation with players via voice or video calls. We clear whatever queries and doubts they have related to the game and fitness regime,” added Andekar.Many summer camps have also been affected due to the pandemic and the lockdown. Andekar himself was gearing up to conduct a camp at Shahu College campus.“The plan was to conduct a camp for the age group of 12 to 17 years and all the players would have been selected from Pune Municipal Corporation schools and slum areas. I had prepared four arenas at my coaching academy and work was almost completed and the lockdown was implemented,” said Andekar.“Even national coaches had agreed to come for the camp but now, I will have to postpone this plan for next year. I don’t think there will be any sports activity in the coming six months,” said Andekar.Doubt over Zilla Parishad tournamentsSchools usually re-open in June and Zilla Parishad tournaments are held in August and September every year, but this year the tournaments are doubtful.“It looks difficult this year due to the current situation of the pandemic. Even international sports events have been cancelled. I think university-level sports tournaments will also be affected,” said Andekar.Mental fitness should be a priority“I feel along with giving fitness tips to players, it is important to keep the players motivated. As a coach, I know the situation is tough especially for young players as they may feel burdened during this situation,” he said.“We make sure to give inspiring talks to help them keep motivated,” said Andekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/next-six-months-challenging-for-kabaddi-players-should-stay-mentally-fit-says-rajendra-andekar-joint-secretary-pdka/story-XtbLD4VCl1Bb35fcBUKTbN.html
28-04-2020||City||Railways begins to dismantle 100-year-old foot overbridge in Ludhiana||Railway authorities pumped in around 180 workers to dismantle the 154 metre long, over 100-year-old foot overbridge at city railway station on Monday. It was a long pending project that was hanging the balance for past few years for want of approval from higher authorities.As during nationwide lockdown, there is no movement of passenger trains and entry of passengers at railway station is prohibited, the authorities found it a right time to start the work of dismantling the bridge. Senior section engineer Sunil Kumar said that the planning had started around five days ago and on Monday, the actual task began. “The work will continue till May 4 and we will dismantle it phase by phase. In the first phase, the portion of bridge between platform 1 and 2 will be disassembled,” he said.First, the power cable was removed and the then portion of bridge was lifted with the help of a crane. The disassembled bridge was placed on a container train to move it to the shed.Station director Tarun Kumar said that during normal days, it was risky to disassemble the bridge due to rush of passengers at the platform and it was optimum utilisation of the time to complete this pending project. Officials from all departments, including Railway Protection Force, Government Railway Police, Mechanical Department, Electrical Department and Engineering Department were on duty.Social distancing went for tossAlthough, masks were being distributed to all workers and a separate desk for sanitising hands of workers was also set up, it became a tough task for authorities to maintain social distancing between the workers.The workers were seen standing together and no distance was being maintained while pulling rope and lifting different equipment and some of them were also working without wearing gloves. Tarun Kumar said that the work was carried out while taking all precautions. “Regular announcements were being made to make sure workers were observing proper distancing while working. But as there were a number of workers, it is possible that at a point of time, some of them may have gathered at one place. Most of the work was performed with the help of machine because of which we were able to take maximum precautions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/railway-begins-to-dismantle-over-100-year-old-foot-overbridge-in-ludhiana/story-9TeJwWf9R2PpgHAaamWiWM.html
28-04-2020||Pune||Pune NGO appeals for donations amid lockdown scarcity||The Society of friends of Sassoon hospitals (Sofosh) a Pune-based NGO which runs two child care institutions that take care of destitute , abandoned or relinquished children and also disabled children, has appealed for donations.Sofosh officials said that resources are drying up due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The organisation that houses 88 children and full-time care takers need essentials and medicines. “Presently, there are 88 children in both establishments. Sofosh usually gets their essentials from donors, individuals and companies, but now, the lockdown has adversely affected the inflow of donations, be it in kind like food grains, vegetables, fruits, infant food, medicines and other provisions or cash donations,” said Shubhangi Abhyangkar, administration corordinator, Sofosh. “On the other hand, the caretaker staff had to be housed in the institution itself 24/7 due to severe movement restrictions for avoiding spread of Covid-19 to the children as well as the staff. This has increased the expenses considerably. Therefore Sofosh has appealed to people to donate cash or kind donations,” she added. How to donateSofosh calls for donations through online transfers directly to the NGO bank account .Bank details: AC name: Sofosh (Society of Friends of Sassoon Hospitals); AC no: 98260100000122; AC type: Savings account; IFSC code: BARB0DRCBJM; Bank name: Bank of BarodaUPI payment accepted: sofosh@barodampayAfter donating a person can send an email to admin@ sofosh.org giving full details. This will help in generating a donation receipt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sofosh-appeals-for-donations-amid-lockdown-scarcity/story-3oEczMdJhXzTwxAtd6sQYO.html
28-04-2020||Pune||Pune Police extend time window to buy essentials till 2pm||The Pune police on Monday announced that there will be a relaxation in the timings for shops to remain open beyond 12 noon in the city. The entire city has been declared a containment zone and shops selling groceries and essential items had been allowed to run their business between 10am and 12 noon during the lockdown, but on Monday, after Pune police’s fresh orders, the timing has been extended till 2pm.The time has been extended taking into account the inconvenience caused to residents, who have been seen breaking social distancing norms in view of the small window to buy essential items.Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of police in his order stated, “Shops selling essential items will now be able to function from 10 am to 2 pm instead of the earlier deadline of 12 noon. However, strictures related to social distancing and observing hygiene standards like compulsory wearing of masks, use of hand gloves, face shield and use of sanitisers will remain in force.”While many housing societies and citizens had demanded that shops be open for half a day, Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol in his request to the police had stated that many people were stepping outside the house to buy essentials and social distancing was not being observed as the timings to buy items was short. According to residents, the time window to buy essential commodities is limited leading to shops being crowded and social distancing norms being violated with impunity.“Residents should not take the relaxation in timings lightly and roam outside their homes. We have information that citizens go to shops multiple times to buy essentials, which must stop. If you go outside time and again you are more likely to get infected if you come in contact with a Covid-19 positive person,” said Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham.In many areas such as Kondhwa, NIBM road, Padmawati, Katraj, Aundh and Baner, social distancing was absent when people stepped out to purchase vegetables and groceries. “The two-hour window is too limited for everyone to come out of their home and purchase essentials. As supply of vegetables and milk is also limited, people do not have any option, but to come out within that two-hour window, which leads to chaos,” said Amrita Mali, a resident of Sahakarnagar.Sanjay Gaikwad, a resident of Salunke Vihar, said, “I had to wait for 45 minutes in the scorching sun to buy chicken, which earlier was an easy task. The two-hour window is putting severe pressure on the shopkeepers and buyers. We request the police authorities to increase the timings by two hours.”Meanwhile, a senior citizen, Francis D Mello, who had stepped out to buy groceries in Wanowrie, said, “The queues are long and it is difficult to get things on time. There is lot of pressure on the shopkeepers as they have very less time on their hand. Relaxation in curfew timings will see less crowds on the roads as people will not panic.”Rajeshkumar Chaudhary, who owns a grocery shop in Kondhwa, said, “The time is short and police take very strict action if we flout the rules. We are able to cater to only around 30 per cent of the customers in queue. Extension in timing will bring things back to normalcy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-hour-window-to-buy-essentials-leads-to-crowding-pune-police-considers-relaxation-of-2-hours/story-NB57Pwjf9WysqEsOcCGwjI.html
28-04-2020||Delhi||200 Tablighi Jamaat members, who have recovered, pledge to donate plasma||Over 200 members of the Tablighi Jamaat who have recovered from the Covid-19 infection have pledged to donate plasma to help those admitted to city hospitals with severe infections. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged everyone who has recovered from Covid-19 to donate plasma without thinking on religious lines.“The people have been tested; the collection will begin now,” a senior official from Delhi’s health department said.Of the over 2,300 people evacuated from the Nizamuddin Markaz in March-end, 1,080 had tested positive for the infection; many have now recovered.So far, 869 people have recovered from the infection in the city.“I was wondering, what if any patient, who is a Hindu, and is in a serious situation, is saved by the plasma extracted from the blood collected from the body of a Muslim person (who has been cured of Covid-19)? What if we come across cases in which plasma extracted from the blood of a Hindu person is found to have saved the life of a Muslim person?” Kejriwal said in a video media briefing.He further said, “God did not differentiate between individuals. It is us who have started to differentiate between humans based on faith. Coronavirus disease can happen to anyone irrespective of one’s faith… A Hindu person’s blood plasma can save a Muslim person’s life and a Muslim person’s blood plasma can save a Hindu person’s life. But, why have we created walls? At least, the virus has taught us that if we stand united, nothing can defeat us. And if we are divided among ourselves, we shall lose the battle. While donating plasma, one should not think on such (religious) lines.”So far, the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), which handles plasma collection, has received about nine donations, with a few more scheduled to take place on Monday.“Delhi needs a bank of around 200 Covid-19 plasma donations; we cannot wait for donation when a sick person comes to the hospital. Anybody who has recovered from the infection—two consecutive samples have tested negative—and has completed two more weeks of quarantine can donate plasma. People who have recovered can donate plasma every seven to ten days,” Dr SK Sarin, director, ILBS, said.The person has to be healthy to donate plasma—normal weight, haemoglobin of over 12, with no history of diabetes or hypertension. The doctors have found good levels of antibodies around three weeks after the infection.The government currently has limited approval to conduct a randomised control trial of the therapy for 20 critical patients, half of whom will receive the antibody-rich plasma and the other half a placebo (which is devoid of any therapeutic value). This will help test whether the plasma actually helps heal those with Covid-19.The therapy will be administered to those with a respiratory rate higher than 30 (normal is 20), have an oxygen saturation of less than 90% (normal is 95 to 100%), or those who have pus in their lungs.The plasma will be able to save critical Covid-19 patients, Kejriwal highlighted, citing an example of a Covid-19 patient in serious condition, who was administered the therapy and has improved in the last 24 hours.Convalescent plasma therapy uses a blood component called plasma—which contains virus-fighting antibodies—from people who have recovered from the infection to treat those who are severely ill with Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/200-tablighi-jamaat-members-who-have-recovered-pledge-to-donate-plasma/story-uCGTmL5MvH5uNXRkDnCDOL.html
