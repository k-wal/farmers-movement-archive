However, despite using them for a month, nurses and doctors find the protective gear uncomfortable and humid, especially with the temperatures soaring, as the air-conditions (ACs) in Covid-19 wards have been switched off to prevent the possibility of the virus spreading through the ducts. To avoid any contamination, the gears can be worn only once. If health workers use washrooms, they have to resort to a long-drawn procedure of disposing used PPEs and wearing new ones. As each of these suits cost around ₹1,200- ₹1,500, nurses limit the intake of water and food to avoid going to washrooms and put their own health at risk. Thus, many of them have developed dehydration.“In non-AC rooms, we sweat profusely in the plastic cover. This makes us dehydrated as we already restrict our water intake. Sometimes, I even feel dizzy,” said a nurse from Seven Hills Hospital, Marol.To ensure that every part is covered with the protective gear while attending a Covid-19 patient, health workers wear two layers of gloves, a mask, goggles and plastic protective cover on their footwear, which stretches to the knees. “We sweat profusely in the kit and the fogging of the googles makes the work difficult,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital.Specialised doctors do not stay for long hours to examine patients. Depending on the number of patients, they spend around two-three hours, which includes around 10 minutes to wear the PPEs and 15 minutes to take them off and dispose them. “More than us, it is the nurses who are making more adjustments to stay put in the suits for hours. Hats off to them,” said epidemiologist Dr Om Srivastava.Sumedha Boshle (name changed), 37, a nurse stationed at Kasturba Hospital’s isolation ward works from 8am to 4pm every day. She said donning the safety suit is a huge challenge but the health workers have to wear them as it is the only protective barrier between them and coronavirus patients. “The PPE is like rubber. In the beginning, I used to sneeze a lot because of the smell, but now I have got used to it. My body also smells of it. Everything comes with a price,” she said. There are precautions that need to be taken while taking off the PPEs and disposing them. The gears must be taken off in a designated area. “They are wrapped in yellow biohazard bags for disposal. By the time we take them off, our clothes get drenched in sweat,” said Dr Ajit Baviskar, head of emergency department and consultant critical care, Global Hospital. Despite all the precautions, health workers are scared that they would infect their families. Boshle has not seen her 10-year-old daughter for the past two weeks. Currently, she has been lodged at a temporary accommodation provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “Every day after my duty hours, I talk to my daughter on video calls. That’s the only time I get to see her,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dehydrated-dizzy-medical-workers-soldier-on-with-ppe-in-humid-non-ac-covid-wards/story-sBcaWwGDE41xrIV0hFMkLK.html
26-04-2020||Mumbai||Nurse at Mumbai’s Wadia maternity hospital tests positive for Covid-19||A nurse from Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital, Parel, has been diagnosed with coronavirus on Sunday. This is the first case of coronavirus among the staffers of the maternity hospital. Minnie Bodhanwala, the chief executive officer (CEO) of the hospital, has confirmed the development but refused to divulge any more information on the incident.On April 25, the samples of the nurse were sent to King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital to ascertain if she had coronavirus after she had developed symptoms. After the case came to light, several hospital staffers have been asked to be home quarantined and report immediately in case they show any symptoms. The staff at the hospital have been claiming that they have not been provided with adequate safety kits and are at a risk of getting exposed to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nurse-at-mumbai-s-wadia-maternity-hospital-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-iqB7HeDNY9cYzB9k9Q5AZO.html
26-04-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER, GMCH staff testing positive for Covid-19 a worrying trend for Chandigarh||The last three days have revealed a worrying trend. Four out of nine persons testing positive for Covid-19 in the city are healthcare workers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32 – both at the forefront of the battle against the virus.The four who tested positive in the last four days include a nurse from PGIMER; and a nurse, an operation theatre assistant and a ward boy from GMCH-32. Five others are primary contacts of the GMCH employee.This development comes even as Chandigarh recorded its biggest spike on Sunday with six persons testing positive, taking the count to 36.“It is a matter of concern that institutes at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19 are now contributing to the number of positive cases,” said a senior UT official requesting anonymity.Nearly 30% of the city’s cases are either health workers of PGIMER and GMCH-32 or their primary contacts.In fact, of the total 36 cases confirmed positive so far, six patients are staffers at the institutes and five are their primary contacts. Tests of other contacts are awaited.Among positive cases reported earlier in PGIMER, a nurse tested positive on April 1; two workers on April 17 and one on April 19. A spurt in cases at Nayagon in Mohali, in fact, has been attributed by local authorities to “exposure” of PGIMER employees to the virus after a 30-year-old attendant from the institute first tested positive. His wife, mother, child, brother-in-law and a 25-year-old living in the same building as them at Adarsh Nagar have also tested positive.Then there’s the GMCH-32 operation theatre attendant from Bapu Dham Colony in Chandigarh who tested positive on Friday. His father, mother, two sisters and a child have also contracted the disease.FOLLOW PROTOCOL STRICTLYUT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida has admitted that the infections among hospital staff are a matter of concern and asked the institutes to follow safety protocols strictly.PGIMER directorDr Jagat Ram has said: “We need to minimise such instances.” Since healthcare workers were at huge risk, they should follow the guidelines and protocols laid down by the authorities, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-gmch-staff-testing-positive-for-covid-19-a-worrying-trend-for-chandigarh/story-wbgieBCIRLnHBGMua3iUxM.html
26-04-2020||City||Stigma: A challenge in Covid battle||Apart from battling the coronavirus, doctors, nurses and ward attendants attending to the patients are facing another challenge – stigma.In Mumbai, more than 250 doctors, including nurses and Class 4 employees, contracted the infection at work, which is leading to growing incidents of discrimination against medical staffers, some of whom are not even involved in treating coronavirus patients. Neighbours and flat owners are harassing the medical staff, threatening to evict them from their apartments.Dr Rohan Salunke, a radio oncologist who currently works at Mahatma Phule Charitable Trust Hospital and was earlier associated with the Tata Memorial Hospital, is one of the medical staffers who faced such harassment. “My housing society along with neighbouring buildings barricaded the lane in front of our building, although there was no positive case in the area. They weren’t letting anyone in or out. But I had cancer patients to treat. As I was stepping out, they saw my stethoscope and started to harass me.” They warned him that if he stepped out, they wouldn’t allow him back. After days of harassment, on April 2, he had to call Malwani police for help. “I am not even on Covid duty, but still, they heckled me. All I wanted was to provide radiation to cancer patients to save their lives,” he said.Nurses are among the worst-hit. In Mumbai, so far, 153 nurses, including nursing students, have contracted the infection. Pallavi Waghale, a staff nurse from government-run Sir JJ hospital, alleged that her neighbours verbally abuse her when she steps out for work daily. In a series of tweets to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she stated that her neighbours assaulted her two-year-old son when she was away at work.A 26-year-old male nurse from the same hospital had to face the anger of his neighbours when he got home quarantined after getting exposed to a Covid patient. He said that everyday in the morning when the hospital bus would come to pick him up from his building in Kalyan, the residents would treat him like an “untouchable”. “They wouldn’t even cross my shadow in fear. Two days ago, when I got home quarantined, the society people insulted my parents and asked them to restrict their movement outside our flat,” said the nurse, seeking anonymity.The United Nursing Association is planning to raise the issue with the health ministry. “All staffers who are on Covid duty have been given alternative accommodation to stop any possible transmission of virus among their family members. Despite this, people are harassing those on non-Covid duty. They are working for the society,” said a member of the association. Class 4 employees, too, have similar complaints. A 50-year-old sweeper from Kasturba Hospital who was the second staff member from the hospital to contract the infection has tested negative in her swab test. Despite being discharged from the hospital, she has been forced to stay in a hospital ward because her landlord from Kalyan has warned her against returning to her room. “After I turned positive, the health department had to fumigate the chawl and quarantine the area. They fear that I might spread the infection. My landlord has asked me to stay at the hospital,” she said. The Maharashtra State Human Right Commission has also criticised the discrimination of staff members. MA Sayyed, acting chairperson of the commission, said, “It is important to be cautious, but humiliating or harassing medical staffers is unacceptable. No rule can bring such behavioural changes among people. This is in violation of human rights and should be condemned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stigma-a-challenge-in-covid-battle/story-K00YoTvjNVakgc5bXhVU3L.html

But one thing is for sure, we will have to avoid crowding,” Thackeray said.From April 20, the state government has provided some relaxations in the rural areas of the state by allowing operation of industries etc.“If we start doing politics now than we don’t need any other enemy. Elections will come and pass, power will also not remain forever but if we lose a life today, it is not going to come back,” he said and expressed gratitude to Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari for urging the Maharashtra politicians to cooperate with the state government.The chief minister also urged the Muslim community to stay at home while observing the fast and prayers in the holy month of Ramzan. Thackeray also assured the migrant workers that they will be allowed to go back to their native villages as soon as possible. He said that they are in touch with the central government and efforts are on to make some arrangements. The state government is arranging food, stay and medical health facilities for as many as 6 lakh migrant workers that are residing in various shelter homes across Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/curbs-may-continue-in-some-areas-after-may-3-cm-uddhav/story-64uGE0MWQfFvCNlMvBp2xK.html

While Bhoora managed to escape, Lal was caught by the villagers and was tied to a tree and was brutally thrashed by the villagers,” said Bishnoi.The SP added that some locals informed the control room after which Bawalwara police team rushed the spot and took the deceased to nearby community health care center but in the meantime he succumbed to his injuries after which the family members were informed and a case against unknown accused was lodged under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.“The case was taken on priority and a special team was formed to investigate the case and later eight accused were arrested,” said Bishnoi, adding that the accused were presented before a local court in Udaipur on Sunday morning from where they were sent on one-day police remand.The eight arrested accused have been identified as Narayan Garasaiya (36), Nagendra Garasiya (19), Giriraj Garasaiya (21), Rameschand Garasiya (38), Mohan Garasiya (19), Shantilal Garsaiya (42), Rakesh Garasiya (24) and Shambhu Lal Garasiya (33).A cross case of theft has been registered against Lal and his colleague Bhoora who is still absconding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-man-beaten-to-death-on-suspicion-of-theft-eight-arrested/story-txCk8s1ZwrqudqmdYH1KjN.html
26-04-2020||Mumbai||How Borivli, Mulund and Kalbadevi kept cases to less than 25||Three wards in Mumbai which cover Borivli West in the western suburbs, Mulund in the eastern suburbs, and Marine Lines, Kalbadevi and Chira Bazaar in the island city have recorded less than 50 Covid-19 positive cases as of April 25, even as the number of cases recorded in the city in a single day on Sunday were 358, and the total cases in the city touched 5,407.The R-North ward (Borivli) has seen the lowest number of cases so far at 29, followed by T Ward (Mulund) with 32 cases, and C ward in south Mumbai with 33 cases. The numbers are despite the 60% of the R-North ward being occupied by slums and congested dwellings, and 41% of the C ward housing old chawls with common toilets. The T ward has 35% slum population. These wards have managed to contain their cases mainly due to concentration of the cases to one or two families, and a single large hotspot, instead of many small and periodic outbreaks of the virus. All three wards also got a breather of three to four days that allowed them chance to respond to the outbreak.Sandhya Nandedkar, assistant municipal commissioner of R North ward, said, “We are taking all usual measures such as containment, quarantine, contact tracing, disinfection of common places such as toilets and slums. What has worked for my ward is that we have managed to contain all cases to a few small pockets where first Covid-19 patients were found.” The first case was reported in the R-North ward on March 28, following which six cases were found in the same area of Ambawadi. Following large scale quarantine and contact tracing, no new cases have been recorded so far. Nandedkar said, “Most of my cases are restricted to three slum pockets, including Ambawadi. Some health workers were quarantined in the hospital itself, and did not infect anyone else.”The health officer of C ward said, “We have got two large families that make up for 12 cases among the 33. The remaining cases have been restricted to families. We have 80% index patients, and remaining are contact patients restricted to a family in 28 pockets. None of our index patients transmitted the virus to others.” The first case was recorded on March 27, following which a few lot of cases were recorded five or six days later.In case of T ward, health officer Kishor Gandhi said, “My ward has only 10-11 high-risk contacts. The index patients in my ward did not transmit the virus to others. The transmission too has been within the family. Our cases are restricted to one big pocket called Ramgad slum, followed by small cases in Indira Nagar. We were able to successfully contain the outbreak to some areas. We also got some breathers of 2-3 days.” There are 17 containment zones in T ward. The T ward banned sale of vegetables and fruits on footpaths throughout the ward after a vegetable vendor tested positive for the virus. From the first day of the outbreak in Mumbai, in the beginning of March, the ward has been sanitising all community toilets in its slum pockets every few hours, with dedicated cleaners appointed at every toilet block.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-borivli-mulund-and-kalbadevi-kept-cases-to-less-than-25/story-8nHGd0y6YxMwkqpfGZAkEI.html
26-04-2020||City||With 89% recovery rate, GIMS one of the best Covid-19 hospitals in UP||NOIDA: Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh, there is some encouraging news from Gautam Budh Nagar – one of the worst affected districts in the state.After discharging eight Covid-19 patients, including an 82-year-old woman and a six-day-old baby on Sunday, the isolation ward of the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) at Greater Noida is left with only four patients. Interestingly, the hospital came into existence just about two years ago in July 2018.With a recovery rate of over 89%, the GIMS has emerged as one of the best government medical colleges in the state. Of 35 Covid-19 positive patients, 31 have been discharged from the hospital after being cured, officials said.The other two Covid hospitals in the district, Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute and Sharda Hospital, also have good recovery records. While the paediatric hospital has witnessed 44% (22 cured of 50 positive patients) recovery rate till date, the Sharda Hospital has recorded a rate of 24% (seven cured of 30). And, this is despite the fact that GB Nagar had maximum positive cases in the state when the nationwide lockdown was announced by the central government. Notably, the GB Nagar district has not reported any Covid-related deaths so far. However, 29 people have died due to Covid-19 in other parts of the state. GIMS director Dr Rakesh Gupta said that, to his best knowledge, GIMS has the maximum recovery rate among all the hospitals in the country. He, however, gives full credit for the remarkable achievement to his team of 30 doctors. “They are the real motivators, who have kept aside their personal lives in the war against the Covid-19 pandemic. They work in 12-hour shifts treating patients in the isolation ward. Only four to five senior doctors are allowed to go home, while others have to stay in one building,” Gupta said.According to the data collected from other districts of the state, the medical college at Meerut has a recovery rate of 35% (24 cured of 68 positive cases, five deaths) so far, and Agra medical college has recorded a rate of 24% (29 cured of 119 patients). Dr Saurav Srivastava, head of medicine department and the Covid-19 doctors’ team at GIMS, said that he has never seen a challenge like this in his career. “I have heard stories about an outbreak of plague in Gujarat in early 90s, but this appears much bigger. For a doctor, keeping hopes alive and having positive attitude is the biggest challenge in such pandemic situation. It was round-the-clock efforts of our team, comprising doctors and nursing staff, that we could achieve such a big success in the recovery of our patients,” he said.This team of 30 doctors in Covid-19 isolation ward includes 26 young resident doctors, who are working in 12-hour shift every day. There are two 12-hour shifts -- one from 8am till 8pm and another from 8pm till 8am. Six resident doctors are always on duty in each shift, the officials said, adding that each team of six resident doctors works for seven to eight days in one go and then goes under quarantine for 14 days to ensure safety of others. GIMS has also won accolades from the doctors of other medical colleges. Dr GK Aneja, the principal of SN Medical College, Agra, said that it is really a commendable job from a medical college, which came into existence just two years ago. “With no casualty, this nascent medical college has shown us the way that how the pandemic could be handled with a firm determination,” he said.Echoing similar views, Dr Ramesh Chandra Gupta, principal of LLRM Medical College, Meerut, said that the doctors of GIMS have done a commendable job in treatment of Covid-19 patients.Meanwhile, three more persons tested positive for Covid-19 in the GB Nagar district on Sunday, taking the overall tally of positive cases to 115. Among the new cases, two are minors from Sector 8 in Noida and Achher village in Greater Noida, while the other one is 32-year-old male from Tilapta village in Greater Noida. All of them have been admitted to the isolation ward at Sharda Hospital. Till date, 71 patients have been discharged, the officials said. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-89-recovery-rate-gims-one-of-the-best-covid-19-hospitals-in-up/story-Vzb7dbw7UYefoGJAZK2XNK.html
26-04-2020||City||No separate facility for women patients at L3 Covid-19 hospitals||Female patients lodged at state government’s dedicated L3 category Covid hospital — Meerut Medical College — have been caught in a bind. They have been lodged along with male patients without any privacy in a single ward, which some of them claimed also didn’t have proper facilities. The dedicated L3 category hospitals have been identified and created by the UP government for treating critical Covid-19 positive patients.The UP government has come up with three-layered health care facilities – L1, L2 and L3 dedicated Covid hospitals – in order to fight the Coronavirus outbreak in the state.The L1 category hospitals deal with normal Covid-19 positive patients while the L2 hospitals are ones where patients are facing other complications along with Covid-19 are admitted. The L3 category hospitals are meant for admission of Covid-19 positive patients who require critical care. there are 6 L3 hospitals in the state, with one on Meerut“The major issue, which has been a cause of concern, is that both male and female patients are lodged in one dormitory-type ward and there is no privacy. The ward seems to have been recently opened after being shut for around six months. There is no fixed timing for food being served and paranthas and potato curry is served to us, which is not recommended for patients suffering from co-morbid conditions,” said a female patient from Ghaziabad, who suffers from cancer and tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week.She said that there are no hangers available inside the bathroom and she had been using a wet towel as a sponge to clean herself, instead of taking a bath. She added that there was no space available for drying clothes.“Doctors at a private hospital where i was getting treated earlier had recommended timely food and proper diet in order to maintain my immunity. I am already weak after my chemotherapy sessions and there is a major disruption in my schedule here. There is not enough space to even take a walk here as advised by doctors. I would rather go back home and remain in isolation there,” she added.The husband of another patient from Ghaziabad said that his wife has cancer and had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 23.“Her cancer treatment was going on at a hospital in Delhi when she tested positive. We approached the Ghaziabad health department on Saturday and an ambulance shifted my wife on Sunday to Meerut Medical College. There, she has been lodged with other male patients in the same ward. There is no fixed schedule for food distribution and the ward is unhygienic ,” said the woman’s husband.“Such wards need to follow proper and regular sanitization, more so when cancer patients are lodged in them. Back home I installed an air purifier for her so that she can breathe properly. But here at the hospital, there is no proper ventilation as well,” he added.Dr TS Arya, the medical superintendent of the L3 hospital at Meerut, said that the shortcomings at the facility had come to his notice and proper arrangements will be made for women patients.“There is no segregation of male and female patients in the ward and we will look into that so that women patients get the privacy they require. At present we have shifted all women patients to a particular section of the ward. Regular sanitisation of ward is being carried out and we will try to reserve washrooms for women soon. The other issues l— ike timely food and type of food — will also be reviewed,” Dr Arya said.He added that the L3 facility has 38 Covid-19 patients at present, besides 7-8 suspected cases.“We have about 200 beds reserved for isolation with 20 beds at ICU. There are 40 other beds which are reserved for suspected cases. At present we are conducting the second round of Covid test on patients after 13 days. If it turns negative then another test is conducted within 24 hours. If two consecutive tests are negative, then the patient is discharged. But patients with comorbid conditions may require further treatment,” he added.According to the state health department officials, about 79.15% of male patients have got infected while the percentage of females is 20.85% across the state.In Ghaziabad, the health department officials also admitted that they have no separate arrangements for women patients at L1 and L2 facilities as well.“We have not reserved spaces or wards for women patients at our L1 category hospital at Muradnagar (30 beds). The L1 attached hospital (76 beds) at Sahibabad has different rooms which can be reserved for women patients. Likewise, the L2 category hospital at Sanjay Nagar (100 beds) also has different rooms which can be reserved for women patients. We will also reserve washrooms for them. I will issue directions to our government hospitals to reserve or separate facilities for women,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer at Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-separate-facility-for-women-patients-at-l3-covid-19-hospitals/story-GGObjVgC3Cfxkb7k5YB0SJ.html
26-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad: All 900 flats of Niho Scottish Garden may be sealed; district sees 4 new positive cases||The district health department officials on Sunday said that four more people had tested Covid-19 positive, taking Ghaziabad’s total of virus-infected patients to 57. The district administration officials on Sunday also restricted and sealed the movement of residents of Niho Scottish Garden in Indirapuram. A tower of the highrise had been completely sealed on April 20 after a 71-year-old man tested positive for the virus there.“Despite the sealing, the movement of residents in the society continued unabated.The administration decided to put a restriction on that from today. All residents will get food and other essentials delivered to the gate of the society. We will talk to district officials and take a call on sealing all 900 flats in the society,” said Naresh Chhokar, president of Niho Scottish Garden AOA.Aditya Prajapati, the sub divisional magistrate for the area said the restrictions were placed on recommendation of the health department.“The restriction of movement amounts to sealing of highrise, which has about 900 flats. It is questionable why the sealing was not taken up on April 20? The officials cannot seal towers or buildings in an arbitrary manner,” said DK Maurya, former AOA president of the highrise.Meanwhile, of the four people who tested positive on Sunday, three belong to Kaila Bhatta area. The fourth patient is a 40 year old woman, who has cancer. She has been sent to the L3 Covid hospital at Meerut.“The three patients who tested positive for Covid-19 are men and came in contact with a woman who earlier tested positive. The fourth case on Sunday was of a woman from Loni who was under cancer treatment in Delhi when she tested positive. We have sent her to Meerut Medical College,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.“There were two other suspected cases of a doctor couple, but their reports are awaited. We have started a disinfection process at their home,” Dr Gupta added.On sunday, the number of cases in Uttar Pradesh rose to 1,843 with 289 patients discharged from different hospitals. At least 29 people had succumbed to the virus.“We now have 1,525 active cases in 58 districts of UP. The pool sampling tests has also been increased and on Saturday we tested 318 pools, which included 1,590 samples,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).On Sunday, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that Covid-19 patinets must be treated only at dedicated hospitals and the staff attending to them must not attend to patients with other ailments. The UP government has prepared three tier-setup of L1, L2 and L3 dedicated Covid hospitals to deal with teh virus.The CM on Sunday, during a review meeting with the teams of government officials, said that all shelter homes and community kitchens to be geo-tagged.“It is very important to safeguard medical teams engaged in Covid-19 treatment. The doctors, nurses, paramedics and other support staff engaged in coronavirus cure should be protected against infection. So at the Covid hospitals, ensure stocks of more than sufficient PPE (personal protection equipment), N-95 masks. And at the same time, the Covid hospitals must be kept clean and sanitised all the time,” Yogi said.The CM has also directed for dedicated teams to be set up in all districts to check prevalence of infection prevention protocol in order to safeguard healthcare staff members working for treatment of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-niho-scottish-garden-sealed-district-sees-4-new-positive-cases/story-6UegawhOo3uDmUXZmhEJnL.html
26-04-2020||Mumbai||Pawar demands grant of ₹1 lakh crore from centre to overcome financial crisis||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has demanded a generous financial package for Maharashtra to tide over the economic crisis due to the lockdown imposed to arrest the coronavirus outbreak.Pawar, in a letter to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday, has sought an additional grant of ₹1 lakh crore for this fiscal. He said the state is estimated to face a shortfall of this amount due to the outbreak.He has also demanded a two-year moratorium on repayment against a loan from National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) citing that it will help in bridging the likely budgetary gap.The state makes repayment of ₹10,500 crore for NSSF loan every year. “So far, Mumbai is the hardest-hit city in the Covid-19 outbreak and the prolonged lockdown conditions. This has severely impacted the economy of Maharashtra and may have detrimental consequences on Indian economy if not addressed urgently,” Pawar stated in his letter.He said that there is an expected revenue shortfall of ₹140,000 crore. This is around 40% of the expected revenues and will leave a huge hole in the state finances.“As per the present borrowing limits (3% of GSDP), the state can borrow up to ₹92,000 crore, of which ₹54,000 has been planned for meeting the capital expenditure requirements. So, it is clear that state is going to face a shortfall of ₹100,000 crore to sustain projected expenditure,” he said.The veteran leader also suggested some other measures to help Maharashtra, including hiking the borrowing limit under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM), but cautioned that covering the entire shortfall only through borrowing will push the state towards a potential debt trap.Pawar said that cut in public spending can also be used as a measure, however, that would be counterproductive given the subdued economy. “There will be additional expenditure requirements in the area of public health and medical education and other public services,” he pointed out.“Almost all countries US, Spain, Germany, France, Australia etc have released financial packages of around 10% of GDP. Thus, a room can be created by the Government of India along with RBI for giving suitable financial package to states,” the letter states.“In the eventual recovery of the Indian economy the states will play a major role and if left out without any help the states will not be in a position to supplement the required national government efforts,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pawar-demands-grant-of-1-lakh-crore-from-centre-to-overcome-financial-crisis/story-OYVDxWQqyBVQVWdCGhVibL.html

26-04-2020||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray will remain CM after May 27, says Sena MP Raut||With Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari yet to give his nod to appoint chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray to the Maharashtra Legislative Council, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has now targeted the central leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the delay. In his weekly column Rokhthok in Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Raut called Koshyari a person with “morals”, and expressed confidence that Thackeray will remain the chief minister after May 27. The CM on Sunday also said that politics should be kept aside during the ongoing war against Covid-19.In his column, Raut said, “If the Governor decides to sign the nomination file, he can do so instantly. But for that, he would have to ask the BJP leaders in Delhi. Then, the Governor, as an institution, is not independent and impartial.” He also wrote that the opposition party in Maharashtra is egging the Governor to not sign the recommendation of the cabinet and let President’s Rule take over the state at a time when the Thackeray government is fighting a war against the coronavirus. Raut said that the Thackeray government has the support of over 170 MLAs and it will continue after May 27.Thackeray, who is not a member of either House of the state legislature, took oath as the chief minister on November 28. The Constitution allows a non-legislator to hold the post for up to six months. For Thackeray, this period ends on May 27, before which his nomination to legislature needs to be confirmed.This month, the state cabinet recommended that the Governor appoint Thackeray as a member of the Legislative Council (MLC) through his quota, to avoid a Constitutional crisis. The Governor has so far not taken any decision, leaving the three-party Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government on tenterhooks.“When the war against coronavirus was on, the Madhya Pradesh (MP) government was pulled down, and a month later the cabinet expansion was done. Similarly, a one-day session of the state legislature can be convened for the MLC polls. More importantly, if the [MLC] election will be done without any opposition, the Election Commission has to merely do it as a formality,” Raut mentioned in his column.He cited examples where governors in other states have nominated chief ministers and ministers and such nominations had stood the legality in the courts. Raut, a Rajya Sabha MP, added that Koshyari will weigh the “political good and evil”. “We have been blessed with a Governor who strictly follows the Constitution, morality, and political courtesy,” he wrote.Thackeray on Sunday said that political leaders in the state will have to keep politics aside at this moment. “If we focus on politics at this time, then we do not need any other enemy. Elections come and go, so does power, but if lives are lost, they will not come back. Therefore, no one should play dirty politics,” he said.The CM also thanked Union minister Nitin Gadkari for earlier saying that politics should be kept aside and “all should work closely with the Maharashtra government” during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-will-remain-cm-after-may-27-says-sena-mp-raut/story-snPgh0G3iseFmHk8WXBczL.html
26-04-2020||City||In absence of Covid PPE kit, Women Hospital staff use HIV protection kit for delivery of suspected Covid-19 patient||Ghaziabad: Doctors at the District Women Hospital in Ghaziabad had to perform the delivery of a suspected Covid-19 patient while wearing personal protection equipment (PPE) meant for protection against HIV, officials said. The hospital did not have any PPE kit that is used during treatment of a Covid-19 patient, they said. The 27-year-old woman is presently lodged in an isolation room of the hospital, and her samples were sent for testing on Sunday. The woman delivered a baby who is her third child, the officials said. “The woman, having mild labour pain, had come to the hospital with respiratory infection and fever. On Saturday afternoon, we sent her in an ambulance to the sampling centre at Sanjay Nagar hospital twice, but she was turned back from there. In the meantime, she went into labour and we decided to take her to the operation theatre. We had no PPE kits meant for protection against Covid-19, so we decided to go ahead with delivery with the help of kit meant for protection against HIV,” said Dr Deepa Tyagi, medical superintendent of the hospital.“During the delivery, there were three staff members inside. We had to take a decision in order to save her life, and would have faced complications,” she added.However, Dr NK Gupta, Ghaziabad chief medical officer (CMO), said that there were about 2,000 PPE kits available in the district till Sunday.“The hospital officials should have taken the kits from our department. Also, there is a separate budget which is allotted for purchase of kits to all the three government hospitals in Ghaziabad. Meanwhile, directions have been issued that such women patients, if tested positive for Covid-19, should undergo delivery only at OT of dedicated Covid hospital. Such provision is available at our L2 category hospital at Sanjay Nagar,” Gupta said.The CMO said that he will inquire why the samples of the woman was not taken up at the sampling centre on Saturday afternoon. The sampling centre at the Sanjay Nagar hospital was inaugurated earlier this month for taking samples of suspected Covid-19 cases.The state government has already said that all the Covid and non-Covid hospitals should be properly sanitized in order to keep away any medical infection. For the purpose of inspection and audit of hospitals, the state government has directed for formation of committees in all districts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-absence-of-covid-ppe-kit-women-hospital-staff-use-hiv-protection-kit-for-delivery-of-suspected-covid-19-patient/story-gHs17bFIcKG16E47R7Ln5L.html
26-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad administration restricts travel to Delhi between 9am and 6pm for government employees||In order to further restrict the movement of commuters between Ghaziabad and Delhi, the Ghaziabad district magistrate on Sunday issued an advisory to all employees of Central government and Delhi government offices in the capital . The advisory stated that such commuters will have to leave Ghaziabad maximum by 9am and travel back home after 6pm, when their duty hours end.“The advisory has been issued in order to enforce lockdown norms. There has been movement of commuters who travel between Delhi and Ghaziabad throughout the day. We are required to depute police officials for round-the-clock checks. Therefore, we have issued the advisory for such commuters to restrict their travel timings,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate.Apart from the travel advisory, it has also been decided that officers of deputy secretary and above ranks, travelling between Ghaziabad and Delhi, will only be required to show their ID cards in order to cross the borders.The officials said that only 33% of the officers and staff have been allowed to attend Delhi government and Central government offices but some of them who fall under the Class-3 and Class-4 category of employees continue to commute between Ghaizabad and Delhi throughout the day on the basis of temporary ID cards.“Such employees should be issued passes by their respective offices and these could be availed on a daily or a weekly basis. Such staff members will not be allowed to move between Delhi and Ghaziabad only on the basis of their ID cards. We have issued the advisory letter to Delhi officials and the Delhi police to help them take necessary steps,” Pandey added.He added that mediapersons will be allowed commute only on the basis of valid ID cards.In a decision taken earlier on April 20, the district magistrate under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, had prohibited any travel between Ghaziabad and Delhi, except for those involved in essential services or having valid passes.The decision was taken on the basis of a report submitted by the health department, which said that about six Covid-19 positive cases have emerged after people had travelled to Delhi.After the directions, the Ghaziabad-Delhi borders were sealed and more police deployment was put in place. According to the officials, this led to a reduction in the traffic volume by about 40%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-administration-restricts-travel-to-delhi-between-9am-and-6pm-for-government-employees/story-GMhxKlmE8f9aCdU9YQ6a8N.html
26-04-2020||Mumbai||In post-lockdown transit plan, trains should be restarted last: Experts||While the Covid-19 pandemic has halted local transport across the world, it has also called for cities like Mumbai to re-invent and re-plan their mobility strategies. Transport experts have stressed the need for the city to start planning its post-lockdown strategies, along the lines of those in Milan and Paris where roads will be transformed to make more space for cyclists and pedestrians.Madhav Pai, director, World Resources Institute (WRI), said, “It is becoming more evident around the world that cycling will be the best means to adopt both, social distancing norms and minimum physical activity. If we run a bicycle donation program in the city, we could donate them to many people who would happily cycle to work. Cycling eight to 10kms within the city should be easily manageable.”Cities across the world are adopting the ‘avoid-shift-improve’ method, said transport expert Amruta Ponkshe from the Observer Research Foundation. “Even in the post-lockdown period, cities in other countries are asking people to commute only when it is essential and avoid unnecessary travel. They are urged to shift from cramped transit modes like crowded buses to walking, cycling or e-bikes and improve the overall sustainability of transport by increased usage of e-buses or hybrid fuel vehicles.”Experts also said that this is a good chance for the city to experiment with more bus lanes. Ashok Datar, a transport expert said, “While buses must operate on 2/3rds their capacity with no one standing, we should experiment with bus lanes on arterial roads like the western express highway and eastern express highway.”Like cities around the globe, transit agencies must restart in a phased manner, said AV Shenoy from the Mumbai Mobility Forum. “Private vehicles, autos, and taxis can be started first, as they can also be controlled easily when it comes to adherence of social distancing norms,” Shenoy said, adding that the suburban railways and Metro must be opened in the final phase, as maintaining physical distance would be next to impossible in trains and the Metro. Suburban trains must also look at queue control and restricted access, Ponkshe said. “One thing that can be done across transit modes is to issue only 50% tickets. Railways will have to increase security to adhere to queue control and restricted access,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-post-lockdown-transit-plan-trains-should-be-restarted-last-experts/story-Q1TTp6O8eGAbYggF4XplrM.html
26-04-2020||Mumbai||MVA, BJP tussle over legislature seat for Uddhav Thackeray||Amidst the state’s Covid-19 crisis, a bitter tussle is on between the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the ‘delay’ by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari in accepting the state cabinet’s recommendation to nominate chief minister Uddhav Thackeray as a member of the Legislative Council (MLC).Thackeray will have to resign if he does not become a member of the state legislature by May 28. MVA leaders suspect a political conspiracy in Koshyari’s delay as the cabinet had sent its recommendation more than two weeks ago. While the Shiv Sena is building pressure on Koshyari, Thackeray urged politicians on Sunday not to play dirty politics in the current situation. The BJP hit back saying that the Sena should stop blaming it for its problems.“I am keeping politics aside. Power comes and goes. Nobody should resort to dirty politics. This is not the time for politics. There are lives at stake,” said Thackeray, as he addressed people through social media.He also lauded Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari for his advice to Maharashtra’s politicians to stand behind the state government in this time of crisis.“I thank Nitinji Gadkari for appealing to everybody to keep politics aside and support the state government in its battle against the coronavirus,” Thackeray said.Leaders of Shiv Sena as well as the other two parties of the MVA – Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) – are not sure whether the Governor will approve Thackeray’s nomination in time. This would mean the Shiv Sena leader may have to resign by May 28 since the Constitutional provision makes it mandatory for a minister or CM to be elected to the state legislature within six months of his swearing-in. Thackeray was not a member of the Legislature when he took oath as CM on November 28 after he decided to snap ties with pre-election ally BJP and joined forces with Congress-NCP after last year’s Assembly elections.“We suspect the Center wants to impose President’s Rule in the state. If Thackeray is not nominated by Governor, he would have to resign. The Governor may recommend President’s Rule if we insist on Thackeray again swearing-in as chief minister,” said a key MVA leader who did not wish to be named.Thackeray had planned to contest a by-election to the Legislative Council that was scheduled in April but was postponed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. As such, the cabinet on April 9 recommended that he be nominated to the Council on one of the two vacant slots under the Governor’s quota. The state cabinet wants Koshyari to consider Thackeray as a special case given the health crisis.Maharashtra revenue minister and state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat, said, “The confusion should be ended by the Governor. We trust him not to let uncertainty prevail in the middle of an emergency situation.”Senior BJP leader Ashish Shelar said the Sena should stop blaming others for its problems.“Getting Thackeray elected to the Legislature is the responsibility of the ruling party and not the Opposition. Why didn’t he opt to contest the election for the Yavatmal Council seat earlier this year? Why did his partner, the NCP, not include his name when it made the government recommend its two members for the Council? Further, why didn’t the Sena ask one of its legislators to resign so that Thackeray could contest the election,” asked Shelar. He added that the Governor would consider the constitutional provisions and accordingly take a decision.He also remarked that Thackeray should tell people why he is not taking opposition leaders into confidence regarding measures adopted to handle the Covid-19 outbreak instead of accusing others of playing dirty politics.Political analyst Pratap Asbe said, “Thackeray would have expressed his unhappiness because he is not happy with the way his government is being attacked by the BJP in the state. As long as Thackeray’s nomination to the legislature is concerned, the decision of the state cabinet is binding on the Governor. Still, if he chooses not to accept it, there could be a political crisis in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mva-bjp-tussle-over-mlc-seat-for-uddhav-thackeray/story-6Uwjz0gshOV4SSyv3rrq4J.html

I go around each area to water the saplings. The police allow me to go when I tell them about the newly planted saplings,” said Gupta.He started planting saplings in 2016. “My aim is to increase the number trees in the city. Citizens and nature lovers have joined the plantation drive. As we got a good response and donations, we started Sadbhavna Hara-Bhara Foundation,” said Gupta.Through the foundation, Gupta is now helping the underprivileged auto drivers with food and ration.“We will also start distributing food to labourers and migrants in Thane,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-auto-driver-provides-ration-to-needy-families/story-SgwCDZSQwlyCnHJ6j99ZDI.html

No one was injured in the fire, which was put out by the fired department officials in a 70-minute operation. Fire department officials said they received a call about the fire at 1.50pm. Two fire tenders were sent from the Sector 37 fire brigade, located less than two kilometres from the spot.IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer, said that the fire took place at a manufacturing unit of Mirah Belle Naturals. He said that the company was primarily manufacturing hand sanitisers, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He said that the company workers had an off on Sunday, and nobody was present inside the building during the fire. “The security guards of the company informed us about the fire. Fortunately, we were able to contain the fire in the basement of the two-storey building and prevent it from spreading to the two floors above, where highly flammable chemicals used in the manufacturing of hand sanitisers were stored,” said Kashyap.Heavy smoke emission from the building caused a slight panic in the industrial area, initially, especially among workers staying in the vicinity, said officials.Kashyap said that it took fire department officials around 30 minutes to control the fire and by 3pm it was completely doused. Items used in packaging hand sanitisers, furniture, and large electrical appliances were gutted in the incident.Officials said that the company had a valid no-objection certificate from the fire department.“The fire was caused by a short circuit and there was limited damage due to it. The company is closed for operations on Sunday. We had called the fire department who quickly doused the fire,” said Shivani Kapur, owner of Mirah Belle Naturals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fire-at-hand-sanitiser-production-unit-in-sec-37-no-injuries/story-nE3VKwOpbmPnn6fn8jGoUL.html
26-04-2020||City||Over 600 migrant workers leave for their homes in western UP||Gurugram: More than 600 migrant workers, who were staying at different shelter homes in the city due to the lockdown, left for their home districts in western Uttar Pradesh on Sunday morning aboard 19 buses arranged by the Haryana government.The migrant workers were stopped by the police in the last week of March, while they were walking to their hometowns in UP, on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway, NH-8 and along the Delhi-Jaipur railway line, said a spokesperson for the district administration.Anu Sheokand, general manager, Haryana Roadways, said that these workers left for UP around 6.30am on Sunday. “We had received directions from head office in Chandigarh that arrangements had to be made for transport of these migrant workers to their state. Nineteen buses were made available to the district administration. It was ensured that all norms of social distancing were followed while sending them,” she said.The 634 workers, who left from Gurugram, are from Shamli, Mathura, Baghpat, Bulandshahr and Saharanpur districts of western UP, the spokesperson said, adding that they boarded Haryana Roadways buses that would drop them in their respective districts.According to the officials, some workers from Uttarakhand and Punjab stuck in Faridabad were also sent through the state-run buses from there. Around 950 workers, including 634, were lodged at shelter homes set up in the two cities. The remaining workers will continue to stay in the shelter homes as they have been living and working in the city for the past several years and went there due to lack of food or money, the spokesperson added.Naveen Dahiya, MCG councillor from ward number 12, who worked with the district administration in repatriation of stuck workers, said that 47 migrant workers had been found walking on the railway line around March 20 and were brought to community centres at Dhanwapur and Basai. “These workers were kept in quarantine. We made food and other essential items available to them. Today, they were able to get a bus to reach their villages in other states,” he said.Prior to their journey, a health check-up of these workers was done at the shelter homes and it was ensured that none of them suffered from any flu-like illness. Temperature of the workers was also checked and they were asked to wear masks compulsorily, said Dahiya.The migrants, who boarded the buses, also heaved a sigh of relief as most of them were short on money, and wanted to go back to their homes.Ali Jaan, who worked as plumber in Gurugram, lost his job during the lockdown period. He, along with his friends, decided to walk from Gurugram till Allahabad on March 28 only to be found by the Gurugram police who brought him to a shelter home in Sector 31. “I was crying in my rented accommodation as there was no food. Then I, along with friends, decided to walk down to my native place with no money in my pocket, but the police personnel brought us to a shelter home in Sector 31,” said Jaan. The 20-year-old said that he only wanted to reach home and didn’t think that he would ever come back. “My mother started crying when I had called her. I only want to be with my family,” added Jaan.Like Jaan, Asgar Ali, who stayed in Badshahpur, said that he could finally get a bus home. “I was determined to go back home after the lockdown period. Had the authorities not provided the bus service, I would have walked all the way till Allahabad,” said Ali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-600-migrant-workers-leave-for-their-homes-in-western-up/story-FFuU4fIY16XjXaZmow6sZN.html
26-04-2020||Delhi||Delivery boy arrested for stealing mobile, laptop from advocate’s house||A 21-year-old delivery agent with a food delivery app first offered a lift to a stranded advocate during the lockdown, won his trust and then stole cash, a laptop and a mobile phone from his home in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar, the police said on Sunday, after arresting the suspect.The suspect, Tushar Sansanwal, is a resident of Katwariya Sarai and was associated with the food delivery app as a rider.Earlier this month, Sansanwal had come across an advocate returning from Saket Court. “The advocate was stranded on the road without any transport, when he spotted Sansanwal riding a scooter. Since Sansanwal had a permit to ply on the road, he offered to drop the advocate back to his home in Malviya Nagar,” said a senior investigator. When they reached the advocate’s home in Malviya Nagar, the delivery agent shared his phone number with the lawyer and offered to help him if he needed anything during the lockdown. “Over the next few days, the delivery agent received multiple calls from the advocate and went to deliver several household commodities to his home,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (South). During one such visit on April 18, Sansanwal requested the advocate for a glass of water. “As the advocate went into the kitchen to get water, Sansanwal escaped with the man’s laptop, mobile phone and Rs 500 cash,” said the DCP. The advocate, after finding his belongings missing, contacted the police who registered a case and began tracking Sansanwal using his phone number. The suspect was finally caught on Saturday, based on his phone location. Police said the stolen mobile phone and laptop have been recovered and Sansanwal sent to judicial custody. “His brother too has a robbery case against him,” said another officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delivery-boy-arrested-for-stealing-mobile-laptop-from-advocate-s-house/story-BDuEsDnvULWMyLdqACArYP.html

26-04-2020||Gurugram||Beyond classes: Teachers make individual calls, cheer up students||With schools across the country closed in the wake of the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), children are keeping up with their lessons through online classes and remotely delivered assignments. While technology is allowing them to virtually connect with classmates and teachers, schools are also taking cognisance of the lockdown’s possible fallout on the students’ mental well being.To provide students with a stress-free learning experience, several private schools across the city are taking steps to ensure that children are not overwhelmed by remote classes and schedules.Parents of the students of Delhi Public School, Sector 45, were surprised when they received a video featuring the school’s principal and headmistresses dancing to songs while doing household chores, such as sweeping and cleaning. The video, they said, brought a smile to their children’s faces.Aditi Misra, principal of the school, said that the idea behind the video was to make children laugh at a time when they have been away from physical classrooms for over a month due to the unprecedented circumstances.“During the third week of the lockdown, students sounded low while attending one of the online classes. When I asked why, one of them said that they wanted schools to reopen soon. I realised that it was important to cheer students up, especially since there was no certainty around the resumption of offline classes any time soon,” Misra, who reached out to the school’s leadership team and headmistresses soon after, said. “We put together this video of us dancing and doing chores. The idea was to send out the message that household work is dignified work as well as make people smile. The video got a good response from parents too,” Misra said. The school has also asked children to share videos of them dancing, acting, and doing other activities, which are being collated on the school portal.Besides the video that was shared by the principal, teachers from the school have also been calling students individually to keep tabs on them. Komal Lalwani, a parent, said that teachers were making sure that parents and students didn’t worry too much about monthly tests or other issues. “Teachers are calling us and asking what the children have been up to at home. They ask us to send pictures and videos and keep motivating us. There is dialogue beyond academics,” Lalwani said.Amity International School, Sector 43, has pooled in resources with Amity University for a 24*7 helpline, where problems shared by children are recorded and responded to. “Sometimes, there’s a live exchange when a counsellor is available to talk. If not, someone calls the student back to discuss issues they want to share,” said Arora.She said that children, like everyone else, were experiencing emotional and mental pressures due to the lockdown situation. “Children, too, are used to their safe spaces, places where they can go out and interact with others their age, something that has not been happening since the lockdown began. They are learning to cope with the changed realities,” Arora said, adding that the school was continuously writing to parents and students to ensure that they can make sense of the situation.She said that psychologists were conducting regular counselling sessions for students in senior classes, while counselling had been integrated into value education classes for students in the junior wing. “Regular classes are conducted for students in the senior wing. Besides, the psychologist also pitches in with talks for the middle school. For junior students, the school has integrated counselling in the value education classes,” Arora said.Sonal Kaushik, whose son is a Class 9 student at Manav Rachna International School, Sector 46, said that the school had conducted a counselling session with students this week where issues related to stress and ways of dealing with it were discussed. “Insights on mediation and other processes that can help maintain composure were shared during the class. Children are beginning to miss school, their routine and their friends now. As parents, we are keeping calm and encouraging our son to do the same,” Kaushik same.At Heritage Xperiential Learning School, besides the daily check-ins during classes, school teachers have been calling students individually to ensure their well being during this difficult time, Vishnu Karthik, director, Heritage Group of Schools, said. Teachers at the school also held virtual assemblies and end-of-year closures for students to ensure that they were not deprived of meaningful experiences.Jyoti Raghavan, whose children study in two different private schools, said that both her daughters had been missing school a lot. “I had never thought that I would hear my children talk about going back to school. They are missing their friends, teachers and the environment. They are missing the routine of waking up in the morning and rushing to school,” Raghavan said. She said that while there was a difference in seeing each other onscreen and being with each other in person, children were using technology for staying in touch with their peers as a coping mechanism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/beyond-classes-teachers-make-individual-calls-cheer-up-students/story-HoPYwawqTvEuURHcE0EquN.html
26-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police starts 24x7 helpline for its personnel||The Mumbai Police have started a 24/7 Covid-19 helpline number — 9137777100 — for police personnel after a police constable died due to the disease on Saturday. The helpline, operating from the city police headquarters, was needed as a second death and 50 more cases were reported from across the city till Sunday with several instances of infected personnel being denied admission in public hospitals.

26-04-2020||Gurugram||Ramprastha City residents stand together amid the lockdown||Residents of Ramprastha City in Sector 37D had much to worry when the nationwide lockdown for containing the spread of the coronavirus disease came into force. With restrictions on people’s movement, the supply of essential items became a major concern for more than 800 families that live in the condominium as there is no grocery store within the society complex or in its vicinity. Residents usually depend on the Sector 10 market or markets at Sohna Road, which are around 5-10 kilometre away from the complex.In order to resolve the crisis, residents joined their hands, and with some support from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) came up with a temporary solution to end all woes. While initially, an MCG food truck would supply essential goods to the residents at a gap of four days, a temporary store was set up in the under-construction market area within the complex after the lockdown was extended till May 3. MCG vendors now operate from the store that runs from 8am in the morning till 1pm in the afternoon, catering to the various needs of the residents.“When the lockdown started, everyone was very worried. Keeping aside all differences, the builder, management, and residents came together to work out a solution. Initially, the MCG’s food truck used to supply essentials every four days. Since the past two weeks, MCG vendors have started operating from a makeshift shop within the complex on a daily basis,” said Pradip Rahi, president of the society’s resident welfare association. A list of prices of essential items such as fruits and vegetables sold at the store is sent by the MCG every day.Similarly, at the behest of the district administration, mobile ATM vans visit the complex once in a week to let residents withdraw cash. The facility was much needed as the nearest ATM is more than four kilometres away from the complex, and residents struggled had to face a shortage of cash in the early days of the lockdownIn view of the lockdown, the apartment has cut down the strength of its non-essential staff and provided rest of the staff members with boarding and lodging facilities within the flat to minimise their exposure with the outside world.“On normal days, the maintenance team has a strength of over 100 people, but we are managing with 50 people currently. While those who live alone are sharing a room with another person, workers with families have been given separate flats. Residents contributed towards a common fund which is being utilised for providing rations to the workers,” said Rahi.The condominium has barred the entry of part-time workers such as domestic helpers, cooks, drivers, and car cleaners. Food delivery agents, meanwhile, are allowed until the society’s entrance and residents are required to collect their orders from the entrance. All delivery agents are thermally scanned and are required to use sanitisers and wear face masks. Since the lockdown started, the condominium has been maintaining a record of people moving in and out of the society. Domestic helpers were called in batches in the first week of April and paid for the month. “We called domestic workers in small batches and gave them ration along with their salary. All residents were advised to pay salaries so that workers can survive the pandemic,” said Rahi.To ensure that physical distancing is followed at all times in the society, circles have been marked outside the makeshift shop. “Residents have been told to stay at an arm’s distance from each other, while they queue for purchasing essential items. The markings have been drawn 2 metres apart,” said Rahi. Guards have also been deputed near the shop and the entrance to ensure that the people abide by physical distancing rules. Three resident volunteers also keep a tab to ensure physical distancing norms are followed during the shopping hours.The condominium has also created a network of volunteers to take care of needs of all senior citizens, and helping them with medicines and other essential items. “Senior citizens and families with kids (younger than 3 years) in the complex were identified by the management. Members of the RWA interacted with these residents and asked them to reach out to volunteers whenever they needed help,” said Rahi.Ranjay Kumar Singh, a resident of the society, said people had been helping each other out and ensuring that everyone abides by the lockdown rules. “There were hiccups initially, but people dealt with the circumstances by coming together. Most people are staying inside their apartments. If we come across people venturing out or getting worried due to the situation, we talk to them and advise them in the best possible manner,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ramprastha-city-residents-stand-together-amid-the-lockdown/story-ac2OgDcNizCaEyLEC3zPqL.html
26-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Hospital transmission a major concern; new epicentres and hotspots emerge||There has been a steady growth in the number of hotspots and epicentres in different localities of Ghaziabad ever since the outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was first reported in the district. The health department officials have now raised concerns that such cases will continue to rise and there is a risk of community transmission if the disease is not controlled in a timely manner.The Ghaziabad district at present has 17 hotspots, which include nine in the red zone (areas where new cases have been found in the past 14 days), five in the orange zone (areas where no fresh cases have been found in the past 14 days) and three in the green zone (where no fresh cases have been reported in the past 28 days since the time the last Covid-19 positive case came to light).The recently added hotspots in the district include Indirapuram, Khoda and Islam Nagar, along with Loni and Vaishali in the red zone. Medical transmission in the district“At present, the major concern is that infections are being contracted at the hospitals and healthcare workers are being infected by the patients. This may lead to community transmission if the spread of the disease is not controlled in a timely manner,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer(CMO).“Initially, most of the cases related to foreign travel and those who attended religious congregations. Such areas included Masuri, Pasonda etc. Now, the cases are being reported from areas, such as Indirpauram, Vaishali etc. We are also keeping a close watch on cases emerging from Khoda, Loni and Kaila Bhatta as these are densely populated regions,” Dr Gupta added.A number of cases related to hospital transmission have emerged after two resident doctors of Max Hospital were tested positive, although both later recovered. A 71-year-old man from Niho Scottish Garden in Indirapuram was reported to be positive, while a woman patient from ATS Advantage was also found to be infected. She was, however, later declared negative. Similarly, another woman doctor working at a hospital in Delhi was found to be positive for Covid-19 on Saturday while a 40-year-old woman from Vaishali, with comorbidities, also tested positive for the infection. Another 40 year old woman from Loni, who was undergoing cancer treatment in Delhi, tested positive for Covid-19 and was shifted to Meerut Medical College during the early hours on Sunday, the officials said.Hotspots and epicentresThe number of hotspots in the district has increased to 27 and includes 14 in the red zone. These areas include residential apartments or colonies, such as ATS Advantage, Niho Scottish Garden, Exotica Elegance in Indirapuram, sectors 1 and 5 in Vaishali, Hayat Nagar in Khoda, parts of Kaila Bhatta, and Islam Nagar, among others.“On Sunday evening, we came to know of two more suspected cases pertaining to a doctor couple. We have informed the district officials to verify the cases. Several cases of medical transmission now emerging. To deal with the situation, we will be issuing advisory to all our member high-rises to reveal the names of healthcare professionals, who need to be in active and passive quarantine while at work and should therefore avoid their stay at high-rises,” said Alok Kumar, founder-member of the federation of association of apartment owners.According to officials, an area is demarcated as a hotspot if a Covid-19 positive case is reported from that area. The radius of one kilometre is identified as its containment zone and a 2km outer area is defined as the buffer zone. In case, the hotspot has more than one case, then a 3km area is identified as the containment zone, while a further 2km area further falls under the buffer zone.If further cases emerge from within a 3km or 5km radius of the hotspot, then the area is defined as the epicentre and is sealed as per the norms, officials added.In order to prevent medical infection, the Uttar Pradesh government has decided to form district level committees, which will include officials of the health department, along with one officer from the pollution control board.“The emphasis now is to prevent medical infection. The chief minister has directed that doctors and healthcare professionals should be provided with PPE kits and N95 masks. Further, regular sanitisation of hospitals should be taken up. Dedicated teams have been formed in every district and will be working to stop such infections. The directions have also been given for safe disposal of biomedical waste,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-hospital-transmission-a-major-concern-new-epicentres-and-hotspots-emerge/story-aGh3vFPOGQoj4ZBdeHRDjI.html
26-04-2020||Mumbai||Farm-to-home: The new go-to for Mumbai||After more than a decade since the state government started ushering in reforms in the agriculture marketing sector, the Covid-19 lockdown has finally made way for farm-to-home concept to take off with more and more farmer companies and groups supplying produce directly to the doorsteps of Mumbaiites. In the six years that Arjun Mohan, a farmer and founder of Yashwant Essential Farmers Group, started supplying vegetables and fruits directly from farms in Nasik to the doorsteps of Mumbaiites, his regular customer base could grow only up to 1,000 families.However, over the last month, the farmers group has been supplying produce to more than 50 housing societies across Thane, Kalyan, Powai, Vikroli and Vile Parle. They make four trips weekly to Nasik to Mumbai to supply pre-ordered vegetables directly to housing societies; they do not accept orders from less than 50 families at a time.Currently, 350 to 400 farmer companies and groups across the state have started supplying vegetables and fruits directly to housing societies and consumers in metros like Mumbai, Pune and Nasik.The lockdown has increased demand for direct supply of farm produce to consumers while selling the produce at wholesale markets has become more tedious and complicated for farmers.“The lockdown has enabled farmer companies and groups to set up and formalise supply chains, which we hope will last even after this. Maharashtra has nearly 3,000 odd farmer producer companies, and currently 350 to 400 of them are actively engaged in marketing produce directly. The supply is going largely to big cities like Mumbai, Pune but also at a local level in Nasik, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad and Nagpur,” said Sunil Pawar, managing director of Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board.He said, “Farmers have linked up with customers through online registrations and mobile apps. We have also restarted 150 weekly farmers’ markets in both Mumbai and Pune by offering them space in each ward.”Mohan and his wife Gayatri, a business graduate who left her job to implement the farm-to-home concept, have walked a long road to make their business work. They managed to start their business and run it, but their customer base has suddenly mushroomed since the lockdown.“We would supply to four to five families each in around 30+ housing societies from Badlapur to Colaba. Now, we are supplying to all the residents at more than 50 housing societies. And we do not take orders for less than 50 families. Along the way, we are also learning to be more professional; such as replacing vegetables if there are complaints, better packaging and transport etc,” said Mohan. He said their customer base increased solely through word of mouth.Greenfield Agro Services, another farm producer company set up in 2012, which sources produce from more than 1,300 farmers, also supplies pre-ordered vegetables, fruits and now even groceries from Nasik to Thane.“The lockdown has led to a collapse of APMC markets and provided a much-needed scope for farmers to sell produce directly. We are currently supplying 3 tonnes of produce daily to housing societies in Thane. However, if the authorities set up a nodal desk or depute officer to deal with our issues, there is much more potential for farmers group to reach out to urban customers,” said Amol Gorhe, the owner.The first wave of marketing reforms in the state began in 2006 when the state adopted the model APMC Act, thus paving way for farmers markets, contract farming ventures. Around 10 years after this, in 2016 the former Fadnavis government amended the act to allow sale of vegetables and fruits outside APMC markets.However, the groups are of the view that the pandemic gave the farm-to-home marketing its real break.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/farm-to-home-the-new-go-to-for-mumbai/story-sP9pXqBJ0GzKYPQiLMoj6I.html
26-04-2020||City||Pension at doorstep: Anxious of Covid infection, beneficiaries in Ludhiana turning away postmen||Despite the department of posts taking precautions while delivering pension at doorsteps, beneficiaries in the district are refusing to give their thumb impressions for biometric verification to avoid catching coronavirus infection.Postmen in different areas of the district have complained to the department that pensioners instead wish to withdraw the cash from ATMs and turn them away. Thumb impression is requisite for verifying the authenticity of a beneficiary before making the transaction through Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS). AEPS is a system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India that allows people to carry out financial transactions on a micro-ATM by furnishing their Aadhaar number and verifying it with the help of their fingerprint/iris scan. Karamjit Singh, a postman working with Focal Point branch, said, “Many pensioners have told me they will withdraw the amount from their bank ATMs. Some have already withdrawn their pensions, and since we don’t have the calibrated data, we still need to visit every house.” “We use the masks and sanitisers provided to us by the department during our field visits, but it’s the beneficiaries’ will if they want to avail of our services or not,” he said.The department had started door-to-door distribution of pension in the first week of April to avoid financial difficulties to pensioners. UNNECESSARY QUERIES BURDENING SERVERThe residents are also inquiring about their bank balance, putting extra burden on the postal department servers. There are around 2.13 lakh pension beneficiaries in the district. Last month, the department had issued helpline number 0161-2772488 for people who wish to get their money from the bank accounts at their doorsteps. The requested amount, however, cannot exceed Rs 10,000 at once.OTHER DOOR-TO-DOOR SERVICESMeanwhile, the postal department is also delivering cash, medicine parcels, registered posts and essential items to the residents. Ludhiana senior superintendent of post office Amanpreet Singh said, “While the department is dedicated to the service of the masses in these difficult times, we request people to avoid calling about their balance, since it burdens the server used across the nation,” he said. “This leads to various kinds of technical glitches, delaying transactions. We have issued similar instructions to our postmen,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pension-at-doorstep-anxious-of-covid-infection-beneficiaries-turning-away-postmen/story-nGa0pcYpFL32MOTse2B59H.html

They also rued about the lack of security and social distancing at the premises.The college has over 109 resident doctors, who are posted in both Covid and non-Covid hospitals in the city.Dr. Atul Khadke, vice president of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors, said, “The doctors have to depend on one canteen in the premises, which is closed on Sundays. With outside eateries closed and unsafe during the lockdown, they have to suffer. Moreover, on regular days the canteen opens at 10 am, by then most doctors have left for work.”He added that the association has written to the administration to arrange food for them. They also claimed that doctors’ safety is being sidelined.A resident doctor, on the condition of anonymity, said “Some doctors in our college work at Covid, while others at non-Covid hospitals. However, both these doctors have to share the same room, thus, no social distancing or isolation norms are being followed. The administration must allot separate rooms for doctors to control the spread of the virus.”He added that quarantine norms are also not being followed. “When any resident doctor comes in contact with a patient, he will be subjected to a swab test and once the test is negative, will be asked to join work in a day or two. The 14-day quarantine norm is not followed,” he said. Rajendra Ahivar, additional municipal commissioner, TMC said the corporation will ensure that no inconvenience is faced by medical professionals.“We have provided proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to all doctors working in isolation wards and quarantine institutions. However, if they want us to separate the doctors working in Covid and non-Covid hospitals, that rearrangement can be done at the hostel,” he said.Ahivar added that he was informed about the food problem on Sunday morning. “I came to know that the resident doctors are facing food problem on Sundays and public holidays. I have immediately asked the dean to make an alternate arrangement. We will ensure that the canteen either remains open on Sundays or food is provided in case the canteen is closed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-food-social-distancing-or-security-thane-resident-docs/story-qm3CIYDIsHLIma5qw9nOKL.html

26-04-2020||Chandigarh||A month without work, 27,000 poor Chandigarh families await promised ration under PM scheme||Even as lockdown enters its second month, not all poor families have received the promised food grains and pulses under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKA) in Chandigarh. UT officials said it will take another ten days for every household under the scheme to get its share of ration. As part of the ₹1.70 lakh crore relief package, the central government announced free food grains and cash to women, poor senior citizens and farmers to ease their hardships during the lockdown.Under the PMGKAY, the poor will get 5 kg wheat per head per month, and 1 kg pulses per family per month for the months of April, May and June.Till Sunday, of the approximate 64,000 families eligible for getting food grains under the scheme, Chandigarh administration has been able to deliver dry ration to around 36,600 households. About 156 families under Antyodaya (AAY) and 63,457 priority households (PHH) will be covered under the scheme and more than 2.75 lakh persons are likely to benefit therein. Under AAY, the poorest among the below poverty line (BPL) families have been selected and issued AAY ration cards. Under the PHH, really poor and vulnerable sections of society such as landless labourers, marginal farmers and wage earners of informal sections of the economy are covered. The administration identifies such families on the basis of set parameters.Curfew in the UT was imposed on March 24, while it was designated as a red zone on April 15.Most of these families are daily wage earners who have no source of income during the curfew. In the absence of government ration, these families are depending on charities for their food. Cart vendor Prem Shankar Shah of Sector 49 said, “I am a yellow ration card holder. We are six in my family. I transport goods, malba in my rehri. Since the curfew put an end to work, we are struggling to meet our daily needs of food. The longer the delay in giving us ration, the tougher it becomes to feed our children.”Even though ration was distributed in his area, Shah said he didn’t get any. “We went to the place where ration was being distributed but we didn’t get any despite requests.”Secretary of food supplies, Vinod P Kavle, said the administration shares the concern of the people in the matter. “We are expediting the process of delivery of ration to households under the scheme. Meanwhile, we are also providing cooked food and are seeking cooperation from the public in the matter.”Adding that most states are distributing ration till June, Kavle said, “We have clubbed the distribution and are distributing it all at one go.”When asked by what time the administration would complete the exercise, Kavle said, “We expect to complete distribution in another ten days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/a-month-without-work-27-000-poor-chandigarh-families-await-promised-ration-under-pm-scheme/story-tHLl37gCyQeWdHhZfIu60N.html

It will be constructed as part of the Bharatmala project.As per the website http://environmentclearance.nic.in of the Union ministry, Amritsar district is not part of execution of the project, which means the expressway bypasses the district in the alignment proposed for it.Taking serious note of this development, Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla on Sunday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, raising concern of the drastic change in the mega project.Observing that the entire Amritsar district is missing from the alignment of the expressway, he said, “I request you on behalf of all the residents, business owners, pilgrims and transporters connected with Amritsar to reconsider this project and make necessary amendments to reconnect Amritsar with the said highway”.Former BJP state president and Rajya Sabha MP Shwait Malik said, “I have also written to Union road and transport minister Nitin Gadkari to include Amritsar again in the project”.However, he blamed the Capt Amarinder Singh government in Punjab for exclusion of Amritsar. “I am sure the conspiracies of the Congress government led to the exclusion of Amritsar from the project”.Kulwant Singh Ankhi, patron of Amritsar Vikas Manch (AVM), a local NGO, said, “Along with Amritsar, residents of Tarn Taran district are also pained as they feel cheated at the hands of higher authorities of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amritsar-excluded-from-rs-60-000-crore-delhi-amritsar-katra-expressway-project/story-UhoXln2PvVH4Yk91vpcbmN.html

Data with the Northern grid shows that the daily average power consumption of the state was 730 lakh units, against the consumption of 1,210 lakh units last year.“Due to lockdown and curfew, demand has nosedived in the entire country and PSPCL is also suffering. We have sold only 60% of what we sold during this period last year. Usually every year, there is a load increase of 10% every month after February. It hasn’t happened this year,” said a PSPCL official.He added that during discussion with industry, it was almost a given that it cannot run to full capacity in the near-term, as labour and raw material supply chain was missing.“Not only industry, even domestic demand has dipped as consumers are not using air conditioners yet, due to the covid-19 pandemic. We also anticipate 20% lower demand from cinema halls, malls, big hotels, restaurants and commercial joints, as these will not operate to their capacity.”The collection figure during the lockdown till April 22 shows that PSPCL got Rs 650 crore in its kitty, a fall of 54% over last year’s Rs 1,407 crore. Of the Rs 650 crore, Rs 60 crore is advance payment from industrialists upon which the PSPCL is to pay 12% interest. Due to the curfew, just few consumers have paid up and that too only online. PSPCL chief managing director Baldev Singh Sran said, “The government has been apprised of the financial condition of the PSPCL. The CM has also written to the Centre, asking for a package to help power corporations. Things will improve once the lockdown ends.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pspcl-battles-40-dip-in-demand-54-fall-in-revenue/story-eK6XPAHOiTeJ1r6gKYMlPL.html

The move was widely criticised by students of the varsity. The university said hostel wardens will take care of keeping the belongings of students safe. “Once the two hostels are handed over to UT administration, no student will be allowed to enter,” an official spokesperson of PU said. A day after Parida’s tweet, the number of students visiting hostels to collect their belongings saw a steep decline. After 350 students visited the varsity on Saturday, only 45 turned up on Sunday, officials said.National Students Union of India’s PU president Nikhil Narmeta said, “We are not opposing the move, but it should have been done more systematically.

A farmer Harmel Singh of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Ugrahan said, “Even as the turn of our curfew pass comes, we have to wait due to this.”So far, the district has procured 4.6 lakh tonne of crop, of which 1.78 lakh has been lifted. An agent at the Nabha grain market Nitish Goyal claimed, “Officials tell us that gunny bags are in short supply and play favourites.” “There is no shortage of sacks, but distribution has been rationalised as per passes. There is shortage of labour, so the lifting is slow,” said Patiala district food and civil supplies controller (DFSC) Harsharanjit Singh In Bathinda district, rain and hailstorm were witnessed in many villages in Rampura Phul on Sunday, adding to the woes of farmers who are engaged in harvesting of wheat.

26-04-2020||City||Guest Column: Reflections of a Covid-19 survivor||As someone who has suffered from and survived Covid-19 and after reading up extensively on it, I think there is no need to panic. Consider these thoughts of a layman, who is not a doctor, scientist, economist or an expert in financial matters.This disease is not the monster it’s made out to be and is a lot like any other virus, but only with a very aggressive spreading rate (highly contagious); and in some cases, the potentially deadly Covid pneumonia.Everyone will get this disease. It normally will not kill if you are proactive when you feel unwell by starting to monitor the symptoms, keep a check on some health parameters and take timely treatment. The two most important checks to be done are for fever and oxygenation (oxygen saturation in the lungs) using a thermometer and pulse oximeter. Both give immediate readouts. Fever means you are fighting some infection in your body and fall in oxygen saturation percentage indicates there is infection in the lungs preventing them from functioning normally. Oxygen saturation of a normal person is between 94% and 100% (smokers, people with asthma or damaged lungs or any other ailment are likely to have a lower oxygen saturation level).NEGLECT COULD KILLThe killer (or the ‘silent killer’) in this disease is Covid pneumonia, which is different from regular pneumonia with chest discomfort and breathing problems.Covid pneumonia starts silently and the person feels no chest/respiratory discomfort, pain or shortness of breath. There are absolutely no signs or sensation of breathing problems, but it can initially cause a form of oxygen deprivation – a ‘silent hypoxia,’ which is hard to detect.Respiratory discomfort is felt when the oxygen levels become alarmingly low and moderate to severe pneumonia sets in (50% oxygen saturation). This is a critical condition and develops into ‘acute hypoxia,’ for which the person has to be put on a respirator/ventilator. At this stage, chances of respiratory failure and multiple organ failure are high due to lack of oxygen causing death. This Covid pneumonia takes about two weeks to develop and reach a dangerous stage. Initial start might be slow, but later progression into acute hypoxia stage is fast.Only about 35% of the people who get Covid-19 get the Covid pneumonia, of which about 25% cases, like I have, recover as the pneumonia is detected at an early stage. About 8% to 10% go on to the ventilator of which about 3% die.WHAT TO EXPECTSPREAD: Covid-19 is very aggressive and spreads quickly. Everyone’s likely to get it unless we get a vaccine (which is not going to happen soon, the earliest being a year). Lockdown, isolation, personal protective equipment (PPE) and other preventive measures are only going to buy time for our countries/states to be better prepared to fight the pandemic and to some extent reduce stress on our hospitals and medical care systems.SYMPTOMS: From none to varied, with cough, cold, headache, bodyache, shortness of breath, fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, loss of taste and smell, diarrhoea, stiffness or stretched feeling around your chest and back. Some don’t feel unwell at all (and develop antibodies). Duration varies too with one feeling feverish for half a day and recovering and another for three to four days and yet another for two to five weeks. Some, unfortunately, do not survive.TESTING: The most common swab test is useless for the following reasons:1) It’s not in real time and you get the results after three to four days, which could mean the difference between life and death if silent hypoxia or Covid pneumonia has set in2) Results are 70% accurate.3) Acute shortage of test kits.4) Lack of information on testing centres, both in India and abroad for people who suspect they have got Covid.5) Testing expensive for the poor.I feel using a thermometer and pulse oximeter could be a better indicator as both give immediate readouts. A CT Scan or an X-Ray of the chest will further determine infection in the lungs or Covid pneumonia.TREATMENT: Viral infections have no treatment, only therapy (therapeutic treatment). Paracetamol is administered for fever and aches, antibiotics for any infection (pneumonia) and any other medication which would help, that the doctor advises. In my case I was given hydrochloroquine whereas a friend of mine being treated in The Hague was given codeine, an opiate used to treat pain, coughing, and diarrhoea.Being healthy and having good immunity is important to fight the disease. Older people and others with medical ailments have to be more careful. To win you need to detect Covid pneumonia and nip it in the bud quickly.Educating the public about the disease is vital. They have to be made to understand the disease and its novel characteristics which differ from other viral infections. Everyone should know that sooner or later they will get it. They have to be told not to take it casually but know that it will normally not kill if they monitor the symptoms, keep a check on health parameters and take timely treatment.I recommend that people also buy a pulse oximeter and log in readings taken twice a day in a spreadsheet to detect any drop in their oxygen saturation levels.The government should also set up small camps, booths in as many localities as possible for these checks and send suspected cases for treatment.A lockdown is only good for buying time.....so once the government has control over the situation, it should be lifted and business should be allowed to run as usual to prevent an economic crisis.(The writer is an actor and a captain in the merchant navy.

26-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh school demands fee by April end; education dept seeks explanation||Ignoring directives of the education department, Moti Ram Arya School in Sector 27, Chandigarh, on Friday has asked parents of class 11 students to deposit school fees by end of April. Parents received an email from the school authorities on April 24, saying: “The provisional admission schedule to class 11 has been initiated. Parents who are willing to admit their ward in class 11 (non-medical stream) are requested to pay ₹18,140 by April 29, 2020, in the school account.”The email also says that online classes for class 11 will begin on April 30, 2020.The school is charging ₹7,695 as quarterly fees and ₹6,445 as annual charges. Additionally, admission charges of ₹3,500 were also levied on parents apart from ₹500 as refundable security. The school has fixed the total amount of fee for admission to class 11 at ₹18,140. The email also said that parents who cannot deposit the whole amount, could pay a minimum ₹11,695 at the moment, while “the rest should be deposited in the first week of June.” The email, however, stands in contradiction to the education department’s instructions to schools wherein it had directed them to defer payment of tuition fee for 2020-21 session because of the lockdown in Chandigarh. The department had said final dates for payment of fee would be announced once the lockdown is over, and parents would be given a month’s time for payment. The school principal Seema Biji said, “This circular was only for those parents who were enquiring about provisional admission to class 11, as we were also going to start online classes for them.” She also said that students of other classes “have not been asked to pay fees till further orders from the department.” Director of school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar told Hindustan Times that after seeking comments from the school about their move, it will be issued a show cause notice. Also, schools have been asked to submit their balance sheets for scrutiny before April 30 to the education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-school-demands-fee-by-april-end-education-dept-seeks-explanation/story-17nxWMAl9vEGk3ZSzcwk6L.html

26-04-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER docs monitor Covid-19 patients remotely through system built in-house||Doctors at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Chandigarh (PGIMER) have started using a system built in-house to remotely monitor their Covid-19 patients.The system collects data from multiple devices – mainly vital sign monitors – the patient is hooked up to. The information can be checked from remote locations through mobile phones or computers and doctors alerted in case of a problem.Monitoring oxygen saturation levels of Covid-19 is vital because the disease affects the lungs, says Dr GD Puri, dean (academics) and head of the anaesthesia department. In case oxygen levels drop below dangerous levels doctors will be alerted at once through any of their devices. Real time values of heart rate, blood pressure and temperature of the patient being monitored are also transmitted to remote devices.Currently patients admitted at the intensive care unit of PGIMER are being monitored by senior doctors from remote locations, either in office or at home and even during the administrative meetings. “With this system we guide the team of resident doctors, nurses and technicians who constantly monitor the patients in the units. A record of patient history is also maintained,” Dr Puri adds.The idea is to create different levels of controls using technology. “We can even monitor the patients using CCTVs. However, we do not beam it directly to our mobile phones due to privacy concerns, so we have created a base in the Covid-19 Centre for all-round monitoring.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-docs-monitor-covid-19-patients-remotely-through-system-built-in-house/story-NXPb7ILf7Lj8gfaSgcp6UN.html

26-04-2020||Chandigarh||Fear of more rain gets farmers jittery amid delayed wheat procurement in Chandigarh||Over a week after procurement of wheat was begun at the New Grain Market in Sector 39, farmers are complaining that labour trouble along with other issues posed by the epidemic is affecting procurement at the mandi this year.As per mandi officials, close to 10,000 tonne wheat had been procured by the end of April, while this year, only 4,750 tonne wheat has been procured. Surjit Singh from Mohali district said many farmers have been affected as procurement was delayed this year. He said, “There were heavier rains this April as compared to previous years and due to delays in procuring it, some of our crop was damaged. No labour was available for harvesting so the process took place at a slow pace.”Jagdeep Singh from Mohali district said due to curfew restrictions they could not get adequate number of trucks in the city to transport their wheat. “We can take only a limited amount of wheat to the mandi at one go, which puts the rest of our stock at risk. The Zirakpur and Kurali mandis are too far so I have to come to Sector 39 mandi to sell my grain,” he said.Speaking about this, mandi officials said, “This year procurement began very late and is likely to extend till the first week of May. We are hopeful a similar quantity of wheat can be procured this year too.” However, farmers are not so optimistic. They say rain has already damaged some of the crop, and if it rains again, it will be disastrous. Some are choosing to come all the way to Chandigarh due to the fewer Covid cases, such as Paramjeet Singh from Fatehgarh Sahib district. “I keep my mask on at all times and maintain distance from labourers working to offload the wheat. Chandigarh has fewer cases and screening is more thorough here so it’s a safer option,” he said.Gabbar, a daily wage labourer who stays in Mauli Jagran, said most of the workforce had left the city before the curfew, which has resulted in a shortage now. Sunil from Sector 26 said many labourers from Sector 26 were worried because a youth from Bapu Dham Colony recently tested positive. “The administration is providing us meals so some people have decided to wait till the lockdown is lifted before working,” he said.Many expressed happiness at the Sector 26 mandi getting thoroughly sanitised. Mukesh Kumar from Dadumajra said the mandi looks spotlessly clean and he hopes the practice of sanitisation will be continued. As per mandi officials about 4,750 tonne of wheat has been procured in the city till now. “Nobody is allowed to enter the mandi without being screened or without a mask. Facilities have been set up here for workers to sanitise their hands,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fear-of-more-rain-gets-farmers-jittery-amid-delayed-wheat-procurement-in-chandigarh/story-dJABpNNTiiX8ZztwvawEZJ.html

Industries in the state are battling with an acute shortage of labour after the government has been repeatedly asking them to start operations. The industrial sector in Baddi, Barotiwaala and Nalagarh in Solan district and Kalamb in Sirmaur district is the worst hit.The state government has made it mandatory that industries that have in-house arrangements for lodging of workers in order to resume functioning. Industries in Baddi, Barotiwaala and Nalagarh are mostly dependent on the migrant labourers who have returned to their native villages in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Bengal. Villagers on borders of Haryana and Punjab constitute a major workforce in Baddi and Barotiwala, while the industries in Parwanoo are dependent on the workforce from Pinjore and Kalka. The state government has sealed its border with Punjab and Haryana and those with valid permission from deputy commissioners of the respective district are allowed to travel.Colonel Shailesh Pathak, chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industries Himachal Chapter said that the HP government should allow labourers from adjoining states to travel to the state.“Big industries don’t have many problems while the smaller ones are facing the music. Big companies have in-house facilities for labourers and their workforce. Many industrial areas in the Nalagarh subdivision which also comprises Baddi and Barotiwala have been classified as red zones after six persons were found positive for Covid-19,” he said.Industrial sector performance is critical and plays a major decisive role in determining the overall growth of state output and employment through backward and forward linkages with other sectors of economy It contributes about 30% of the total gross value. There are nearly 54,310 industrial units in the state with an approximately ₹49,974 crore investment which provides employment to 4.52 lakh people.

26-04-2020||Chandigarh||11-month-old, Chandigarh’s youngest patient, checkmates Covid||Chandigarh’s youngest Covid-19 patient, an 11-month-old baby girl, has recovered. The infant and her mother were discharged from Chandigarh’s Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research on Sunday after winning a hard battle against the virus, providing a beacon of hope for recovery to others battling the epidemic.With their discharge, the number of patients declared cured and discharged from PGIMER rose to nine. Holding her daughter in her arms, the Sector 33 resident said, “No words are enough to convey my thanks to the entire PGIMER team. There were phases of hopelessness and I thought I had lost the battle. But constant medical and psychological support had me sailing through.”Director PGIMER professor Jagat Ram complimented the mother-daughter duo on their successful recovery. It was a touching scene at the hospital as the duo were given a warm send off with showering of flower petals and gifts.Speaking on the occasion, Professor Jagat Ram said, “There is always a silver lining in dark clouds. In these challenging times, the moment, when any patient is discharged after being declared Covid-19-free, is a moment of triumph and jubilation not only for the patient and his family but for the entire medical team. Today, it is all the more special because treating the virus infected baby was a mighty task for the medical team due to her tender age.”The four recovered patients discharged today were all members of one family who tested positive and were admitted in PGI on April 3. The baby girl’s father was discharged a week earlier, the mother-daughter were discharged on Sunday, while the baby’s grandmother is still in isolation, but is stable.Professor Vipin Koushal, additional medical superintendent of the dedicated Covid-19 hospital, said, “It was the perfect birthday gift for me today. It is a joy to see the young angel cured. One cannot imagine how gruelling it must have been for the little one who could not even express her pain and anguish. Although we discuss all patients and their prognosis, but the team was emotionally attached to this little girl.” Elaborating the importance of psychological intervention along with pharmacological treatment to help a patient fight the virus, Dr Swapanjit Sahu from the psychiatry department said, “Though both mother and daughter were physically stable, it was very stressful experience psychologically to stay isolated from everyone. The mother reported significant distress during her stay and was consistently counselled via video. It was tressful for her as despite her testing negative, her baby tested positive again and again. This can be disappointing for anyone but regular counselling helped her through.”Although discharged from PGI, the mother and daughter will be home quarantined for 14 days as per the standard protocol to be followed by all Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/11-month-old-chandigarh-s-youngest-patient-checkmates-covid/story-XIJjUVLDLPr1U0qcleco9H.html

With migrant labourers either having left the city or unwilling to work in this situation, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has written to the state government to allow them to get labourers from tribal areas of Wada and Mokhada.TMC claimed this would not only give employment opportunity to tribals but also resolve their woes.A civic official requesting anonymity said, “We have finished the tendering process for nullah-cleaning work. However, the contractor is facing labour crunch. We need around 6,000 people for the work. Even with usage of machines, we still need manual labourers. We have written a letter to the state government to allow us to get labourers from tribal areas of Palghar district. This will also provide employment to the tribals.”The budget for this year’s nullah-cleaning work is ₹9.50 crore and is slated to start by the end of this week with the help of machines and available manpower.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pre-monsoon-nullah-cleaning-work-in-thane-likely-to-be-hit/story-OYP0TojEdeWrkLfGkyGfPO.html

Mw can potentially decrease the cytokine storm seen in patients with Covid-19, and may thus be of potential benefit in managing these patients and decreasing mortality.“In the pre-study phase, we assessed safety of Mw in four hospitalised patients with Covid-19, and found no short-term adverse effects,” said Dr Ashok Kumar, PGIMER official spokesperson. The impact of Mw use on long term safety and efficacy will only be known after conclusion of this CSIR-supported clinical trial, which will be initiated soon at all three centres, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/too-early-to-reach-conclusion-about-leprosy-vaccine-s-clinical-trial-on-covid-19-patients-pgimer/story-GuOnSN3mIHpIFjxrRqFUIJ.html

26-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tricity to participate in indoor virtual run to raise funds for fight against Covid-19||To contribute their bit in the fight against Covid-19, the running community of Chandigarh and its satellite cities of Panchkula and Mohali — collectively known as the tricity — has come together to raise funds through an indoor virtual event. Breaking none of the lockdown rules, they will take part in the event from the confines of their homes on April 27. Of late, the tricity has seen a surge in the running community, with marathons and half-marathons being organised round the year and each witnessing hundreds of participants. For them, running has become a way of life. Since the lockdown, even while staying at home, there has been no alteration in their running routine. They are doing it in a room, on terrace or in balcony and even creating a track around the sofa and table in the living room or just running in one spot. Now, to put their zeal to some good use, Chandigarh Distance Runners — a club with over 500 active members in the tricity — is organising the ‘Run For Charity, Indoor Virtual Run’, wherein the participants will run for 30 minutes, anytime of the day, on April 27. There is a participation fee of Rs 200 per runner, and all the money collected through registration and other contributions will go towards a Covid-19 charity. For registration, you can log in to www.townscript.com/e/run-for-charity-321024.“Do you want to help the society in these difficult times, do you want to make the difference? Come join a virtual indoor short run on April 27. The funds so raised would be donated as charity to fight Covid-19. We have been running for ourselves; it’s the time to repay to society with this small contribution,” shared Ashok Giri, who is one of the founder members of Chandigarh Distance Runners, in the message circulated in the running community. “With this run, we will able to generate some funds that will be used to arrange food for the needy and simultaneously it will help to generate awareness about the healthy lifestyle. Even within the walls of our house, we can do regular workouts and sweat,” said Jaspreet Kaur, one of the core members of the running group, stressing on daily workout to boost the immune system — the key to fight Covid-19.Before taking to running in mid-2017, this mother of two had two worries — being overweight and starting the day with a pill to control her thyroid. Running helped her lose 18 kg — from 74kg to 56kg — and for the last one year, she has been able to go off thyroid medications as well. “Before the lockdown I had a thyroid test and the results were normal. Running can do wonders in our lives and I am an example,” said Jaspreet, who will be running again at her home on April 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-tricity-to-participate-in-indoor-virtual-run-to-raise-funds-for-fight-against-covid-19/story-2uAsDC4jzE20dVbvEayN3I.html

26-04-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank fraud case: CBI arrests Wadhawans from Mahabaleshwar||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Sunday arrested Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan of DHFL group, who are allegedly involved in the Yes Bank fraud, from their bungalow in Mahabaleshwar.They will be produced before a special court on Monday where CBI will seek their custody. The duo, along with their other family members, were under home quarantine for 14 days since April 23, a senior official of the agency said.The CBI had obtained an arrest warrant against the two brothers after the family was caught holidaying in Mahabaleshwar. On April 18, the brothers had obtained a stay on the execution of an arrest warrant after their lawyer pleaded that the two should not be arrested amidst the coronavirus pandemic. The special court had granted them relief and stayed the warrant. The court order protected the two from arrest till May 5.However, CBI, which was not heard while staying the warrant, approached the special court to lift the stay. The Wadhwans’ interim relief was cancelled on Saturday and a CBI team from Mumbai reached Satara early Saturday afternoon to arrest the two bothers, a senior officer of the agency said.The agency was assisted by the Satara police. The two arrested men will be brought to Mumbai, the officer said.Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh confirmed the arrests with a tweet.“A CBI team has arrested both Kapil and Dhiraj Wadhwan. Satara Police has given them all required assistance and an escort vehicle with one plus three guards up to Mumbai on a written request. The arrest procedures are going on,” Deshmukh tweeted.According to the CBI FIR, between April and June 2018, Yes Bank invested Rs3,700 crore in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). In return, the Wadhawans allegedly “paid a kickback of Rs600 crore” to Kapoor and family members in the form of loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd.The CBI had obtained a non-bailable warrant against the two on March 17 but the two men had not been arrested. On April 9, the Wadhawans, with a group of 23 people, flouted the lockdown and travelled to Mahabaleshwar from Khandala after a senior home department official gave them a free pass. They were put in quarantine once the news of their lockdown violation became public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-case-cbi-arrests-wadhawans-from-mahabaleshwar/story-aSLWGOimXGmTrS2PWh6ZIN.html

All those who have offices in Gurgaon should continue to work from home to the extent possible,” Kundu told PTI. Kundu, who is in charge of handling the COVID-19 crisis for Gurgaon district, said it is advisable that companies should ensure that as many employees as possible work from home.This might not be possible in the case of industries and the manufacturing sector but should be followed wherever possible, he added.Kundu said few construction sites at GMDA and NHAI projects have been allowed to resume work within the norms of social distancing. “Construction sites where labourers are already staying on the site or those where labourers stay within walking distance are allowed to resume work while adhering to social distancing norms,” he said. Such is the nature of the coronavirus pandemic that no one knows “when we will go back to previous normal”, the GMDA CEO said.“You may have to go to a new normal,” he added.Besides being a corporate hub, Gurgaon is also a hub for the automobile industry.It has reported 51 COVID-19 cases. Of these, 35 have recovered. It is in the red zone and is the worst affected district along with Nuh, Palwal and Faridabad in Haryana.The state has reported 289 cases (including 176 who have been cured, discharged or migrated) and three fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry on Sunday.Kundu described the situation in Gurgaon as “fairly under control” and said there is no evidence of community transmission.Gurgaon has effectively been under lockdown since March 22 – two days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of a pan-India shutdown to stem the spread of the disease. This gave the administration a head start and enabled it to handle the situation effectively, the official said.The administration is working on the twin objectives of saving lives and ensuring livelihoods, he said.The district administration is conducting surveys and will start providing food coupons to poor families who don’t have ration cards. This will give them rations for three months.The district administration has been ensuring smooth supply of rations to them through its various channels, Kundu added.He said the manufacturing of personal protective equipment (PPEs) has also started. Two apparel firms have been given permission to manufacture PPEs in their plants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurgaon-mncs-may-have-to-work-from-home-till-july-end-some-real-estate-projects-can-resume-work-official/story-ekhbZYKdFZDooTfhfRwdHK.html

26-04-2020||City||Consumers will have to change their buying habits after Covid-19 lockdown||Covid-19 has necessitated a change in the way we shop and consumers need to remember this as we come to the last week of the lockdown and look forward to at least partial or gradual lifting of the restrictions.Since the threat of the dreaded virus is not going to disappear soon, we cannot bring down our defences and need to exercise utmost caution when we go shopping. Of course, as far as possible, it would be advisable to order goods online and have them delivered at home. And it’s better to pay online, rather than take the option of payment on delivery, so that you minimize your contact with the delivery person. But make sure that you are doing the transaction on a genuine site with proper safeguards. Do remember to wear a mask when the delivery person arrives, maintain safe distance and ask the person to keep the goods in a corner at the entrance of your home or just outside the door.Even where such home delivery services are not available, it might be better to give the retailer a list of all you need so that he keeps them packed and ready for you to pick them up. This will reduce the time that you spend at the store and minimize your contacts with various surfaces. Today, even a road side vegetable or fruit vendor has a cell phone and you can well order what you want on phone. Consumers usually prefer to pick the fruits and vegetables themselves in order to ensure quality, but that’s a habit that has to change. If the vendor delivers poor quality stuff, return it. Similarly, if you have a weighing machine at home, you can check the weight once in a while to ensure that he is not cheating on quantity. Once he knows that you cross-check the weight and will complain to legal metrology in case of violations, he will be careful. Also, if you are regularly patronizing a particular vendor, he is bound to be honest with you, to prevent you from going to a rival.In fact, the National Disaster Management Authority’s Covid-19 guidelines for grocery stores says that “as far as possible, a helper should take out the items needed by customers and not allow all customers to pick their own items, so as to avoid multiple contacts” . The guidelines also suggest that the helper frequently sanitize his hands. In large self-help stores, this may be difficult , so order your grocery in advance. Avoid staying too long in the air conditioned ambience.This is the appropriate time to say goodbye to plastic carry bags -research published in the New England Journal of Medicine has shown that the virus (SARS Covid-2) stays on plastic surfaces for two to three days.. So take your own cloth bag- ask the seller to put the purchases in it. The advantage of cotton is that you can wash it and dry it in the sun. As far as possible avoid using cash- there is enough evidence to show that they carry pathogens. Use instead, mobile wallets to pay the bill . Maintaining the required distance –either while buying or while paying- at all times is absolutely essential. In fact the NDMA guidelines require shop owners to make arrangements for ensuring that all customers wait outside at a safe distance. Similarly, they must maintain a distance of 1 meter to 1.5 metres from the cash counter and the person receiving payments (cash or card) should preferably sanitise the hand each time, says NDMA.Wear a mask at all times and if the seller or the shop assistants are not wearing masks, complain. It is meant to ensure your protection as well as theirs. As soon as you come out of the shop, sanitise your hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/consumer-will-have-to-change-their-buying-habits-after-covid-19-lockdown/story-mkLK9PL2AKimrudmBe6bLP.html

Even when normalcy prevails and the golf course is busy, caddies find it difficult to make ends meet. Carrying a bag over nine holes yields just R120 and R240 for a complete round over 18 holes. Tips, if any, are a bonus. A month into the lockdown and their paltry savings all but gone, desperation is taking over. While some are into odd jobs like fixing punctures, others have taken to sewing clothes.With the pandemic showing no signs of subsiding, lives and plans are on hold. “I was to get married in May but have had to put it off since I’m struggling to meet daily expenses,” said Rishi, a caddie.Like most in his profession, Rishi hails from the Martinpurwa village, which also has a tradition of producing quality golfers like Vijay Kumar, the 2002 Indian Open champion, and Sanjay Kumar, a two-time winner on the Professional Golf Tour of India.ALSO READ: HT SPECIAL - TOP SPORTSPERSONS TALK ABOUT LIFE IN LOCKDOWNThe golf club has stepped in with secretary, Rajnish Chopra, saying “the club was giving out food packets and R1000 per month and the efforts would continue for the next three months”.The relief might be enough for smaller households but not for Suresh’s family of six. Being the eldest son, the caddie-turned-golfer has other responsibilities, and that could mean putting his dream on hold. “I was about to start my amateur career and play some key tournaments across the country, but the present situation has made it tough,” said Suresh. There is repentance that unlike many in the village, he did not focus enough on academics. “Perhaps, I too could have got a government job and a secure future,” said Suresh.Under the circumstances, Vijay Kumar, who runs the pro shop at the club, warned that the sport could lose out on talent.“Many of the young caddies have the potential to become good professionals, but in the current scenario many of them of them could quit the game and move on.” Sanjay Kumar echoed the sentiment and urged more patrons to step in. “As caddies, these boys know only this sport. Without financial help, their future hangs in balance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/caddies-at-lucknow-golf-club-struggling-to-make-ends-meet/story-cfnxYhs05G8GfZtJQ48tGP.html

I recently did my first FB and Insta live and to tell you honestly I’m liking it too,” says the ‘Haal-e-Dil’ singer.The Lucknowite understands that in coming months things will be no different as real shows and concerts will not happen any time soon. “I had two concerts lined up in Kanpur and Unnao but the country went into lockdown and rightly so! For performers, like us who are part of public shows, it’s going to be tough time ahead. Given the scenario, public events won’t take place for another few months. Film projects will also take time. Also, what little rental income we had has been blocked due to government order. So, it’s a tough phase.”He feels professionally well-organised ticketed digital concerts are going to be the next big thing. “It will be safe, have global reach, win-win situation for performers, organisers and audience as this social distancing norm is here to stay for long,” he says.He is taking his quarantine days all easy, “Thankfully my parents had come here before Holi and had stayed back. I am also helping my mother in dusting and household work. Also tried mopping the floor and trust me I was sweating like anything.”He is missing his gym badly. “I was on path of achieving six-packs abs for my private album song shoot. It’s going to be a tough task now!” Harshit’s last film as solo music director was ‘Sab Kushal Mangal’ and next as composer is multi-starrer ‘Utawle Bawle’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/digital-concert-is-going-to-be-the-space-post-lockdown/story-BLukxbafBh3i4DVzMB6fCJ.html
26-04-2020||Entertainment||‘I am cooking food and stories...’||Writer-actor Manu Rishi Chadha is currently enjoying the success of his last release with Ayushmann Khurrana in the lead. “What a fun film it was! And I am absolutely thrilled with the response ‘Shubh Mangal Zyada Savdhaan’ received across mediums. My role of ‘Chaman Tripathi’ went down well with the audience. This was full-fledged role that made me totally content as an upcoming actor,” he said.Best remembered for his dialogue-writing and acting in the film ‘Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!’ and OTT series ‘Inside Edge’, he feels that the right filmmakers will always know what they want from their actors, “Filmmakers like Dibakar Banerjee, Anand L Rai and Hitesh Kewalya are so confident of their craft and pattern of storytelling that it becomes easy for an actor to perform. And yes, they very well know the potential of their cast and crew! This is a plus for actors like us who are trying to make mark in acting.”When asked has the writing taken a back seat for now, Rishi is quick to revert, “Once a writer always a writer. I am making most of this lockdown, you can say I am cooking both food and stories these days. Two film scripts are complete and work on my web series is in final stages. Acting is something I enjoy the most so I asked all my acquaintances in the industry for a role. That is bearing result now when I am getting good roles to act.”Rishi believes we that this is best time to show empathy, “I am so proud of the entire industry the way they have come forward in such times. Like my friend Deepak (Dobriyal) said that he will help his staff even if he has to take a loan. ‘Sab khuddar hai…’ I remember when I asked my staff to a break and tried paying them advance salaries they downright refused saying ‘Kaam kare bina nai chahiye...’ It amazed me to see such sincerity.”For his last release Rishi shot in Varanasi he says, “Varanasi was truly enjoyable. Ghats, its food, paan and dhaba tea made those days more memorable for all. The best part is we actors of ‘SMZS’ still continue to have a What’sApp group with name of Tripathis’ and chat most of the time.”He next release will be seen in ‘Laxmmi Bomb’ with none other than superstar Akshay Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/i-am-cooking-food-and-stories/story-PakdlF7RRoMrxzaD13qtHM.html
26-04-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow doctor donates plasma after recovering from Covid-19 for treating patients||Tauseef Khan, a resident doctor at the KGMU in Lucknow who recently defeated COVID-19, began the holy month of Ramzan, which is considered a time for giving, by donating his plasma for treatment of others suffering from the deadly disease.Khan, in his late 20s, contracted coronavirus from a patient while working at the King George’s Medical University and tested positive for the infection on March 17.He was discharged from the hospital on April 7 and is now back at work after a 14-day home quarantine.“Dr D Himanshu of Medicine Department, who is looking after the treatment of COVID-19 patients, asked me if I wanted to become the first plasma donor (of KGMU). I immediately said yes as nothing could be greater than being able to save the life of a patient in the holy month of Ramzan,” Khan said.He said he observed his first ‘roza’ on Saturday and gave his blood after consulting clerics whether it is permissible to do so while fasting.Head of Transfusion Medicine, KGMU, Tulika Chandra told PTI, “The work on administering medical treatment to COVID-19 patients through plasma therapy began on Saturday.” “In this context, the blood sample of Dr Tauseef Khan, a resident doctor who had recovered from COVID-19, was taken for testing. In the test, the condition of the antibodies was found quite good,” she said.Chandra said, “In the evening, the process of extracting plasma from his body started, and almost 500 millilitres of plasma was extracted. The process took almost one-and-half hour.” She said Khan’s plasma will be administered on Monday or Tuesday to a patient who is in a serious condition and in whose case medicines aren’t working.“The patient will be given 200 millilitres of plasma. In other words, plasma donated by one patient (who has recovered from COVID-19) can be used for the treatment of two patients. If there is no positive result after the first 200 millilitres of plasma has been infused, then another 200 millilitres is infused,” she elaborated.Asked about the chances of success of plasma therapy, Chandra said, “It seems that the chances of (success of) plasma therapy are good, and it is for this reason that this therapy is gradually being adopted across the country for treatment of COVID-19 patients. We are hopeful that KGMU will emerge successful in plasma therapy.” On April 21, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had asked the state’s medical authorities to promote plasma therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients after examining its efficacy.Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recently allowed states to start clinical trials of plasma therapy.Several states like Kerala, Gujarat and Punjab have already started using it for treatment of coronvairus patients.Convalescent Plasma Therapy is an experimental procedure for COVID-19 patients.In this treatment, plasma from a cured COVID-19 patient is transfused to a critically ill coronavirus patient.The idea behind this therapy is that immunity can be transferred from a healthy person to a sick patient using convalescent plasma. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of a cured coronavirus patient to treat another critical patient.The recovered COVID-19 patient’s blood develops antibodies to battle against COVID-19. Once the blood of the recovered patient is infused to the second patient, those antibodies will start fighting against coronavirus in the second person’s body.The process of donating plasma is similar to donating blood and takes about an hour.Several countries around the world, including the United Kingdom and the United States have also started plasma therapy trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lucknow-doctor-donates-plasma-after-recovering-from-covid-19-for-treating-patients/story-Sk0wjZ3HImSSUAHNmZIr9I.html

26-04-2020||Mumbai||BMC gears up for plasma therapy, patient identified||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is ready to start plasma therapy for eligible coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients. A patient at Lilavati Hospital has been identified for the first plasma transfusion in Maharashtra, according to sources, and the process is likely to be carried out on Sunday. A plasmapheresis — removal, treatment, and return or exchange of blood plasma — machine has been installed at Nair Hospital.The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those infected. The therapy can also be used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contracts. Three units of plasma from recovered patients are already collected, sources said. Plasma is the almost-clear liquid left behind after red and white blood cells and platelets are removed from the blood.Dr Daksha Shah, deputy director, health department, BMC, said, “Patients’ blood group is getting matched. Five more recovered Covid-19 patients have been screened to donate plasma. Other recovered Covid-19 patients are being contacted, so that more severely ill patients can benefit from plasma therapy.”Last week, the state had sought permission from the Centre to start clinical trials of plasma therapy and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine for treatment of Covid-19 patients. Kerala and Delhi have already got permission to conduct the trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-gears-up-for-plasma-therapy-patient-identified/story-odNwhP4GSYkJjK4z0PF9LK.html

26-04-2020||Delhi||Hindu Rao Hospital shut after nurse tests positive, probe likely soon||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation decided to temporarily shut down its biggest hospital, Hindu Rao, at Malka Ganj after one of its nurses tested Covid-19 positive on Saturday evening.The hospital is spread across 14.3 acres and is a designated ‘Covid screening centre’ by the Delhi government and is currently not conducting any surgeries. Only a few departments like gynaecology, medicine and partially the pediatrics department is functioning here right now.The north body commissioner, Varsha Joshi, said on Saturday, “Late evening, a nurse on duty at HRH is found positive. Since she has been on duty in various locations within the campus over the last two weeks, we are closing down the hospital till we fully sanitise it and complete contact tracing. Only some patients are admitted right now in gynae ward, we will make appropriate arrangements for them.” Senior officers of the corporation said that the nurse had developed fever about one week ago but was still called for duty. “She met so many doctors and nurses in between at the hospital, all will have to be quarantined.”Joshi said, “There appears to be definite negligence at some level here. It’s too early to pinpoint exactly who are responsible since we came to know only now. We will have a thorough inquiry into this aspect and we will not spare those responsible.”It was learnt that the nurse is about 30 years old and had been recently shifted from one of the AYUSH dispensaries to the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hindu-rao-hospital-shut-after-nurse-tests-positive-probe-likely-soon/story-OY5f89MBLvnD4BJfIKLdNI.html
26-04-2020||Delhi||They beat the virus, but Covid anxiety still haunts survivors||Rohit Dutta, 45, the first person in Delhi to be diagnosed with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on March 2, bounced back and returned home on March 14. He quickly went back to his daily routine of aerobics and yoga . He has no breathing difficulty of fatigue.“In the hospital, I had a mild fever of 99.5(Fahrenheit) and really bad cough for several days, but there were no symptoms at all after that. I feel very healthy and very lucky to have survived an infection that is killing so many others around the world,” said Dutta.But the illness, and the fact that he got infected without knowing about it, has made him anxious. He prefers to stay in his room, and is visibly nervous when he gets follow-up calls from authorities who want to make sure he hasn’t been reinfected. Safdarjung hospital’s Dr Huda -- who wants to be identified just by her last name -- did not have severe symptoms when she tested positive. “One day I could not get up from my bed, I was drained and had body ache. That is when I got tested and the result turned out to be positive. Other than that, I just had some cough for a day and half” she said.She has been upset by the reaction of others, though. “Everyone is scared and anxious and even after I have recovered and completed my quarantine, people still want to stay away, they don’t want to talk. The other day, when my neighbour saw me on the balcony he went inside,” she said.Dr Mohinder Sadana, 62, and his wife Dr Poonam Sadana, 61, both had almost no symptoms when they tested positive and say they feel “100% fit”. They exercise for an hour each morning. “I have no fatigue, no weakness. Nothing at all. And, even when we tested positive my symptoms were milder than a flu,”he said. Other than anxiety and some stigma , many people in Delhi who have recovered from coronavirus disease (Covid-19) show none of the long-term lung and health damage the disease is known to have. The Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, belongs to the family of at least 39 known species of coronavirus, seven of which can infect humans. There has been a lot of research on the long-term impact , especially after hospitalisation, for coronavirus diseases such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Covid-19. According to this research, people who recover may have impaired lung function, reduced exercise capability, and psychological disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety even six months after recovery.A yet to be published study by researchers in the United Kingdom looked at 18 studies and found that the diffusing capacity of the lung – or its ability to perform gaseous exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide -- was considerably low six months of infection. All but one of the 18 studies involved SARS patients, which was not as infectious as Covid-19, but deadlier, according to researchers. The other study was on MERS. The authors said healthcare systems should prepare for long-term health effects, according to the study published in the pre-print server medRxiv.Although the patients who have recovered from Covid-19 in Delhi might not be showing long term symptoms, doctors believe there might still be damage to the lungs.“Certainly, there could be some long-term damage. What we have seen so far is that the clinical symptoms do not match the radiological diagnosis. A patient might be very comfortable, but their x-rays show damage to the lungs, which will take time to recover,” said Dr Amit Kohli, intensive care specialist from Lok Nayak hospital, which is handling the highest number and the most serious Covid-19 cases in the city.Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and the chair of the committee advising the chief minister of Delhi on Covid-19 said, “Around 20% of the patients, despite having very mild or no symptoms, will have lung lesions and low-degree pneumonia. That is a very large number.”Doctors who analysed the clinical symptoms of the first 21 patients at Safdarjung hospital suggested following up the patients to check for lung fibrosis, which is caused due to damage and scarring of the lungs.“The long-term impact on diffusion capability of the lungs is possible as we know that the viral infection attacks the interstitial tissues (a lace-like structure that supports the alveoli or air sacs in the lungs). These tissues help in the gas exchange, meaning patients with damaged tissues will be breathless,” said Dr Nitesh Gupta, department of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjung hospital.As for the psychological impact, it will have more to do with “social exclusion and economic hardship,” according to Dr Nimesh Desai, director, Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences. “I think PTSD is an overrated American concept.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/they-beat-the-virus-but-covid-anxiety-still-haunts-survivors/story-esp0QBzCUqs8f64wju1rJJ.html
26-04-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19 tests row: Gurugram lab stands by results, dares govt to re-examine samples||A week after a Gurugram-based private lab’s Covid-19 reports sparked controversy, the testing facility has stood by its past result and challenged that the samples can be checked again at any other laboratory.Addressing a video conference with the media here on Saturday, SRL Diagnostics said the patients’ RNA samples with them can be tested again at National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, or All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. “We have re-tested the same samples using the RNA extracts stored with us under the recommended guidelines by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and the same turned out positive again. So, we stand by the past results.”“When the health department officials visited us, we explained them the whole process. We are ready to provide them with the same RNA extracts to re-test the samples at NIV, AIIMS or any other lab,” said Dr Anurag Bansal, SRL Gurugram lab operations director.Dr Anurag pointed out the various factors that affect the samples. “Testing depends upon various factors, such as the amount of time an individual was exposed before specimen collection, shedding of virus at the time sample was taken and conditions in which the same was collected, packaged and transported. Also, there can be disparities because of the sensitivity of the testing machine that can detect the virus in only 67% of the cases,” he added.Meanwhile, SRL Limited CEO Arindam Haidar expressed hope that the state government will reverse its decision and allow testing of samples at the private lab again.The private lab had come under the scanner after Haryana health minister Anil Vij on April 20 had banned Covid-19 testing at the testing facility, and subsequently ordered an inquiry, after four patients had tested negative within 24 hours of their infection confirmation by the lab.Ambala chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Kuldeep Singh and his counterpart in Gurugram were appointed to probe the cases in their districts.Meanwhile, Vij said, “I have apprised the Union health minister about the case and expressed that the lab’s varied results can create problems. He has accepted my request to get an ICMR probe conducted in the case.”Stating that repeated tests of the patients’ samples conducted at different government labs turned out negative, the CMO observed, “The private lab should not have re-tested the samples on its own. If they wanted to challenge the results, the samples should have been sent to some other government or private lab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-tests-row-gurugram-lab-stands-by-results-dares-govt-to-re-examine-samples/story-TYKn6KTUrxsv51ZasE7llM.html

Schools across the city are have been shut for more than a month.To be run in collaboration with a non-profit organisation, Khan Academy, students would be sent links to mathematics lessons designed by Khan Academy though SMS from Monday. The links will have videos of lessons as well as activities for the students based on the topics mentioned in the lessons.Shailendra Sharma, senior advisor to education minister, said mathematics has always been a major challenge for government school students. “Last year, when we examined the class 10 board exam results we found that while the overall pass percentage was 97%, only 71% students had passed in mathematics. The pass percentage was 57% in mathematics in class 9. Keeping that in mind we decided to collaborate with Khan Academy, which will produce online study material for our students.”Sandeep Bapna, managing director of Khan Academy India, said it will be a 10-week-long programme. “Starting Monday, the parents will receive an SMS with a link to that day’s micro lesson. It will have two or three videos and a couple of exercises,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/online-math-lessons-for-class-9-students-in-delhi-amid-lockdown-2-0/story-MpeDJk6ly5IP73hTDgYXCI.html

26-04-2020||Delhi||Man kills wife in red zone, is asked to walk out of area so he can be arrested||In what a police officers called “a case of many firsts,”a 35-year-old man was arrested on Saturday morning from outside a containment zone in Madipur, near Punjabi Bagh, for allegedly murdering his wife in their home inside the zone.The murder, the first such incident reported from inside a Covid-19 containment zone in Delhi, was reported when the suspect called the police and confessed to the murder. The city has 92 such zones, across areas such as Nizamuddin, Chandni Mahal, Nabi Karim, to limit the spread of Covid-19. Police officers privy to the investigation said that because this was the first case of murder within a containment zone , they had to look at standard operating procedures for such cases and act accordingly. “There were many firsts in this case. Usually our officers immediately visit the crime scene, but in this case, we called the suspect and asked him to come outside the zone. We waited for him. He was then arrested and sent into isolation,” a police officer said. Police said that it took them around eight hours to clear the crime scene — the road that leads to the house was first sanitised and investigating officers then waited for personal protective equipment (PPE) kits to be delivered before carrying out a detailed inspection of the room. A forensics team was called to the spot. Senior officers said even though the woman hadn’t died of Covid-19, her body was wrapped in multiple layers. The hearse used to take the body from the house was also sanitised twice.The police said the suspect, Rahisul Azam, called the police at 3.56 am and reported that he had attacked his wife after an argument in their house. The woman supposedly died on the spot. “A team from Punjabi Bagh station rushed to the address given by the man, but found the house was in a containment zone. In order to adhere to guidelines, the sub-divisional magistrate, district magistrate and civic agencies concerned were informed of the case. The Delhi Jal Board was roped in to sanitise the area,” said a senior officer.The policemen then called up Azam and asked him to walk out of the containment zone and surrender. Before he was arrested, his temperature was checked and he was asked if he had symptoms. “Azam has told us he sells footwear in Jahangirpuri and had got married three years ago. It was the second marriage for both Azam and his wife. While he had three children from his first marriage, the woman had six. During an argument on Saturday, he hit her with a stick on the head and she fell unconscious. He said when he checked, she was already dead,” the officer said. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said disaster management teams and Covid helplines were also alerted. “Azam has been arrested as per guidelines issued in view of Covid-19. All preventive and precautionary steps are being taken while investigating the case so as to adhere to the containment zone guidelines and at the same time to conduct an efficient investigation,” Purohit said.Until late Saturday evening, investigating officers said they were checking with authorities about proceedings related to the autopsy and disposal of the body. Police said they are checking if the body could be handed back to the family, because the woman was not Covid-19 positive but was a resident of a containment zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-kills-wife-in-red-zone-is-asked-to-walk-out-of-area-so-he-can-be-arrested/story-sxMovu1UwRWWWmaRE27w6N.html

In order to monitor the Sonepat residents working in various Delhi government departments, we have sought a list, but they refused to provide us with the said information terming it a tough task. We are only allowing those people into the district who are either employed in Delhi or have a permit.”When asked if Sonepat was potentially as hotspot, the DC said the district has not emerged as a new hotspot because cases were being reporting from neighbouring areas with history of 17 patients linked to Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/spurt-in-cases-sends-alarm-bells-ringing-in-sonepat/story-nuSE6VqO8cfBLrkVrOLUJI.html

26-04-2020||Chandigarh||Residents should avail maximum benefit of e-Sanjeevani app: Ludhiana DC||In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Punjab government has undertaken a citizen centric initiative to ensure uninterrupted health services to the public in the state. The state government on Saturday launched an application ‘e-Sanjeevani’, an online OPD system, Ludhiana deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said.Agrawal said the application extended the reach of specialised healthcare services to the masses in both rural areas and any isolated community pockets of the state. It provided a platform for citizens to connect with a network of specialist doctors over video-conferencing and obtain medical treatment and advice for common health concerns while sitting at home. “There is a degree of unease among citizens due to the inability to reach doctors in non-emergency cases amid the lockdown. However, this technology shall help all sections of society to gain access to quality medical advice and treatment during the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.Maximum number of residents should avail benefit of this system, the DC urged, adding that the application has an extremely user-friendly interface which facilitates both tech savvy and relatively novice doctors and users in the rural and urban environment.Besides telemedicine services in health and wellness centres, the health and family welfare department with active support from the governance reforms and public grievances departments has implemented this programme across the state, the DC said, adding that apart from enhancing the quality of medical services, e-Sanjeevani addresses the issues pertaining to uneven distribution and shortage of infrastructural as well as human resources to an extent.He further highlighted the salient features of the application which includes— patient registration, token generation, queue management, audio-video consultation with a doctor, e-prescription, SMS/email notifications— serviced by the doctors from the department of health and family welfare. The service is free and fully configurable, he added.“The application also has an advanced degree of security against unwanted elements. To keep the operations smoother in the district, a team of district technical coordinators (DTCs) or district e-governance coordinators (DeGCs) has been deputed to assist the teams of doctors at the district-level,” he said.Agrawal added that the state government has provided training about the application, its protocols and functionality to some of the specialist doctors by C-DAC, Mohali, via video-conference. He informed that this feature is also available in the COVA Punjab mobile application which is available for Android on the Google Play Store and for iOS on the Apple AppStore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/residents-should-avail-maximum-benefit-of-e-sanjeevani-app-ludhiana-dc/story-pTga8A95vv5BLpAqb8lCbJ.html

26-04-2020||City||Fumed over deployment of homeguards, Ludhiana MLA denies security cover||Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief and member of legislative assembly (MLA) from Atam Nagar constituency, Simarjit Singh Bains, on Saturday rejected the security cover provided to him by Ludhiana police.Agitated over being denied police security few days back, the MLA did not let the four homeguard jawans equipped with .303 rifles sit outside his house in Alamgir Enclave. He has also asked the police department to withdraw security given to him and instead deploy the homeguards on curfew duties. Puzzled whether to follow the department’s orders or comply with Bains’ instructions, the security personnel sat at the main gate of the colony during the day. The LIP chief alleged that the deployment of homeguards was the violation of protocol “as security personnel of an MLA should be trained police personnel with modern weapons, including carbine or automatic rifles.” “.303 rifles are not feasible and do not fit inside vehicles when the security personnel hold them in their hands,” he said. HAD LOST SECURITY AFTER PATIALA COP ATTACK INCIDENTBains had lost his security on April 14 when he allegedly justified the Patiala incident wherein a Nihang Sikh had chopped off a cop’s hand. Following this, the cops deployed on his security submitted in writing that they did not want to serve him anymore as “he had insulted the police fraternity that too at a time when they are serving the masses by putting their lives at risk.” Adhering to their request, the department withdrew the MLA’s security personnel and asked them to report to Police Lines.The police, however, did not withdraw the security cover of the LIP leader’s older brother and MLA from Ludhiana South, Balwinder Singh Bains. Assistant sub-inspector, a head constable and two constables deployed on his security were replaced by four homeguard jawans.The LIP chief said, “An MLA gets security following orders of Vidhan Sabha speaker. The police officials are very much aware that they would be in trouble if I take up the matter in privilege committee. For the sake of formality, they have deployed four homeguard jawans for my security.” “Homeguard jawans with .303 rifles are deployed outside banks and other premises, but not with MLAs. Moreover, no other MLA has been provided homeguard jawans in security,”he said.‘HAVE WRITTEN TO POLICE COMMISSIONER’The legislator also said, “I have sent an e-mail to police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal and asked him to withdraw homeguard jawans from my security. I don’t need any security and the same can be utilised for Covid-19 duties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fumed-over-deployment-of-homeguards-ludhiana-mla-denies-security-cover/story-niyngOLCREwvEYVF91AtGN.html
26-04-2020||Chandigarh||Despite lockdown, Punjab sees no halt in heroin smuggling from Pak||Even as both India and Pakistan have enforced countrywide lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, smuggling of heroin from the neighbouring country through the Punjab border has been going on unabated. The Border Security Force (BSF) seized 38 kg heroin during the past one month — from March 23 to April 23— in Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Ferozepur and Abohar sectors.With this, the total recovery of heroin by the BSF this year has been pegged at 130 kg, which is much higher as compared to the recovery of the drug during the corresponding period in 2019. According to the BSF’s data, the recovery of heroin from January to May 2019 was 85 kg. On April 23 this year, the BSF had seized 1 kg of heroin near Khemkaran village of Tarn Taran. On April 22, 1 kg heroin and a country-made pistol were recovered near Attari border. On April 21, 4.5 kg heroin was seized in Ajnala. Similarly, 9 kg heroin was seized near Attari border on April 16. A senior BSF official said Pakistani smugglers continue to push in the drugs into the Indian territory taking advantage of the standing wheat crop along the border. Punjab shares a 553-km border, with a barbed fence, with Pakistan. A senior official of the special task force (STF) of Punjab Police said, “Due to strictness of police on drug smuggling and the ongoing curfew, the supply chain of drugs has been broken in the state. Due to this, Pakistani smugglers may have been attempting to push in more drugs.”“Besides, Indian farmers are allowed to visit their fields across the fence during the harvesting season. It becomes easy for Indian smugglers to clear the consignments adopting various concealing methods in the guise of agriculture-related works. We have already prepared a list of suspected people, including some farmers. Our teams have increased vigil in the border villages and no one will be allowed to peddle the drugs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-lockdown-punjab-sees-no-halt-in-heroin-smuggling-from-pak/story-MbHsKXmJxIcgZZEq9X8CfM.html

The hospital will also launch its own inquiry into the issue, even as deputy commissioner Shiv Dular Singh Dhillon had also ordered a probe on Friday. Doctors, nurses and other hospital staff had refused to wear these kits, saying they were sub-standard and did not even include N-95 masks.GMCH principal Dr Sujata Sharma said, “The institute has formed a team of senior doctors to probe the purchase of these 2,000 kits. Deputy medical superintendent Dr Narinder, Dr JS Kullar, Dr Ashwani Bhagat and Dr Jaspreet will look into the matter.” She refused to name the company saying that it would be revealed to the media after the inquiry. She added, “The private firm that supplied the kits has been ordered to replace these with the required quality or refund the entire amount. The firm has agreed to these terms.” Dr Raman Sharma, medical superintendent of GNDH, who ordered the kits, said, “After receiving the stock, it was found substandard.

26-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt not in favour of allowing all shops to open till May 3||The Maharashtra government has decided not to extend the relaxation given to shops and establishments from the ongoing lockdown even after it was announced by the Central government via a notification on Friday. Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra has decided to stick to the current curbs till May 3.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state government was not extending the relaxations to shops and establishments. “The Centre has issued the notification allowing standalone shops in rural and urban areas, but in the absence of a similar notification in Maharashtra, it will not come into effect. It is the prerogative of the state government to decide on the lockdown. Maharashtra government is not in favour of allowing establishments to operate till May 3,” he said.Tope, however, said that the relaxation from lockdown is expected to be discussed during a meeting between PM Narendra Modi and chief ministers of states on Monday.According to the officials from the state government, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is of the opinion that lifting of restriction may further jeopardise social distancing and lead to a rise in cases. “Even if we extend the relaxation and allow stand-alone shops to operate, the police and revenue machinery will be engaged in implementing the lockdown orders to a great extent. Secondly shortfall of raw material and manpower will continue to persist until the lockdown is not lifted completely. Against this backdrop, the state government has decided to continue with the complete lockdown for one more week,” an official from Mantralaya said.The official said that the state can impose stricter norms than specified by the Centre under the Disaster Management Act, but cannot give more relaxations than that ordered by the Centre. “This was the reason why we had to withdraw our last week’s order of allowing sweet and snacks like farsan shops within two days,” he said.Tope had earlier said that the after the second phase of the lockdown ending on May 3, it may be extended by two weeks till May 18 for MMR and Pune where the positive cases are highest. On Saturday evening, he said, “The decision about the extension in MMR and Pune is yet to be taken. The activities within the district with tag of green zones can be allowed through,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-govt-not-in-favour-of-allowing-all-shops-to-open-till-may-3/story-C4svIjQz1SlrPwbLsvAAjM.html
26-04-2020||Mumbai||Highest single-day spike of 811 cases takes Maha tally to 7,628||Eight hundred and eleven coronavirus cases were on Saturday reported across Maharashtra — the highest single-day spike since the first case on March 9— taking the number of infected people in the state to 7,628. The state’s capital, Mumbai, also registered its grimmest figures with 602 new infections, increasing the case count to 5,049.The state’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) toll rose to 323 with 22 deaths, 13 of them in Mumbai. The city’s toll is now 191. Eleven people who died were above 60 years of age, while eight were in the 40-59 years age group. Three were below the age of 40 years. On Friday, there were 394 fresh cases, a significant dip from the then highest one-day rise of 778 on Thursday and 552 and 431 cases on the two previous days. With the fluctuating trend in Covid-19 cases and a drop in the mortality rate by around four percentage points over the past few days, state authorities are expecting the doubling rate of cases to improve and fatality rate to drop further in the next few weeks. State officials opined that the situation seemed to be in their control, but they would observe the trends for a few days before reaching any conclusion on whether the worst is over for Maharashtra. They also pointed out that the new cases are coming from identified contacts of patients and as such, community transmission (in which the source of infection is not known) doesn’t seem to be the cause of increase in Covid-19 cases. As a precautionary measure, the state government has decided not to allow shops of non-essential services to operate although a notification issued by the Centre on Friday has permitted their operations. The state government will continue the ongoing lockdown till May 3. State health minister Rajesh Tope, contrary to his earlier statement, said on Saturday evening that no decision on extending the lockdown in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune has been taken yet.Dr Avinash Supe, head of a committee appointed to advise the state government on management protocol for serious Covid-19 patients, said that the mortality rate has dropped satisfactorily, but the graph of fresh cases will have to be observed for the next two weeks. “The doubling rate has reduced to over seven days, when many other countries are still lingering at 3.5. Similarly, our mortality rate has dropped to 4.4 from 8 in the state and 4% in Mumbai. If we maintain this trend of doubling it would help us in containing the spread. We have been urging elderly persons to not undermine warning signs and get required tests done to avoid further complications. This would help us keep the mortality rate in check,” he said.Supe said that unless the trend of cases is reviewed for at least two weeks, it would be difficult to comment about the curve. Dr Sadhana Tayade , of Directorate of Health Services, said that the mortality rate is expected to fall further in Maharashtra. “We have been strictly monitoring the containment zones and have been following protocols strictly. There is the Central government’s prediction of rise in cases by May-end and we are prepared for it. The rise is also because of the rise in testing,” she said.Tope said that the World Health Organization (WHO) and Central government have been continuously reviewing the situation in the state and they have endorsed our claim that community spread has not begun in Maharashtra. “We have been concentrating on slums and congested areas than buildings and individual apartments for the effective containment of the spread. As directed by the Central teams that visited Mumbai and Pune, we are concentrating on containment in areas like Dharavi and the hygiene in these areas. We have successfully brought the mortality rate down and improved doubling rate to more than 7 days from the earlier rate of 3.5,” he said .Tope said that though the ICMR protocol mandates for the tests on those showing some symptoms, the state government has been doing testing of asymptomatic contacts too. “We have been aggressively doing testing and quarantining contacts of patients. Now, the relatives of patients in areas like Dharavi will be administered with hydroxychloroquine,” he said.The health minister has, however, clarified that the state government is unlikely to extend the relaxations to the shops from lockdown, following the notification issued by the Centre. “The Centre has issued the notification, allowing stand-alone shops in rural and urban areas, but in the absence of a similar notification in Maharashtra, it could not come into effect” he said.Tope had earlier said that after the second phase of the lockdown ending on May 3, it may be extended by two weeks till May 18 for MMR and Pune, the most affected regions in the state. On Saturday evening, Tope said, “The decision about the extension in MMR and Pune is yet to be taken. The activities within the district with the tag of green zones can be allowed through,” he said.According to officials from the state government, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is of the opinion that lifting of restrictions may further jeopardise social distancing and lead to rise in cases. “Even if we extend the relaxation and allow stand-alone shops to operate, the police and revenue machinery will be engaged in implementing lockdown orders to a great extent. Secondly, shortfall of raw material and manpower will continue to persist until the lockdown is not lifted completely.

The state government will again push for special trains for migrant workers to reach their respective states. Maharashtra has been taking care of more than 6.5lakh migrant workers who have been stuck at various shelters across the state. CM Thackeray has already requested the Centre for such special trains, while deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has written a letter to Railway minister Piyush Goyal for trains from Mumbai and Pune. The state government fears violent reactions from migrants if the ongoing lockdown is extended beyond May 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/highest-single-day-spike-of-811-cases-takes-maha-tally-to-7-628/story-VPZ7FHzVAFiZook6hcB6pN.html
26-04-2020||City||AIIMS Bathinda to launch virtual OPD from tomorrow||Patients from Bathinda or any part of the state will now be able to consult specialist doctors from 13 different departments at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here through WhatsApp video calls.Officials at AIIMS here told HT that the virtual outpatient department (OPD) will be fully functional from Monday to cater to the patients’ needs amid the ongoing lockdown in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.Medical superintendent Dr Satish Gupta said the first-of-its-kind initiative in the traditional telemedicine sector in the region will enable AIIMS specialists to examine a patient through a video call. Patients can also share their clinical reports, X-ray reports etc to get advice from specialists without any consultation fee.Departments of dermatology, oncology, urology, ENT and general medicines will be among others available for the virtual OPD.Gupta said the facility is aimed at minimising the movement of patients, particularly the elderly and children, during the lockdown period.After registering on dedicated telephone lines by submitting details of ailments from 10 am till noon on weekdays, a patient will get teleconference appointment for the next day.The medical prescription will be sent to the patient on the end of the day on the registered WhatsApp number of the patient.“Cases like post-surgery swelling, dental or orthopaedic and psychiatric patients will be among others handled with a video call.

26-04-2020||Pune||Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association is getting ready for tough times in post covid era||The deadly coronavirus has brought tennis in Pune to a screeching halt. From players to coaches to tournaments, everything has suffered a severe blow. Pune has 40 coaching centres and 455 tennis courts.April, May and June – these months have always been reserved for Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association’s (MSLTA) summer circuit, where around 50-60 tournaments take place across the city, but none of the tournaments will take place due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Sunder Iyer, secretary, MSLTA said, “It is our peak season and during this time tournaments for under-10, 12, 14 and 16 categories are organised. So as an association we need to take care of the whole system in these trying times which include officials, stringers, ball boys and ground maintenance staff along with players. The next season begins after the monsoon in October.”“As a stop-gap arrangement we will be providing two months ration to our coaches in various districts at MSLTA coaching centres. We have informed our zonal coordinators and we are preparing a list of coaches. We have received 60 names so far and more will be added to the list,” added Iyer.Tennis in times of Covid“We are working on long-term plans. One thing is sure, sports will definitely take a hit in post covid era, so even when tennis restarts we need to come up with different guidelines for conducting tournaments. Like having more district-wise tournaments instead of state and nationals or having draws of 16 instead of 32,” said Iyer.In last couple of years, MSLTA has focussed on developing centres like Kolhapur, Nashik, Satara, Aurnagabad and Sangli with an aim of promoting tennis in rural parts of the country.“Smaller centres will have more impact of this pandemic. As tennis is an expensive, it may also be difficult for parents to send their children due to the current pay cuts,” added Iyer.A lot depends on government protocolsAccording to Iyer, how the government will facilitate sports activities after the lockdown is a major concern for all city-based sports associations. “The associations will only get a clear picture after the government announces the protocols. I hope action starts soon but complete normalcy will surely take time to return. Many things also depend on schools reopening and once the guidelines are out for them, there will be clarity on sports as well,” added Iyer.Role of SponsorsSponsors have always played key role for tennis and keeping them on the board and attracting new sponsors will be difficult after the lockdown, according to Iyer.Key challengesNo. of tournaments suspended: 60 (across Maharashtra)Most affected age groups: u10, 12, 14 and 16Lockdown challenge: To keep sponsors on board||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mslta-is-getting-ready-for-tough-times-in-post-covid-era/story-aIiwcaGCyVtYDlkvgA0vEN.html

Over the course of the next five days, her requirement for oxygen reduced and she was gradually weaned off increased oxygen delivery. Close monitoring over the next few days ensured her condition improved and she didn’t need ventilator support at all. We are very happy to say that she is currently doing well and has been discharged as of today,” said Dr Zirpe.Speaking about her treatment, the hospital authorities said they followed the guidelines laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research. This was owing to the fact that the patient had already come into contact with a confirmed Covid case. “Our isolation frontline warriors — Dr Sushil Yadav and team did a commendable job while quarantining the patient. This case was all the more challenging for our doctors because the patient had pre-existing comorbidities,” said Dr Sanjay Pathare, medical director, Ruby Hall Clinic.Mr. Bomi Bhote, CEO, Ruby Hall Clinic concluded, “This is wonderful news and a testament to all our doctors and staff who have been working night and day to care for our patients. She has been the only Covid-19 patient to be admitted to the hospital and her prompt recovery is indeed heartening.

26-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: Social workers in Pune come forward to assist in burial of Covid-19 patients||With the immediate relatives of patients who have died of the Covid-19 disease unable or unwilling to assist in the final rites, volunteers from two organisations in Pune have come forward to assist the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in the burial of the bodies.As of April 24, 68 people have died of the deadly coronavirus disease, registering one of the highest death counts due to this disease in the country. On at least three occasions previously, the cremation of Covid-19 patients was delayed due to lack of adequate manpower.Realising that the burial of Covid-19 patients was becoming a problem, volunteers from the city branch of the Popular Front of India (PFI) and social organisation Mulnivasi Muslim Manch came forward to perform the final rites.While they have been doing the final rites of Muslim victims of the disease, they have offered their service, free of charge to people from other faiths who may have died of Covid-19.In many cases, close relatives of the dead patients have been unable to assist in the final rites either because of extreme fear of contracting the infection, or because they are themselves under institutional quarantine.Manch president Anjum Inamdar said, “I was distraught when I came to know that relatives were not coming forward to perform the final rites. We could see that even the municipal corporation was also struggling because of this. As per our faith, bodies have to be buried after death and so we appealed to the PMC to give us the permission to do the burial with all the necessary precautions.”The PMC agreed to the proposal and Inamdar along with fellow volunteers Saabir Topkhan, Zameer Momi and Irfan Maniyar have performed the final rites of 11 Covid-19 patients as of April 14. “Even my 70-year-old mother, Zenab, supported me in this work,” he said.Appreciating this initiative, Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “Some muslim volunteers have come forward for carrying out the final rites in the absence of the relatives. This is helping the PMC and we have given them instructions and equipment for personal safety,” he said.Srinivas Kandul, PMC’s head of electrical department and in-charge of cremations said, while the PMC did not face much difficulty in cremating the bodies at the six designated gas-fired crematoriums, burials of dead Covid patients was becoming a problem because of the digging of the trench and other final rites.The two organisations have given a list of 26, young and healthy volunteers who will undertake this work. They have been trained on the precautions to take and the PPEs (personal protective equipment) that needs to be used.“Now, it is we who do the final rites even if the close relatives are present and we ask them to keep a distance,” Inamdar said.Razi said that they have organised a back-up team of 50 volunteers for this work, They have all-round support of their family members and the community in this, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-social-workers-come-forward-to-assist-in-burial-of-dead/story-icklKJFAcGtLDcgMpfjVeM.html

26-04-2020||Delhi||Why Delhi govt allowed shops to open after MHA directive||Official reports that several shops had already opened across the city and forcing them shut again may cause law and order problems prompted the Delhi government’s rethink on the resumption of commercial activities in the national capital, senior officials who attended a review meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said. In an order on Saturday evening, the Delhi government allowed opening of all neighbourhood stores, even those selling non-essentials, in areas outside containment zones and hot spots of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The order came a day after the Union home ministry allowed stand-alone establishments. Till Saturday evening when Kejriwal held a review meeting with senior state officials, confusion prevailed on the operation of the Centre’s decision to allow shops to open in areas that are not containment zones. Senior officials in the chief minister’s office, who attended Kejriwal’s meeting and did not wish to be named, said the Delhi Police gave its feedback that forcing shops to shut again would lead to law and order issues in some pockets of the city.“Actually, the Delhi government was left with no other option than to allow the shops to open because the news of Centre’s decision spread like wildfire across the city and many shop owners resumed their business. Altercations between officials and shop owners were reported in some parts of north and north east Delhi. They showed a copy of the MHA order on the phones to the officials to support their decision to open their shops,” said a senior official.The police and the district magistrates informed the CM that it will be impossible to go to every nook and corner of the city and get shutters down of shops now, a second official said. “So, it was decided to comply with the MHA orders,” the official said. As per the latest order issued by the Delhi government on Saturday, all registered shops, except those in containment zones, will be allowed to operate in the national Capital. The Delhi government, however, made it clear that other relaxations such as opening industries and allowing self-employed persons to work will not be permitted. It also clarified that all outlets which render services such as restaurants, salons, barber shops and so on will continue to be shut. Besides, sale of all non-essential items by e-commerce firms will also continue to be prohibited until further orders. The Delhi government added that a decision of any further relaxation on the existing lockdown restrictions will be taken on Monday.On Saturday morning, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain hinted that the national Capital could get some relaxations from April 27.“There are 95 coronavirus hot spots in Delhi. The entire district or the entire city is not (a hotspot),” Jain said replying to a query from reporters on whether the Delhi government was considering easing the curbs enforced to contain the spread of novel coronavirus.Several outlets such as stationery shops, electronic stores, hardware shops among others were opened in different parts of the city on Saturday. Many of those shops, in areas such as Laxmi Nagar and Lajpat Nagar, were closed after police intervention.The traders welcomed the government’s decision with the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) saying that Delhi has around 75,000 such neighbourhood shops that will benefit with the latest relaxation. “We are requesting all traders that before opening shops, they should thoroughly sanitise their shops and also ensure sanitisation of commercial markets. While opening the shops, the health safety rules released by the ministry of health & family welfare must be followed in letter and spirit,” said BC Bhartia, national president, CAIT.CAIT secretary general Praveeen Khandelwal said, shopkeepers and their staff should wear masks and gloves. “Sanitisers should be made available. The owner should ensure that they sanitise every incoming customer while maintaining social distancing,” he said. Brijesh Goyal, convener Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI), who is also Delhi state head of Aam Aadmi Party’s trade wing, said shops located in markets and shopping complexes have not been given permission to open yet. He pegged the number of shops that would benefit form Saturday’s order at 1.5 lakh. “All commercial markets will also remain closed until further orders. Besides, those areas which have markets will also not open as of now. Those who can open are standalone flower shops, bakery shops, gift shop, books and stationery shops, mobile shops and so on,” he said. Shops selling essential items such as groceries and poultry and medical stores have been operational throughout the lockdown. However, the Delhi government’s decision to comply with the Centre’s directive did not go down well with Residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in the city. Most of the associations wanted an extension of the lockdown.“This will cause crowding on the roads and social distancing will go for a toss. The government’s own projections show that the Covid-19 situation is not good. The CM had two days back said that the number of coronavirus cases may increase if relaxations are given, then what changed in these two days. Cases are being reported from each of the 11 districts, then why hurry. The government should have waited at least for May 3 and then should have taken a decision after assessing the situation,” said BS Vohra, president, federation of east Delhi RWAs.Rajiv Kakria, member of GK-1 RWA said that both the central and state governments are unaware that more than 60% of shops in Delhi are in residential areas due to mixed-land use.“The malls and shopping complexes being closed will have no impact as mixed land use shops are on almost every road in any colony, village or unauthorised area. Opening these shops will throw all lockdown rules to the winds and there will be chaos. Do we even have enough police personnel or district officials to man each and every lane of the city and check if social distancing is being followed?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-delhi-govt-allowed-shops-to-open-after-mha-directive/story-W66qn2yhSzUvMAA7hvfyWN.html
26-04-2020||Gurugram||Bhondsi: 35 kilos of marijuana seized, one arrested||The police arrested a 30-year-old man late Tuesday near Bhondsi for allegedly possessing 35 kilograms of marijuana (ganja). According to the police, the man allegedly procured the banned substance from an Alwar dealer and peddled it in smaller quantities. He had procured the consignment for ₹4.80 lakh but had paid only ₹20,000 as advance and had planned to sell the marijuana at the rate of ₹250 for 10 grams. The police registered a case against him under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at the Bhondsi City police station on Friday night.The man was identified as Salem Khan of Tauru in Nuh.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said the Khan is a history-sheeter and has been involved in the drug trade for the past 18 months. “He worked as an electrician in his village but could not make ends meet. He discussed his financial condition with one of his friends in Alwar, who introduced him to drug smuggling,” he said.Earlier, Khan would allegedly go to Alwar to buy the consignment and later sell it to small-time dealers in Nuh and Gurugram areas.A police team, headed by Bijender Hooda, inspector, crime unit, Palam Vihar, arrested the suspect based on secret information near a farmhouse in Bhondsi around 11pm when he had allegedly received the consignment and was walking back home.Hooda said Khan was carrying a sack in which there were around 15 sealed packets. “He had received a call from the supplier to pick up the consignment from Gurugram on Friday. He took lifts in trucks and motorcycles to reach Gurugram and was planning to return via the same mode of transport but was caught,” he said.During questioning, the suspect allegedly told the police that the kingpin of the trade sourced marijuana from Odisha and sold it in smaller quantities. The consignment from Odisha reached Alwar in trucks carrying essential supplies and was later sold to dealers in Rajasthan, Nuh and Gurugram, the police said.The police said they received a tip about a consignment of drugs that was to be delivered in Bhondsi. A team from the Palam Vihar crime investigation unit set a trap to apprehend the dealer near the farmhouse.Sangwan said they are yet to identify the kingpin and the Alwar dealer who had come to deliver the consignment. “We are on the lookout for his aides,” he said.The seized marijuana will be sent to the forensics lab at Madhuban in Karnal, the police said.The suspect was produced at the district court on Saturday and sent to 14-day judicial custody.Earlier on April 16, the police had arrested two men allegedly in possession of 107 kilograms of marijuana, estimated to be worth at least ₹50 lakh, from a housekeeping shop in Udyog Vihar. One of their suppliers, a Bangladesh national, was arrested from Delhi a day after.According to the police, the gang was active in Delhi-NCR and its members allegedly sold smaller consignments of 10 kilograms each to drug peddlers for potential sale to peopleSangwan said that during questioning, the suspects had revealed that they had sourced the marijuana a few days before a nationwide lockdown was announced to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“Suspects these days are peddling drugs by walking down from other districts through fields. They have increased their prices during the lockdown and are managing to supply the consignment to several dealers in the city. Due to frequent police patrols, their movement within the city is restricted. We have arrested nine people from the city in the last one month, are mapping the areas from where these men were arrested and have increased patrolling to ensure there is no supply of drugs in the city,” Sangwan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/bhondsi-35-kilos-of-marijuana-seized-one-arrested/story-ENW9ZIFQXHIMd3PLwejH1L.html
26-04-2020||Delhi||44 health care staff at Babu Jagjivan Ram hospital test Covid-positive||The 100-bed Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital in Jahangirpuri has now become a Covid-19 hot spot, with at least 30 health care workers testing positive on Saturday for the disease in the Delhi government-run hospital, highlighting the dangers front line workers are exposed to, in the fight against the contagious coronavirus disease. In total, 44 health care workers from the Jahangirpuri hospital have tested positive.The national Capital has so far reported 2,625 of Covid-19, 54 of whom have died, while 869 have recovered.Of the 111 new cases, 24 were among samples that were collected by health care workers from the 95 containment zones in the city. So far 257 people from these areas have tested positive. Across the city, 132 health care workers have contracted Covid-19. However, there have been no reports of any deaths amongst the 132 so far.Initially, the infections were detected in some staff members working in the DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course) centre of the hospital, which TB patients visit to get their medicines. The centre has been closed and sanitised earlier this week. “However, the cases that turned positive on Friday night were from across the hospital – including security staff and healthcare workers from different departments,” said a doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity.As staff members quarantine, a doctor from the hospital said, “We have asked the government for staff from other hospitals to run the services.”The hospital is situated in the middle of a hot spot, with six of the seven containment zones in north district located in Jahangirpuri. The authorities are yet to trace the source of any of the infections. “Many of the people working at the hospital live near areas from where cases are being reported. Patients from Jahangirpuri also visit the hospital. Now, with the government saying that many are asymptomatic, we do not know where the infection actually came from,” a doctor said. One of the junior residents and the chief medical officer of Babu Jagjivan Ram hospital had reported Covid-like symptoms a week ago, but the hospital did not get them tested, after which they got themselves checked. When their reports returned positive, the other doctors from the hospital demanded they be tested, and had to resort to a strike for a few hours on Monday, after which around 200 samples were collected.The hospital is yet to decide how to prevent further infections. So far, a flu clinic had been set up to screen patient with flu-like symptoms who had international travel history or history of contact with positive cases. The hospital receives around 2,000 people in its outpatient clinics a day.This comes after several health care workers from Lady Hardinge Medical College’s paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) started testing positive for the contagious disease last week. So far, at least 13 health care workers have tested positive from the ward. Another doctor from the ward meant to admit children with Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (Sari) has also tested positive. Two children from the ward — a 45-day-old and a 10-month-old — also tested positive for Covid-19. The 45-day-old succumbed to the infection last Saturday, making him the youngest person in the country to die of Covid-19.A similar series of infection was detected in health care workers at the Delhi State Cancer Institute towards the end of March, with a 35-year-old resident doctor from the preventive oncology department testing positive first. Twenty-six health care workers have tested positive for the infection so far in the hospital. Four patients, one of their family members, and the child of a nurse from the hospital also tested positive for infection. The hospital had to be shut for over two weeks to ensure that the infection is not passed on to immunocompromised cancer patients. The cancer hospital has started its out-patient clinic and will start running the chemotherapy department soon. Of the total Covid-19 cases in Delhi, almost 66% of those infected are below the age of 50, according to the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin. Less than 18% cases are recorded among those above the age of 60. However, almost 54% deaths are in those 60 years or older.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/44-health-care-staff-at-babu-jagjivan-ram-hospital-test-covid-positive/story-625LLb1UVTpiEyGmgytiuK.html
26-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s power consumption over last one month lowest in 11 years||The daily average power demand in Delhi during the month-long lockdown has not only seen a 35% dip from the previous year, but it has also turned out to be a period with the lowest average electricity consumption in the capital over the past 11 years at least.Delhi was among the first cities to impose a lockdown -- it came into effect in the capital city on March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown on March 24. Reports prepared by the state power department revealed that Delhi had not witnessed such low electricity consumption between March 23 and April 24 in any year since 2009. HT could access Delhi’s power consumption reports since 2009. Data prior to 2009 was not provided. “The average power demand in the past one month has been 2,560MW, which is 35% lower than last year’s consumption during the same period. If we go back even further, the average consumption in the year 2009 was 3,156MW for the same period,” said a senior official in the power department. At the same time, the maximum power demand has been 3,169MW which is 40% lower than last year’s peak (5,263MW) during the same period. Breaking down the data further revealed that the daytime peak demand dropped by over 40%. This implied that a major contributor to the reduction in electricity consumption was the closure of commercial and industrial establishments. Under the lockdown, only factories manufacturing essential items are allowed to operate. Malls, offices and shops, other than those selling essential items, are shut until further orders by the state government. “The peak electricity demand during the night has reduced by around 25%. It was expected that the percentage reduction during the night would be lower since the consumption pattern at that time otherwise remains almost the same throughout the year,” said an official of a distribution company. Delhi has around 5.5 million domestic consumers. Power officials said the electricity consumption pattern suggests that people had started practising restrain by staying indoors more even prior to the lockdown started.“Malls, gyms, schools, colleges and other such institutions were shut prior to the lockdown which had an impact. Many people on their own also reduced their movement fearing they would contract Covid-19 or spread it,” the official said. “Data suggests that Delhi’s peak power demand in March considerably declined, even before the lockdown was announced. On March 15, the national capital’s peak power demand was 3421 MW that sharply reduced by around 33% on March 22 to 2294 MW. On the same dates last year, the city’s electricity demand was 3776MW and 3095MW respectively,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-power-consumption-over-last-one-month-lowest-in-11-years/story-OyowAFBj2XeTz02GNnyy2J.html
26-04-2020||Delhi||57-yr-old south civic body worker first fatality of Covid-19 among sanitation workers||A 57-year-old sanitation worker of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), who had tested positive for Covid-19 and was on ventilator support at AIIMS Trauma Centre, succumbed on Saturday. The man used to lift garbage in Bhogal, Jangpura. At least three other sanitation workers have tested positive for the virus and are admitted to various hospitals in the city.This is the first case of a municipal sanitation worker succumbing to the virus in the city. On April 21, a female sanitation worker — who worked with the east Delhi municipality in Jwala Nagar area of Shahdara — had died of “acute respiratory distress” at Lok Nayak Hospital. She was tested and had later reported negative for Covid-19.Till Saturday 2,625 Covid-19 positive cases had been detected in Delhi with 54 deaths. In Saturday’s case, relatives claimed that the man — despite his age — had been attending duty daily till April 16 “for the fear of salary deduction” and had most likely contracted the disease “on the job.” However, south corporation officials said that the man had showed up to work only twice since the lockdown. “We express deepest condolence on the sad demise of one of our safai sainiks. He was posted in the Daryaganj ward and admitted at AIIMS on April 22 as a Covid-19 positive case. However, he was also suffering from liver-related issues and had been earlier treated at Holy Family Hospital and availed medical leave from December 19, 2019 to February 5, 2020 for the same. He attended duty only twice this month, April 4 and April 11, of his own free will. He was not posted in any Covid-19 hot spot or disinfection work,” a senior official with the corporation said.“South corporation has asked all its sanitation workers who are 55-year-old or above not to come to work as per guidelines and will extend all possible help to the family,” the officer added.However, the nephew of the dead sanitation worker said, “He was attending work daily. He even had a curfew pass to be able to go through the police barricades.”Leader of Congress in SDMC and councillor from Amar Colony, Abhishek Dutt, said, “We demand chief minister Arvind Kejriwal provide Rs. 1 crore to the family of the man and one government job at least.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/57-yr-old-south-civic-body-worker-first-fatality-of-virus-among-sanitation-workers/story-kd6BcxjCzj0pbISzTgnjTL.html
26-04-2020||Delhi||Three more policemen test Covid-19 positive, 31 cops infected with Covid-19 till now||A Delhi Police head constable, who was posted at outer Delhi’s Alipur, on Friday tested positive for Covid-19, triggering panic among his colleagues since his place of posting or duty was not in any of the city’s 92 containment or ‘red’ zones. Until Friday evening, 31 Delhi police personnel had tested positive for Covid-19. Police suspect the head constable may have contracted the infection from someone in Jahangirpuri, where he lives. Jahangirpuri in north west Delhi has reported several cases and has six containment zones. “There is a possibility that he may have come in contact with an infected person in Jahangirpuri while travelling between his home and workplace. It’s a matter of concern because many police personnel live in or around the containment zones in Delhi-NCR. They commute daily from such areas to reach their place of duty,” said a senior police officer. Joint commissioner of police (northern range) Manish Kumar Aggarwal said that the head constable was sent for testing on Thursday as he showed symptoms of cough and fever. “The policeman’s test result on Friday confirmed that he had been infected with the disease. His residence is in Jahangirpuri but not in any of the containment zones,” said Aggarwal.Eleven other policemen of Alipur station, who came in contact with the head constable in the last few days, have been sent to self-isolation. They will all be tested in the next three-four days.Between Thursday and Friday, two more constables from central Delhi also tested positive for the virus. Police said both the constables were asymptomatic but their samples were taken as they were posted in the areas from where positive Covid-19 cases had been reported in the last fortnight.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia said the constables were posted at the Nabi Karim and Jama Masjid police stations respectively. “The two constables are young and had no symptoms of the infection. They have been shifted to a quarantine facility where they will remain under medical observation,” said DCP Bhatia, adding that screening of more than 200 police personnel from the district has already been done.The central district is one the worst-hit areas in the city. The Chandni Mahal police station has been sealed after many cases of Covid-19 were reported. The police officers of Chandni Mahal station are currently working from the Jama Masjid police station building. Meanwhile, a letter issued from the Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava’s office on Friday said that financial assistance of Rs 1 lakh is being granted from Delhi Police Welfare Society to personnel, who were infected with the virus during duty. In the wake of rising Covid-19 caes among police personnel, Shrivastava has appointed six senior joint commissioner rank officers to visit police stations across the city every day and ensure that police are ensuring social distancing norms. The six officers have to submit their report to the police chief every evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-more-policemen-test-covid-19-positive-31-cops-infected-with-virus-till-now/story-Kkq4M6PtzjBvpJyoTZ9I2M.html
26-04-2020||City||Mohali MC approves Rs 2 lakh compensation for death by stray animal||The Mohali municipal corporation (MC) has decided to pay ₹2 lakh as compensation for death caused by a stray animal. In its last General House meeting held via video conferencing on Saturday, the civic body approved of registration, proper control of stray animals and compensation to victims of animal attack bylaws.The Mohali MC, which has 50 councillors, got dissolved on Saturday after completing a five-year term and now, all the decision making powers are vested with MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg till next elections take place.Garg said that the MC will pay compensation in case of death caused due to attack by a stray animal, but in a case where a pet animal is involved, the owner will have to pay the compensation.He said that the penalties collected for violating the bylaws will be used for maintaining animal pound, payment of compensation to victims of stray animals attacks and cost of identification and veterinary healthcare of stray animals.Mayor Kulwant Singh said, “These bylaws were long awaited and will go a long way to check the menace of stray animal, including dogs, cattle and monkeys.”The MC has clarified that no compensation will be paid if the attack was due to provocation or negligence of the victim, he added. As per the approved bylaws, in case a person becomes disabled due to the animal attack or bite, the person will be entitled to ₹2 lakh compensation, provided the civil surgeon issues a certificate. Earlier, Mohali had no bylaws to govern stray animals and compensate the victims.Only two dogs per family allowedUnder the bylaws, the MC had put a cap on the number of the animals that can be owned by a family. As per the bylaws approved now, each family in Mohali can keep only two dogs. MC has given six months for getting the pets registered.MC commissioner said that the registration of pet animals, be it a cat or a dog, is mandatory and will be valid for 12 months. The registration will have to be approved by April 30 every year, he said. For dogs, the registration fee will be ₹500. Late fee of ₹100 will be charged if there’s one-month delay while ₹200 will be charged for a two-month delay. However, for a delay of more than two months, money worth five times the registration fee will be charged. Besides, the animal will be impounded and maintenance charges of ₹200 per day will be levied.Chain your dog before taking out for walkWhile taking out pets for walks in public places, the animal should be muzzled and chained.

26-04-2020||Chandigarh||Heat poses new challenge for Chandigarh admn in feeding the poor||After food scarcity and supply mismanagement, rising temperature has now become a fresh challenge for the Chandigarh administration in helping out the poor with free ration and cooked food.In the light of April 22 fiasco at Mauli Jagran during which hundreds jostled on the street for free ration, UT food supplies and consumer affairs department improved the distribution with a new coupon system.HT team checked multiple spots and found that as the distribution is slow paced and performed mostly in day time, there was no escape for people from the sunny heat as the mercury touched 39 degree Celsius on Saturday.In Daria, a village opposite the city railway station, ration was distributed on Saturday among 300 beneficiaries in two shifts: 10am to 12pm and then 3pm to 4pm. Among them, 80 were those who failed to get ration on Friday and were called again.Siya Ram, a daily wager, said that he got no ration on Friday since the stock was finished before his turn. “Today I was denied ration on some identification issue. Coping with all this in such heat is next to impossible, but we are forced to bear it out of sheer hunger,” he said.A volunteer, Sunil Singh, said the UT authorities must consider how difficult it is for the people to get delivery in the scorching heat. “The authorities should ensure that those being called for ration must get it on the same day,” he said.‘GETTING COUPONS AT HOME, WHY NOT RATION’At the Sector 56 distribution point inside a government school that is catering to 2,500 beneficiaries from Sectors 53 to 56, a long queue of 400 was given ration between 10am to 4pm, albeit with much hardship.Satinder Kaur, 43, a housewife, said, “I am diabetic. Waiting in queue for hours is making me nervous. If I can get coupons for ration delivery at my doorstep, why can’t I get ration too? Their should be shorter cues or at least provision of some shade.”Parminder Kumar, 40, a sweeper, said, “Due to the lockdown, our life has become all about standing in a line. Earlier it was for cooked food and now it is for wheat and dal. I feel fatigued and frustrated every day.”Satpal, 57, taking turns with his wife Asha, 50, while standing in a line, said, “Our children are at home alone and here we are struggling to make ends meet.”Transporting heavy quantity of ration back home is an even greater challenge for them. Many were seen arguing with rickshaw-pullers over fare. Area councillor Satish Kainth said he had proposed to the food department to distribute ration in different areas of his ward so that people get it near their homes. But the latter could not manage due to limited resources.Those who did not get coupons were left anxious. Sayida, 27, who works as a tailor at home, said, “My husband is no more. I hope that in his absence, I will get ration as his name is there on the list.”CONG WRITES TO UT ADMNMeanwhile, local Congress president Pardeep Chhabra on Saturday wrote to the UT administration, suggesting shifting ration and cooked food distribution timings to 8am-11am and 4pm-6pm so that people do not have to stand in long queues and bear the heat. Chhabra also suggested that cooked food delivery be advanced by at least one hour. Department secretary Vinod P Kavle did not respond to the text messages or calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/heat-poses-new-challenge-for-chandigarh-admn-in-feeding-the-poor/story-a0wffGHcTugBbrZX3ZKs9M.html

26-04-2020||Chandigarh||Apply for movement pass online to recover impounded vehicle in Chandigarh||To prevent chaos and crowding at the Traffic Lines in Sector 29, Chandigarh traffic police have made it mandatory for violators to avail a movement pass online before coming to recover their impounded vehicles. According to the new mandate by the UT’s traffic police, the pass will be issued as a message on the phone and will be valid for a limited time to prevent misuse. Discussing this, Kewal Krishan, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic administration) of Chandigarh, said, “The new rule will facilitate better management of the swarm of people who come here, as about 100 to 200 vehicles are impounded everyday. Also, many people were violating the curfew to come to Sector 29, or after getting their impounded vehicle released. In some cases, people who were stopped at nakas for violating curfew, used this as an excuse. The movement pass will be valid for limited hours only and will prevent misuse.”The movement pass can be applied via the e-saathi app of the Chandigarh police. A shortcut has been created on the main window of the app, where one must upload a copy of one’s challan in pdf format while applying for a pass or else the pass will get cancelled. Impounded vehicles can be four days after they are impounded and anyone going to Traffic Lines without a pass will be liable to be booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian penal Code (IPC) for violating curfew.Owing to strict checking of those violating curfew, the number of challans related to driving licences in Chandigarh have increased by 2.5 times this year, as compared to 2019.As per data with challaning branch, up till 24 April this year 9,142 challans were issued for driving without procuring a licence and failure to produce driving license on demand of a policeman.
