01-04-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 cases double in Punjab in one week||The number of COVID-19 cases in Punjab has doubled in the past one week, with the state recording 23 more cases since March 24, taking the tally to 46.An analysis of the data released in media bulletins by the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) of the health and family welfare department reveals that till March 23, out of total 251 samples tested across the state, 23 were found positive for the virus. And in the next seven days till April 1, the figure touched 46, with the state conducting a total of 1,260 tests so far.What could be termed as a relief for the government is the fact that whereas the first 50% cases came out from 251 samples, the next 50% came out from 978 samples taken between March 24 to April 1.“Things appear to be positive till date as the rise in the cases has not shown a clear-cut pattern. During four days after March 18, the state witnessed 26 cases, whereas in the next four days it recorded only nine cases. The number decreased to five in the next four days. It clearly shows that things are very much under control,” said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, spokesperson of the health department for COVID-19.The first case of coronavirus was reported in Punjab on March 9. He was a Hoshiarpur resident, who has now recovered and has been discharged from the hospital.Notably, Punjab has also increased its testing capability in the past one week from 80 a day in two labs in Government Medical Colleges in Patiala and Amritsar to 360 a day. However, till date samples of only symptomatic patients are being sent to these two laboratories.In case of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, which tops the tally in the state with 19 coronavirus cases and has been marked among the seven Covid-19 ‘hotbeds’ across the nation, out of 361 samples tested during the past five days, none was found positive.The district administration has sealed 15 villages falling under Banga subdivision and has quarantined nearly 700 suspects who came in contact with Baldev Singh who died due to coronavirus and his other contacts.Out of 19 positive cases in SBS Nagar, 14 are family members of Baldev Singh, the first coronavirus casualty in the state who died on March 18, almost ten days after his arrival from Germany via Italy.Out of total 46 cases in the state, 27 are said to have got the virus from Baldev, his religious guru Gurbachan Singh and another associate Daljinder Singh. All three were together during their visit to Germany. The state has witnessed four deaths till date.According a senior official dealing with the treatment of Covid-19 cases, all cases undergoing treatment, including a two year from SBS Nagar, are stable and responding positively to treatment.“None of the Covid-19 patients is on ventilator at present. Some of the patients from SBS Nagar will complete 14 days of their treatment on Thursday and we will start taking their fresh samples,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-cases-double-in-punjab-in-one-week/story-MZEKqV5fzFc5xK2SWRCMcI.html

01-04-2020||Chandigarh||Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar in NRI belt has nearly half of Punjab’s positive cases, making it the state’s Covid-19 hotspot||With 45% of the total coronavirus cases in Punjab and nearly 1,000 people quarantined in 15 villages sealed by the health authorities, Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar, earlier known as Nawanshahr, has emerged as the state’s Covid-19 hotspot.Coronavirus reached Pathlawa village with the return of a granthi (Sikh preacher) from Germany via Covid-hit Italy, Baldev Singh, 70. He landed in India on March 7 along with his religious teacher who heads a local dera, Gurbachan Singh, and another granthi, Daljinder Singh.Baldev Singh died after a heart attack at the civil hospital in Banga on March 18 after a brief illness. The next day, the result of his samples were received and it was found that he was suffering from Covid-19. His guru also tested positive and is in the isolation ward at the SBS Nagar civil hospital. But before they were diagnosed with Covid-19, they kept on meeting dera followers and relatives in nearby villages.UNAWARE, PREACHER KEPT VISITING PEOPLEBaldev Singh’s death triggered panic in the area and nearly 1,000 residents of 15 villages were quarantined.Since Baldev had returned via Italy, he had been advised avoid social gatherings for a fortnight but he kept visiting people.Deputy commissioner Vinay Bublani said till date 361 samples of suspected people have been taken from the 15 villages.

01-04-2020||Chandigarh||Vegetable market near Jalandhar bypass closed till Friday||There is no relief for city residents in terms of vegetable supply as the main vegetable market near Jalandhar bypass would remain closed till Friday as the district administration is working out a plan to reduce the crowding in the area. As per information, no sale of vegetables and fruits would be allowed at the vegetable market and supply would be done at the ward level, and that too only through registered commission agents (ahrtiyas) and vendors.The market has been closed since Tuesday, a day after a huge rush of vendors was witnessed in the area, defeating the purpose of social distancing. The administration officials said that despite several warnings, the rush of residents and vendors was not receding due to which the market had to be closed to control the spread of the disease.While chairing a review meeting at Bachat Bhawan in mini-secretariat on Wednesday, deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Agrawal said that to ensure regular supply of fruits and vegetables in the city, a new system is being developed.He said that a separate commission agent (arhtiya) would be deployed at each of the 95 wards of the city and the agent concerned would bring fruits and vegetables to an earmarked place in that particular ward, from where street vendors would collect the produce and then take it door-to-door for sale. He said that 20-25 street vendors would be allocated to each ward. The commission agents would be identified by the district mandi officer, while the sites and street vendors would be decided by the civic body.Agrawal said that as the administration is working to reduce the rush in the market, the supply would be done at ward level. “It would take two days to streamline the process and the supply in the city would commence through the vendors from Saturday. The administration is trying its best to ensure residents don’t face any trouble,” he said.The DC further informed that cooked food is being distributed to more than 1.5 lakh people in the city everyday and several NGOs, social, religious and industrial organisations are supporting the district administration in this.He assured that the supply of food packets being sent by the state government would also start in the district shortly. The DC said that the food packets have arrived and the distribution would start shortly.Agarwal further said that four ventilators from Ludhiana civil hospital have now been shifted to Christian Medical College and Hospital, where a separate ward has been set up for Covid-19 patients. He clarified that all shops selling essential commodities can carry out for home delivery, and even vehicles carrying essential commodities such as milk can operate. He urged the residents to apply for e-pass and assured that if their reason is valid, they would get permission within two hours. He also said that employees of all government departments do not need any separate curfew pass and they just need to carry their official ID card, that has to be presented whenever asked for.Residents will have to bear the brunt: Vendors bodyLudhiana Rehri Fadi association president Tiger Singh said residents will face shortage of supply for the next two days as vendors do not have adequate stock to supply the vegetables for the next two days. However, the step is necessary to check the virus from spreading, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vegetable-market-near-jalandhar-bypass-closed-till-friday/story-1PVqtGQGgyINuzuaRdOs3K.html
01-04-2020||City||EDMC steps up measures to contain infection at corona hot spot Dilshad Garden||New Delhi: The East Delhi Municipal Corporation on Tuesday deployed two 9,000-litre tankers of disinfectant and over 100 workers to disinfect Dilshad Garden, one of the 10 Covid-19 hotspots in the country. The moves come after the corporation began intensifying its operations in Dilshad Garden and nearby Babarpur, where a mohalla clinic doctor had tested positive for the disease on March 25.There have so far been six confirmed cases of the severely contagious Covid-19 in Dilshad Garden — a 38-year-old woman, two of her relatives, a mohalla clinic doctor posted in the area who was diagnosed on March 21, his wife (the mohalla clinic doctor at Babarpur) and their daughter.The east civic agency on Monday received a list of nearly 1,000 people who come in close contact with the mohalla clinic doctor at Dilshad Garden.“We have got the list of the people and their phone numbers, but don’t know where they stay, yet. We are calling them to find out their location and have requested the Delhi government to provide locations of the area. As for Babarpur, we have got the mohalla clinic and the neighbouring areas disinfected,” said Ranen Kumar, deputy commissioner for Shahdara North zone, EDMC.A senior Delhi government official said, “We have provided the details to the civic agency. The list was shared a few days back.”Of the 97 Covid-19 cases reported in the national capital so far, 13 are from East Delhi — Six in Shahdara North and seven in Shahdara South zone of the EDMC.While all the six cases in Shahdara North are from Dilshad Garden, the seven cases in Shahdara South are from Anand Vihar, Shyam Enclave and Bahubali Enclave in Karkardooma, Kalyanpuri, Khichripur, Vasundhara and Mayur Vihar.To contain the spread of the coronavirus disease, the EDMC has identified around 1,600 flats, most of which are in J, K, L and R blocks of Dilshad Garden.Kumar said, “We are spraying disinfectant, and spreading awareness everywhere, but with a focus on these blocks in Dilshad Garden where the 38-year-old woman and her doctor and their respective families live.”The woman, who returned from Umrah, a pilgrimage to Mecca — tested positive for Covid-19 on March 18. The civic body said they are spraying disinfectant everywhere — roads, lanes, alleys and walkways. Kumar added, “We have earmarked around 1,600 flats here over an area of about 1.5 square kilometres, and are extensively spraying sodium hypochlorite, a sanitising solution. Not only are we spraying it on cars, building walls, but the colony park as well. Dust suppressants used during peak winter air pollution have also been deployed here now,” he said.The civic agency has pressed into service 17 tankers of 9,000-litre capacity across east Delhi to spray the disinfectant twice a day. A senior EDMC official said, “We will increase the number of tankers to 40 over the next few days.”The civic body is carrying out an awareness drive, informing people about the symptoms of Covid-19 and asking people to report if anyone has these symptoms.Around 100 domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) have been deployed, who are going to the 1,600 flats and asking residents if anybody has developed symptoms.Arun Kumar, spokesperson, EDMC, “Munaadi, a traditional method of creating awareness through drum rolls and loudspeakers conveying messages is also being used.”The first coronavirus positive patient from Delhi, known as “patient zero”, was from Mayur Vihar Phase 2, and has recovered now.With Dilshad Garden as a hotspot, EDMC commissioner Dilraj Kaur said the agency is following all the instructions given by the union ministry of health and family welfare and the Delhi government. “Special arrangements for garbage collection have been made here for quarantined homes. This garbage is not being mixed with the rest, and is directly sent for incineration,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/edmc-steps-up-measures-to-contain-infection-at-corona-hot-spot-dilshad-garden/story-SBSPvAoyH0n30LDgUWWiIJ.html

01-04-2020||Gurugram||To avoid spread of Covid-19, Haryana bans sale of chewing gum till June 30||The Haryana food and drug administration department on Wednesday banned the sale and use of chewing and bubble gum in the state till June 30, on the suspicion that their use and disposal may lead to the transmission of Covid-19. As per the order, issued by the department’s commissioner Ashok Kumar Meena, as the coronavirus disease is transmitted through droplets, there is a possibility that chewing gum could carry and spread the virus. The decision under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. Amandeep Chauhan, an officer in the district’s food and drugs control department, said, “It is a precautionary step to avoid transmission of coronavirus by a symptomatic patient through any of these items. People have the habit of spitting in front of others, which has to be avoided. To keep the situation under control at least for some time the prohibition has been imposed.” Likewise, the department has also been asked to implement the ban on gutka (chewing tobacco) and pan masala for a year. The state government in 2019, had imposed a ban on the sale and distribution of tobacco products. In the wake of Covid-19, the department has been directed to check the sale and distribution of scented or flavoured tobacco, gutkha, pan masala, and kharra (a powdered combination of tobacco, areca nut, lime (chuna) and katechu). “We will inspect shops and keep a check on the market to prevent the sale of any of these items for at least three months,” Chauhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/to-avoid-spread-of-covid-19-haryana-bans-sale-of-chewing-gum-till-june-30/story-UEj399Sdi2LXYaYPmyvvpO.html
01-04-2020||Delhi||Govt will give ₹1crore to corona warriors who die treating Covid-19 patients||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced a financial assistance of Rs 1 crore for families of doctors, health workers and sanitation workers who die while providing services to Covid-19 infected patients.“If anyone, irrespective of whether they are from the private or government sector, loses their life while serving coronavirus patients — be it sanitation workers, doctors or nurses, — their family will be provided Rs 1 crore as respect to their service,” said Kejriwal, who along with Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain, addressed health workers in the city through a video conference on Wednesday.Kejriwal equated health workers fighting against Covid-19 with the armed forces and pointed out how there is a similar financial assistant scheme in place for people in the armed forces who are residents of Delhi.He further said, in case any doctor, health worker or sanitation worker is affected by the virus, all expenses of his/her treatment will be borne by the government.Delhi has so far recorded at least 120 coronavirus cases and two deaths.Kejriwal said that his government is open to the possibility of having dedicated hospitals for treating virus-infected patients in case the numbers increase with time.The chief minister also maintained that Delhi has yet not slipped into the stage of community transmission – a stage in which the source of infection can no longer be traced.He said that more tests need to be conducted for a fair assessment of the scale of the spread of the virus, but admitted that there is a shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE) and testing kits in the city. He also admitted how multiple attempts to procure these essentials recently did not yield results owing to shortage in the market and logistical reasons.“Once again, I urge the Central government to provide us with more PPEs and testing kits. For people who want to donate in the CM relief fund, I also urge them to help us procuring testing kits and PPE,” said Kejriwal. He further said, “Security of hospitals is an issue. Patients and their relatives are angry. There is also certain stigma against people suffering from coronavirus because the disease is highly contagious. I have learnt about a patient trying to commit suicide in one of the hospitals. For security, I have already requested for more police deployment in hospital premises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-will-give-1crore-to-corona-warriors-who-die-treating-covid-19-patients/story-YsAsPO0V5hJKnObKd2F6xN.html
01-04-2020||Mumbai||49 distilleries in state get licences to make sanitisers||In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, 49 distilleries in the state have been given licences to produce hand sanitisers. The distilleries have a collective production capacity of over 4.5 lakh litres per day. After getting the licences, most of them started producing liquor-based sanitisers as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and started selling them at subsidised rates.Maharashtra has 119 distilleries which produce liquor and ethanol from sugarcane molasses they get as a by-product during sugar production. Since the production of liquor has been banned during the coronavirus lockdown, the central government had asked the distillers to produce sanitisers.As per directives by the Centre, the state excise department and food and drugs administration (FDA) has given licences to the distilleries for the production. Many leading distillers like United Spirits Limited, Jubilant Life Sciences, GM Breweries limited have started production of hand sanitisers. “We have given licences to 49 distilleries for the production of sanitisers to meet the increased demand. The highest number of licences have been issued in Maharashtra to ensure that there is no shortage in the market. The manufacturers are mandated to sell the sanitisers at the price fixed by the central government,” said Arun Unhale, FDA commissioner. Although the manufacturing units have started production, they are facing a shortage of packing bottles which are made in China. “After the central government’s directives, we gave them licences in the last eight days. Though they have started production, the manufacturing units are facing a shortage of packing bottles that are generally manufactured in China. Thus, the distilleries have started supplying the sanitisers in cans to hospitals to refill their containers,” said an official from the excise department.Ramchandra Mahuli, managing director, Rajarambapu Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana in Sangli, one of the 49 distilleries granted licences, said, “We are producing hand sanitisers in bottles of 100ml, 200ml and 1 litre and selling it in the market at the rates ascertained by the central government without earning much of the profit.”A spokesperson from United Spirits Limited said that they have started production in eight states, including Maharashtra, and it is being distributed free of cost to government hospitals as part of their CSR activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/49-distilleries-in-state-get-licences-to-make-sanitisers/story-FLpXdaju8CRx2XQeLbZXLI.html
01-04-2020||Mumbai||SevenHills to be India’s largest Covid-19 facility||Within two weeks, Mumbai will have a 1,500-bed isolation centre at the recently-converted quarantine facility at SevenHills Hospital, in Marol. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which gave its final nod to the project on Tuesday, said this would be the biggest Covid-19 isolation centre in the country.With a growing number of reported Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, the BMC and state authorities are looking to set up large isolation centres, instead of smaller ones, to curb the possible spread of the Sars-Cov-2 which causes Covid-19. With 1,500 beds, Seven Hills Hospital will be the biggest isolation facility in India, said the BMC. “We already have 350 quarantine beds at the hospital and another 100 isolation beds. But in the next 10-15 days, we will extend the isolation bed facilities to 1,500 at the hospital itself,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health) BMC. Of the 1,500 beds, 100 will have ventilators.BMC also plans to hire 1,000 nurses to work at the centre and 500 nurses will work in three daily shifts once the centre is operational.HT had previously reported that the BMC had converted Seven Hills Hospital, which was shut down in 2018, into a 350-bed screening and isolation centre over 60 hours. It became operational as a screening centre on March 18. At present, 145 suspected patients are quarantined at Seven Hills Hospital, which also collects samples to send to Kasturba Hospital for testing. Dr Mohan Joshi, who has been in-charge of the hospital since it was re-opened in March, is among those quarantined.Mumbai currently has 2,000 isolation beds — 1,000 in civic-run hospitals and rest in private and the government-run hospitals. The BMC is working on a plan to expand these facilities too. “Due to cancellation of non-emergency services, several beds are vacant which can be used for isolation both in private and government sectors. In KEM alone, we have 2,000 isolation beds,” said Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of KEM Hospital.A tender to revamp the civic-run Kasturba Hospital will be floated in the next few days, said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “We have two wards — 13 and 15 — which are exclusively used for the treatment of epidemic outbreaks. We will first redevelop ward 15 and then we will start with ward 13,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sevenhills-to-be-india-s-largest-covid-19-facility/story-hlHHdrEzImeiFPbmUSM7QO.html

01-04-2020||City||Seventy-five who attended religious congregations quarantined in Ghaziabad||The district health department officials Wednesday evening said they have identified and quarantined 75 persons who had attended different religious congregations, including the one at Delhi’s Nizamuddin in March. The officials said 70 of these persons were sent to quarantine while five were sent to isolation as they showed symptoms of Covid-19.More than 2,000 people were evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, which has now become a Covid-19 hot spot, with at least 53 who attended the congregation in Mid-March testing positive for the virus.Different states, including Uttar Pradesh. and Union territories are making efforts to identify, trace and quarantine people who attended the congregation at Nizamuddin.“Till 7pm Wednesday, we have picked up about 75 persons who attended different religious congregations. Some of the 75 persons may also include contacts of attendees. Five persons have symptoms such as cough and fever, and they were sent to isolation wards. The other 70 have been put in quarantine at a private college where we have set up a 100-bed quarantine facility. Our doctors are available there,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said.He said 75 persons picked up so far are from areas such as Masuri, Dasna, Sahibabad, Loni, among others. This number is likely to rise further, officials said.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond on the issue on Wednesday.Across the state, efforts are on to identify people who attended different religious gatherings.“In UPm we have found 569 persons who attended the Tablighi Jamaat and other such gatherings. The arrangements for their quarantine have been made in different districts and monitoring is done by respective district magistrates and superintendents of police. About 218 foreign nationals who had come to UP on tourist visas are also placed under quarantine. They had not given information upon their arrival at the local police station as they were mandated to do,” UP’s additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said during a press briefing in Lucknow.“As per norms, those who have come on tourist visas cannot attend programmes like the one held by Tablighi Jamaat and also cannot take up missionary activities. Their documents are also being verified and legal action will be taken against them,” he said.Meanwhile Amit Mohan Prasad, UP principal secretary (health), said there is no community spread of coronavirus so far in the state. He said the state saw two deaths (residents of Basti and Meerut) on Wednesday but they are trying to find out how the Basti resident was infected despite having no travel history to foreign countries.“As a result of social distancing and lockdown, the number of cases in UP is not surging. On March 28, we had 49 cases which increased to 68 on March 29 and further to 87 on March 30. On March 31, we reached 101 cases and 113 on April 1. So the quantum of increase is low over the past three days,” he said.The officials said he UP police, since the lockdown, has registered 6,594 FIRs in which 20,581 persons were booked and about 8.16 lakh vehicles were checked at 5,261 barriers on roads.“The UP CM has also directed that in order to intensify the sanitisation and fogging activities, fire tenders should be roped in. We expect that the activity will start by Thursday,” Awasthi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/seventy-five-who-attended-religious-congregations-quarantined-in-ghaziabad/story-iK5xvMxo8f2yg1ibBeUxvI.html

The department has also decided that in case workers are facing any problem or they are in need of something, they can contact district town planner RS Bhath, planning assistant Satinder Arya, or Satbir Singh, who is a senior draughtsman, on 9815531460, 9812923999, 9810350911, respectively.Bhath said that they have identified at least 85 locations of various project sites where the workers were working. “There are 21,000 workers who were engaged in construction work, as per a survey conducted by our team. Now all efforts are being made to ensure that cooked meals, dry ration, medicines and other essentials are made available to them as per the orders issued by the director, DTCP,” he said.The team members said that feedback is taken daily from the developers engaged in relief efforts and a report is sought, which is then sent to the headquarters in Chandigarh. DTCP officials also said that they had conducted a survey last week to assess how many workers have been engaged by developers and what were their requirements. “An assessment was made as to what their immediate requirements were. Also, the developers were asked that they should ensure that contractors paid the pending wages to them so that they have money in their pocket,” said Bhath.DTCP officials said that at the beginning of the lockdown, it was observed that while large builders were able to help workers, smaller firms were slow in taking these measures. “Our goal is to bring the entire relief effort on the same page so that all workers associated with the city’s real estate industry are taken care of,” said another official, requesting anonymity.Developers said that they were working hard to provide relief to the workers and are coordinating with the DTCP.Real estate major DLF said it will ensure distribution of about 27 lakh meals in urban slums, and among construction workers and migrants in Gurugram and other parts of the national Capital region. “We are also distributing medical supplies, ventilators and masks to help all affected people,” said a company spokesperson.Vatika Developers said that they are delivering food packets to construction workers and migrant labourers, along with other essential supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-dtcp-forms-10-member-team-to-help-construction-workers-shares-contact-details-for-aid/story-AYqJwnLiPaDUTxLU3fBP5K.html

While 46 FIRs were against those who gathered at a spot, 37 were for unnecessary use of vehicles, 2 against hotels, 1 against pan shop and six against other shops that stayed open.“Across Maharashtra, 10,505 FIRs have been registered for violating lockdown orders,” said Vinayak Deshmukh, assistant inspector general of police, law and order, Maharashtra.The Twitter handle - @MumbaiPolice – received 700 complaints on lockdown violations, social gathering and shops operating with partially closed shutters. In two cases, permissions were sought to attend the funerals of close kin, to which the police asked them to get in touch with their local police station. Those seeking approval to move out for medical emergencies were told to carry necessary documents. Pranaya Ashok, deputy commissioner of police, operations and spokesperson for Mumbai Police, said, “We received thousands of calls on 100, a majority of which are complaints about people not following lockdown orders.”Senior police officials across Mumbai Police claimed so far no police personnel has been home quarantined. However, the railway police confirmed that one of their personnel tested positive for Covid-19 and his colleagues have been sent for testing. The police are finding patrolling the vast and densely-populated slum pockets tough, even though they are distributing masks and making announcements urging slum dwellers to stay indoors.  Sudhakar Kamble, senior inspector of Powai police station, which has Tunga village slums under its jurisdiction, said, “Two areas have been sealed.” Sudhir Nigudkar, senior inspector of Meghwadi in Jogeshwari (E), said, “Two localities, Imampada and Premnagar, are sealed.” Three residential areas at Vakola, Santacruz (East) were sealed by the civic body after a Covid-19 positive patient found. Kailas Awhad, senior inspector, Vakola police station, said, “After migrants, we have now started identifying beggars and are sending them to shelter homes.”In Ramabai Nagar at Ghatkopar, police are briefing local leaders to ensure residents stay indoors. In Vikhroli (east), where new cases were reported, the police are trying to keep rumours at bay. “The area has been completely cordoned off,” said Sanjay Dalvi, senior inspector, Vikhroli police station.In Kurar village, Malad (East), the Jain Mandir area and Pathanwadi have been declared containment zones. “In Kalyan, on March 31, we seized 96 vehicles and registered 46 cases under various laws,” said Datta Karale, additional commissioner of police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-92-firs-for-flouting-lockdown-orders/story-sqKA1Sw3swrs2MnpG2YRrM.html
01-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad police starts surveillance unit for verifying movements, contacts of Covid-19 patients||The health department, aided by the police, have started tracking down people who may have contracted Covid-19, using their call records, efforts which so far led to 17 people from a Noida firm and more than 15 who attended religious congregations across the country being traced.No new cases of the contagious disease were reported on Wednesday.Rajneesh Dube, UP additional chief secretary (medical education), had held a review meeting with Ghaziabad officials on Tuesday and had stressed on the need to use electronic surveillance to find suspected patients, with the help of their call records.Under the electronic surveillance measures, the police obtain CDRs of suspects, and can track their contacts and locations with the help of data obtained from cellular operators.Prakash Kumar, Ghaziabad superintendent of police (crime), was appointed as nodal officer of the district medical surveillance office (DMSO) on Wednesday.“We are cross verifying disclosures of patients using electronic surveillance, because many are disclosing incorrect information about their movement in questionnaires. Similarly, a Covid-19 suspect’s contacts can also be traced using their call detail records,” Kumar said.The questionnaires are handed to suspects or potential patients of Covid-19 to ascertain their travel history, trace their contacts, and determine if they or those around them need treatment.“Several people have not made disclosures about their travel history, and whether they came in contact with any Covid-19-positive persons. These steps are important to stop the spread of the coronavirus,” he said.Ghaziabad district has so far recorded eight positive cases of Covid-19, two of whom have been discharged. Two of the active cases are of a couple who were tested positive by a private laboratory. Both are currently under isolation.“After surveillance, we received a list from the Ghaziabad police of 19 other employees of Noida-based firm Ceasefire who are residents of Ghaziabad. Five of the 19 are not in Ghaziabad, while three of them have already been declared negative. Two of them are admitted in Noida hospitals, and the rest have been tracked,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.So far, 24 persons, employed or indirectly linked with the fire safety solutions firm have tested positive for the virus in Gautam Budh Nagar district alone. These 24 include 13 employees and 11 family members. The firm’s office was sealed on Tuesday.“All Ceasefire employees have now been located. We have informed the respective police and administration officials details of the whereabouts of the other five employees,” he added.Health department officials said two employees of the company, a 30-year-man and a 37-year-woman, are in isolation in MMG Hospital. They have passed on the infection to two more persons who are being treated in Ghaziabad.The woman’s husband also tested positive for the disease on March 28. The residents of Savior Park high-rise came in contact with about 93 persons in their society. All 93 are under quarantine and being monitored by the health department.The second employee from the Noida-based company, the 30-year-old man, came in touch with a man from Ghaziabad’s Duhai area who had contracted the disease. On Wednesday, Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, Ghaziabad also called upon residents to inform police of potential patients or their contacts so that protocol may be initiated.“Any Covid-19 patient, and people who are their contacts, must inform the police or health department. Anybody who is aware of such information should also approach authorities. Anyone who has travel history in March must also disclose such information. In case of any laxity, legal action will be initiated,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-police-starts-surveillance-unit-for-verifying-movements-contacts-of-covid-19-patients/story-0vX1le9Plr9bzzP6HKx6qJ.html

01-04-2020||Gurugram||Ex-Covid patient, who was accused of hiding travel history despite immediate action, urges people to not spread rumours||On March 17, 29-year-old Rohit Sharma had to rush back from Oxford in United Kingdom at a notice of a few hours as he was informed by his office that all international flights would be banned from entering India starting March 18 in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Sector 83 resident had no option, but to reschedule his initial plan of flying out on March 19.“Even the thought of getting stuck in an unknown country is scary when each day you read about increasing number of Covid-19 cases and deaths,” said Sharma, a finance expert with a multinational company (MNC) who had been working in different cities across UK since January. On March 17, he took the first flight back to India via Dubai. He reached his residence around 6:30am on March 18 with clear symptoms of Covid-19, none of which were even vaguely felt even a day earlier. “I had no symptoms till the time I was in the UK. It is likely that I contracted the virus while I was at the Dubai or Delhi airport. The moment I landed in Delhi, I left the airport and reached home at 6:30am. I started to shiver and developed a high fever,” said Sharma, who immediately took an OTC drug and contacted the local doctor.“Knowing my travel history, the doctor advised me to get tested for Covid-19,” said Sharma, who immediately visited the Civil Hospital in Sector 10 to give his swab sample. “That day, I was just given medicines to see if the symptoms persist even after the medicine takes effect. Doctors asked me to visit the hospital the following day if there was no improvement in the health,” he said.Sadly for Sharma the fever and shivering did not abate for the entire day. His sample was taken on March 20 and the next day he was confirmed positive for Covid-19. “The moment I was told I was Covid-positive, I felt everything in my life slip out of my hand; my heart started beating faster. My parents, who stay about 3km away from me, were stunned and silent,” he said. However, the biggest scare was for Sharma’s wife with whom he had spent two days before being hospitalised. Her sample was also taken for Covid-19 testing. “She was alone at home and was immediately put under home quarantine; thankfully, she tested negative. Our neighbours used to drop groceries at the doorstep for her. She handled everything on her own while I was in the hospital,” said Sharma, who confessed that he was very scared when he first saw the isolation ward. “It became less scary for me when I saw two other patients in the isolation ward. They were siblings and lived in Palam Vihar. Our beds were at 1-2 metres apart. We introduced ourselves and spent time talking about the transmission of coronavirus and symptoms we had experienced. Twice a day, our vitals were checked. None of us showed any severe symptoms so we were allowed to use our phones. There was nothing else to keep myself occupied with so I used to talk to my wife for about four hours a day, checking on her. Never in my life have I seen so many entertainment series,” Sharma said.RUMOURS AND SOCIAL MEDIAAs Sharma and his wife spent their days cut off from the world, rumour mongering was in overdrive on social media, particularly WhatsApp groups. “It was disturbing to read rumours about us. People said things like we had hidden our illness, stayed in the society without any check-up for a week and put others in the society at risk. I had to finally write in one of the groups introducing myself and stating that if people have any queries, they should approach me instead of stigmatizing my family and I,” Sharma said, adding that stigmatized was not a solution and urging that people should not spread rumours. Asked when did he feel scared, if at all. Sharma said it was the day the other two patients were discharged. “That night was scary. I was the only one in the isolation ward. That night I couldn’t sleep. I was in a terrible mental state. The next morning, I contacted the district health officer to enquire about my reports; I was in a hurry to leave. Later in the day, I was told my second confirmation report showed I was negative and I could be discharged,” said Sharma, who was discharged at 5pm on March 30 and has been put under home quarantine for the next 14 days. Sharma now hopes to see his parents after the home quarantine period ends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ex-covid-patient-who-was-accused-of-hiding-travel-history-despite-immediate-action-urges-people-to-not-spread-rumours/story-okW5wP8DZ1LJeYarLlGX0L.html
01-04-2020||Noida||Covid-19 outbreak shatters bumper rabi harvest dreams of part-time workers||The nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 outbreak has had other implications besides the obvious. It has shattered the dreams of several farmers-turned-part-time workers in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, who were expecting a bumper rabi crop this year. Thirty-five-year-old Mangal Sah wheels his vegetable cart in the streets of Sector 62. Though he now earns more than he did before, he is not a happy man. He curses his fate for not getting a reservation on a Bihar-bound train before the announcement of the 21-day nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak.Sah, however, is not worried about losing a job or eking out a livelihood; he owns a two-storey home in Loni, Ghaziabad. “Selling vegetable is not my permanent vocation. I came to Delhi 15 years ago with my father and we’ve been working here since then. My father deals in property and I chip in. Our family stays with us. But, back home in our native Pratapganj, Bihar, there is no taker for our five bigha-worth of a bumper wheat crop this year,” he said.Standing beside him, his father Raghuvir Sah breaks down, saying that they live in Delhi-NCR just to make money so that they can buy more land back home. “I have seen the plight of landless farmers in our village. It was my dream to become a landowner, that’s why I moved to Delhi and started working as a daily wager in a plastic factory. Since then, I have not wasted a single penny and bought eight bighas of land, besides purchasing an eight-room house in Loni. People like us return home every year during this time for the harvesting season. This time, with our return halted because of the nationwide lockdown, availability of labour will be hurt,” he said and claimed that this year they were supposed to harvest wheat worth over ₹1 lakh.The Sahs, however, are not an exception. Echoing similar views, Rajinder Yadav, who hails from Barapalasi village in Dumka district (Jharkhand), says that he is unable to sleep worrying over his blooming wheat fields back home.Yadav, who works as a caretaker in a tyre company, located in the C block of Sector 63. “After unseasonal rainfall caused considerable damage to the kharif crops late last year, the rabi harvest was expected to be a bumper crop because of higher soil fertility and water reservoir levels. But, all our dreams are shattered now,” he said.Ajay Pal Sharma, a Greater Noida-based farmer and Uttar Pradesh state general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), too, sympathise with the plight of these migrant workers. “These farmers are the biggest losers of this lockdown. A factory can restart and increase its production at any time, but farmers can’t. First, it was the adverse weather conditions that shattered hopes. And, now the directive issued by the state government, which restricts the farmers using combine harvesters, straw reapers and threshers, to operate in groups of not more than 2-5 people, is leading to problems” he said.Sharma also said that the farmers of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand have been asked to intimate their gram panchayats concerned about their movements. “The government has ordered that while cutting crops, along with the landowner, only two more people are permitted as long as they maintain a distance of at least two metres between each other. Not only that, if anyone involved in harvesting is suffering from a cold, cough or a fever, they are to go for a check-up and will not be permitted to harvest the crops. The situation is far from normal for farmers. The government must make adequate arrangements to send the migrants to their hometowns so that they can contribute to harvesting,” the BKU leader said.The Gautam Budh Nagar district labour department, however, is having a hard time locating these part-time workers. Deputy commissioner (labour) Pradeep Kumar Singh said that such workers, mostly associated with construction companies, come once or twice in a year, to earn during the offseason, while farming remains their main vocation. “Of 1,94,611 workers registered with the district labour department since 2008, some 38,000 have renewed their registration. We contacted their employers, who told us that most of them did not return to those companies after a year or two. During this lockdown, our officials who are trying to locate their details say that lesser than 10% of them available on the mobile phone numbers given at the time of their registration,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-outbreak-shatters-bumper-rabi-harvest-dreams-of-part-time-workers/story-KcyQ0kn42eysi83hg5a94K.html

Our sector is highly dense, with a large village — Carterpuri — that has a large population and unauthorised colonies like Om Vihar and Dharam colony, with thousands of migrant workers living here,” the RWA stated in the letter.It also stated that they have not received any directions from the police or administration, but only through forwarded messages.“No doubt your office (administration) is doing lots of good work on Covid-19, but as an RWA, we have a good reach among the local population and can support the administration effectively, acting as a force multiplier in many ways,” said Bhawani Shankar Tripathy, RWA, general secretary.The letter stated that the RWA can keep people informed with authentic and verified messages on Covid-19 and can ensure an effective lockdown, in cooperation with the administration.“RWAs can keep a tab on any travel history of any individual or family, be it foreign or local travel. RWAs can support in the distribution of emergency materials like sanitisers, masks, gloves, food, etc. RWAs can keep a tab on services provided by the administration, such as the supply of essential items like groceries, vegetables and dairy products, and help in other activities,” said Malkhan Singh, RWA president.Other RWAs too said they want to administration to rope in their help.Bhim Singh Yadav, president, Sector 22 RWA, said, “This step on part of the administration is urgently required because we know workers much more than government officials and can work effectively. Tens of thousands of people are still in pain as their jobs have been hampered and they are ready to leave the city.”Many individuals and industrialists are already taking initiatives to help the stranded workers. Without commenting on any plan to rope in RWAs, Haryana chief secretary, Kesni Anand Arora, said, “People should inform the local administration if help is required in any particular area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-sector-23a-rwa-seeks-permission-from-district-administration-find-help-migrants-in-nearby-slums/story-6lUGQUbxsRjG3ZF77mMGqI.html

But now we are on the verge of entering the third stage, where community transmission of Covid-19 happens. It is the stage, where infection occurs in people, who neither have a travel history nor have made contact with any traveller. In third stage, we do not know who is a carrier,” Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority, said.“According to experts, one person can infect 1,024 persons.

People should not act foolishly and maintain social distance,” he added. The authority issued the advisory on social media and urged all social groups including residents’ welfare associations(RWAs) and apartment owners associations to motivate people to stay home and cooperate in fighting Covid-19.“The Greater Noida authority has started an excellent campaign and we all should come forward to support it.

01-04-2020||Gurugram||Coronavirus lockdown: Six FIRs filed against shopkeepers for black marketing essential goods||The Gurugram Police on Wednesday—Day 8 of the 21-day nationwide lockdown to combat spread of coronavirus—registered six cases of black marketing against shopkeepers in three markets of the city after a ground recce based on multiple complaints from residents. Action is yet to be taken against the shopkeepers, but the top cop has warned that anyone found indulging in black marketing would be arrested on the spot. Gurugram commissioner of police Muhammad Akil said FIRs were lodged on Tuesday under Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act-1980, based on the complaints of residents and daily wagers from Sushant Lok-1, Sector 31 and Sector 40. If convicted, a person may face jail of 6 months under the Act. “We had warned shopkeepers to not sell essential commodities at more than the MRP. Despite regular supply from wholesalers, they were found selling goods at a mark-up and refusing to sell goods to those who questioned their malpractice,” Akil said. Akil said they formed four teams on Tuesday and they were given the task to keep a check on shopkeepers indulging in malpractices and to send decoy customers to get ground report from markets across the city. Reports of black marketing are becoming increasingly common in Gurugram as packaged dry ration has run out and these items are now being sold by the kilogram. Unlike packaged ration, these packets do not have prices, allowing the shopkeepers to charge as they please. There are also reports of suppliers increasing prices of mineral water.However, like residents, shopkeepers, too, are crying foul saying that they were also being fleeced by wholesalers because the demand has increased. “Due to the high demand of groceries and snacks, we have no choice but to agree to their (wholesalers’) price quotation. Even the demand for tobacco and cigarettes has increased. Earlier, a packet of cigarettes which used to cost ₹350 is costing us ₹500, so we sell it for ₹600,” Sector 40 shopkeeper Suresh Thakran said. Warning against such practices, the police reiterated that all shopkeepers must display a rate list outside the shop, and that they would be booked if selling above MRP. On March 25, the district food civil supplies and consumer affairs controller issued a release stating the price list of essential items. The prices of goods per kilogram are ₹25 for loose flour and parmal rice, ₹36 for sugar and ₹20 for salt. Prices for pulses per kilogram are ₹90 for urad dal, ₹95 for moong dal, ₹57 for chana dal and ₹80 for tur dal.Akil said they have ordered all shopkeepers to paste a rate list of grocery items outside the shop and mention the number of local police station. “Anyone found indulging in any illegal activity will now be arrested on the spot,” he said.“We will take stern action against people who are taking benefit out of the crisis that has increased people’s dependence on local shopkeepers for essential goods,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/coronavirus-lockdown-six-firs-filed-against-shopkeepers-for-black-marketing-essential-goods/story-Y3iFN0uqQuz0GnbDOj4BUJ.html
01-04-2020||Gurugram||Six-fold increase in MCG funds for environment, water supply in 2020-21 budget||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is likely to increase the allocation of funds for environment-related works and water supply significantly in its budget for the 2020-21 financial year.According to officials with knowledge of the matter, the increase will likely be to the tune of Rs 60 crore, six times its budget for the same in the previous fiscal. They added that the increase is needed as the MCG wants to convert places near drains into recreational areas, such as the Badshahpur drain, and has been looking for suitable sites for it. The allocation for the same in the last fiscal was Rs 10 crore.At the five-kilometre stretch of the Badshahpur drain, between Vatika Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk, the MCG has set up jogging, cycling and walking tracks, as well as sitting space for an open-theatre, among others. In addition, the MCG has planted native trees and shrubs in the area along with creating spaces for groundwater recharging.In March, the MCG had initiated a survey of drains across the city and identified Gwal Pahari and Jharsa drains as potential sites for undertaking a similar venture, assessment of which officials said would take place later this year.“With the city expanding rapidly, it was realised that a higher allocation of funds was needed to preserve the environment and simultaneously undertake initiatives which would result in both conservation and spaces for citizens to undertake recreational activities,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.Environmentalists, meanwhile, said that the MCG should also allocate some of its funds for checking environment-related violations.“The MCG should also look at creating an environmental task force whose sole focus should be on surveillance and patrolling across the city to curb violations such as tree felling, illegal construction and demolition waste dumping, burning of waste, illegal mining, and illegal dumping into storm water drains. This too will help the city preserve its environment, along with giving greater attention on increasing it as well,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environmentalist.Under the water supply category, MCG officials said that funds are likely to be increased by almost three times in the 2020-21 fiscal. Officials said that the civic body may reserve around Rs 100 crore for this fiscal against Rs 30 crore allocated in the last budget.Officials said that the increased funds will also be used for improving water supply in several sectors operated by the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran that were transferred to the MCG last year, as well as the MCG’s larger objective of installing water meters across all domestic and commercial establishments in the city.The MCG only has 33,000 registered water connections in the city, even though it is estimated that there are nearly six lakh properties falling under its jurisdiction.Property TaxMCG officials said that the civic body is expecting to net a collection of around Rs 800 crore in the 2020-21 fiscal, against its expected collection of Rs 250 crore last fiscal.In the previous month, the MCG had prepared a list of 197 properties whose owners owed the civic body more than Rs 20 lakh in property tax, and identified 243 properties whose owners owed the civic body between Rs 10-20 lakh. In addition, the MCG had also sent notices to 150 liquor shop owners last month for pending property tax.During the two pre-budget meetings, officials had said that the MCG was going to be concentrating on recovering pending property tax dues in the 2020-21 fiscal.The draft 2020-21 budget was sent to the Directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) for approval on March 27. Officials said they are expecting communication from ULB on the matter within the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/six-fold-increase-in-mcg-funds-for-environment-water-supply-in-2020-21-budget/story-6Jctyu1C0UsmwOmbSAxMGJ.html

01-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus outbreak: 108 ambulance service runs without protective gears||rupsa.chakraborty@htlive.com Drivers and doctors operating the ‘108’ ambulance service have alleged they are not provided personal protective equipment (PPE) and sanitisers, and the ambulances are not disinfected regularly. The 108 service has been taking suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients to hospitals across the city. As per the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) guidelines, ambulances should be disinfected after transporting patients exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19, which is caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus.Ambulances operated by 108 — named after the telephone number for the service — assign one doctor to each patient being transported to hospital. WHO has made it mandatory for ambulance staffers to use PPE while carrying confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients. However, Bharat Vikas Group, which runs the ambulance service with the state government, has not provided either PPE or sanitizers, alleged staffers. Umesh Kumar (name changed upon request) is associated with a civic-run Covid-19 isolation centre. “Two days ago, I transported a suspected patient from Mumbai suburban to Kasturba Hospital. I also help put the patient on a stretcher. This exposed me to the virus, but I didn’t have hand sanitizer. I immediately bought soap to wash my hands,” he said.Atiq Khan, leader of Maharashtra Mathadi Shramik Kamgar Sangharsh Union, said the union has asked the government to provide its members with medical insurance worth Rs 50 lakh for Covid-19. “We are putting our lives at risk every day by carrying patients to hospitals and we aren’t covered under medical insurance,” he said.Khan also alleged ambulances are not disinfected as per WHO guidelines. “The service providers don’t even disinfect the ambulances, which make those sitting on the seats later vulnerable to the infection,” said Khan. State authorities said it is not responsible for ambulance staffers’ PPE. “It is the duty of the service providers to ensure the safety of the workers. We will look into it,” said Dr Sadhanna Taide, director, Directorate of Health Service, Maharashtra.Dnyaneshwar Shelke, CEO of the service said that there are 30 ambulances that cater to COVID-19 patients and all the staffers have been provided with protective kits. “People are trying to spread fake information. All staffers working with coronavirus ambulances have PPE. In other ambulances we have given general masks along with hand sanitizers. We are going to file complaint against the people for making false allegations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-outbreak-108-ambulance-service-runs-without-protective-gears/story-UxMf51oRD7WDIrLVZAvtzH.html

A majority of the new zones are from the suburbs. The containment zones are sealed by the civic body, with the police barricading the spots to bar the entry or exit of residents.With the number of cases on the rise, state health minister Rajesh Tope chaired a review meeting of BMC officials on measures taken to treat Covid-19 patients, testing and isolation bed facilities. Tope was briefed about the situation in the city. Since March, the civic body claims to have completed over 6,100 tests, including those by private labs. “The number of positive cases is higher in Mumbai because the testing facilities have increased. A lot of the patients are from the outskirts, who had approached our facilities owing to lack of testing facilities in their area. Most of the new detected cases are safe and with mild or no symptoms due to early detection,” said a senior official. The BMC has planned to increase the total bed capacity at SevenHills Hospital upto 1,000. In a recent meeting on Covid-19, top civic officials had decided to increase its isolation bed capacity upto 2,000. The BMC has appointed 33 nodal officers across the city who will ensure food supply and logistics to be provided at 10 shelter locations made for them. The officers will have to prepare a list of people requiring shelters, shifting identified persons to shelter homes, monitoring, and also identifying NGOs to assist and ensure supply of food and other essentials.An analysis of the total positive cases found in Mumbai shows that people with travel history and their close contacts account for more than 90% of the cases. This means that a majority of the positive cases found in Mumbai either they have a travel history or are their close contacts. As per the BMC data, 25 patients are found to have traveled to the UAE, while 12 people had flown down from the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-shutdown-45-more-areas-are-now-no-go-zones/story-mJzUn3048bmwsifcVY5RGM.html

Though there is no mandate given to the group to carry out any such screening by us, any help is appreciated,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health director of BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/one-rupee-clinic-volunteers-screen-people-at-societies-for-covid-19/story-aYaz2SvchW7foLs3OsO5kO.html

01-04-2020||Delhi||Migrant exodus leads to labour shortage at farms||For the past one week, Sukhbir Dagar, a farmer in southwest Delhi’s Dhansa village (Najafgarh area), has been trying to arrange labour and a machine to harvest mustard and wheat crops.But to no avail, as a large number of migrant labourers in the area have left for their hometowns after the 21-day national lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week.“We prefer to manually harvest the mustard crop, as there is a 15-20% loss of crop if harvested by a machine. But there is a shortage of labour,” Dagar, who owns 10 acres of land in the village and has rented 80 acres for farming, said. “Now, I’m looking to hire a machine, as we have to harvest the mustard crop (spread over 30 acres) in the next 3-4 days. I also have to harvest wheat from the first week of April. But even the machines we usually get from Punjab are not available in adequate numbers due to the lockdown. This time just 2-3 machines are available till now due to the lockdown as against 10-12 which were available till last year,” he added.Farmers in villages located in the Najafgarh area largely grow wheat, mustard and vegetables. According to the Economic Survey of Delhi 2019-20, the total cropped area in Delhi is 34,750 hectares. The production of wheat in the national capital in 2018-19 was 82,876 metric tonnes.Another major concern of the farmers is taking the crop to the mandis and getting the right price. “There is no labour available. Small farmers don’t have adequate space for storage and due to the lockdown, there is not much business in the mandi. I don’t know how will we sell it,” Pradeep Dagar, another farmer who owns four acres of land in Dhansa, said.Due to the fear of the spread of Covid-19, a majority of traders at Agriculture Produce Market Committee at Najafgarh have decided to close their businesses till March 31. “Our families don’t want us to go out. So, a majority of traders are not going to the mandi. We will take a call on whether to restart work in a day or two,” Sushil Mittal, head of the traders’ association, said.But Naresh Sharma, chairman of APMC Najafgarh, said, “The mandi is open. Though whoever wants to do business can come. There were problems in the initial days. Though the business is affected, we are hoping it will recover in the next few days. Now we are issuing passes to people.”The area where food-grain crops are planted has decreased over some time, as more farmers are taking to vegetable farming. However, the shortage of labour has adversely affected all farmers, including those who grow vegetables.In Dichaon Kalan, a large number of farmers are involved in vegetable farming, mainly of cauliflower. But farmers say that taking their produce to the market has become a real challenge for them. Similar problems abound in Narela. Bhupinder Bazad, a farmer who owns 42 acres of land in Hiranki village in Narela, said that farming is a labour-intensive job and apart from harvesting, labour is needed to clean the produce, store it and take it to the food grain or vegetable markets. But the work is adversely affected due to shortage of labour.“On 50% of the land, I grow vegetables. For this, we need labour. In the initial days of the lockdown, we were not even allowed to go to the farms. Even the temporary mandis in the village were not allowed to be held. The labour started leaving fearing job loss due to the lockdown. I’m working with 50% of the labour staff,” Bazad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/migrant-exodus-leads-to-labour-shortage-at-farms/story-AHTtTCVJQRtOH2Kw0IIBuL.html

Bengaluru-based Yulu Bikes is tying-up with essential service suppliers to facilitate hyper-local deliveries in the city and Navi Mumbai. However, unlike its concept of shared mobility, those renting the bikes can keep it for a month to ensure doorstep delivery and sanitisation.A spokesperson from Yulu Bikes said, “Our initiative is to support the corona warriors who are helping deliver essential services to people. Setups like chemists, local grocers can use the bike. Even citizens can use it as a personal vehicle for a month if they are stepping out to buy essentials.”The mobile application has also been customised wherein only the vehicle owner can unlock the vehicle for the stipulated period. “The idea is to not use it as a shared vehicle during this period,” the spokesperson added. The services have already started in Bengaluru with 200 e-bikes. The company will be charging citizens ₹90 per day for the facility. Yulu Bikes was one amongst the top nine teams selected by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) in November 2019, when the authority ran a technology-driven challenge to look at smart mobility solutions in the city.

01-04-2020||Mumbai||IIT-B’s fact-checking platform will help verify coronavirus news||Amid the coronavirus outbreak in the country, many fake news and rumours are doing the rounds. To dispel these rumours, a team of scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, have launched a fact-checking platform that helps in verifying news or claims.Director of IIT-B Subhasis Chaudhari, on Tuesday, announced the launch of the platform ‘KauwaKaate’ on social media. This platform developed by students and faculty of the department of computer science engineering can verify news articles, text messages, social media posts, pictures as well as videos, using the platform which is available via WhatsApp, mobile app and a web-interface.The website is available at http://kkfactcheck.in/ or the KauwaKaate Fact Checker application can be downloaded onto an android phone. It works for textual, image and video queries.One can simply send a query to 8369749660 on WhatsApp asking if a viral or forwarded message is true. Alternatively, users can submit queries for checking the veracity of news, pictures, articles or texts on either the mobile application or the website. The query is extracted onto a dashboard, which users can access using a login.“We see if the item has been fact-checked previously by checking them against a predefined set of India-focused fact-checking sites such as check4spam.com, boomlive.com, Alt News, and other leading news sites. We crawl these sites regularly and perform a search on our server on the crawled data. For images, we look for exact matches, and if that fails, we do a partial image match,” said Kameswari Chebrolu, associate professor, IIT Bombay. “If an article/image does not match either of the above cases, we have a few automated checks that we carry out,” she added.The platform is a part of a three-year project funded by the Government of India. The team plans to scale up operations and do more research on automated checking. “For example, we wish to check against a set of sites known to be biased on a particular topic (say politics), and tell the user that their search article appears on such a site, and they should dig deeper and not necessarily accept it as is. We do not believe that the software should remain open-sourced so that other people can pick it up and work on it,” said Chebrolu.The platform also provides additional features in the form of combining similar articles submitted by different users under the same task (task merging), identifying language, possible category of these articles, gathering existing evidence on the Internet via automated means and presenting the same in an organised fashion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-b-s-fact-checking-platform-will-help-verify-coronavirus-news/story-GH0H0004bhwaZB06Q9y3lK.html

He has been ordered to report at the police station, under whose jurisdiction he will spend the furlough period, every alternate day. The convict had approached the high court after his four pleas for furlough were rejected by jail authorities on the grounds that earlier when he was released on furlough, he reported in April 2013 - 855 days later than the due date. His appeals for the leave were also rejected by the home department. The high court allowed his petition, stating that overstaying the leave once cannot be a reason in perpetuity to reject furlough to a convict forever. The bench stated that the leave can be granted by imposing suitable conditions of reporting to thepolice station concerned every alternate day. The bench also took into consideration that as a punishment for reporting back late by 855 days, Gill’s 240 days of remission were forfeited and his name was removed from the remission list for a period of 3 years and that period has already expired.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/overshooting-furlough-cannot-be-reason-to-deny-leave-forever-bombay-hc/story-X8ZFlCCPbebDhOBp2YngTN.html

The court cited that most victims of the contagious pandemic have been senior citizens as they have a weak immune system. The arrested was arrested for molesting a 10-year-old girl in Cuffe Parade. “The accused is a senior citizen and if he stays in jail then he would be vulnerable to contracting Coronavirus or other diseases in overcrowded city prisons,” argued advocate Sunil Pandey, representing the accused. Upon hearing the defence’s argument, the court was granted bail to the accused on Monday. While granting bail on a bond for ₹15,000, judge BV Kale said, “The applicant is a 62-year-old and is suffering from ailments. Hence, considering the present circumstances the applicant is released on PR bond.” The incident had taken place on February 22 around 4pm when the accused took the 10-year-old girl near a temple in Cuffe Parade and molested her. The minor went home and told her parents, following which a complaint was lodged. The accused was booked and arrested and was kept in judicial custody since.

With a restriction on movement, NGOs, shelter homes and volunteers became worried about the fate of the animals. The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi requested people to take care of any such animals, and his efforts were consolidated by MP and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi who announced that dog feeders can now get feeder passes. The application can be made either online or at the respective DCP’s office. Any dog feeder can go to their district DCP office in delhi and get a feeder pass. Please start today as only 50 passes are being given per district.“I applied for the feeder pass online and got it through the District Magistrate. I was given a number on Whatsapp according to the district I fall under and had to send my details there. And that was it! It was a smooth process. But going to the DCP’s office was a pain. I thought I will apply for it both ways, but had to wait for three hours. I had to stand in the line and there were more chances of infection. There were about 300-400 people. You have to wait to get a form, then again get in the queue to submit the form, and collect the pass the next day. They (the authorities) are not to blame because they are processing a lot of applications,” says Vikash Aggarwal who lives in Delhi Cantonment and goes to central areas including Safdarjung Road, Chanakyapuri to feed strays.Basic precautions, such as carrying sanitisers and wearing a mask, in place, some of these volunteers are also feeding strays locally and keeping it low profile. “I live in NOIDA sector 45 and some of us have spoken to the SHO here. He told us we can feed the strays here but to not do so in groups. The authorities recognise the regulars and according to the local police station, we can do without the feeder pass,” says NOIDA-based business owner Deepak Saxena. Day 6 of #feedingstrays in #Delhi. I am posting thez updates daily so tht all of u reading my posts lend a helping hand in feeding stray #animals around u. Feed thoz u can. Help the needy. Seeking your help in spreading the word @deespeak #AnimalsArePeopleToo #BeKind #StayAtHome pic.twitter.com/U4CyWHKoRSFeeder pass or no, people are finding ways to feed strays, either by showing notices circulated by the concerned authorities or by working on the goodwill of the police. “The DM has told some people that if you have food in your car and you are going to feed, no one is going to stop you. We also have a letter from the Chief Secretary’s office, UP, that says the police should help those who are out to feed stray animals,” says Anuradha Dogra a NOIDA resident, who was previously associated with SPCA before it shut down and was taken over by the UP government as Animal Hospital and Shelter, NOIDA.“I got a curfew pass because my NGO is in Gurgaon and I live in Saket. I went to the DCP office in Vasant Vihar where they have put up a counter to collect the form. I submitted some documents including the RC and driving license. I got the pass the next day and have no difficulty in going out and feeding strays,” says Divya Parthasarathy.

01-04-2020||Dehradun||COVID-19 Warrior: Uttarakhand man uses his car as ambulance in remote hilly regions amid lockdown||With  state and district borders sealed and travel services suspended due to nation-wide lock down to contain the coronavirus outbreak, a 32-year-old man from Devprayag in Tehri Garhwal district has started using his car as an ambulance cum essential services delivery vehicle to help people in need.Ganesh Bhatt, 32, from Devprayag got the idea of using his vehicle as an emergency service after he learnt from a few locals that drivers in the area were scared to take patients to and from hospitals fearing they might contract the virus. Bhatt can be contacted on 9410530387.“We all know how the healthcare system is in the hilly regions of our state; ambulance services are not efficient even at the best of times and to top that, now local drivers do not want to take people to hospitals even if they are paid Rs 2000, as they are scared they might get infected. So I started using my own car as an ambulance,” said Bhatt.He started taking people to health centres near his region since March 22 and since then he has helped 24 people get timely treatment, including a pregnant woman.“I have got distress calls from families of pregnant women who were not able to find ambulances on time. I recently took one woman to a health centre for first aid after she was bitten by a monkey, then a small boy who had fractured his hand. I myself have a one and a half year-old son, but I feel that people need to be helped in this hour of crisis,” he added. He said he constantly santises both his hands and vehicle so that they remain free of the virus.According to him, he initially offered only emergency services, but now he has started supplying essential items too in his car.“Following social distancing norms, people call me and tell me to get them medicines, ration and other essential items, so that they don’t have to come out of their houses,” said Bhatt.Bhatt who ran a computer education centre during the pre-covid-19 days, says he is using the money he has saved to offer his service. “People who have contacted me through social media are also contributing money for fuel. Locals have started calling my car, 109 ambulance service,” says Bhatt||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/covid-19-warrior-uttarakhand-man-uses-his-car-as-ambulance-in-remote-hilly-regions-amid-lockdown/story-bWH8EIC7oKNbs8WaXGiQfI.html

No one among them developed flu-like symptoms. The police clapped for them to boost their morale,” said Idrees, nodal officer of the quarantine centre on the banks of Dal Lake.Out of these 78 people, 52 were travellers including businessmen while 26 were students.

01-04-2020||Delhi||5 more govt hospitals to fight Covid-19||With a surge in the number of infection cases likely in the city after health officials uncovered the clustering at Nizamuddin, the government has decided to convert five of its tertiary care hospitals to dedicated Covid-19 centres. This will earmark at least 5,850 beds for the management of Covid-19 patients in Delhi, officials said.Lok Nayak, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Guru Teg Bahadur, Rajiv Gandhi super speciality, and Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospitals have started working on moving their non-Covid patients to other hospitals, said to a Delhi government order issued on Tuesday.Another 200 bed in Guru Nanak Eye Centre in Lok Nayak campus may also be added if needed.On Tuesday, 23 more people tested positive for Covid-19 in the city, taking the total up to 120. The test reports of none of the people evacuated from the Nizamuddin markaz had come back on Tuesday and the number of people who tested positive from the area remained at 24. Another person who had tested positive on Saturday had visited the dargah.The reports of 441 people from the markaz, who showed symptoms of the virus, is awaited.The Delhi government is still in the process of tracing 18 other people who tested positive at private laboratories. The government is trying to trace the history of all the 18.Delhi government’s biggest tertiary care centre Lok Nayak hospital, along with government’s only superspeciality hospital GB Pant on the same campus, are preparing to become Covid-19 hospitals.“Any patient that can be discharged, will be. For those who still need hospitalisation, they will be moved to other Delhi government hospitals or even to a private hospital, if need be,” said Dr JC Passey, medical director of Lok Nayak campus.The hospital is also in the process of moving its out-patient clinic to the separate orthopaedics block and the surgical emergency to Sushruta Trauma centre in Civil Lines. “We are in the process of converting the entire 2,700 bed facility for Covid-19,” said Dr Passey. The government is also exploring the option of opening up a newly constructed hospital in Burari with 1,000 beds – of which 10 -15% will have ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/5-more-govt-hospitals-to-fight-covid-19/story-gr6LkGQMqmV52bFIFyxIuO.html
01-04-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus update: Gravity of situation yet to dawn upon most Nizamuddin evacuees||Their faces covered, a group of men with their belongings on trolleys and in sacks, walked towards a green DTC bus parked outside the Nizamuddin police station. They left their bags in the front and silently occupied one seat after the other. They hardly spoke to each other.As they waited, another group did what they had done just minutes ago-- they evacuated from a five-storey white building, called Markaz, submitted to a thermal screening, gave their contact details and walked towards the bus.“I had arrived from Muzaffarnagar 25 days ago to do social service. Now, I feel like as if I committed a crime,” said one of the men in the bus — the gravity of their collective act still not having dawned on him. Click here for complete coronavirus coverageHe wanted water as the temperature rose in the bus, but none of his co-passengers had any.The men were part of the around 1,000 pilgrims and guests hiding in the Markaz after the countrywide lockdown was announced on March 24 to prevent the spread of Covid-19. When officials tracked the travel history of at least eight persons who died in different parts of the country, it led them to this building. Since then, 24 people from the area were found positive for the virus and around 441 others showed symptoms. Nizamuddin had become a hot spot of the virus in the city.On Tuesday, the roads leading to the Markaz were sealed and only government officials were allowed. Sanitation workers roped in to spray disinfectants on the gates and windows in the Nizamuddin neighbourhoods received unusual requests -- from health officials and journalists to spray on their clothes and shoes, and the police requested them to spray on their cars and motorcycles. In the adjoining lanes, civil defence volunteers walked around with a list of residents who were suspected of having come in contact with the Markaz residents.But these volunteers said it was a futile task. “We are looking at people who may have visited the Markaz, but the occupants themselves had been to several places,” said Suraj Kumar, one of the volunteers.People in the area concurred. Afzal Khan, a man who works at a roadside food stall and sleeps in a park near the Markaz, said, “Many of them would take a walk in the park and play with our children. They would then walk to the nearby Humayun’s Tomb.”Other residents in the adjoining neighbourhoods said that the occupants would roam around in their streets. “Our delivery boys had been delivering food at the Markaz until Friday. They would approach the gates, collect the cash, hand over the food and leave,” said Zuhaib, owner of a Biryani restaurant nearby.But the evacuees insisted that they weren’t to blame. “When the lockdown was announced, I visited multiple tour and transport shops in the neighbourhood for a way to get to my home in Lucknow. They all refused,” said another evacuee who didn’t wish to be identified.He said that since the lockdown, he and the others in the Markaz wore masks and kept a “social distance”. “Our religion teaches us to follow the law of the land. Is it our fault that the lockdown was announced when we were here? Why weren’t we asked to leave much earlier when there is a police station right next door?” the man asked.A statement from the Markaz on Tuesday said that when the ‘janta curfew’ was announced for March 22, the ongoing programmes were discontinued immediately, but the sudden halting of rail services during the lockdown left them stranded.According to them, there were about 2,500 pilgrims in the Markaz and about 1,500 managed to leave the city immediately in the wake of the lockdown. Scores of those left behind included those from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Myanmar.The Markaz statement said that the first formal notice to vacate the premises arrived on March 24. Senior police officers refused to comment on why they did not ask the residents to leave as the Delhi government had also announced a “lockdown” from March 23. One officer on condition of anonymity said that they were cautious in dealing with a religious gathering. “We thought that any attempt to disperse them would be met with the resistance that we faced in Shaheen Bagh and Jamia,” said the officer.Fuzail Ayyubi, the legal counsel of the Markaz in them matter, said that the visitors had arrived before any of the restrictions came into place. “The pilgrims stay here for a few days and then depart. This is a round-the-year feature. After the country-wide lockdown was announced, we asked the authorities for help to send these people back, but no action was taken,” said Ayyubi, adding that the Markaz can accommodate 4,000-5,000 people on any given day.Some of the evacuees HT spoke to said that they had arrived at the Markaz as late as on March 22, the day of the voluntary janta curfew. Police and other officials involved in the evacuation said that the number of people stranded in the Markaz was heavily downplayed. “They hid the real figures from us. So far, we have already sent 34 buses, each occupied by 34 pilgrims. Many pilgrims are still being brought out,” said a police officer.Parveen Kumar, a civil defence volunteer, said that when he had visited the Markaz on Friday with health officials, the response he received was that they didn’t need help from outside. “They weren’t willing to let us take the details of the occupants. They said they would manage on their own. When we spoke to the occupants, some of them complained of cough and fever. That is how some of them were found positive,” said Kumar.At the adjoining Basti, which houses around 30,000 people, there were regular announcements from the mosques asking people not to panic.“A teams of residents would stand guard on the streets to ensure people don’t step out. Now the area is almost sealed,” said Mohammad Umair, a social activist and resident.Residents blamed the police for not acting on time despite being close to the Markaz. SM Umar, the general secretary of Nizamuddin West RWA, said that they have issued circulars their WhatsApp groups, urging people to step out only when urgently required. “The civic agencies spray disinfectants only on select days. We have divided ourselves in small groups to carry out the sanitisation work every day,” Umar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gravity-of-situation-yet-to-dawn-upon-most-evacuees/story-YpZEPxQjRi8qcdizQZOvGP.html
01-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration extends curfew till April 14||The UT administration has extended the curfew imposed in the city till April 14.After imposing the curfew on March 24 to prevent transmission of Covid-19, the administration had relaxed it between 10am and 6pm on March 28, only to curtail the relaxation to between 11am and 3pm on March 30. Only shops of groceries, medicines and vegetables are allowed to remain open during these hours.“UT will follow central government directions on the issue and conform with the 21-day nationwide lockdown announced by the Prime Minister. The curfew will continue during the entirety of the lockdown period,” UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said on Tuesday.After Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal for a nationwide lockdown on March 24, most states and union territories opted for a lockdown, keeping shops selling essential articles open. But, in Chandigarh and Punjab a curfew was imposed, and all establishments were shut down. This invited a flurry of complaints about non-availability, poor quality and high prices of essential products, such as vegetables, fruits and medicines. The problem was much worse in Chandigarh’s periphery and villages, where only few chemist shops were open.While in most sectors, administration has successfully implemented the curfew and enforced social distancing norms, in the peripheral areas and in colonies, the curfew norms continue to be violated unabatedly.FULL WAGES FOR PVT SECTOR EMPLOYEESThe UT administration has issued an order to all employers — to consider private sector employees working from home as working. “All employees working in the private sector – casual, contractual or regular, who are forced stay at home during the lockdown, will be treated on duty and get full wages,” Parida said.In an earlier order, UT had barred house owners from demanding rent from tenants for one month. Any property owner forcing tenants to vacate premises during the lockdown will be prosecuted.EXPIRED DRIVING LICENCES EXTENDEDThe UT administration has extended the validity of driving licences that expired on February 1 till June 30, 2020. “All driving licences and fitness permits of vehicles, which lapsed on February 1 and could not be renewed due to the lockdown, will be treated valid till June 30,” Parida said.The decision was taken following an advisory in this regard by the Union ministry of road transport and highways. Driving licence tests at the Registering and Licensing Authority (RLA) already remain suspended since March 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-extends-curfew-till-april-14/story-RvuAO3LGTm2ajOf15uswdM.html

These residents have not been found at the UT address mentioned in their passports.Of the 15 Covid-19 cases in the city so far, five recently came from abroad and the rest are those who came in contact with them.“We initially received a list of 1,600 people who came to the city in March. On Saturday, this number was updated to 2,277,” said a senior UT official requesting anonymity.Of the 2,277 people, the administration is trying to trace the 676 persons who returned to the city after March 14. “While 626 of them were already under home quarantine, the administration has marked 30 more for home quarantine, and 20 were quarantined on Tuesday,” the official said.However, adding to the administration’s worry are the missing 76 persons, all of whom returned before March 14.“We are yet to trace 76 people. Some are not present at the address mentioned in their passport, and their houses are locked. The others, we suspect, have shifted to other states. We will make a list of such people and share it with other states,” the official said.As of March 31, as many as 1,070 people in the city are in quarantine, but the administration has not clarified as to how many of them returned from abroad or the number of people they have come in contact with.“It’s a precarious situation. People who have returned from abroad and have not reported to the administration should come forward and disclose their travel history and status of health,” said Ravindra Khaiwal, additional professor, school of public health, PGIMER. The guidelines are clear and should be followed religiously, the professor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-76-untraced-passengers-from-abroad-give-chandigarh-admn-the-jitters/story-nYzTiRlXJaSZxeYlGZmRsO.html
01-04-2020||Chandigarh||Nayagaon man’s death: Nurses cry foul, PGI says protocol was followed||After a 32-year-old nursing officer tested positive for Covid-19 while another was put in quarantine after coming in contact with the Nayagaon man who died of the infection at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research on Tuesday, the nurses association accused the authorities of “denying proper safety equipment” to those posted in emergency wards.The 22 nurses in emergency wards have been provided with only triple-layer masks and gloves, while personal protective equipment (PPE) is available only to the staff in the communicable disease ward, said PGIMER Nurses Welfare Association general secretary Satyaveer Dagur.“Since patients with no contact history have started reporting to the institute with symptoms, there is need to provide PPEs to nurses in all such wards,” he said. The association has also shot off a letter to the administration stating that protective gear, including N95 masks, should be provided to all nurses who may come in contact with infected patients. Dagur also alleged that nurses posted in the Emergency repeatedly asked for Covid-19 testing of the Nayagaon patient, but to no avail.However, PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram denied the claims, stating that the protocol was followed: “The patient was suspected of H1N1 infection and thus admitted in the specific area earmarked for the disease. He had no travel history and had no contact with any suspected patient, thus he was not expected to have contracted Covid-19. Still, we carried out the test as he was suffering from respiratory syndrome and found that he was positive.”He said a committee has been formed to look into proper distribution of equipment required to safeguard the staff and other demands.P’KULA NURSE SHARES VIDEO TOOMeanwhile, after a 36-year-old nurse at the Sector 6 civil hospital in Panchkula tested positive for Covid-19 in similar circumstances on Tuesday, a video of a staff nurse posted at the primary health centre in old Panchkula was widely shared on social media, wherein she can be seen raising concern over lack of protective equipment.The video also showed Asha workers covering their faces with dupattas in the absence of masks.“I am wearing a raincoat of my own and a polythene bag on my feet. We request the authorities to provide us proper kits as we too have families,” the nurse can be seen saying in the video.“I have come across the video and an inquiry has been marked,” said chief medical officer Dr Jasjeet Kaur. “We have provided protection kits to all medical staff. If any doctor is found negligent, action will be taken.”MISSTEPS IN HANDLING NAYAGAON MAN’S CASEMarch 18 The 65-year-old Nayagaon man visits GMSH-16 on experiencing acute respiratory problem.

01-04-2020||Delhi||8 Kyrgyz Jamaat members shifted from Sangam Park||Eight Kyrgyzstan nationals, who are suspected of attending the Tablighi Jamaat congregation earlier this month in south Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin area, were evacuated from a house in northwest Delhi’s Sangam Park on Tuesday and were sent to a quarantine facility, the police said. The eight foreigners were living in a rented house near Bharat Nagar since early March, they added.Police said they have also booked the landlord for not informing the police before renting the house to foreigners.DCP (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said the eight Kyrgyzstan nationals have been sent to a quarantine centre after they were screened at a hospital. Their samples were also collected and tested for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “The eight persons showed some symptoms of the infection,” said Arya, adding that only health officials would confirm the health status of the eight foreigners.The DCP said police came to know about the Kyrgyzstan nationals through their sources. “We cordoned off the area and informed the authorities about the foreign nationals who were suspected to have attended the congregation at the Markaz in Nizamuddin. The foreigners were evacuated and taken to a hospital so that they could be screened and tested,” the DCP said. She said the eight Kyrgyzstan nationals were staying in Delhi since early March.A police officer, not authorised to speak to media, said the foreigners told the police and health officials that they were supposed to return home on March 16 but could leave due to the travel curbs. “They said the Tablighi Jamaat authorities had arranged the rented accommodation for them,” the officer said.“We are going through the markaz’s records to see who all left the premises before the screening began. We have asked all our district teams to look for such people,” an official from Delhi’s health department said requesting anonymity.Model Town MLA Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, said he had informed the police and the district magistrate on Tuesday about foreigners living in Sangam Park.“While the police have quarantined the foreigners, I have asked the DM to ensure other people are placed under quarantine as well,” the Aam Admi Party MLA said.A senior official of the north Delhi municipal corporation said civic body was yet to get instructions from the Delhi government’s health department about taking any quarantine measures in the area.

01-04-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown: Only 46 migrants housed in 200-bed facility in Chandigarh||At the newly built community centre in Maloya, Chandigarh, which has an intake capacity of over 200 beds, only 46 migrants have been housed so far.The UT administration had set up a makeshift shelter at the Maloya community centre for interstate migrant labourers after receiving directions from the ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Sunday. The directions came in light of the mass exodus of migrant labourers amid the 21-day lockdown in India to control the spread of coronavirus. Most of the migrants in the Maloya shelter had been working in Ludhiana, Punjab, and Baddi, Himachal Pradesh.On Monday, 52 migrants were brought in by Chandigarh Police. Rajiv Tewari, the nodal officer appointed by UT administration, said, “Initially, the total number was 52 but 11 were residents of Maloya and Manimajra. After consulting the police, they were sent back to their homes here.”When this reporter visited the shelter, it was found that despite the facilities provided by the administration, most of the migrants still wanted to go back. Sarvesh Kumar, 17, walked all the way from Una to Chandigarh and was on his way to Sector 43 bus stand when he was caught by police and brought here. “Train kab tak chalu ho jayegi, hum gaon nahin ja payenge kya (When will trains resume, will I never be able to reach my village)?” he asked.“My mother, father and sisters are in Badami, Uttar Pradesh. They are worried about me. Agar mujhe marna hi hai toh unke samne marna chahta hu (If I have to die, I want to die in front of them),” said another migrant, Hoshiyar Kumar, 19.Migrants are served meals three times a day, donated by a local café; basic hygiene products like soap, towels and toothbrushes are arranged by the administration. The facility is sanitised twice. A team of doctors from Government Multi-Speciality Hospital (GMSH) in Sector 16 conduct frequent checkups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-only-46-migrants-housed-in-200-bed-facility-in-chandigarh/story-9ZWn0qey6GfeZ14OKHyi1I.html
01-04-2020||City||Coronavirus curfew: Knights in khaki deliver essentials, food to Mohali colonies||Walking into a police station in Mohali amid the coronavirus curfew is a completely new experience. Instead of writing FIRs, the staff will be found busy packing rations and cooked food to be distributed among the homeless and those living in slums and colonies of the city.The cops instead of making crime entries in the log register are busy keeping a record of the ration as well as food distributed and how much more is required on a daily basis.A senior policeman who was busy packing at the Phase 1 police station said, “Along with some good Samaritans, we, too, are contributing from our pockets towards purchase of ration, while our friends and relatives are coming forward to donate as well. We pack the ration in hampers that are given to each family. Each packet includes flour, pulses, sugar, and oil.”Around 20 police stations, eight police posts and all 13 traffic zones in the district are ensuring no one goes without food in the district. Many police stations serving cooked food have decided on a menu for different days of the week to introduce variety.“On some days, we serve kheer or curry rice, on others sweet rice, chhole-poori, or aalu-poori. Nobody can eat the same thing everyday,” said the senior policeman. There are days when even fruit is distributed, he added.HAPPY TO SEE POLICE AT DOORSTEPUnlike other days when the presence of police would invoke confusion, residents are happy to see the khaki-clad teams and are coming forward to identify families in dire need of food and other essential items.“The police control room as well as police officers are getting calls seeking help. People even help us identify the families who need food and other essentials. We are here to serve the residents,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Mohali.“A lot of organisations, are coming forward to donate. As the movement is restricted, they are coming to the police station or approaching us to accompany them for distribution, which we are readily doing,” said Rajiv Kumar, station house officer, Mataur.POLICE TAKING PRECAUTIONS“We are preparing food in police stations and ensuring proper hygiene is maintained. We have tied up with local gurdwaras as well to cook food for us,” said Baljinder Singh Mand, police post in-charge, Industrial Area, Phase 8, Mohali.He added that while distributing food, servers wear gloves and masks, and social distancing norms are strictly adhered to.“To ensure that there is no chaos during distribution, we are deploying a couple of constables and making announcements that ration packets will be delivered at people’s homes,” said Ramadeep Singh, DSP (city), Mohali, who was busy supervising the distribution of ration in Jagatpura, one of the biggest colonies in Mohali.Besides feeding humans, the SHO of Phase 8, Rajnish Chaudhary, and some other police officials regularly feed stray animals in Mohali to ensure they don’t starve amid the curfew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/knights-in-khaki-deliver-essentials-food-to-mohali-colonies/story-Z3qrv0FbJpAOR41VsVMM1M.html

Hardly anybody has really seen the faces of the unsung heroes who braving calamity are ensuring our living spaces remain clean.Even when the city is on a 21-day lockdown and residents are confined to the walls of their houses because of the fear of coronavirus spread, the 2,500-strong brigade of door-to-door garbage collectors is doing their job relentlessly, without giving it a day’s skip.“We, too, are scared of the virus, but we have no other option. We work so that our family can have a day’s meal,” says 47-year-old Suresh Kumar, who collects garbage from over 140 houses in Sector 41 and over 50 houses in Sector 40.The only change that the ‘virus’ has brought in Suresh’s working schedule is that now, he does not take his wife and two daughters, school drop-outs, along. The entire responsibility of collecting the garbage has fallen on him and his 16-year-old son, also a school drop-out. “This is the only thing I can do for my family at this time of crisis. At least the ladies of the house will be confined inside and it reduces the chances of their getting infected,” says Suresh.Jagwanti, a garbage collector who works along with her husband in a society in Sector 48, says, “After we are done with work, the very first thing we do is take bath, before we meet the family.”AN ‘UNRECOGNISED’ PROFESSIONThe door-to-door garbage collectors are neither a part of the Chandigarh municipal corporation’s sanitation wing, nor are they employees of the private company that has been given charge of cleanness work in the southern sectors.Most door-to-door garbage collectors are paid ₹50 to ₹100 per month per house for collecting daily trash.They don’t have any life insurance cover or any health insurance benefits. They don’t even enjoy the privilege of a weekly off. If one of them falls sick, their family members must pitch and take their place. They cannot let the chain break—from houses to a sector’s garbage collection centre to the processing unit at Dadumajra.“It is the time to show the society that we, too, care for them. If we don’t pick the garbage during the curfew period, the piled up garbage will start spreading infections,” says Shamsher Lotia, who is the head of the door-to-door garbage collectors’ society and himself collects garbage from Sector 27.But how is the administration making sure they stay safe?The only thing the collectors have been provided by the administration is a pair of plastic gloves each, which don’t last for more than a couple of days. “We have urged the UT administration and central government to provide insurance cover to door-to-door garbage collectors who fall under the rag picker category, and at least provide bare minimum facilities that are extended to municipal corporation’s sanitation workers to carry out work at the time of coronavirus,” says Lotia.“Except for a handful, all garbage collectors are Dalits. Though we largely don’t face any discrimination in our work, people do have a tendency to maintain distance. Some people even tell us not to touch their gates. In case we ask for water, they prefer not to use steel or glass tumblers, but give us a bottle and ask us to take it along,” he adds.CLEANLINESS, A DISTANT DREAM FOR THEIR LOCALITYThe garbage collectors ensure cleanliness in all sectors and societies in the city, but when it comes to their colony in Sector 56, cleanliness is a distant reality.It was in 2008 that the collectors were allotted prefabricated tin shed houses under the central government’s Rag Pickers Awas Yojana Scheme in Sector 56, Chandigarh.For the last four months, their sewerage line is choked and the wastewater is overflowing into the residential spaces.“It is the duty of the MC to take care of the common toilets and sewerage lines and of the outer roads. But the officials have a callous approach towards us. They think since we are garbage collectors, we ourselves will take care of the entire sanitation work of the area,” says Rajdulari, 40, who accompanies her husband for collecting garbage from over 150 houses in Sector 39.KIDS MEAN EXTRA INCOMEMost of the children of garbage collectors are school drop-outs and are seen as extra earning hands. “In our profession, you will see the entire family, including wife and kids, helping the man of the house to cover more houses and subsequently add more to the household income. We send our children to schools, but the rate of the drop-out is more in our community,” says garbage collector Geeta, 40, whose all four daughters attend school hoping to one day break out of the ‘family profession’.“We are contributing towards keeping Chandigarh clean even at the time of coronavirus spread, and hoping the administration realises that the rag pickers’ colony, too, should be an area of concern. We are residents of Chandigarh as well,” says a 50-year-old garbage collector, Saroj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/door-to-door-garbage-collectors-brave-coronavirus-outbreak-to-keep-chandigarh-clean/story-FrHMKPKVBqpdkY3SAqxSVN.html
01-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus: Chandigarh MC civic works hit, labour exodus adds to worries||All civic works being carried out by the municipal corporation in Chandigarh have come to a halt as the nationwide lockdown to contain coronavirus enters second week on Wednesday.What worries the contractors even more is the mass exodus of labourers from the tricity. This, they say, will further delay the works even after the situation normalises. The major work that has been hit is road recarpeting. Pegged at ₹40 crore, it had been pending for long. After taking off in the first week of March, it had to be stopped within 10 days due to the restrictions imposed in Chandigarh.A road contractor, who did not wish to be named, said although he did not have the exact number, most of the labourers engaged by him left the city in the past three to four days. “This will definitely pose a hurdle once we plan to restart the work,” he said. Harpreet Singh, another contractor who deals with public health works, said outsourced labourers working at tubewells and water reservoirs are still reporting on duty. However, as far as civic works, such as road repairs, are concerned, he was not sure whether they were available anymore. “It will be known once restrictions are lifted,” he said. Chief engineer Shailender Singh said suspension of civic works is “beyond our control”. “However, we will try to restart them at the earliest, when the situation normalises,” he said. Meanwhile, parking lots will also take more time to get smart facilities.The MC in February had given 90 days to the two new parking contractors to equip 89 lots with smart facilities.It is learnt, the contractors have told the civic body that they will not be able to meet the deadline, and sought three to four weeks extension. Smart facilities include installation of cameras and display screens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-chandigarh-mc-civic-works-hit-labour-exodus-adds-to-worries/story-GHmqlKoISW1evWy2MZV8QP.html

Nearly 7,000 cops are still deployed to guard VIPs in Punjab. Among the 161 persons, whose security was pruned, are former CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal (2 of 30), Markfed chairman Amarjit Singh Samra (2 of 6), Punjab Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh (2 of 9), Punsup chairman Tejinder Bittu (2 of 6), Amritsar mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu (2 of 4), former Congress ministers Avtar Singh Henry (2 of 4), Mohinder Singh Kay Pee (2 of 4), Hari Singh Zira (1 of 3); Akali leaders Jagmeet Singh Brar (2 of 4), Prem Singh Chandumajra (2 of 4), Adesh Partap Kairon (2 of 12), Charanjit Singh Atwal (2 of 8), Maheshinder Grewal (1 of 3), Sikander Singh Maluka (2 out of 4) and Surjit Singh Rakhra (2 out of 4).Also on the list are Amritsar district and sessions judge Balwinder Singh (2 out 10), Patiala district and sessions judge Rajinder Aggarwal (2 of 10) and Fazilka Patiala district and sessions judge Tarsem Mangla (2 of 10).

Extensive mobilisation of the force has been planned in a phased manner,” he said. The exercise has again exposed how certain people continue to enjoy police cover despite Amarinder-led government’s repeated claims about ending VIP culture in the state.The list also has names of retired cops who have up to 10 gunmen.BOX:Retiring cops, home guardsget extension till May 31Due to the rising Covid-19 threat, the department of home affairs gave extension till May 31to police personnel and home guards jawans who were slated to retire soon.“These employees would not be eligible for any promotion or additional perks during the extension period,” the official notification read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-outbreak-1-600-punjab-cops-pulled-out-of-security-duty-to-maintain-law-and-order/story-isKlJGKLGbOyhzYhxbS8SM.html

They also demanded removal of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala’s song from YouTube, which allegedly maligns the image of Baldev Singh, besides legal action against the singer. They also sought that the link of Moose Wala’s objectionable song be removed from Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta’s official Twitter handle, besides calling for the latter’s explanation.Baldev Singh, 70, died at the Banga civil hospital in SBS Nagar district on March 18. He along with his two associates, Gurbachan Singh and Daljinder Singh, returned from Germany via Italy on March 7 and then attended the Hola Mohalla celebrations at Anandpur Sahib. As many as 27 contacts of Baldev were infected with coronavirus.In their letter to CM, the villagers said that fake reports are being spread about Baldev that he concealed that he was Covid 19 patient. “You (CM) can verify from the health department that Baldev was tested positive for coronavirus only after his death.” “Now, fake stories maligning the image of Baldev Singh’s family and our village are doing the rounds on social media. Besides Baldev, Baba Gurbachan Singh, a respected personality, is also being defamed,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-1st-covid-19-death-pathlawa-residents-urge-capt-to-act-against-those-defaming-village/story-riD7jXidjFgtzS6SRhMPEO.html

Hailing from Jalandhar district, Sharma, 72, is among nearly 30 MPs who have gone into self-isolation with symptoms or tested positive. They include senior figures like Prime Minister Boris Johnson, health secretary Matt Hancock and Scotland secretary Alister Jack. Sharma, MP from Ealing Southall, said: “At Hillingdon Hospital I tested positive for coronavirus, and had some trouble breathing, and was hospitalised for a week. My care was exceptional, and I want to pay an enormous tribute to all the staff at the hospital.” “Now I am back home again and self-isolating, and following all the NHS (National Health Service) and government advice. I want to urge everyone else to do the same…The amazing men and women of the NHS working in almost impossible situations, with too little kit and too little support deserve our help,” he added. Noting that many Britons, including those of Indian origin, are stranded abroad, Sharma said he and his staff have been liaising with the Foreign Office. There has been “some positive development” on this, but the issue has not yet been resolved for all, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-punjab-born-uk-mp-virendra-sharma-recovering/story-uUJqiZRV2yDm8lxbaQRGVI.html
01-04-2020||Chandigarh||Threat, repercussions real; we Punjabis are resilient and will overcome: Captain||After the coronavirus outbreak, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was quick to pad up to deal with the looming public health emergency. He was the first head of the state to clamp curfew on March 23 – a day before the Centre declared a nationwide lockdown – slow down the virus spread. In a crisis management mode, his government is focusing on tracing 1,300-odd missing NRIs, preparing contingency plans for harvesting and procurement of a whopping 135 lakh tonnes of wheat crop and finding ways to endure the pandemic’s debilitating effect on the state economy. In an e-mail interview with HT on Tuesday, the chief minister dwelt on the challenges ahead and his action plan. Excerpts:What impact the coronavirus outbreak would have on the state?It is too early to give an assessment. Our efforts currently are focused on preventing the spread of the disease and ramping up the health infrastructure to meet any eventuality. I am personally monitoring the situation and we are prepared to handle any eventuality. The government machinery is fully engaged so that people are not inconvenienced. The impact of the outbreak is likely to be an extended one, though it is not possible to put any timeline. Also, I do not think any section of the society will remain untouched by the crisis. But we, Punjabis, are resilient, and will undoubtedly come through this crisis eventually.Has the state government been able to figure out the broader spread? If yes, how do you plan to deal with it?The situation is a very dynamic one and changing every day. As of now, there is no apparent community transmission in Punjab. However, as the danger still looms, and we cannot rule out escalation in the coming days, we have geared ourselves fully. We have planned three levels of care centres: i) critical care where all Covid-19 patients with HDU (High Dependence Units) and ICU (Intensive Care Units) requirement would go to Government Medical Colleges (GMCs); ii) Patients with mild symptoms would be admitted to isolation facilities created in government hospitals with total bed capacity of 5,000 at present; and iii) In case of broad spread of Covid-19, hostel buildings of colleges would be converted into care centres. This plan would enable us to take care of more than 25,000 positive patients at any given point of time.As India, according to several experts, is entering into a critical phase where we can either flatten the curve or see a sharp spike. What is your main worry on the health front?Fortunately, we have not entered the Stage-3 of community transmission and hope we do not have to face such an eventuality. However, if a broader spread does occur, then the focus will have to be on flattening the curve so that there is no rush of positive patients to the hospitals and each patient is properly taken care of. The very low number of positive cases in the last few days give us cause for optimism on this count. More aggressive testing and more contact tracing so as to put Covid-19 positive cases in isolation for treatment is the strategy we have adopted. We hope it will help prevent the situation from escalating.What about NRIs and other persons with history of foreign travel who are still to be traced? How serious a danger do they pose?When reports of the outbreak started coming in, we screened more than 95,000 passengers who had arrived at the two international airports at SAS Nagar and Amritsar, and two land ports at Wagah and Kartarpur Sahib. Subsequently, we received a list of 55,000 international passengers from government of India. We have put these passengers under home quarantine of 14 days and are keeping a strong vigil. It is true all Covid-19 positive cases in Punjab have been traced back to persons with history of foreign travel, but it would be unfair to say that NRIs pose a special danger of Covid-19 because if we consider the total percentage of persons who came from abroad and showed symptoms of the virus, then we’ll see that it is a very small percentage.What is your sense on the impact of national lockdown on Punjab’s economy?It is too early to predict anything, especially considering that we are still in the midst of the crisis. Right now, we are diverting all resources to coping with the problem and providing all possible support to our people. I have already asked finance minister Manpreet Badal to draw up a detailed financial contingency plan to deal with the situation. But given the extent of the problem, the economic fallout is going to be extremely serious, and may take a long time to recover, not just in Punjab but the entire nation, and in fact the whole world.As Punjab is heavily dependent on migrant workers for harvesting and they are returning to their homes in droves, what challenges do you see?My instructions to all the departments that not a single migrant labourer should be out on the streets. Industry and brick-kiln owners have been asked to shelter the migrants. Also, we are in talks with the Radha Soami Satsang sect to help accommodate the migrant labourers in their Satsang Bhawans so that they can help out with the wheat harvesting that is due to begin in two weeks. The government has also made elaborate arrangements to provide food and shelter to those left in the lurch because of the sudden lockdown.How do you look at India’s response to the coronavirus challenge?The nation has, by and large, responded very well to the situation. The challenge of locking down 1.3 billion people overnight was an extremely tough one, and naturally it was not possible to put in place foolproof systems. Yet, given the scale and enormity of the challenge. Things have been largely smooth, barring the exodus of labour from some states, which is also now being managed. In retrospect, one can of course think of many things that could and should have been done differently. But things are getting normalised and I am sure every state is doing everything in its power to manage its people while extending full support to the Centre in this critical hour.What steps should the Centre take to help the states?We have already shared a detailed list of steps needed urgently to be taken by the Centre to help us out of this crisis. These include immediate release of our GST compensation, payment of dues under MGNREGA, deferment of industrial and agriculture/crop loan instalments by commercial banks, special insurance for police and sanitary workers in line with the one announced by the Centre for health workers and incentives for farmers to ensure staggered transport of wheat grain into mandis.Medical experts have been pressing for more testing. What is your take on this and whether we have the facilities in Punjab for testing on a large scale?When this problem started, we had testing facilities at PGIMER with capacity of 40 Covid cases per day and then we got approval for testing facilities at GMCs at Patiala and Amritsar. GMC, Faridkot, will also get approval very soon. In the next 3-4 days, we will increase the testing capacity in Punjab to 850 cases per day. Regarding testing protocol, we have been broadly following the ICMR guidelines which allow very limited testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/threat-repercussions-real-we-punjabis-are-resilient-and-will-overcome-captain/story-xFJmJ0gJEiD5dlsdN56K3N.html

She had been declared dead at Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, at 6pm on Monday.To control the spread of the infection, only two sons of the woman and health officials were allowed to be present. The two sons are now under isolation at the civil hospital. Her younger son works as driver and elder one is a peon at Guru Nanak Bhawan. The health department has advised people who came in contact with her sons to self-isolate.3 doctors among 58 identifiedcontacts asked to self-isolateSince the death, 33 contacts of Rani, who worked at a factory near Samrala Chowk, were asked to self-isolate on Monday night. On Tuesday, 25 more persons, including the medical staff deployed at civil hospital were also asked to self-isolate. Samples of three children of Rani, her brother-in- law Sukhwinder Singh, and two other relatives have been sent for covid-19 testing.Three doctors, two staff nurses and a Class-4 employee, who came in direct contact with the patient, have also been instructed to self-isolate. The private ambulance driver, who the woman’s family had hired to take her to Patiala, has also been advised home quarantine.With her brother-in-law Sukhvinder claiming that Rani had visited civil hospital for treatment from March 24, some trainee doctors deployed in isolation wards have been asked to go on leave.Quarters cordonedoff; colony sanitisedWith palpable panic among residents of Amarpura Colony, a congested locality marked by dingy small quarters, police cordoned off Rani’s house in the area on Monday. In Shimalpuri too, where Sukhwinder, along with his 10 family members, have been quarantined, the house was sealed. The Amarpura quarter, where Rani had been living as tenant for a year, was sanitised.Sukhwinder, whose own sample report is awaited, expressed disbelief that Rani had died due to the virus infection. “Rani had stopped going to work since March 11. She did not step out of the house. We are shocked as to how did she get the infection. No other family member has fallen sick for 15 days. We demand a reexamination of her samples.”Strap/BlurbSamples of six relatives, including three children, sent for testing; medical staff who came in direct contact with victim instructed to self-isolate||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-woman-cremated-in-dead-of-night-two-sons-isolated-at-civil-hospital/story-7kE7UOLZLZEnF6GvSp1MML.html

01-04-2020||City||Nabha villagers protest over ‘inadequate ration’||The underprivileged dwellers in five villages here on Tuesday protested against the ‘poor distribution’ of ration among them during the lockdown period.Villagers in Kakrala, Dhanouri, Surajpur, Bouran Kalan and Majha, along with the members of zameen prapti sangarsh committee and pendu mazdoor union, came out beating utensils and claimed that they were suffering due to poor supplies of ration.However, the administration has roped in several social organisations to help the needy as the government supply of free ration has not reached all the villages yet. The state government has authorised panchayats to withdraw ₹5,000 per day from the panchayat fund if there is a need for emergency supply of ration.Meanwhile, many villages seemed rife with inadequate information regarding government schemes.Protesters claimed that the government was not supplying ration to registered construction workers or MGNREGA workers who receive cash payments. “Are ₹3,000 sufficient to feed a family in these times,” asked Balwant Singh, a protester.A village sarpanch requesting anonymity said that the government had barred them from providing supply to the workers registered under BOCW and MGNREGA schemes as they were already getting cash deposit in their bank accounts.Giving clarity on matter, Nabha block development and panchayat officer (BDPO) Ajaib Singh Ghundar said that free ration will be supplied to all below poverty line (BPL) families, irrespective of the cash reliefs given to them. He said the village heads were barred only from withdrawing cash from the panchayat funds in the name of emergency for those who were already getting relief under various government schemes.When asked about the protest, Nabha sub-divisional magistrate Sooba Singh told HT that he was not aware about it. “I will verify and address the protesters’ issues at the earliest,” he added.Around 1,700 families have been listed from Nabha’s rural areas for not being included as BPL or beneficiaries of Atta Dal and other government schemes. These include shack dwellers and migrant labourers. BDPO Ghundar confirmed the listing of these families assuring help to them during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nabha-villagers-protest-over-inadequate-ration/story-DSJFPbidlqNPFn8litUVaI.html

They had visited various tourist destinations in the country before getting stuck in the city.For the past week, the two have been staying in a hotel on Queen’s Road here, while the administration and police are tending to their needs. “We are making sure that they do not face any problems because they are our guests in this crisis-ridden situation,” said a hotel employee.Assistant sub-inspector Vikram Singh, who is deployed at the hotel for their security, said that five police personnel take turns guarding the hotel round-the-clock. “Efforts are on to ensure their safe return to their respective countries,” said deputy commissioner Shivdular Singh Dhillon.As per information, after finding themselves in trouble, the tourists had approached the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) seeking accommodation in the premises of the Golden Temple, but were turned away by SGPC officials citing their different lifestyle.Zhong had landed in country on January 5. After visiting several tourist destinations, he came to Amritsar on March 23.The hotel staff also said that they were offering them simple vegetarian Indian food and the foreigners were accepting the same in view the prevailing situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amritsar-admn-tending-to-stranded-chinese-swiss-tourists/story-TI20tl4x6VDoGIyesmUSsM.html

01-04-2020||Chandigarh||Not wise to assemble for Baisakhi celebration: Sukhbir Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president and former Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday said that keeping in view the ongoing lockdown and curfew in the state, it would not be advisable for devotees to assemble at Takht Damdama Sahib in Talwandi Sabo to celebrate Baisakhi. Baisakhi marks the birth of Khalsa, which was founded by the tenth Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. “Human lives are precious and in such scenario when social distancing is the key to stay healthy, it is better to stay at home,” Sukhbir said, adding that he would request Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh to ponder to on the issue, take a decision and make an appeal to the community.Speaking to select journalists in a video conference, Sukhbir also raised concern over the availability of labour for wheat harvest and the following paddy transplantation. “In the absence of labour, industrial production has come to standstill. The lockdown is casting its shadows on the state’s economy which is largely dependent on agriculture and migrants labour plays a vital role,” he added, suggesting to the Punjab government to arrange for stay and food for labour.He added that state government had a huge role to play in procurement of wheat because it was only on getting payment that farmers would be able to make arrangement for kharif sowing.“My party cadre report that they are out in the field helping the people. The government, however, has failed to give ration and items of daily need to the people, especially the poor,” he claimed. “I would not like to enter into any kind of politics but make a suggestion to the CM to start regular interaction with leaders of all political parties to draw out a strategy to fight the pandemic,” added Sukhbir.On the Kabul gurdwara attack, he added he had asked Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who is also his wife, to take up the issue with PM Narendra Modi so that all Sikh families living in Afghanistan are relocated to India and allowed to start their lives afresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/not-wise-to-assemble-for-baisakhi-celebration-sukhbir-badal/story-5tP85BQEVRAYuPGFYDyszI.html
01-04-2020||Mumbai||82 cases take Maha Covid-19 count to 302||Maharashtra’s coronavirus case count on Tuesday reached 302, highest in the country, after 82 new cases were reported. Of the 82 cases, 59 were recorded in Mumbai alone, taking the number of infected people in India’s worst-hit city to 151. Health minister Rajesh Tope, however, said the spike was because the results of tests conducted by the city’s private laboratories over the past four days were declared together on Tuesday.Among the remaining cases, 13 are in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), five in Pune, three in Ahmednagar and two in Buldhana district. Significantly, test reports of 201 people across the state are still awaited, said the state health department.The spike in Mumbai was registered a day after a few patients, who tested positive, were found to be from densely populated Worli-Koliwada, following which the state government has issued instructions to all authorities to take precautions to contain the spread.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday said they are sealing areas where there are coronavirus patients, so as to curb the spread of the disease.For Mumbai, the chief minister also directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to set up 227 flying squads that will conduct house-to-house inspection in each and every ward. The squad comprises a staffer each from the BMC, police, health and revenue departments.“The squads will reach out to the members of the patient’s family and all those who came in contact with them. They will be asked if they have any symptoms of flu, such as cough, cold and fever, and for those having any of these symptoms, arrangements will be made for testing,” Thackeray said.He also said that the entire Worli-Koliwada area has been declared as affected and movement of locals there have been restricted. “It will be difficult to contain if the epidemic spreads out to other such populated areas of the city. Mumbai is a capital and the situation here should be under control,” the chief minister said in a meeting held late on Monday evening at his official residence.Tope said that there is nothing to panic as the spike in numbers is not of a day. “The number of 59 cases are an accumulation of test reports of the past four days of private laboratories, which was validated by the state laboratory,” said Tope.As per the guidelines issued by the Central government, first ten test reports of a private laboratory need to be validated by the state-run laboratory, only after which the test reports of the private lab is considered as final. This is the reason the test reports of the past four days got accumulated, creating a picture of a spike in cases in Mumbai, said a senior health official, wishing not to be named.At present, the state has a capacity of testing around 5,500 samples in a day. Of them, capacity of 13 government laboratories are of 2,300 samples per day and eight private laboratories have capacity of testing 2,800 samples per day, informed the health minister. He, however, stressed that there is no need to conduct sample testing at such a huge level, hence they are not using testing facilities at full capacity.Meanwhile, a 49-year-old housekeeping employee of Saifee Hospital has tested positive for the infection (Sars-Cov-2). She came in direct contact with an asymptomatic patient, who was undergoing treatment at the hospital for a different illness. Currently, she is undergoing treatment at Kasturba Hospital. Around five of her family members have been home quarantined and their samples have been collected for analysis. When contacted, the hospital refused to make any comment.Five close contacts of the 85-year-old surgeon, who died last week in Saifee, have also tested positive, including a house help. “They were earlier kept in home quarantine, but as their samples have tested positive, we have isolated them,” said a ward officer. At Jaslok Hospital, where a nurse was earlier detected with coronavirus, around 150 medical staff, including doctors, have been home quarantined. Non-emergency services at the hospital have been stopped for 14 days.On Tuesday, six more nurses were diagnosed with the disease at the hospital. So far, 6,331 samples have been analysed in the state. The data given by the state government also states 23,913 people are in home quarantine and 1,434 are in institutional quarantine across Maharashtra.Meanwhile, the shutdown declared by the chief minister on March 22 ended on Tuesday and in the past ten days, Maharashtra has got 228 new cases of novel coronavirus. Despite all the restrictions, the numbers are still rising and is likely to further rise, it is said. Moreover, the state government too believes that there could be a spike after the first week of April and they are trying to reduce the impact. Experts believe the state should increase its testing capacity and reach out to maximum people to contain the spread.Two days before the Prime Minister declared a 21-day lockdown across the country, Thackeray had on March 22 declared imposing section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in urban areas of the state, restricting assembly of not more than five people at one place. He has also declared a shutdown of public transport services — Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST), state transport and private buses — after which Mumbai Metro and Monorail also announced closure of their services till the end of the month. The staff in all the government offices was also reduced to 5% each day. The clampdown orders were issued to contain the outbreak but numbers are still going up.The data provided by the state government indicates that in the past five days (since March 26), most of the new cases found are of non-travellers, which means the ones who have come in contact with a coronavirus-infected person, while in the past three days (from March 28), all the new patients of Covid-19 in the state are non-travellers, which is not a good sign. On March 28, 29, and 30, the number of positive cases found were 20, 27 and 22 respectively.Senior officials in the government also confirmed that the state is expecting a spike in cases and are taking all the precautions to restrict it. “It has been observed in other countries that after a gap of 30-35 days, the number of cases rises suddenly, hence a spike is very likely to happen in the second and third week of April month. We are taking all the precautions to minimise the rise,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.Tope also said that the number will increase, but not that high, like in other countries. “There is no community transmission in the state as of now. The number will increase , but not in the range like that of other countries, as we have taken precautionary measures in an advanced stage,” he said.But experts insist that the state should increase its capacity for testing facilities. Dr Behram Pardiwala, internal medicine expert, Wockhart Hospital, said that the test, which should take 12-14 hours, is taking up to 4 days because of a backlog. “With more number of tests the government can epistemologically see how the epidemic is spreading. For instance, Worli-Koliwada got few patients and we know there is a cluster there, so there is a need to test people there more actively,” he said.Meanwhile, state home minister Anil Deshmukh has warned people against spreading any rumour owing it to be April Fool’s Day on Wednesday. “Tomorrow’s April 1st. The annual tradition making an ‘April Fool’ of people has already begun on WhatsApp & social media. The state govt won’t allow anyone to spread rumours/panic on #Corona. I’ve instructed @MahaCyber1 to act swiftly & strongly such miscreants,” Deshmukh said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/82-cases-take-maha-covid-19-count-to-302/story-2RRtwxGt1sCIEqoe43dbjO.html
01-04-2020||Mumbai||3 new Covid-19 patients from Worli Koliwada worked alongside infected doctor||Three new positive cases of Covid-19 were reported in Worli Koliwada and the adjoining Janata Nagar and Adarsh Nagar on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases to 12 in the area. A 60-year-old resident of Worli Koliwada, who had died in Nair Hospital on Monday, was also revealed to be positive for Covid-19 after his test results were confirmed on Tuesday. Of the three latest patients, one man worked as a technician with the doctor at Saifee Hospital who also tested positive for Covid19 last week. The other two were staff nurses who worked with the same doctor, according to an official from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)On Sunday, when the first four persons from Worli Koliwada tested positive for the coronavirus, the BMC revealed that neither had a history of travel or close contact with a person who had traveled to another affected country.However, when asked if the most recent infected persons, who were in contact with the Saifee Hospital doctor, could be traced as the origin of the spread of Covid-19 in Worli Koliwada, the BMC official said, “It is too early to say this. The results of these three persons came only today. We are examining this possibility.”The G South ward, that has jurisdiction over Worli Koliwada, also recorded 15 other cases up from 12 reported on Monday, all of them from a single chawl at Elphinstone Road. A food vendor living in this chawl tested positive for Covid-19 on March 24. She died three days later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-new-covid-19-patients-in-worli-koliwada-worked-alongside-infected-doctor/story-Nx4osveQvGvA7rux4AtJFI.html
01-04-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal warns of rise in cases after Tablighi Jamaat episode||Terming the Tablighi Jamaat congregation that took place mid-March in Delhi’s Nizamuddin West “highly irresponsible”, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said 24 of the 89 active coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-infected people in the Capital were those who were part of the religious gathering earlier this month. Kejriwal also warned that the number of positive cases in Delhi could go up further in two-three days as 431 of over 1,500 persons evacuated from the Nizamuddin area till Tuesday had started showing Covid-19 like symptoms, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. In a digital address to the media, the chief minister talked of strict action against his officers if they were found negligent in performing their duties. The administration of the markaz has alleged inaction on the part of the district magistrate and the sub-divisional magistrate (south-east) for failing to evacuate people on time. It alleged that the revenue officials did not issue e-passes for its vehicles, as a result of which a large number of guests had to stay put in the building. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) blamed the Delhi Police and the organisers of the markaz and sought strong action by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. “Strong action should be taken against the administrators of the Nizamuddin markaz who organised a three-day religious gathering with thousands of people from March 13-15, when Delhi government orders had clearly forbidden gatherings of more than 200 persons on March 13 itself,” Kalkaji MLA Atishi said.Earlier in the day, Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain said the organisers of the gathering had “committed a grave crime”.The AAP also attacked the Delhi Police for its inaction. “The Delhi Police should have stopped them since they had full information about the event, especially since the Nizamuddin police station shares a boundary wall with the markaz. Strict action needs to be taken against the police officers concerned as well,” Atishi said. Kejriwal said his government had written to lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Monday seeking an FIR against the organisers of the Nizamuddin markaz. To this, the L-G’s office later responded with: “The matter has been referred to the police today for appropriate action as per law.”“A total of 1,548 people has been evacuated over the past two days. Of them, 431 people were found to be symptomatic and were directly sent to the hospitals. A total of 1,107 were asymptomatic and so, were sent to the government’s quarantine centres. Organising such a gathering was extremely wrong. Imagine how many people may have contracted the virus since several persons returned to other states from the markaz. What happened was highly irresponsible,” Kejriwal said. The chief minister also cited an empty Vatican and Mecca to urge people not to gather. He appealed to religious leaders not to hold any such gatherings to avoid the spread of Covid-19, which he said was still in the local transmission stage in Delhi. “This is the time of Navratri and temples are usually crowded with worshippers. But everyone is following the lockdown and not crowding these places of worship. Gurudwaras and even mosques are empty. Everyone is offering prayers in their homes. But if cases like this (Nizamuddin) emerge then Delhi government will have to resort to strict action,” he said. According to an analysis of the total number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi by the city administration, of a total of 97 cases so far, 41 are of those who returned from abroad, 24 are from the Nizamuddin markaz and 22 are mostly family and friends who came in contact with those who returned from abroad. “For the remaining 10 cases, we are checking the nature of transmission. Further, of the 97 cases, two have died, five have recovered and been released, one is out of the country. So, we currently have 89 active cases in which one patient is serious and is on ventilator support. Two others are on oxygen. Eighty-six patients are stable,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-warns-of-rise-in-cases-after-tablighi-jamaat-episode/story-WBnIqyYQgzfGoX3jrxiADN.html
01-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus outbreak: Maharashtra government employees to get salary for March in two instalments||Staring at a drastic drop in the revenue receipts of outgoing fiscal 2019-20, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday announced the deferment of a part of the March salary of elected representatives and government employees.The elected representatives, from the chief minister (CM) to the gram panchayat members, will get 40% of their March salary, while the government employees will get 50% to 75% in the first installment. The remaining part of the March salary will be released later in the next financial year, the government has clarified.The decision has been taken in the wake of the drastic drop in revenue receipts and huge amounts spent on unforeseen expenditure while combating the Covid-19 outbreak.Class A and B officers, ranging from the rank of secretaries to desk officers, will get 50% of their March salaries, while the clerical staff in Category C will get 75% of the salary. There is no deduction initiated for Class D employees, comprising peons and office assistants, deputy CM and finance minister Ajit Pawar said after his meeting with all the unions representing state government employees.“I hope that the employees and their unions will extend their whole-hearted support to the government in this unprecedented challenge we are facing,” Pawar said, adding that the decision would boost the morale and finances of the government in its fight against the outbreak.After Pawar’s announcement, chief secretary Ajoy Mehta issued a circular stating that the March salary will be released in two phases.“A separate circular will be issued announcing the release of the remaining part of the salary,” it read. The state government is expected to save ₹5,000 crore by deferring the payment and utilising the amount for the settlement of the balance sheet in a bid to make-up for the drop in the revenue receipts, in form of taxes and duties, due to the lockdown.There are more than 15 lakh state employees, drawing an estimated annual salary of ₹1.15 lakh crore for financial year 2019-20.GD Kulthe, chief consultant, Maharashtra Gazetted Officers’ Federation, said, “We have agreed to the deferment of a part of the salaries in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. The delayed payment will help the government to adjust its bills during the closure of the financial year 2019-20. The government has assured us that the salary deduction will be restored within the next couple of months.”However, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders Kirit Somaiya, Ashish Shelar and Nitesh Rane have criticised the state government for not excluding health workers and police from the decision. CM Uddhav Thackeray later in the evening clarified that the government would try releasing the second instalment of the salary of employees who have been fighting Covid-19 from front-line at the earliest. A day ago, Pawar had demanded the Centre to release a package of ₹25,000 crore to the state in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown, which has badly hit the state economy. He also has demanded that dues of ₹16,654 crore with the Centre towards the devolution of central taxes and aid be released before March 31.All major political parties have already declared to donate the salary of their legislators to the relief funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-outbreak-maharashtra-government-employees-to-get-salary-for-march-in-two-instalments/story-Q9f19X0CHTbBYa1ZKUNo4N.html
01-04-2020||Delhi||SDMC steps up sanitisation ops in Nizamuddin area||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday stepped up sanitising operations in Nizamuddin Basti and Nizamuddin West residential colony and areas adjoining the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters, also referred to as markaz. A team of 40 people with sodium hypochlorite (a disinfectant) on shoulder-mounted knapsack pumps and three tractor-driven tankers sanitised the entire area on Tuesday, starting at 7.30am.The headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim organisation, in Nizamuddin West is emerging as a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hot spot in the national capital, with 24 confirmed cases so far, more than 400 showing symptoms of the contagious disease, and more than 1,100 people placed in quarantine. Though SDMC officials have been spraying disinfectant in the congested Nizamuddin Basti since Saturday, a senior official with the civic body, said efforts have been stepped up since Monday evening. “Till now 45,000 litres of disinfectant have been sprayed in the area, including Nizamuddin Basti, Nizamuddin West and Nizam Nagar. Spraying is being done twice a day. It starts at 7.30 am and continues till the entire area is covered. We have been spraying 15,000 litres of disinfectant in the area every day since Sunday,” the official said.A senior SDMC official said there is a special focus on disinfecting the area because of its population density and the fact that it also has a large floating population, factors which make it vulnerable for the spread of the coronavirus. Area councillor Yasmin Kidwai, said, “We ensured that the area adjourning the markaz (Basti and Nizamuddin West residential area) were completely sanitised on Tuesday.”He said that as many as 50 sanitation employees have been deployed in the area to sweep the area and collect garbage. Four tippers has also been engaged for transportation of municipal waste from the area.As many as 40 masked domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) are spraying disinfectant in the narrow alleys and lanes in the area that tankers cannot enter. “We are keeping a close vigil and actively taking all measures to contain the spread of the virus in the area. Whatever actions are required, will be taken,” SDMC mayor Sunita Kangra said.Meanwhile the health department of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) on Tuesday sanitised the Bakkarwala area, as suspected cases from Nizamuddin have been quarantined here, municipality officials said. Public toilets in and around Nizamuddin were sanitised as well on Tuesday.“The NDMC has provided the Delhi government 240 EWS flats at Bakkarwala to isolate suspected cases. The sanitation staff carried out spraying of disinfectant and fogging in Bakkarwala, along with other New Delhi areas such as Khan Market, Chanakyapuri. Officials are keeping a close watch on areas near Nizamuddin,” an NDMC official said.Residents concernedJangpura MLA Praveen Kumar said that ever since the matter concerning the congregation at the markaz came to light, he has been getting requests from residents of Nizamuddin West to carry screenings of all households in the area. “We have cordoned off Basti, Nizamuddin West and East, Bhogal and Sarai Kale Khan. People want all households, especially in the Nizamuddin West residential colony to be screened. The government is thinking of screening all houses in the Basti first.”A senior Delhi government official said the priority right now is to take all people in the markaz to quarantine facilities, and trace their contacts.Rakesh Mehta, former president of the Nizamuddin West RWA, said, “Our residential colony is adjacent to the Basti. There are no gates, so people move around freely here. The civic agency has sanitised the area. But now that so many cases have been reported, we want the government to screen all the houses in this area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdmc-steps-up-sanitisation-ops-in-nizamuddin-area/story-suwaz3SSLhLKgbCgpxuDYO.html
01-04-2020||Gurugram||33 sent to quarantine, cops suspect their participation in Tablighi Jamaat||Worried about the spread of Covid-19 in the district, the Gurugram administration, along with the local police, on Tuesday sent 27 persons from Pataudi and six from Dhankot village to quarantine at the Civil Hospital after collecting their samples for testing. Officials in the district administration said they were yet to find out if the patients sent to quarantine were part of the Tablighi Jamaat convention held at Nizamuddin in Delhi.“These people are from districts of Haryana like Mahendergarh and neighbouring cities like Loni border, Ghaziabad and Delhi. According to locals, 27 people — including three families — arrived in Pataudi on Monday night. These families, however, claim that they have been in Pataudi since March 2019,” said Rajesh Kumar, sub-divisional magistrate, Pataudi. He added that locals fear that the 27 were part of the Tablighi Jamaat. “We are still inquiring whether they were part of the Jamaat or not,” said Kumar, who along with the local police on Tuesday morning had gone to Pataudi and Dhankot .Of these 27 people, officials said, 13 are adults and the remaining children. They were taken to civil hospital, sector 10, where their samples were collected for Covid-19 testing. Currently they are admitted in the quarantine ward of the hospital and after the sample reports are in, the symptomatic patients will be admitted in the isolation ward, health officials said.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer said, “We were informed about people in Dhankot and Pataudi. So, we had to admit them in quarantine. We carried them to sector 10 civil hospital in an ambulance and their samples have been sent for testing to PGIMS, Rohtak. We had to take their samples to prevent community transmission . However, it cannot be confirmed right now, whether they were part of the Jamaat or not.” In Gurugram, of the 10 Covid-19 cases, 6 patients have recovered so far and have been discharged. One of the biggest cases of coronavirus transmission has come from a convention of Islamic preachers held by Tableeghi Jamaat held earlier this month in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Along with Delhi, the case is being connected to states like Maharashtra, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andaman-Nicobar, Andhra Pradesh and Srinagar. Telangana reported that six people who attended the event died from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/33-sent-to-quarantine-cops-suspect-they-might-have-been-part-of-tablighi-jamaat/story-2txuaCFYcWY1kTkYJ03G5O.html
01-04-2020||Delhi||Ghaziabad health dept traces 14 residents who attended Tablighi Jamaat congregation||The Ghaziabad health department officials on Tuesday said they have so far identified 14 persons in the district who had participated in the Tablighi Jamaat congregation earlier this month in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area.The chief medical officer (CMO) said the department will soon put the identified persons under isolation and is tracing those who might have come into their contact apart from others who attended the congregation.“ So far we have identified fourteen persons who had attended the congregation at Nizamuddin. We are in touch with them, and they will soon be taken to isolation wards and their samples will be collected for testing. The majority of these people are from Masuri area, while some are from Muradnagar and Loni. Our teams are tracing others who came into their contact,” Dr NK Gupta, CMO, Ghaziabad, said.“Some of the persons have shown symptoms of Covid-19. We are also tracing their contacts and fear that some of the identified persons might have offered Friday namaz at a mosque on March 20 and might have made direct or indirect contact with many people,” he added.The Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters in Nizamuddin has emerged as one of the biggest coronavirus disease hotspots in India with 24 people testing positive till Tuesday evening. In a digital address to the media, Delhi chief minister had said that 431 of over 1,500 persons evacuated from the Nizamuddin area till Tuesday had started showing Covid-19 like symptoms, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath and warned that this number could go up in the coming two or three days.The Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday morning cut short his visit to Ghaziabad and flew to Lucknow where he held meeting with senior state officials after the incident came to light.Avanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home), on Tuesday said the CM has directed officials to conduct searches in every district as there is a possibility that some people who attended the event at Nizamuddin might have entered the state.“Over 157 people who attended the congregation are in the state and 95% of them have been tracked so far. The rest will be tracked by Tuesday evening. If they show any symptoms, their tests will be conducted. Searches for others are going on in every district. We appeal to the people who attended the congregation and have come to UP to make self-disclosures, and those around them should also come forward to reveal information about such people to the local administration,” Awasthi said during a press briefing at Lucknow.Meanwhile, one more person was tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday in Ghaziabad taking the total number of virus-infected cases to eight.“The man declared positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday was admitted to an isolation ward as a suspect case. His test report confirmed him positive for Covid-19. He has been shifted to the Covid-19 ward, The man had come in contact with a 30-year-old man from Shalimar Garden who is an employee of Noida-based fire safety solutions firm ‘Ceasefire’ from where a number of positive cases have been reported,” Dr Gupta said. Until now, 24 persons, who are directly or indirectly linked with the company, have tested positive for the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-health-dept-traces-14-residents-who-attended-tablighi-jamaat-congregation/story-i7LdIZKLGAJDWvpHMrZ9RM.html
01-04-2020||Mumbai||Society in Navi Mumbai doesn’t step out, even to buy essentials amid coronavirus lockdown||A housing society in Nerul, which was once bustling with children playing in parks and senior citizens enjoying their evening walks, wears a deserted look since its residents went into complete quarantine.The Jay Balaji cooperative society, Nerul, which consists of seven wings and 200 flats with over 1000 residents, enforced ‘zero contact’ over the past few days. This implies that no resident is allowed to meet a person who is not a family member, speak to them or co-ordinate with them, except for over messaging applications.“We have never seen the society this deserted before. No children are in playgrounds, there is no hustle and bustle of people. It is grim to be living like this, but it’s for our greater good,” said Sangeeta Bal, a resident. Even for essentials goods and services, the orders are placed on the society messaging groups and Archana Lokeshwar, the chairperson of the society, combines all the orders and forwards them to the respective vendors. “We have set up a mechanism, wherein all the essentials are delivered at the gate by the vendors and our security and house-keeping staff pick it up, sanitise it and place it outside the door of the respective house. Then a message is sent on the group, and one by one members from each house can pick up their orders but not together,” said Lokeshwar.A team of 15 volunteers and around 11 security staff help Lokeshwar in this task.To take the zero contact initiative a notch higher, the society has collectively decided that any household, who has a person visiting them from outside, won’t be supplied with essentials for 10 days.“The self-quarantine is put in place to ensure that people can manage to do basic work on their own, and no carpenter or a plumber is called in. It is to minimise outside contact to prevent spread of Sars-Cov-2,” said Mugdha Moghe, a resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/society-in-navi-mumbai-doesn-t-step-out-even-to-buy-essentials-amid-coronavirus-lockdown/story-sFeWFdRv1w9MYPkTlkYzPN.html

Hence, they were not checked. Later, when they visited a local hospital here (Islampur), they were asked to go to Civil Hospital, Sangli. They were given tablets and told to remain indoors. I took a meeting on March 18 and asked the officials to stamp those with travel history. The stamping started from the morning of March 19. This family was also stamped and they visited the hospital again on March 22 complaining of medical issues. The local hospital immediately sent them to Sangli and their swap samples were sent to NIV Pune and the reports released on March 23 were positive. We immediately carried out tests of first contacts and those found positive were placed in quarantine.The outbreak has come at the beginning of your term as a state cabinet minister.This is not a local political situation, but a global health issue. We should not draw political conclusions, but take all possible steps to save people.Future course of actionWe will be starting a testing centre soon. I’m going to Miraj today [Tuesday]. After my return, a lab to carry out Covid-19 tests will be set up. The lab will function from Wednesday evening or Thursday morning as there is no such facility in Sangli, Kolhapur and Ratnagiri areas. Will you be staying in Islampur to review the situation?Where I stay is not important as it is not a flood-like situation that I have to meet people regularly. I am in constant touch with officers. The response to lockdownThe lockdown has been received fairly well by the people. The lockdown was announced by our state government and a curfew was called for before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the lockdown. 21-day lockdown is a long period, but as scientifically it has been observed that the duration will help in checking the virus spread, so we do not have any other option.The situation post-lockdownIf the lockdown is extended beyond April 14, the economy will come to a standstill. The authorities will find it difficult to cope up with the situation. Post-lockdown, production units all over Maharashtra will have to start all over again. The Covid-19 cases should drop after lockdown. The government may extend the lockdown period if infected numbers do not drop.Message for your constituency Essentials are in place. All towns and urban areas, including Islampur, are taken care of. People are co-operating. We have asked police machinery to deal with those who flout lockdown norms, softly but firmly. There is fear among masses as well which is preventing them from venturing out.How do you view the issue of migrant labourers getting stuck at borders?I don’t want to criticise anyone, but we should have thought about migrant labourers and their safety, stay and food requirements. It could have been planned in a better way. It is unfortunate that migrants are left to walk on the streets to reach their native places. In Maharashtra, we have set up camps for them to stay and be fed. We should have made them understand that it is a temporary phase, but the migrants felt that the crisis will be long term.Is not 21-day lockdown a long period? As I said, they feared that this could be 2-3 months. They felt that if they’re not going to have jobs here, it’s better to go back home. So, people migrated back to their own villages - UP, Bihar, Andhra and Karnataka. In the night, people are seen walking on highways.If the lockdown continues, is the government prepared to feed them?We have already started doing that through Shiv Bhojan.There are complaints that these canteens are closed due to fear of virus?Yes, that is happening. Whoever has taken up Shiv Bhojan canteen projects have been asked to restart canteens.Any incentive for them to open up?It is a seva (service) now. If everybody starts asking for incentive, how will the government be able to give? You keep social distancing and start serving. Fortunately, the virus has not spread among masses so nobody needs to worry. The places where we have found cases have been cordoned off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/we-have-taken-steps-to-stem-virus-spread/story-NlkHztSJVdlK5VR2M5C1RP.html
01-04-2020||Pune||Covid-19 patient in Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital tests negative for virus||A Covid-19 positive woman admitted to the Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital on March 16 has tested negative, twice, for the virus, hospital doctors said on Tuesday.She had been on ventilator support since March 16. Dr Sanjay Lalwani, medical director, at Bharati Vidyapeth, said, “This is a case wherein a patient who is on the ventilator has recovered from Covid-19. It gives us more reason to follow the lockdown and flatten the curve of the spread.” The woman has no foreign travel history and so was suspected to be the first case of community transmission in the city. A central team also visited the hospital to determine the source of transmission. The woman, who lives at Sinhgad road, was initially thought to have swine flu, but when her samples were sent to NIV, the institute confirmed Covid-19. Dr Lalwani said, “We sent her swab samples on Monday after she completed her incubation period and then we got her first test results negative. Her second swab samples were sent on Tuesday morning and that too tested negative. Right now, we can say that she has been cured of Covid19.”According to the current ICMR guidelines, any patient who tests negative for two swab samples taken at a 24-hour interval after the incubation period of 14 days can be said to have recovered from Covid-19. Dr Lalwnai further said, “She still has slight breathlessness, which is just the recovery phase. Her fever has gone down. If her recovery continues this way, she should be discharged in a week’s time.” The woman attended a wedding at Navi Mumbai earlier this month and used public transport to go to an Aangandwadi at Panshet in Pune, where she works as a sevika.Currently five persons infected through the woman are admitted to PMC’s Naidu hospital. The driver who drove the woman from Navi Mumbai to Pune is also quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-patient-in-bharati-vidyapeeth-hospital-tests-negative-for-virus/story-PQ3u7xsynPI5xHpoX3ITfO.html
01-04-2020||Pune||Drones, video calls, GPS tracking app and even personal visits: Pune admin out on a limb to track those home quarantined||The Pune police along with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and district administration have come up with various ways to keep a check on those home quarantined to prevent the spread of Covid-19 (coronavirus).The new methods of keeping a check on residents include drones, video calls, facial recognition techniques and a GPS (global positioning system) tracking app in the person’s phone to ensure that they do not leave their houses. While technology is at the centre of ensuring implementation of the home quarantine order, PMC staff is also visiting residences of those advised isolation and putting up posters at door with the message – “Please do not visit. This home is under quarantine”.The move to use drones, video calls or putting up posters has come after it came to the administration’s notice that many under home quarantine are not adhering to instructions and stepping out of their homes. According to the district administration, there are at least 3,500 people who have been ordered to be home quarantined and the list is growing amid fresh Covid-19 positive cases being detected. Besides posters, the PMC’s disaster management cell has dedicated its staff to call those at home at least once in a day to ensure that they do not leave their house. The PMC has also stamped the hands of those who have been asked to be home quarantined, so that it is visible for the social policing groups and neighbours. Rahul Jagtap, PMC IT department head, said, “The disaster management cell makes at least 2,000-2,500 calls every day and the list keeps growing. We have also put up posters at homes of those asked to stay isolated so that there is a societal pressure on the family members to stay inside from the neighbours and social policing groups. We have asked them to download an app ‘Saiyam’ which has GPS tracking so that whenever they leave their homes, we are alerted and we can inform the local ward or the local police station, who then visit the family.”To ensure, people under home quarantine are being provided essential commodities, the housing society members have been instructed to proivde the same to the family. On their part, police are making video calls everyday to ensure people under isolation are not stepping out. Through the video calls, police check if the person under mandatory home stay is at his residence. One of the new measures also includes use of drones to check if people are not stepping out home, especially when the centre has announced a 21-day lockdown. In addition to the PMC, the Pune police is also keeping a watch so that no one violates the home isolation norms. The Pune police has developed a facial recognition software system for surveillance of home quarantined persons in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad areas. It will help all police personnel to avoid direct contact with these persons. DCP Mitesh Ghatte (Special Branch) said, “The major features are the selfie-app based face recognition and location tracking system that enables a passenger/person to register themselves with their details like name, phone number, selfie and other relevant information. The passenger uploads his/her registration details using the app, following which a verification is made against the existing master list of passengers. Once the registration is approved, the selfie app enables a passenger to upload their attendance in the form of a selfie with location tagging in realtime.” He further added that this information is then sent to a private cloud based server which runs a realtime Artificial Intelligence based face recognition and location tracking algorithm and compares against the registered information. When the face data and location data match against the database, a positive attendance / update is made into a dashboard.”The district administration too has come up with a website and an app to keep track of those recommended home isolation and for the doctors who might get such patients. Both doctors and patients can register themselves on idsp.mkcl.org to update the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme which is under the central ministry, said district collector Naval Kishore Ram. With regards to doctors, they can notify the IDSP about any suspected patient with a travel history and they would be guided accordingly, added Ram. As of now, there are 4,591 passengers out of 7,746 passengers still under home quarantine in Pune division, including Pune, Solapur, Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/drones-video-calls-gps-tracking-app-and-even-personal-visits-pune-admin-out-on-a-limb-to-track-those-home-quarantined/story-HOuhjXE7kmVvH3OICIM0BM.html
01-04-2020||Pune||Pune’s Market Yard market allows entry to 400 vehicles at a time to maintain social distancing||Pune: The wholesale market at Gultekdi is back in business, though in small scale, after the Pune agriculture produce market committee (APMC) decided to allow trucks carrying agriculture produce to enter the market from March 29 [Sunday]. Though the members of Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders and Agents Association have not opened their shops, APMC Pune has decided to allow trucks to arrive at the market on alternate days — vegetables on one day and fruits on another day.An APMC official said that only 400 trucks will be allowed to enter the wholesale market at one time to adhere to the social distancing norm put in place because of Covid-19 (coronavirus) spread.“On Tuesday, 1,150 trucks, including 720 from sub division markets, carrying vegetables arrived at Market Yard. The total quantity of agriculture produce was 20,000 quintals. Looking at the response from farmers, the market is stabilising now and the rates of vegetables have also reduced. There is adequate supply of vegetables, fruits and other necessary essentials at the markets affiliated to APMC Pune and there is no need to panic,” said Balasaheb Deshmukh, Pune APMC chairman.“To maintain social distancing as a precautionary measure, we are not allowing more than 400 vehicles inside the market at one time. Retailers carry the vegetables, fruits and other essentials in light vehicles and tempos. The arrangement of goods and its sale is also done by maintaining distance between two shops. We appeal to farmers, traders, agents and purchasers to not bring extra goods and always produce identity cards issued by APMC, Pune to enter and leave the wholesale market,” added Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-s-market-yard-market-allows-entry-to-400-vehicles-at-a-time-to-maintain-social-distancing/story-R9fDFT5nBi6jA7oRV6U8pK.html
01-04-2020||Pune||Fear, shame and isolation: Lockdown in Maha’s virus hot-spot, Islampur, has 5K residents in eye of storm||Metal barricades have rendered the Uran Islampur area in Sangli into a ghost-town.One extended family that lives here contributed to 24 of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 (coronavirus) positive cases.Four family members, including two females – ages 62 and 50; and two males – ages 65 and 35; landed in Delhi on the morning of March 13 returning from a pilgrimage (Umrah) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.They had booked a package for 24 days, but had completed only 20 days of the Umrah.The family then flew to Mumbai the same evening and drove went straight home to Islampur, Sangli. The four reached home on March 14.Life ever since has been a never-ending series of tests, lockdowns and hospitalisations for the family and residents of Islampur.“The people in our area started behaving in a certain way with us. On the day the first four were tested positive, general stores stopped selling to people of our community. Our family is suffering. How are we to blame for this?” said a family member who runs a local business, has tested negative, and is in an institutional quarantine facility set up by the local authorities.“My parents are not educated people. And they’re old. If you ask them what quarantine or coronavirus means, they might not be able to tell you. At Delhi airport, as well as Mumbai airport, only thermal temperature testing happened. They were not informed about the situation or what precautions they needed to take, or even taken into quarantine. They reached home early on March 14 and the next day we took them to our family doctor. The doctor referred us to Islampur government hospital, who in turn referred us to Sangli Civil hospital,” said another young man from the family, who is a software engineer based in Pune.“There, they were given flu medicine twice. On March 21 got more medicine. However, as the flu conditions were not improving we took them to Islampur government hospital where we were told to go to Sangli Civil Hospital on Sunday morning (March 22). That is when the entire process started,” said the young man.The joint family lives in three houses in the Gandhi chowk area of Islampur. Positive patients were found in all three households.The family members had allegedly visited a bank, the municipal corporation, hospital and the local masjid, all of which have been sealed shut, according to Dr Saket Patil, taluka health officer.“We acted as soon as we could, without wasting any time. My team has maintained a map of their movements and marked out the core area which includes the family houses and the two maids’ houses, and buffer zone where they may have visited. My team is working continuously and has managed to contain the spread,” said Dr Patil.“One of them came into the bank, from what I know. Our house has been sealed shut for the past few days. The shops that were open for some days were shut down during the three-day severe lockdown. Now we just stay inside and wait for milk and groceries to be delivered,” says Chandrashekar Pawar, whose household of seven shares a wall with the MD Pawar People’s Bank, where a Covid +ve family member visited. “There is no strict distinction between secondary and tertiary contacts of the family. So far, there is no provision for swan testing of secondary and territory contacts,” said chief surgeon at Sangli Civil hospital, Dr Salunkhe.The Islampur area is divided into three– the core zone, where the three houses of the infected family are located; a buffer zone where they are suspected to have roamed; and the rest of the area.Pawar’s house falls in the buffer zone where one member of each family is provided with the home quarantine stamp.The entire sealed area has 5,000 people living within, according to Pradnya Potdar-Pawar, chief municipal officer, Islampur.“There are 10 officers of the municipal council, including me, who are living in isolation, away from the family for the past few days. Nobody wants to come near Islampur, but my staff is on the road on all days, maintaining cleanliness. The garbage from Islampur is not going to the usual dumping yard, but to Surya Biomedical Agency where it is incinerated. Continuous fogging and spraying of sodium hypochlorite is on. My city has risen to the challenge and we will get through this,” said Potdar-Pawar.The administration has set up a 75-bed isolation facility on the outskirts of Islampur which lodges 28 people who have come in contact with positive cases, according to Dr Saket Patil, taluka health officer. Of the 28, 18 have tested negative, 10 are yet to be tested.The authorities are also tracking 434 people from 79 families who were identified as secondary and tertiary contacts of the infected family.Police action-The Sangli police, along with health department officials, are tracking 434 people whose houses are marked with a quarantine notice.- The Islampur police station officials have appointed 28 special police officers (SPO) who help enforce the lockdown.- A case has been registered against one of the 24-infected family members for giving an allegedly false statement about having made contact with a neighbour with whom he had an old disagreement, according police inspector Narayan Deshmukh.Municipal council action- Regular fogging and spraying of sodium hypochlorite in open areas.-Home delivery of essential goods like vegetables, groceries and milk .- Garbage from Islampur is not going to the usual dumping yard, but to Surya Biomedical Agency where it is incinerated.-Gutters are cleaned more regularly than usual.-All sanitation workers are provided with masks and latex gloves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fear-shame-and-isolation-lockdown-in-maha-s-virus-hot-spot-islampur-has-5k-residents-in-eye-of-storm/story-bEOcg8KTXr6A8u6BgbthKN.html
01-04-2020||Pune||Covid-19: Maharashtra’s Kolhapur deploys data analysis-driven tool to track returnees||Kolhapur district which has reported three positive cases of Covid-19 as of Tuesday, has deployed a data analysis-driven symptom-based risk assessment tool to track the estimated 75,000 returnees to the district. The ‘Corona Symptom Tracker’ consists of an e-questionnaire circulated by the district administration via SMS on the mobile phone network and a back-end analysis of the filled forms by CPC Analytics, a Pune-based data analysis firm. On March 29, Maharashtra’s minister of state for home Satej (Bunty) Patil, a prominent Congressman and Kolhapur’s guardian minister said in a tweet: Our primary priority is to quickly identify individuals who are at a high risk of being affected. Along with @deosahil and @pvinayak, we have developed a symptom-based risk tool. If you have returned to Kolhapur from outside or have symptoms, fill this.” Patil shared the link to the e-form of the Corona Symptom Tracker on his tweet. In a telephonic interview he said: “Nearly 75,000 people have returned to the district and we didn’t know how to track them. This tracker has provided us with a tool where the people can connect with us and we can connect with them. People are responding and this is a good platform for communication. It is also helping us with GPS tracking.” Sahil Deo, co-founder of CPC Analytics, said the analysis of about 12,000 forms received so far has been done and people with medium to high risk have been identified for follow-up action by the district administration. The 12 questions in the e-form are as per the guidelines of the WHO (World Health Organisation) and the Indian Council of Medical Research), he said. “The system allows the district collectorate to call and intervene in the cases we flag as medium to high risk. It allows us to track community spread if it is happening,” he said. Deo’s colleague, Vinayak Pachalag, a data analyst on the ground working closely with the Kolhapur district administration said, “We shot 30,000 links of the tracker in the first phase on March 29. Of these, 12,000 people responded. The medium to high risk cases identified through the tracker are manually validated. The district administration has deployed nearly 7,000 people on the ground for Covid-19 related work.” Pachalag said of the estimated 75,000 people who returned largely from Pune, Mumbai, Bangalore and Goa where they were working, the administration has data such as phone numbers and addresses of about 60,000 people.The e-questionnaire Issued by the Kolhapur district administration begins by stating that it can help people assess whether they are at risk from Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease. It then gathers basic details such as name, gender, mobile number, age, address, taluka and foreign travel history in the last month, especially to the high risk countries. Respondents are asked whether they were suffering from symptoms such as fever, tiredness, dry cough, difficulty in breathing and whether they have body pain, nasal congestion, runny nose, or diarrhoea. It then proceeds to ask about health conditions such as hypertension, lung, kidney or/and heart disease, cancer, diabetes, other chronic diseases or ‘none of the above’. The 12th question asks whether they had any contact with a Covid-19 patient.Deo said the data is “extremely granular” (detailed) and “luckily the people there are taking it seriously. Every minute, we get 20-30 new entries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-kolhapur-deploys-data-analysis-driven-tool-to-track-returnees/story-JZTF7A8wAFO4i7Gd0teGgI.html

This includes restricting the entry of non-uniformed personnel, contractual staff, staggered meal timings for personnel, multiple hand washing points, minimising the congestion in barracks and shutting down of non-essential stores and office spaces.As a part of assistance to civil administration, this station has also been at the forefront in providing the essential services to the civil populace around the base. The nearby Kurvande village with an approx. population of 4,000 and a labour camp comprising about 325 persons adjacent to this station, which provide contractual manpower for MES works, were completely sanitised by the SHO team on March 28 and 30. The station also facilitated and coordinated the distribution of food packets and other essential provisions in conjunction with the local NGOs.All the domestic helps residing at the Naval Officers Residential Area (Nofra) were briefed about the prevention measures to be taken to avoid the Covid-19 on March 30 which was followed by the distribution of essential provisions to the domestic helps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ins-shivaji-lonavla-takes-precautionary-measures/story-76vZTUWltfQ2pH0gMagIsK.html
01-04-2020||Pune||NCL Pune starts R&D on bulk drugs to develop self-sufficient, indigenous supply chain in India||Pune-based CSIR National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) is currently focusing on the chemical synthesis of at least half of the 53 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and bulk drugs in order to develop self-sufficiency in the drug supply chain in the country.The Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved on March 21 a special package for the promotion of bulk drugs parks to finance common infrastructural facilities and production-linked incentive schemes for the manufacture of key starting materials (KSMs), drug intermediates and APIs in the country, in response to the medical emergency situation which might arise due to Covid-19 lockdown for an extended period. According to officials, the Indian pharmaceutical industry is the third largest by volume, but it is critically dependent on imports of raw materials or KSMs, in some cases to over 80 per cent extent, mainly from China. Drug security, self-sufficiency and continuous supply of essential medicines are the need of the hour for national security and healthy population. India has the largest number of FDA approved manufacturing sites outside of the US. “The more than 27 or so bulk drugs covering different therapeutic classes such as anti-viral, retro-viral, antibiotics, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, cardiovascular, diabetes, cholesterol lowering, anti-cancer to simple pain killers like paracetamol, are synthesised from about 10-12 simpler building blocks or KSMs and drug intermediates. Self-sufficiency in drug supply chain for India means indigenous processes and platform technology to produce these important KSMs,” said NCL director Ashwini Kumar Nangia. “For three-four drug intermediates and bulk chemicals, R&D projects are already ongoing and these will be fast-tracked. For remaining four-five molecules, the most efficient routes considering atom economy, novel catalysis, flow chemistry, process intensification, plant safety, cost of raw materials, reagents and solvents, and recycling of by-products, and energy management have been designed. These chemical processes will bring down the cost of production through continuous flow synthesis, process optimization and reaction engineering, an area in which CSIR-NCL has prior experience and expertise. CSIR-NCL scientists have reported a novel and economical chemical synthesis of cystic fibrosis drug Ivacaftor in 2018, which is one of the highest priced drugs for patients (US $300000 per year per patient). CSIR-NCL has recently demonstrated flow synthesis with minimal or no solvent use which will make significant economic benefit when translated for the identified molecules. Apart from cost economics, minimal chemicals, process safety, and environment friendly, the biggest advantage of multi-step continuous flow technology is that the production can be carried out on smaller scale in a distributed model at several locations, a factor which will be important in the medical emergency situation facing the country,” he added. “We are hopeful that CSIR-NCL will be able to release the R&D reports to the government and chemicals and pharmaceutical industry bodies soon as each laboratory scale process is ready in the next few weeks and months to be taken up for manufacturing by Indian drug companies. The capability and infrastructure for further synthesis of final APIs from the intermediate KSMs largely exists in the country,” said Prof Nangia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ncl-pune-starts-r-d-on-bulk-drugs-to-develop-self-sufficient-indigenous-supply-chain-in-india/story-N39DbkmkGTtf59hGGklHlJ.html

Apart from the game, Bharucha is catching up on the ‘traditional’ quarantine routine of doing the household chores. A resident of Camp, Bharucha explains her current daily routine. Morning sessionI am a physiotherapist by profession, so I treat patients during this time (only those who really need my presence). I follow-up with all my other clients via social media.Afternoon sessionThe first half of the afternoon I devote to doing household chores like cleaning and sweeping my house. Post lunch, I train inside my house or on the terrace of our building. These workouts are usually sent out by our coaches from South Africa. Coach Jannie Brooks is our strength and conditioning coach. He puts out daily WODs (work out of the day) on his Instagram handle, which I follow. His latest upload is the 1,000 repetition challenge. Through the workout, you end up completing 1,000 repetitions distributed over 10-12 exercises- these comprises variations of squats, lunges, push-ups and core. At times, I just do cardio by running up and down the six floors of my building over a predefined time limit.Evening sessionI just relax in the evening, eat good food, write my diary, plan the next day and binge watch videos on the internet. I also watch rugby games (men’s, women’s and even my own games) to get those visuals in place, so that I can practice it whenever the time comes. I watch at least two 7s games and one 15s game.I look at these for reference points, to learn, to practice as and when the situation permits. Watching games helps me grow and it broadens my point of view of a scenario. I watch players who play the same position as I do (number 8) and I look at everything from how they place their hands in a scrum to what skills and speed would they possess and in turn work on myself because now I have the visual in my mind.Also something that we (rugby India) have begun on Wednesday evenings at 7pm is “The Breakdown Session,” where people get to interact live with the national stars of India rugby over the Rugby India Instagram portal. So, inching to a Wednesday, I am preparing for that too.No gymsI do basic exercises like squats, push-ups, lunges, core, burpees and then, their infinite variations. As rugby players, we also need to keep our running continuously in check, so I step out early mornings just outside my building and do some shuttles to get those strides in place and my cardio vascular system pumping.HobbiesI love colouring and spend a lot of time doing that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/captain-of-india-s-women-rugby-team-tackles-lockdown-in-pune-with-work-out-of-the-day-breakout-sessions-over-the-net/story-Z1dnWNqZNMCm8ptfLFd7gO.html

He had treated the 65-year-old coronavirus patient from Nayagoan in Mohali district who died on Tuesday afternoon.The patient was suspected of having contracted H1N1 virus and was being treated along with other patients in the emergency ward. After he was tested positive, 36 healthcare workers were quarantined in the hospital, including 22 nursing officers and five doctors. Officials said two nursing officers showed symptoms of the disease. One of them tested positive, while the report of the other nurse is awaited. The nurse has been admitted in the communicable disease ward of the institute and is stated to be stable.His nine-month-old daughter and wife have been quarantined.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram confirmed that the nursing officer had tested positive. The other Chandigarh case is a Sector 49 resident, who is a doctor at Mayo hospital in Sector 69, Mohali. After confirmation of his results, he was admitted in Mayo hospital itself. The condition of the doctor is stated to be stable.With this, the number of positive cases in Chandigarh has spiked from eight to 15 in the past two days.The first case was reported on March 18, after a 23-year-old student, who flew back from London tested positive. Later, her five contacts, including her brother and mother, tested positive.A 22-year-old mechanic, who returned from Dubai, tested positive on Friday after which his mother and two friends were diagnosed with Covid-19, too.

No one from the family, except his son, was allowed to attend. His other family members are under quarantine, so we could not allow them to attend the cremation.
