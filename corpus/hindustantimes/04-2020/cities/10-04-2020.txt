The district administration had conducted screening of the entire area on Wednesday where it found that 35 workers of the popular Bengali Pastry Shop were living in unhygienic conditions in a cramped space above the shop, violating social distancing norms. The Delhi Police had also registered an FIR against the owner of the shop on Thursday for not following social distancing measures which may have caused the spread of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ndmc-issues-show-cause-notice-to-bengali-market-pastry-shop-owner/story-GRnVAkS09iw4BSJPEB4RnM.html

Now everyThe person entering will have to pass through the tunnel to get sanitised before entering Azadpur Mandi—Asia’s largest fruit and vegetable wholesale market. While inaugurating of the tunnel, Delhi’s development minister Gopal Rai said depending on how successful the tunnels prove to be, the Delhi government will install such machines in the other wholesale markets in Delhi.“The Azadpur Mandi is open during the lockdown as it supplies essential items for residents of the entire city. The Delhi government has installed two full-body sanitisation machines at the market gates. Every person entering and exiting the Mandi will have to pass through these machines which will automatically spray a sanitising solution on them. This will protect the people from the coronavirus spread,” Rai said. “This machine is developed by the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. I have instructed the traders to maintain social distance and the government has also marked circles in front of the shops for the purpose. Special attention will be given to the cleanliness of the market. I have instructed all the labourers and traders to wear masks as well. The Delhi government is distributing masks to everyone here,” he added.To sensitise the workers at the wholesale market, the government is distributing pamphlets on the dos and don’ts on controlling the coronavirus spread. Disinfectants are being sprayed at the market daily.

10-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt shuts paid quarantine facility at Aerocity||Once the largest quarantine cluster facility in the country, the paid quarantine centres in Aerocity near the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport were shut by the Delhi government on Friday. From now, all Covid-19 suspected patients will be taken directly to government quarantine centres set up in various parts of the national capital.The paid centres were opened on the night of March 16 at five hotels of Aerocity — Red Fox, IBIS, Aloft, Holiday Inn, and Pride Plaza — and as many as 608 people were put under quarantine. Most of the them were passengers who had arrived at the Delhi airport from other countries and had to undergo the mandated quarantine. According to district magistrate (New Delhi) Tanvi Garg, of the 608 people under quarantine, five tested positive for Covid-19. Three of them had come from the Untied States while two were from Australia. “The Aerocity’s paid quarantine facility saw the last batch of passengers check out on Thursday. With this, the paid quarantine achieved its purpose successfully with only five positive (asymptomatic) cases. The remaining 603 persons were discharged after they tested negative for Covid-19,” Garg said. The five Covid-19 patients are being treated at Lok Nayak hospital. Piyush Rohankar, the area’s subdivisional magistrate and the nodal officer of the paid facility, said the hotel quarantine facility has now been closed by the government.“Now, every district has quarantine centres, so there is no need for the paid facility anymore. In case there is a spurt in cases, then the government itself will book the hotels. The people will not have to pay,” he said.A few persons who stayed at the quarantine facility told HT over phone that some of them had to stay there even after their 14-day mandatory quarantine was over as the government did not have a standard operating procedure (SoP) in place for their movement, what with the 21-day nationwide lockdown in place from March 24.“Although my quarantine got over last week, I had to stay on as officials could not tell us how we could go back to our homes. Cabs are not plying and friends or family could not come because of the lockdown. From this week, they started issuing transit passes which is acceptable all over India for a fixed period of time,” a 47-year old man, who did not wish to be named, said. It was only on April 4 that Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev issued the SoP which allowed persons who have completed their mandatory 14-day quarantine period to return home via routes approved by the district administration and within a specified time frame.“Transport arrangement has to be made by the person and transit for fixed route with specified validity for such person will be issued by district magistrate of district concerned. Such person will further remain under home quarantine for a period of 14 days, as per standard protocol on the matter; the details of such person will be shared with State/UT Government for necessary follow-up,” read the SoP. Rohankar, who issued the transit passes for all the hotel quarantine persons, said there were people who went as far as Andhra Pradesh by road. He, however, refused to provide the contact details of such persons citing confidentiality.But, Sudipto Chakraborty (27), who left the quarantine facility on April 5 had no option but to shift to another hotel in Delhi. “While leaving, they gave us a certificate for completing the mandatory quarantine and also the Covid-19 test report. My home is in Assam, and the authorities offered a cab on payment basis. But, I opted out because it would have cost me a bomb to go all the way to the north-east in a cab. So, I am staying in another hotel in Delhi,” he said. “I got a call form the district administration today. They asked me about my health and if I am showing any flu-like symptoms. So, they are doing solid follow-up even on those who have completed the quarantine,” Chakraborty said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-shuts-paid-quarantine-facility-at-aerocity/story-U0BTGfsxahh0M6P8UdJ9FM.html

Now, the district has 48 positive cases, contributing 31% to the state’s tally.Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “Extensive sampling has enabled us to detect more positive cases in the village and isolate them timely. Without testing, containing the village of around 2,500 plus population would not have achieved the desired results”.Of the 206 samples collected from the village, reports of 12 are awaited.On Friday, 20 new cases reported in Punjab, yet another day of highest spike in a single day.Earlier on Wednesday, as many cases were reported. With one more death in Mohali in a 78-year old woman, the total count of Covid-19 casualties in the district rose to 2. The samples of the woman, who died on April 6, came out positive on Friday.However, the state government’s media bulletin mentioned only one death in the district.With 15 cases, Pathankot district’s Sujanpur has emerged as another hotspot as 14 people have been found infected from the town. Of a total of 3,461 tests conducted in the state, reports of 2,972 samples have been received. Of these, nearly 95% have turned out be negative.Even as the state government is claiming to have increased its testing capacity to 800 tests a day, only 269 samples were sent for testing on Friday.State health department’s Covid-19 official spokesperson Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the department is waiting for rapid testing kits from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) which will be used in the hotspots.“In a rapid test, results arrive within 15 minutes. The samples found negative during these tests will be sent to our state laboratories to reconfirmation. Our increased capacity will be fully utilised during the rapid testing,” said the spokesperson.“Everyday, ICMR officials assure us that rapid testing kits would be arriving anytime. We are waiting for these kits for the last three days,” a senior health department official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-one-fifth-cases-from-mohali-village-alone/story-qlSgL8mckktB8fSFF6v1hO.html
10-04-2020||Lucknow||‘Happy, digital village’ waging musical war against corona||A rather queer makeshift barrier, made up of some old wooden logs and worn out plastic contraptions, announces that the entry of outsiders to the village is banned.Some youths using ‘gamchas’ (multi-purpose cloth wrap-around) as their face masks keep an eye on all arrivals at the barrier from a distance. This is the scene at the entry point of Latifpur, about 40 km from Lucknow and part of the ‘Maal-Malihabad’ famous mango belt.This village, with a population of around 2,000 people, had over the last couple of years also taken to digitisation in a big way, especially under its young woman pradhan Shweta Singh, who holds a master of computer applications (MCA) degree.But where is she? It didn’t take long to locate her, though. That’s because following the sound of music that emerged from the centre of the village, we reached her when she was busy leading a music party, playing cymbals, to create awareness on novel coronavirus. The lyrics of the song, penned by the music party, were self explanatory: “...agar corona se bachna, bachaana hai, to ghar ke baher nahi aana hai, gamcha se mooh dhak ke hi bahar aana hai ... (to save oneself and others from corona stay indoors and wrap a ‘gamcha’ on your face while going out ..).”A ‘dhol’ player was also part of the musical group that clearly appeared to be drawing a number of villagers towards it. “See, music is hugely popular in villages. So we thought of creating awareness through music and as you can see it seems to be working, though we intend to improve on the lyrics,” says Shweta.She is aware of the return of migrant labourers to their villages from across the country.“We are in touch with all of them who have gone out for work. Seven of those who had returned to the village were quarantined for 14 days at a special isolation facility we have set up here,” she said.“Coronavirus has delayed our plans for the village. We have prepared a Rs 420 million (Rs 42 crore) five-year plan for the village and our village panchayat works on both long, mid and short term goals,” she said.“In many ways we are self sufficient. We are growing vegetables and the rural belt has enough availability of fruits, too. Our village is geared up to deal with the lockdown, even if it were to be extended,” said a village elder. “We had gone digital long back. There is internet connectivity, we have a whatsapp group which helps keep us posted about the requirements of the villagers.” We have also been going around telling the masses why it was necessary to frequently wash hands with soap,” the village head said.“We like to call ourselves – a happy, digital village,” she said. A village projector is also used to screen movies and other important documentaries and messages.The village has also inked a pact with Japan for a mango-honey project and can also offer, in normal times, a camel ride to people around the village. A ‘camel safari’ if you like to call it so!BEATING THE CORONA SCARE ‘DIGITALLY’Functional village whatsapp group for two-way information.The village has its own website and a mobile app – digitallatifpur – to disseminate information to villagersThe gram panchayat is also running a common service centre (CSC) which helps villagers keep connected Doorstep banking facility which helps provide banking services right at the doorstep.

10-04-2020||Mumbai||Society in Mumbai sealed, residents step up to help each other||Until a week ago, the residents of a society housing 300 flats at Raj Arcade society in Kandivli could take walks in their complex while following the social distancing norms. However, on April 7, the civic body sealed their society after four members of a family were tested positive for Covid-19, forcing around 1,000 residents of the society to remain restricted to their homes until April 19. The family has been quarantined at a civic facility while the members of two homes, who were close contacts of the family, have been asked to follow self-isolation. More than 20 residents who came in contact with the family have been tested for negative for the virus, but there is panic among the residents but they are cooperating with the officials. “No one was taking the lockdown seriously. The supermarkets were open till 4am and residents continued to roam out. Now after finding corona-positive patients in our society, residents are worried and are now staying indoors,” said one of the residents Mihir Jobanputra, who is a businessman.With the society gate sealed now, residents have to place online orders for vegetables, fruits and groceries or through guards, which will be delivered outside the gate.“BMC officials have been of a great help to us. A WhatsApp group has been created by them in which we can inform what we need and they get it delivered outside the gate. The commodities are sanitised by the security guard and police officers deployed at the society gate and sent to residents through a small window outside the gate. From Friday, a vendor has been delivering vegetables outside the premises to the guard,” said Divya Agrawal, one of the residents.Some residents are helping senior citizens living alone to place grocery orders. “There are some senior citizens, who are facing difficulties, but order their groceries and place it outside their door,” said Sneha Sedani, a photographer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/society-in-mumbai-sealed-residents-step-up-to-help-each-other/story-Y9tfcOTC3QJAnxamdtzLTP.html

10-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 outbreak: Delhi University may shift admission process completely online||Delhi University (DU) on Friday recommended to all its colleges to shift the admission process completely online, including the verification of documents and certificates, for the academic session 2020-21, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. In a communication sent to colleges on Friday, Shobha Bagai, the dean of admissions, said that the varsity’s admissions branch has been working towards ensuring a friendly admission process for the students for the coming academic session amid the pandemic. “There have been conscious efforts to minimise visits of the students for physical verification of the mandatory documents during the admission process. In the current scenario, it is recommended that it becomes more imperative to have the complete admission process online, which also includes the online verification of the certificates,” it stated.In DU, the process of registration for admission to undergraduate courses and submission of fee is already online. However, candidates have to visit the colleges of their choice for the verification of certificates and documents to complete the admission process.The varsity’s admission branch has also asked all colleges to provide information about the number of course combinations offered by them and the additional eligibility criteria by Monday.The registration process for admission in DU colleges begins in the last week of May every year, immediately after the announcement of CBSE class 12 results. However, this year, the CBSE had to suspend exams midway after a nationwide lockdown was announced to contain the spread of Sars-Cov-2. The board is yet to announce a fresh date sheet for the remaining exams. Although the university has not announced any delay in the admission process as of now, a senior official said they are monitoring the situation. “We are not sure for how long the lockdown will continue. We will wait for the CBSE and other state boards to complete their exams and announce results before starting the registration process. We are also waiting for some communication on this from the University Grant Commission,” said the official, requesting anonymity. Besides, the university has asked all colleges to make relevant information about the admission process available on their websites, including names of courses offered and the number of reserved seats under different categories in each course. The colleges were also asked to constitute their own admission teams to coordinate the process. Some college principals, meanwhile, said it won’t be feasible to verify certificates and documents online. “On one hand, the university asks us to do forensic checking of the certificates and documents and on the other, it’s now recommending online verification. The university’s colleges are not equipped for that. The varsity should postpone the admission process by a week or two rather than bring in sudden changes,” said the principal of a north campus college, requesting anonymity.DU postpones semester examsDelhi University has postponed all theory and practical exams scheduled this month as well as for the next month till further notice, amid the coronavirus outbreak. In a notification, the university said the date sheets issued earlier now stand withdrawn and fresh dates will be issued soon. The university has also postponed exams of the School of Open Learning (SOL) and Non-Collegiate Women’s Board (NCWEB). DU is shut till April 14 in view of the 21-day nationwide lockdown. A senior university official said, “The UGC has constituted a committee to take a decision on the completion of exams and the academic calendar for all central universities. We will issue a fresh notification for the examination based on the recommendations of that committee.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-outbreak-delhi-university-may-shift-admission-process-completely-online/story-Sb5HzbardDJX1I2kQmzXoJ.html

In a letter dated April 8, the director, communicative diseases said a technical team found the quality and design of the PPE kit satisfactory and fit to be used. “Principal secretary, health has not only cleared the quality and design of Kheri-made PPE kits at very reasonable price but also assured to procure all PPE kits prepared by our SHG groups,” said the CDO.“Initially, a demand for 1000 PPE kits has been placed,” Singh added.“UP medical services corporation has also approached Kheri administration expressing its intention for PPE kits procurement.”“However, the very idea behind the PPE kits was to equip our health and the police officials which prompted us to find ways to prepare the kits at local level as we did not expect the kits from the government in a large numbers given the huge demand everywhere.”“But we wanted certification of quality, design and price from the government before taking up their production,” he said adding “we are glad that apart from approval, the health department has assured to procure them.”Regarding production of the PPE kits, the CDO said, “Polypoplin fabric used in making PPE kits is of a very high quality.” “This material is available at select markets in Lucknow, Noida, Mumbai and Chandigarh,” he said and added “but the lockdown has put some hurdles in collecting raw material.”“Our commitment to serve the humanity is such that we would overcome this hurdle.” He said some PPE kits had already been provided to Kheri police and health staff. So far, four Covid-19 patients have been detected in the district. The first such patient, who was undergoing treatment at KGMU in Lucknow, was discharged on Friday. The other three are under treatment at the institutional quarantine centre at Behjam—15 km from the city. -----Deokant Pandey||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/amid-covid-19-threat-self-help-groups-making-ppe-kits-in-kheri/story-GidzTS06Xwi7y6ewe2lrpK.html

The move comes a day after nine containment zones were identified in Gurugram city and it was decided that these areas should be sealed to prevent the spread of the pandemic. The decision to make masks mandatory has been taken under sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Epidemic Act, 1897 and the Haryana Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 Regulations, 2020, said the government order.According to the order, all persons going out in public places like streets, hospitals, offices, markets etc., must be compulsorily wearing a 3-ply mask or cloth mask.

10-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC directs AIIMS to treat HIV-positive woman with mouth cancer||The Delhi High Court on Friday directed the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to provide necessary treatment to a woman who has been an HIV positive patient from the past 20 years and was diagnosed with mouth cancer in March this year.Justice Mukta Gupta also asked the Delhi government to issue a curfew pass to her if the lockdown is extended beyond April 14 so that there is no inconvenience caused to the petitioner or her family members.The court’s order comes on the plea filed by the woman who was an HIV patient and had developed mouth ulcers since 2015. The plea sought direction to AIIMS to provide her necessary treatment after AIIMS Delhi had referred her to AIIMS, Jhajjar. According to her plea, before she could visit AIIMS, Jhajjar with the relevant reports, she received a message that her appointment date has been cancelled because the hospital had been notified as an exclusive hospital for treatment of coronavirus patients.Following this, she visited AIIMS, Delhi but was only examined at the OPD and no treatment was given. The plea also alleged that no date of surgery was given and she had started bleeding from her mouth, resulting in aggravation of her condition.In a status report, AIIMS informed the court through video conferencing that she was admitted to AIIMS on April 4. She was evaluated and it was observed that in view of the nature of growth, poor general condition and anticipated poor surgical outcomes, the surgical procedure for her disease stage would be a high-risk, major, radical procedure with substantial morbidity (Subtotal Glossectomy) and she may not withstand such surgical procedure.Following this, an opinion was sought from the radiotherapy department on April 6 which recommended definitive chemo radiation. The report also said that her tooth would be extracted and radiotherapy will be administered thereafter, to which the petitioner has agreed. The court then said that considering the physical condition of the petitioner as well as her other ailments and if the doctor opines that performance of the surgery would be at high risk to the patient, it would not direct the doctors to take a different view. The counsel appearing for AIIMS assured the court that the treatment will be administered to the petitioner as an in-patient and later as an out-patient by giving her definitive chemo radiation.The court disposed of the plea and said that the petitioner be discharged only after her condition stabilises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-directs-aiims-to-treat-hiv-positive-woman-with-mouth-cancer/story-yJ2UIcQnpsFAVElie1v1JI.html
10-04-2020||City||Musical evenings at Time Residency to keep Covid-19 tension at bay||Gurugram: Keeping spirits high while living in the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus can be a difficult task. However, for the residents of Time Residency in Sector 63, respite has come in the form of musical entertainment. The initiative has been designed, keeping in mind social distancing norms being observed during the ongoing lockdown. The society has been organising musical evenings for the past one week. The residents are participating as well as enjoying the musical evenings from their balconies The first event held on April 4 saw songs by the participants being played on a loudspeaker system. They even had a live singing session from balconies for the first event. The residents had signed up for this ahead of the event and a line-up was decided accordingly.“We had close to 10 residents participating from their balconies. The line-up was shared with them beforehand and they sang one after the other. One person sang while playing his guitar. The idea is to keep spirits high during the lockdown,” said Upendra Pande, vice-president of the residents’ welfare association (RWA) and one of the pioneers of the initiative. The musical programme usually starts post 7.30pm so as to make sure that the residents can join in after finishing their work. The event, mostly planned for weekends, can last up to an hour. It was previously held on Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti when bhajans (religious songs) were played. The society has now decided to take the event a step further and is planning to organise a music quiz contest on Saturday. “There will be 10 songs in different languages. These songs will be similar to a Hindi rendition. Residents have to guess which song it is and what is the language of the song,” said Pande. For the residents, the musical evenings are a welcome break from the tedious lockdown. Lalitha Iyer and her family used the event as a family activity. Her husband, mother-in-law and 10-year-old daughter sang from their balcony.“My husband sang Kishore Kumar’s ‘O Mere Dil Ke Chain’ and my daughter and mother-in-law sang to the tunes of Ajeeb Dasta Hai Ye,” said Iyer, a resident.The musical programme, however, was not well received by all residents as some complained of it to the police. “A few people don’t like it. They complained to the police and our speakers were temporarily confiscated. But we spoke to the authorities and sorted it out. Our musical events will proceed as discussed,” said SK Mishra, RWA president. Mishra adds that since the lockdown started, the society has strictly banned the entry of outsiders. All deliveries, except that of LPG cylinder, are made at the main gate and the residents are expected to collect their packages from there. “The truck is allowed to deliver a cylinder at the lobby. From there, the resident has to take it up to his/her apartment,” said Mishra. At the main gate of the condominium, the society is using thermal scanner to detect individuals with high temperature and also mandating all passing through its gate to use sanitiser. “Everyone has to wear masks when outside,” said Mishra. Walks have been banned while pet owners need to step outside the society to let their pets relieve themselves. Since the lockdown began, the society has been providing accommodation and food to around 22 staff. They have been housed inside vacant apartments and the clubhouse. The residents have donated mattresses and pillows for their temporary living quarters. “We are providing them an additional 10% amount, along with salary,” said Mishra. While the staff are provided meals three times a day free of cost, the residents are also pitching in to make their stay comfortable from time to time.

As of Thursday, 73 patients have been discharged in Mumbai and 125 have recovered in the state.BMC officials said that in other countries, there have been instances of Sars-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19, reappearing in those who had reportedly recovered from the disease. Additional municipal commissioner, BMC, Suresh Kakani said, “One cannot rule out completely that the virus cannot reappear after being discharged, considering there are enough cases globally where people have been diagnosed after being discharged. In Mumbai, there are no cases yet, but we are following up with all the patients who have been discharged.”As per the state health department, Mumbai has the highest number of Covid-19 cases (1,008) in the state where altogether 1,574 people have tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 as of Friday. However, with 73 people discharged, Mumbai has also seen the most recoveries followed by Pune (27), Sangli (12), Nagpur (four), Yavatmal (three) and Ahmednagar (two). Aurangabad, Ratnagiri, Satara and Sindhudurg have each reported one patient having recovered from Covid-19.The BMC has directed its 24 wards to set up special teams to follow up with patients who have been discharged. Upon recovery, patients are given post-discharge instructions that include maintaining safe distance from others at home and remaining as isolated as possible. Daksha Shah, deputy director, health department of the BMC said, “We have a standard practice of following up with patients after they are discharged. All medical health officers in the respective 24 wards will follow up with patients to ensure medical attention, if any is required, is given.” Patients are considered recovered only after they test negative for Sars-Cov-2 twice.Kakani added that patients were also being asked to monitor their own recovery and report any returned symptoms to the BMC. “The first 14 days after being discharged are crucial. We expect patients to report back to us, if there is anything,” he said.As of Thursday, Mumbai has reported 54 deaths from Covid-19, which is more than 50% of the state’s tally of 97. Pune has reported 24 deaths from Covid-19 followed by eight in Thane, three in Palghar, one each in Aurangabad, Nagpur, Ratnagiri, Satara, Buldhana, Jalgaon, Nashik and Amravati districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-keep-eye-on-cured-coronavirus-patients-too/story-CW8DKoHTUZ6Pn7CjMfdPNJ.html
10-04-2020||City||Suspected Covid-19 patient made to run from pillar to post in Ludhiana, probe launched||In a case reminiscent of the district’s first coronavirus disease (Covis-19) casualty, another suspected patient was allegedly denied admission to Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC&H) on April 5 and made to run from piller to post for treatment. A probe was initiated in the matter on Friday.The 35-year-old suspected Covid-19 positive woman was suffering from renal failure. The patient, who stays in the Durgi area, was first taken to the Civil Hospital on March 30 for dialyses.A health department official, on condition of anonymity, said, “The woman had been referred to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, for dialysis but as she could not travel amid the lockdown, the patient sought treatment at a private hospital in Model Town on April 3.”“Soon after, her condition began to deteriorate and she developed a fever and dry cough. She was rushed to the Civil Hospital for treatment on April 5. However, the doctors referred her to CMC&H as they suspected of having Covid-19,” the official said.The patient said that instead of admitting her to the hospital, CMC&H authorities sent her back home.On April 8, her condition worsened and she was rushed to the hospital in Model Town where hospital authorities after reading the referral slip of the civil hospital, which mentioned that she was suspected of having Covid-19, raised the alarm.Thereafter, a social activist reached out to the woman and got her admitted to the Civil Hospital.When deputy commissioner Pardeep Agrawal heard of the patient’s ordeal on Thursday, he directed thecivil surgeon to submit a report in the matter.Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga initiated an inquiry into the matter on Friday and asked Dr Baldeep Singh, a medical officer at the Covid-19 unit of the civil hospital, about the incident. The reports of the suspected patient are still awaited.Medical superintendent Anil Luther said the woman had not been denied admission. “We have 14 beds, including seven ventilator beds, dedicated to those suspected of Covid-19 and all of them were occupied. The patient and relatives were apprised of the issue and as per protocol were further referred to another tertiary care hospital for treatment,” said Dr Luther.History repeats itselfThe first patient in the city to die due to Covid-19 was also referred from one hospital to another until she finally breathed her last at Rajindra Hospital Patiala.The 42-year-old, mother of three, was made to visit the Civil Hospital multiple times from March 19 to March 26. When her condition worsened, she was rushed to the Civil Hospital on March 29, from where she was referred to CMC&H, and later ESI Hospital. Ultimately, she was again admitted to the Civil Hospital from where she was rushed to Rajindra hospital, Patiala, at midnight where she succumbed to the infection in the small hours of March 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/suspected-covid-19-patient-made-to-run-from-pillar-to-post-probe-launched/story-0PSsD7WEKz2rwoVoRCYtOI.html
10-04-2020||City||In Greater Noida’s sealed hot-spot areas, essential items to be given to volunteers for doorstep delivery to residents||To ensure strict implementation of social distancing norms, the Greater Noida authority has directed its staff to deliver essential items such as milk, vegetables, fruits, groceries and medicines to the office bearers of the apartment owners associations of housing complexes or to volunteers, who will then deposit the goods at the doors of each resident in hotspots which are sealed till April 14. The move is to ensure that people stay inside their homes and do not come out at all in sealed places. Greater Noida authority CEO Narendra Bhooshan said he monitored the distribution of essential services and conducted inspections on Thursday – the first day of the implementation. However, the goods could not be supplied at the door steps of residents in large housing societies.In Greater Noida, the hotspots are Sector Alpha 1, Nirala GreenShire sector 2, Patwari village, ATS Dolce Zeta 1, Omicron 3 Sector 3, Mehak Residency Acheja village, Village Visnoi post Dujana, Ghodi Bachcheda, Strellar Mi Sector Omicron 3, Palm Olympia Gaur City 2 Greater Noida West’s Sector 16. In many sectors, vegetable vendors delivered ferried carts at houses so that the residents could buy vegetables without stepping out. But in housing societies, the apartment owners had to come out, walk all the way towards vendors to buy vegetables or milk, etc. Despite the CEO’s directions to deploy volunteers to deliver goods at the door step, the system could not take off in large housing societies, unlike in plotted areas.“As of now, we are walking to vendors at the main gate to buy essential goods. In big societies, it is not possible for volunteers to deliver goods at every door step. In Palm Olympia and Gaur City 2, for instance, we faced issues on day one. As of now, we are walking to the gates,” said Rakesh Ranjan, a resident of Gaur City 2, one of the hotspots. Similarly, at ATS Dolce in Sector Zeta 1, essential goods are available at the society’s gate.“Residents are coming out to buy essential goods as per their requirement,” said Akhilesh Kumar, assistant facility manager at this project.In sector Alpha-1, which is a plotted area and one of the hotspots, the supply of vegetables or milk was smooth.“We faced problems on Thursday as many areas were sealed. But now a vegetable cart is moving in lanes and milk is being delivered to houses on order from the local vendor. Many volunteers are also helping deliver essential goods to our society that has around 900 houses,” said Alok Singh, former vice-president of sector Alpha-I resident welfare association and founder member of the active citizen team of Greater Noida.“Our staff members are ensuring essential services are provided at all hotspots. If there are issues, we will resolve the same,” said Bhooshan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-greater-noida-s-sealed-hot-spot-areas-essential-items-to-be-given-to-volunteers-for-doorstep-delivery-to-residents/story-eGHGVU3KpoZcI8VLkMzozH.html

The administration has also issued orders stating that RWAs of condominiums, societies, and residential sectors can also approach Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (HSAMB), district food and supply controller (DFSC) as well as Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) for getting essential items.HSAMB officials said RWAs of condominiums, societies, and residential sectors can send an email to rwa.covid@mcg.gov.in for procuring essential items such as vegetables, fruits, milk, ration. The essential items that would be put together in packets and subsequently delivered inside the residential areas.“Since last month, we already have a mechanism in place for delivering essential items to RWAs and in the past we have already delivered essentials to a few societies that fall under the nine containment zones. We will emulate the same process unless the administration gives new directive stating otherwise,” Vinay Yadav, secretary, HSAMB, said.On March 25, the MCG had issued a public release stating that the civic body will provide fruits, vegetables, pulses, flour, rice, sugar, and salt to RWAs of condominiums, gated colonies, and residential sectors that do not have a local grocery within their premises. The MCG had also issued a price list of each item along with the release.The MCG, the HSAMB, and the Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited (GMCBL) have joined hands to deliver essential goods to city residents.As per Mitu Dhankhar, zonal administrator, HSAMB said that after an order has been placed on the MCG’s email address, a disinfected bus operated by the GMCBL would be loaded with all the stock. The stock would then be dropped by delivery teams at designated sites chosen by respective RWAs. The drop-off spots would be within the establishment and would be open sites where circles would be marked to ensure residents maintain social distance.The delivery teams would all be provided with a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kit, which will include masks, gloves, sanitisers, full-body and shoe covers.The team members will be directed to not make any physical contact with any resident under any capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-administration-allows-online-delivery-retailers-to-continue-services-in-containment-zones/story-4U4dHpzUvnXSRrfJwkUj4M.html
10-04-2020||City||Principal secretary sent on leave by Maharashtra government for allowing DHFL scam accused to travel||The state government on Friday sent principal secretary Amitabh Gupta on compulsory leave, a day after it came to light that his letter helped 23 people, Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) scam accused Wadhawan family and their friends, travel to Mahabaleshwar amid national lockdown. The police have booked the 23, including Kapil Wadhawan, a promoter of DHFL, and Dheeraj Wadhawan, former executive director of DHFL, and put them in “institutional quarantine”, even as the incident led to a blame game between political parties.Sources said the Wadhawans were staying in a rented accommodation in Khandala, a hill station around 80km from Mumbai, from where they were asked to vacate. They decided to move to their farmhouse in Mahabaleshwar, also a hill station around 220km from Mumbai. The Wadhawan family could bypass the sealed district borders and travel from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar thanks to the letter by Gupta on his letterhead as the principal secretary (special), home department. According to officials in Satara collectorate, locals from Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani objected to allowing them to stay in their farm house or keep them under quarantine at Panchgani facility, which unearthed the violation. As the letter was leaked, home minister Anil Deshmukh announced a probe on Thursday night. Gupta was summoned by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Thursday night and the home minister on Friday morning. He has reportedly admitted to giving the letter to the Wadhawans. Gupta reportedly tried to convince the home minister and the chief secretary that the wrong letter was sent out by his personal secretary to Wadhawans. He reportedly told his political bosses that the second letter had the words ‘they are my family friends’ removed from the draft. “He did not say whether he was pressurised to do so,’’ said a senior bureaucrat. Gupta was not available for a comment.On Friday, Deshmukh tweeted, “As per discussion with Hon CM, Mr Amitabh Gupta, Principal Secretary (special), has been sent on compulsory leave with immediate effect, till the pending inquiry, which will be initiated against him.” The state has ordered an inquiry by additional chief secretary (finance) Manoj Saunik, while the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) have written to the authorities in Satara to restrain any further movement of Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan. Tejaswi Satpute, superintendent of police, Satara, said that all the 23 members of the family are under “institutional quarantine” for a stipulated period of 14 days. “The CBI learned that both the accused were located in Satara and lodged at a government institutional quarantine centre at Panchgani. Thereafter, an email was sent to the district magistrate and superintendent of police of district Satara to not release them without a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the CBI or an order of the court,” a CBI spokesperson said. “Even after the issuance of notices and non-bailable warrants, they have not appeared before CBI or the court.” In March, the ED, too, had issued multiple summons to Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan over money laundering charges in Yes Bank case. The brothers had mentioned Covid-19 pandemic as one of the reasons they are not travelling. The ED said the cars too are proceeds of the crime and should be seized. “The agencies have told us that the two are accused in their cases. We will provide assistance,” said Satpute.The Satara police have filed an FIR was filed against the 23 people under sections 188 (disobeying government direction), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code, along with Epidemic Act.The controversy is said to have damaged the image of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said: “Thackeray should tell the people of Maharashtra that under whose pressure the letter was issued.” BJP leader Kirit Somaiya alleged that Wadhawan family had close ties with NCP chief Sharad Pawar and other leaders of the party. Deshmukh and NCP leader Jitendra Awhad rubbished the allegations. Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “We suspect that the permission given to Wadhwans was at the behest of some BJP leader as the family has been very close to the party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/principal-secretary-sent-on-leave-by-maharashtra-government-for-allowing-dhfl-scam-accused-to-travel/story-oj17f2RgwFSzlk3mnDiXtK.html

The societies whose residents need help with withdrawing cash were Corona Optus, Takshila Heights, ILD Green, Iperia Esferia, Our Homes, BPTP Park Serene, Ramprastha City, and NBCC Green View.LDCM Prahlad Roy Godara said the mobile ATM van carried adequate cash and it started dispensing cash at Sector 37 C and D societies within two to three hours of getting the orders from the DC office.“As per deputy commissioner’s directions, we told the residents to maintain social distancing while withdrawing cash. We had mapped the entire localities and all the mentioned societies before reaching,” said Godara, adding that nearest ATM from the Sector 37 C and D is at a distance of 1.5km in Sector 10.The residents on Wednesday had taken to social media and tweeted their concern regarding cash crunch and had tagged Khatri and other top district administration officials.Hemant Kumar, a BPTP Park Serene resident, said, “I sent a message to the DC on WhatsApp raising our concern, and he quickly responded and also sought a list of other societies where residents were falling short of cash. We shared the names of all eight societies by evening we got a call from Godara. We need cash to buy fruits vegetables for other purchases for which digital payments are not possible.”In the district, after the national lockdown came into effect, ATM cash withdrawal has reduced by 50 to 60 percent. “We have observed that in all the 1,440 ATMs in the district that usage has gone down 50 to 60 percent as fewer people visit these kiosks after amid the Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. This is the first time during the lockdown we have supplied cash through a mobile ATM van,” Godara said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mobile-atm-van-reaches-out-to-residents-running-low-on-cash/story-gcmhK02w8OQXN65GNeDSgK.html

The 100-bed quarantine facility at BBDIT College campus in Duhai had admitted 10 suspected cases and they were shifted from MMG Hospital on the night of April 7. A day later the patients took to social media and also posted videos showing According to the videos shared by the suspected patients and the report published in HT, the centre did not have electricity, there was no water to drink, no water or soap to wash hands, no sanitiser, the toilet doors were broken, there were no blankets and the food was inedible. One woman seen in one of the video broke down while stating that some rooms were accommodating two people, instead of one. “After the patients flagged lack of basic facilities, we shut it down a day later. Five patients were sent to MMG Hospital and eight were discharged as they had tested negative for Covid-19,” chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said, adding the facilities at BBDIT College, as per the administration, were proper and each patient had one bed in one room, unlike MMG Hospital where there is a dormitory-type bed arrangement.“From our side arrangement was proper. Since the patients did not like the facility and raised issues we decided to shut it down instead of ramping up facilities which would have diverted more of our resources,” Dr Gupta added.It must be noted that the district needs at least 500 more quarantine beds to cater to patients in future. At present, the district has different quarantine facilities with a total of 554 beds, where 436 people were housed till Thursday afternoon. “We are looking for more colleges we can turn into quarantine centres and require at least 500 more beds to cater to patients in future,” Dr Gupta said, adding that the items purchased (water bucket, mug, slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, mosquito repellent, liquid hand wash, sanitizer, soap, face masks and gloves, among others) to meet the patients’ demands will be handed over for use at MMG Hospital.Meanwhile, the people who were shifted back to the MMG Hospital said they felt safer there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/newly-opened-quarantine-facility-shut-health-dept-to-hand-over-500-personal-kits-to-patients/story-Qzwq2xDB8HbgP9Jrsb0YYP.html
10-04-2020||Noida||UP govt defers lease, water charges of commercial, industrial establishments for three months||The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday said it has decided to postpone recovery of water or sewer charges and lease rent charges of industrial, commercial and institutional premises for three months amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The move comes after the Noida Entrepreneur Association (NEA) demanded relief as their operations have been shut due to the 21-day nationwide lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of Sars-Cov-2. The NEA -- a body of around 10,000 industrial unit owners -- however is not happy with the decision as they had demanded a complete waiver of such charges for the period during which their operations were shut due to the pandemic.After the NEA’s initial letter, the UP government had formed a committee headed by the Noida authority additional chief executive officer. The committee decided that the payment of lease rent and water charges shall be postponed from March 21, 2020 to June 30, 2020, in view of the lockdown.“However, the postponement of lease rent and water charges will be effective only if the industrial, commercial and institutional businessman pays their respective dues by June 30, 2020. If they are not able to pay up by that date then the respective authority will impose an interest on the allottee,” said the order.According to rules, the industrial, institutional and industrial allottees have to pay 2.5% of the total plot cost as lease rent annually or they can choose to pay monthly. Similarly, they can pay water charges monthly to the authority and if it is delayed then the authority can impose an interest.The NEA office-bearers, meanwhile, say this move will not benefit them at all.“The government has already completely shut down operations and we are facing huge financial issues. The government has forced us to pay the salaries of the staff. We had demanded that they not charge lease rent and water charge as we are staying home and not using any of these facilities. Therefore, they should have completely waived it off. How will we arrange funds when our operations are shut and we are facing a funds crisis? We will write again and demand a waiver,” said Vipin Malhan, president of NEA.When contacted, the Noida authority’s chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari said, “We have given what was possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-govt-defers-lease-water-charges-of-commercial-industrial-establishments-for-three-months/story-YpUTxoPhXhZngv45CGtLXK.html
10-04-2020||Noida||UP may defer land dues collection as builders hit hard by Covid-19 lockdown||The Uttar Pradesh government may defer the instalments of housing land dues to Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway industrial development authorities, following requests by builders, as the Covid-19 pandemic has shut down construction and drastically affected the real estate sector.The state government said that it will address the economic crisis being faced by the real estate sector after the national real estate development council (Naredco) demanded a relief package and submitted a demand letter to the Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary, RK Tiwari.“We have received a letter from builders’ body, Naredco. They are demanding the state government’s attention on issues, which are being witnessed by developers amid the nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic. Our infrastructure and industrial department that deals with the real estate sector will look into their demands and take action on the basis of merits and demerits of the issues. The government will take appropriate action as per law,” said RK Tiwari Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary speaking with Hindustan Times.Tiwari said, “Nadredco’s Uttar Pradesh president has spoken with me on the issues faced by builders. We have asked the concerned department to look into the matter so that an appropriate decision can be taken.”The state’s industrial bodies, Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway industrial development authorities, need to recover at least ₹35,000 crore land dues from the builders. The builders are of the view that as the construction is shut in the view of Covid-19 pandemic, they will not be able to repay the installments of land dues.“We have requested the UP government that they should postpone the repayment of land dues for one year and reduce the compounding interest on land dues because we cannot pay our installments amid fund’s liquidity crisis after Covid 19 pandemic forced us to shut all operations. Also, we have requested the government to extend the time for two years, in which many of the builders were supposed to repay financial dues. Another important issue is that the government had earlier fixed June 2021 date to deliver flats and claim some relief on financial dues. Now we have demanded that this flat delivery date should be extended to June, 2023 because construction, which is shut down, will not be restarting any time soon,” said RK Arora, president of Uttar Pradesh chapter of Naredco. Naredco also demanded that many builders, whose projects were disrupted due to a National Green Tribunal order in 2013, are yet to get financial relief package. “We have requested from the government to look into many such issues because only government support can help revive this sector,” said Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-may-defer-land-dues-collection-as-builders-hit-hard-by-covid-19-lockdown/story-UrIsdAYanP0HsmQt4iqKVP.html

Not just the Prime Minister, but most from Bollywood and even the sports world, have been praising their painstaking services. Time and again their videos and messages have surfaced on social media, asking everyone to follow social distancing. However, now, the medical residents (young doctors) have taken to social media to voice their anguish over the recent attacks on doctors — who are treating corona positive patients — that include being pelted with stones and even being spat on.

A senior resident of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Bengaluru, says, “In these tough times, motivation is one of the greatest weapons that we can use. And I feel perpetrators — who have attacked doctors — should be brought to justice so that the doctors have faith that the system backs them.” READ | Rishi Kapoor, Raveena Tandon lead Bollywood in condemning attacks on doctors, cops: ‘They are endangering their lives’Dr Nikita Garg, a junior resident at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, who is under self-isolation after tending to coronavirus patients, says, “What has happened is terrible!

10-04-2020||Mumbai||Shutdowns at 9 Mumbai’s coronavirus hospitals put 1,700 beds off treatment grid||Nine major private hospitals in Mumbai with a cumulative capacity of 1700 beds have been asked to partially or completely shut down their emergency and out-patient department (OPD) services, in addition to some hospitals being told to not admit new patients. The reason: Over the last two weeks, 99 medical staffers from these hospitals have tested positive for Covid-19.Shushrusha at Shivaji Park on Friday was the latest hospital to be placed under the Covid-19 scanner by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) after two nurses tested positive. Following this, 28 nurses in the hospital were put under quarantine and the hospital was asked to shut down its emergency services immediately and shift existing patients to other hospitals in the area within two days. It has 130 regular beds and 17 intensive care unit (ICU) beds.Earlier, Jaslok (Pedder Road), Saifee (Charni Road), Bhatia (Tardeo), Wockhardt (Agripada), Breach Candy (Bhulabhai Desao Road), Nanavati (Vile Parle), Sai (Chembur) and Hinduja (Khar) had been placed under various degrees of restrictions by municipal authorities.BMC officers said they are taking action as per Union health ministry rules. “Covid-19 is a highly transmissible virus. As a precaution, we have to close down some hospitals for the safety of other patients and staffers. We fumigate the hospitals and take samples of all close contacts, and keep others under observation for 14 days,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC. “Most of these patients were asymptomatic, so it is quite possible that medical staffers got unknowingly exposed to the virus and turned into carriers,” she added.Wockhardt and Jaslok have reported the highest number of cross-hospital transmissions. At Wockhardt, 56 medical staffers, including doctors, nurses and ward boys have contracted the virus, making it the worst-affected hospital in Maharashtra with in-house infection cases. This 20-storeyed tertiary care hospital has 350 beds.At Jaslok Hospital, 1005 staff members were tested, of which 21 were found infected with Sars-Cov-2, the coronavirus responsible for the current pandemic. The multi-speciality hospital has 364 beds with 75 ICU beds. At Breach Candy hospital, which has 201 beds, one doctor and two nurses contracted the infection. At Saifee hospital, two doctors contracted the disease through close family contacts. This hospital has approximately 250 beds with 44 ICU beds and nine operation theatres. On Thursday, a nurse at Nanavati Hospital also got diagnosed with Covid-19. This multi-speciality suburban hospital has 350 beds with 75 critical care beds and 11 operation theatres.The number of infected staffers at Bhatia hospital (capacity: 200 beds) increased to 14 on Friday. This is in addition to three patients that had tested positive. Hinduja, with one Covid-19 positive patient and Sai Hospital with three have also come under BMC’s scanner.Following the infections, all hospitals barring Sai Hospital, tied up with the state health department to provide treatment to Covid-19 patients in their isolation wards at concessional rates. However, BMC has not only stopped new admissions but has also kept close 500 medical staffers from these hospitals under quarantine, thus taking away crucial medical manpower resources.Doctors HT spoke to said partially or completely shutting down hospitals for 14 days is impractical, especially since all of them have government accreditation to handle infectious diseases. “A rescue plan to isolate infected workers and the sanitisation of premises should be formulated to reopen these institutions within 24–48 hours instead of a prolonged shutdown of 14 days or more,” said Dr Ramen Goel, President, Indian Association of Gastro-intestinal Endo-Surgeons (IAGES).Other doctors raised the need to divide healthcare facilities into Covid and non-Covid hospitals to protect uninfected patients from the virus. “In China when over 3,000 medical staffers contracted the infection, the country made a makeshift hospital with a 5,000 bed facility. This not only decreased the chances of infection among other patients but managing the resource became handy,” said Dr Vikrant Shah, infectious diseases specialist from Zen Hospital in Mumbai.Dr Mukesh Gupta, president of Association of Medical Consultants said it is important to start more fever clinics at private hospitals, and these should be dedicated for patients with symptoms. “There is a need to have a separate exit and entry point for these fever clinics. If a patient has symptoms, he or she should be directly referred to Covid-19 care facilities,” he said.Doctors also blamed the unavailability of protective kits as the reason behind the spread of the infection within hospitals. Due to a sudden surge in demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), the price of per kit has increased to Rs5000, which, according to the government, shouldn’t cost more than Rs1000.“We can’t use the same PPE for more than one patient. The patients get scared if we have examined any infected patient with the same gloves,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra. “There is so much scarcity of PPE that doctors are now wearing raincoats,” he added.In a meeting held on April 8 with the state health minister Rajesh Tope, IMA said it had asked for Rs 1crore to be assured for doctors in they died performing Covid-19 duties.Meanwhile, on Friday, in a meeting with the representatives of private hospitals, civic chief Praveen Pardeshi warned the hospitals to abide by the safety rules. “The hospitals have been asked to use PPEs and ensure there are separate exit-entry routes for suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients, failing which they must stop admitting coronavirus patients,” said a doctor who was a part of the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shutdowns-at-9-mumbai-s-coronavirus-hospitals-put-1-700-beds-off-treatment-grid/story-amN3vX2MKUEnKt2ORfXBKI.html
10-04-2020||Noida||Greater Noida: Women to be shifted out of quarantine centre after they complain about unhygienic toilets||The district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar has ordered to shift all women Covid-19 suspected patients to a facility at Galgotias University, Greater Noida, after some of the patients allegedly created a ruckus over the hygiene of a government quarantine centre developed at the Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar hostel in Gautam Budh University in the same city.On Friday, the women patients had complained to the doctors and the nurses that they had to share the toilet and bathroom with male Covid-19 suspected patients amid unhygienic conditions. “The condition of the toilets is really unhygienic. We were allotted single rooms which were decent but the toilet facilities were a massive problem. It was uncomfortable to share the washroom with men. Many people who were kept under quarantine at the facility were complaining of the same,” said a 39-year-old woman from Noida who was kept under quarantine and was discharged Friday afternoon after her reports came negative for Sars-Cov-2.“I had travelled to Chennai from Delhi and recently I received a notice from Chennai authorities to get myself checked at the government hospital in Greater Noida. I was told that I will have to stay at the quarantine centre for two days till my reports are received but I ended up staying there for almost five days as my reports got delayed,” added the woman.District magistrate Suhas LY said he has asked the district chief medical officer (CMO) to look into the matter and to write adverse remarks for the doctor heading the facility at Ambedkar hostel. “On Thursday evening itself, I had asked to shift the persons under quarantine to the other, better facility. The CMO has been asked to make adverse remarks against the concerned doctor handling the facilities at the centre. We have made multiple arrangements in the district to ensure that none of the Covid-19 suspects or patients face any inconvenience,” said Suhas LY, DM.Despite multiple attempts, the district CMO was not available for comments.According to the officials, Covid-19 suspected patients at the Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar hostel quarantine centre are given a soap bar, a personal bucket and mug for bathing, and mosquito repellent, along with a separate room. There are 15 cleaning staff members at the Ambedkar hostel who are provided with personal protection kits, which they have to wear before entering the wards.All the women COVID-19 suspects will be shifted to the new facility in the Galgotias University by Friday night, officials said. Till now, a total of 64 confirmed cases of Sars-Cov-2 have been found in the Noida district, out of which 12 have been discharged while the remaining are under treatment for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-women-to-be-shifted-out-of-quarantine-centre-after-they-complain-about-unhygienic-toilets/story-4rNBO9WVo2TdFTiIrJgMNL.html
10-04-2020||Noida||MMG Hospital Covid team tests negative for coronavirus, to remain in quarantine||A group of 12 doctors and staff members, who have been on duty at the MMG District Hospital since the first case was reported in the district in early March, have tested negative for the Covid-19 disease in first of the two tests required as per protocol, officials of the district health department said Thursday. “The report of the first team has come out negative for Saras-Cov-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19 disease). They had been on duty since early March and are now in passive quarantine. The second team is looking after patients in the isolation ward. Once the first team completes 14 days, they will return to active duty. They will then stay in active quarantine and continue to stay away from their families,” Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said.The development comes as a sigh of relief for the hospital authorities as the group includes the hospital’s only physician, besides six nurses and six ward boys. The hospital faces staff shortage even as 13 areas have been made containment zones in the district. “The first team to go on passive quarantine includes our only physician. In absence of our only physician, we have deployed three doctors—radiologist, skin specialist and paediatrician—for attending to patients in the 50-bed isolation ward. Four staff nurses, three pharmacists, three ward boys and three cleaning staff members are now on duty. The two teams will work in rotation,” said Dr Ravinder Rana, chief medical superintendent of MMG District Hospital.CMO Dr Gupta said the first Covid test of the medical staff is done on 12-13th day after last contact with a positive patient. In case the first report is negative, a second test is repeated after 24 hours. In case the first report is positive, the second test is repeated after 2-4 days. “They will be considered negative when two consecutive reports are found negative. For positive patients, the second test is also repeated on 12-13th day,” he added.The physician, who is presently in passive quarantine at a hotel room in Mohan Nagar, said he had been on duty from March 12 when first Covid-19 patient was detected in Ghaziabad. “It has been a long time since I have been able to meet my two daughters and wife. Although it is a major relief that I have tested negative for Covid-19, but I have been cut off from home and am only in touch with them through the mobile phone,” the physician from MMG Hospital said.“When they were on duty, they were not allowed to go home and were residing in the hospital complex itself,” Dr Rana said. No new cases were reported from Ghaziabad on Friday. The total number Covid-19 cases remained 25, of which three have recovered; no fatalities have been recovered from Ghaziabad. There have been instances in Delhi and Mumbai where doctors and nurses have tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/mmg-hospital-covid-team-tests-negative-for-coronavirus-to-remain-in-quarantine/story-YGX2AJscufcmp7lO8meabJ.html
10-04-2020||Mumbai||CM will get 2 months as MLC if appointed||The Covid-19 outbreak has complicated chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray’s election to the state legislature. While the state cabinet decided that governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari must nominate Thackeray from his quota to the state legislative council, the CM will get a tenure of only two months to the upper house. This is because the term of the two vacant seats from the Governor’s quota ends on June 6. Thackeray will only get the remainder of this term.The Governor can appoint 12 people from the fields of art, sports and social work to the upper house on the recommendation of the government.Thackeray was not a member of the legislative council or the legislative assembly when he took over the reins of the state on November 28. He had six months to get elected to either of the house and that period ends on May 28. If he is not nominated or elected in this time, not just Thackeray but the entire cabinet would have to resign.The CM was to get elected to the council through elections for one of the nine seats to be held in April. However, the polls have been indefinitely postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.“Thackeray will not get a full term of six years. He will be able to get only the remainder term as an MLC and the term of that particular seat is ends on June 6. He will have to be re-nominated by the Governor to continue working as the CM,” said a senior official from the state legislature.Given the uncertainty due to the outbreak, the question is what happens after June 6 when Thackeray’s term as a potential MLC ends. If the governor renominates him to the post, all may be well but there could be a legal tangle over whether a person can be reappointed as a minister without being elected to (any of the two Houses of) the state legislature.A Supreme Court judgment issued on August 17, 2001 has termed such reappointment of a minister in the then Punjab government without getting elected as “improper and undemocratic”. “Tej Prakash Singh had resigned from the position as a minister on March 8, 1996, but was reappointed without getting elected in the same term of the legislative assembly as a minister on November 23, 1996, which was challenged in the court of law. The judgement was given by the bench of justice RC Lahoti and KG Balakrishnan,” said a senior law department official.According to Article 164 (4) of the Constitution, “a minister, who for any period of six consecutive months, is not a member of the legislature shall at the expiration of that period cease to be a minister”.The article is silent on reappointments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-will-get-2-months-as-mlc-if-appointed/story-8fkehn66zjLURvfp5FeyFK.html

From March 31, Jamnabai Narsee School has been using its kitchen to make food packets and distribute those to people in need with the help of the parent teacher association (PTA). “We are using the school kitchen to cook meals for those in need. Our in-house cooks are preparing these meals and parents are helping with distribution. The idea was to use our existing resources in this current crisis,” said Sujay Jairaj, trustee of the school. So far, nearly 6,000 meals have been dished out of the school canteen. Lunch boxes are packed in the school premises. In addition to this, parents are also trying to distribute masks, cookies and other essentials depending on the need and availability of resources.Manan Doshi, vice-chairperson of the school PTA said every day fresh meals are cooked, packed and then distributed across the city. “The cooks working in the school are from other parts of the country and were unable to go home. Thus, we decided to involve them and take up the initiative. Many places, such as old age homes, have challenges with respect to cooking as their staff returned to their respective hometowns. The idea is to reach out to the people in need,” he added. The school has also redesigned its logo for the time being. The sides of the hexagon have been separated to give out the message of social distancing. “This is the least we can do to spread awareness about the importance of social distancing,” said Jairaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/juhu-school-distributes-food-to-700-people-every-day/story-YHuBaGQCGsFocPxzZFcW8J.html
10-04-2020||City||Day 2 of sealing: Deliveries still hampered in hot spots, vendors allege police harassment||The delivery of essential items to 13 Covid-19 hot-spot areas in Ghaziabad was hampered for the second day of the intensive lockdown, announced by the Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday. Residents in these clusters complained that they were not receiving essential items at doorstep, as promised by the government, while vendors roped in to make these deliveries said their distribution network was hampered by several administrative bottlenecks and delivery persons accused the police of harassing them.Under the intensive lockdown, 13 hot-spot areas of Ghaziabad were sealed on April 9 and will remain so till the morning of April 15. According to official figures, the 13 hot spots in Ghaziabad have a population of 74,208. On Wednesday night, more than 24 hours after the intensive lockdown was announced, the Ghaziabad district administration roped in multiple vendors for each hot spot areas to supply milk, medicines, vegetables and grocery items.“One of the two milk vendors for our high-rise told us that they could supply only 500 litres of which will be insufficient for 1,300 families. However, our earlier vendor who supplied milk was roped in to offset the shortfall. The designated vegetable vendor told us that he will be able to supply us only by 3pm Friday and residents kept waiting for delivery,” Mukesh Kumar, a resident from Oxy Home, said.The high-rise is located near Tila Morh behind the Hindon airbase and has about 6,000 residents.“The designated chemist also was unable to make deliveries, while the grocery vendor told us that he is short of delivery persons. So for the second consecutive day, residents are struggling to daily need items,” Kumar said.Rajiv Mishra, the business head (retail) of Gopaljee Ananda, a dairy company, said milk supplies in city areas were better but his delivery persons faced issues with the police during distribution.“There are a lot of checks on the road and delivery persons are not allowed to move to rural areas. They are harassed by police and so they refuse to go to such areas. So far, we have deployed 25 delivery persons on motorcycles and have a capacity to scale it up to 100 or 125. But police must also cooperate so that the supply chain is not hampered,” Mishra said.He added that freezers have also been placed in a few high-rises.“We have informed the administration officials about this but the problems persist. There is another problem --- many delivery persons have left due to lockdown. In areas such as Masuri, we have been able to provide only 200-250 litres of milk on Thursday as a result,” Mishra said.Masuri near NH-9 is the biggest of the 13 hot spots in Ghaziabad with a population of about 50,000 living in 5,000 houses. Residents here complained that they were not able to get milk or vegetable supplies ever since intensive lockdown kicked in.“We have been able to supply about 45 crates to areas such as Masuri. Each crate has 12 litres of milk. The supply in other areas is streamlined with the help of our company vehicles and also the vehicles deployed by our distributors,” Sharad Garg, senior superintendent (infrastructure development), Mother Dairy, said.Some other retail outlets which are designated to supply to areas such as Raj Nagar Extension and Nandgram, which are among the 13 hot spot areas, said shortage of delivery persons is a major impediment.“We received no orders from Nandgram and only about five orders from Raj Nagar Extension on Thursday. We just have three delivery persons and none of them was available on Wednesday. Only one arrived on Thursday. So the distribution has been affected,” Krishan Kumar, an employee of a retail chain deployed for doorstep delivery, said.Residents of high-rises such as Savior Park said their deliveries regularised on Thursday, unlike the previous day. “The deliveries on Thursday were streamlined and even milk vans and garbage vans were allowed in. Authorised vegetable vendors were made deliveries by Thursday afternoon,” Sandeep Sharma, a resident of Savior Park in Mohan Nagar, said.The high-rise has about 800 flats, occupied by about 2,500 people. It was sealed on March 28 after a couple tested positive for Covid-19 and again, after the intensive lockdown was announced.“To ensure proper supply, we have roped in magistrates and also informed the local councillors and RWAs. Milk freezers have been installed at KDP High-rise in Raj Nagar Extension and Savior Park. Places facing water issues have also been provided with packaged water. About 3,400 litres of milk, 10 quintals of fruits, 21 quintals of vegetables and seven quintals of ration were supplied till date. About 128 calls were received by us requesting medicines and these were catered to,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said.Superintendent of police Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said he will look into complaints of police harassing delivery staff.“We will speak to the vendor and get all issues rectified. It has already been communicated that no essential supply will be hampered. It has also come to light that delivery persons are fearful of going to hot spot areas due to fear of contracting the virus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-2-of-sealing-deliveries-still-hampered-in-hot-spots-vendors-allege-police-harassment/story-oECi2P6mcncM1P9dpoJVJK.html

10-04-2020||Mumbai||Church distributes 1,000 masks to residents of Aarey village||A church in Aarey Milk Colony has been making masks for the residents of a tribal hamlet amid the Covid-19 lockdown. St Paul’s Methodist Tamil Church began their efforts on Monday with two members stitching masks. Within three days, they distributed 1,025 masks across the hamlet (in unit 7), where the church is located, and at Aarey Chowk as the police were detaining commuters for not wearing masks.After the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday made wearing mask mandatory while stepping out, they intensified their efforts and started making another 2,000 masks in a bid to cover 3,000 residents across the 1,000 hutments in the dairy unit.“We must realise that prayer has to come with action,” said priest in-charge reverend Godson Samuel. “During this difficult time, residents of this hamlet were finding it hard to procure masks which are being sold at ₹200 per piece. As we did not have funds, I asked two of our church members, who are excellent tailors, to help. With the cloth available with us, we managed to stitch 1,000 masks within three days.” Megalingam Meyyan and Samlet Yesumani have been stitching black and white masks at home since then. However, they have exhausted their resources. “We have run out of elastic strings that we attach to the ears and we have also used most of the cloth available with us. We are currently making arrangements to procure more resources,” said Meyyan. Reverend Samuel said church members and locals struggled during the first week of the lockdown. “Our members were not getting the basic essentials. However, with the help of friends across the city, 55 members and local residents were provided with 4kg rice, 2.5kg daal, and one-litre oil each. Then we realised that the next most important thing is to provide personal protective equipment,” he said.Samuel, who stepped out on Thursday to distribute masks, said, “As priests, we too are public servants like doctors and police personnel. It is time for us to take up such efforts on war footing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/church-distributes-1-000-masks-to-residents-of-aarey-village/story-APCW4rxG5TFjQsQb53mxXL.html

We also pray that all this gets over paving way for lifting of the lockdown,” said one Mohd Mukarram, who was among those who had their heads shaved in Mohalla Nala under Dakshin police station where they gathered and shaved one another’s heads while shouting ‘go corona go’ slogan.“We are also offering prayers so that our country gets free of the deadly virus. The lockdown has hit the source of living of many people.

10-04-2020||Mumbai||Care as per need: Hosps divided into 3 types||Just like the patients, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has split the healthcare facilities for Covid-19 positive persons into three categories – Covid Care Centres (CCC), Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC), and Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) – depending on the severity of the infection, in accordance with the directives and standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, director general of health services, on Thursday.CCCs are institutional quarantine facilities set up in hostels, hotels, guesthouses, lodges, stadiums, banquet halls and schools for high- and low-risk contacts, who are not identified as Covid-19 positive, but need to be kept under observation. Cases of contact with Covid-19 positive persons, who are to be quarantined for observation, will be admitted to CCCs.The three categories of patients are mild (fever, cold, slight weakness, feverish), moderate (pneumonia with no sign of severe diseases, weakness, shortness of breath) and severe (pneumonia patients with low respiratory rate and co-morbidities or other existing conditions). Mild and moderate cases will be sent to the Dedicated Covid Health Centres. DCHCs are peripheral hospitals namely Masina Hospital, BPT Hospital, Sewri, Sai Hospital, VN Desai Hospital, Bandra’s Bhabha Hospital, Hindu Hridaysamrat Balasahab Thackeray Trauma Care, Bhabha Hospital, Rajawadi, Bhagwati, ESIC Hospital, MT Agarwal Hospital. The most severe or critical cases will be treated at tertiary care hospitals or Dedicated Covid Hospitals. These include Bombay hospital, St George Hospital, GT Hospital, Saifee Hospital, Jaslok Hospital, HN Reliance, Breach Candy, Wockhardt, Nair, Kasturba, KEM, KJ Somaiya, Global Hospital, SL Raheja, PD Hinduja, Lilavati Hospital, Seven Hills, Kokilaben Hospital, Nanavati Hospital, LH Hiranandani and Fortis Hospital, Mulund.There are 26 DCHs across the city with 1,851 beds and 109 intensive care unit (ICU) beds; 25 DCHCs with 1,130 beds, and 186 number of CCCs with 11,997 beds.The BMC’s circular read: “..available data in India suggests that nearly 70% of the cases affected with Covid-19 either exhibit mild symptoms, or very mild symptoms. Such cases may not require admission to Covid-19 blocks/dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. The purpose of this document is to put in place such SOPs to ensure optimal utilization of available resources and thereby providing appropriate care to all Covid-19 patients. This will ensure that available hospital bed capacity is used only for moderate to severe cases of Covid-19.”The SOP mandates that all three facilities will ensure a separate earmarked area for Covid-19 positive persons, and suspected cases, who will not be allowed to mix with each other. It mandates that all Covid-19 suspected cases, irrespective of the severity of the disease, will be tested for Covid-19.Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had first spoken of this plan with Hindustan Times on Tuesday, and said: “Special care is needed for patients who have an additional health condition attached to coronavirus, such as a heart ailment, diabetes, hypertension, leukemia, among others. We need to fight the infection in these patients much in advance and care for them in advanced hospitals. I cannot mix high-risk patients who also have co-morbidity, with other Covid-19 patients who do not have other health issues. When that is happening I am not able to pay proper attention to these critical patients. So I need to separate them from the other patients and pay better attention to them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/care-as-per-need-hosps-divided-into-3-types/story-KUB13flqOlPcrdKH38qa3H.html

By doing this, they are putting their lives in danger.”Another staffer said, “Many doctors spend most of their time outside the isolation ward. But no one from hospital administration can dare to tell them about their misbehaviour.”“After receiving a complaint, we have deployed security staffers at the floor where these doctors are kept in isolation. In addition, we have also given them strict instructions to follow guidelines issued by the Central government,” said Pradeep Jadhav, medical superintendent of the hospital.Around 40 medical staffers, including 15 doctors, 25 nurses and paramedical staffers of KB Bhabha Hospital, have been quarantined after a woman who died in the hospital tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. Swab samples of all medical staffers have been sent to Kasturba Hospital. The results are yet to come.

10-04-2020||City||Pak asks Afghanistan to hand over Kabul gurdwara attack mastermind||ISLAMABADPakistan on Thursday asked Afghanistan to hand over the chief of the Islamic State’s Khorasan unit, Aslam Farooqi, the mastermind behind a deadly terror attack on a prominent gurdwara in Kabul last month.The foreign office said that the demand was conveyed to the Afghan ambassador in Islamabad who was called at the foreign ministry.A heavily armed Islamic State-Khorasan suicide bomber stormed the gurdwara in the heart of Afghanistan’s capital on March 25, killing 25 Sikhs and injuring eight others.Afghanistan’s national directorate of security earlier this month said Farooqi, also known as Abdullah Orakzai, was arrested along with 19 other commanders in a “complex operation”.“The ambassador of Afghanistan to Pakistan was called to the ministry of foreign affairs and conveyed Pakistan’s views with regard to the arrest of ISIS-K leader, Aslam Farooqi, by the Afghan authorities on April 5, 2020,” a statement issued by the foreign office said here.“It was underscored to the ambassador that since Farooqi was involved in anti-Pakistan activities in Afghanistan, he should be handed over to Pakistan for further investigations,” the statement added.It said that Pakistan had been expressing its concerns over the activities of the group, “which were clearly detrimental to the country”.Pakistan’s position was being regularly shared with the government of Afghanistan and others concerned, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pak-asks-afghanistan-to-hand-over-kabul-gurdwara-attack-mastermind/story-klfdsV9InDABVuhHlHe4NL.html
10-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab police slap sedition cases against ‘Sikhs for Justice’, its chief||The Punjab Police on Friday booked Gurpatwant Singh Pannun and his banned ‘Sikhs for Justice’ (SFJ) for “seditious automated calls aimed at instigating the people, particularly youth, against the state government” during the lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak.Cases have been registered against Pannun and US-based SFJ under Section 124A of IPC, and Sections 10 (a) and 13 (1) of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, at the State Special Operations Cell (SSOC), Mohali, said director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta.According to Varinder Pal Singh, AIG, SSOC, preliminary enquiries have revealed that Pannun was involved in the commission of seditious acts of advocating secession of Punjab through automated calls as well as pre-recorded audio messages to various residents of Punjab and nearby areas in March and April, with the intention to foment trouble in Punjab.He said that since the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, Pannun, his associates and organisation were found “incessantly disseminating seditious contents on social media to further frustrate and instigate the already anguished and distressed masses of Punjab”.Disclosing the SFJ modus operandi, the AIG said that in one such recorded audio message, sent from an international number (+1-8336101020) of North America region, Pannun instigated the listeners by alleging that the central government and the Punjab government were torturing the youth in the name of enforcing the ongoing curfew in the state due to Covid-19 pandemic. The pre-recorded interactive voice response messages through telephone calls as well as audio messages to the people of Punjab belonging to various walks of life from New York (US) are being made for pushing the secessionist agenda of SFJ, said the AIG.In one audio call, recorded by an informer, Pannu is heard asking the receivers of the voice calls to vote for SFJ if they are in agreement with the policies of the organisation by pressing ‘1’, or press ‘2’ if they are in agreement with the policies of the Prime Minister of India and the chief minister of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-police-slap-sedition-cases-against-sikhs-for-justice-its-chief/story-2QGYSCn8XuZOD9MeqNQj4K.html
10-04-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown: Children suffering due to lack of stationery items at home||A majority of private schools have switched over to online classes due to lockdown in the state, but parents are finding it difficult to make children complete the daily assignments because of lack of stationery items such as notebooks, pencils, erasers, scrapbooks, sharpeners, drawing books, crayons and tools of geometry.Parents rued that children have used all old notebooks to revise lessons for the final exams held last month and now, with all stationery shops closed, they have no notebooks. Scores of parents have stated that online classes are keeping children engaged for four to five hours but, with no textbooks, notebooks and other stationery material, it is becoming difficult to cope with the syllabus covered by teachers. Several parents have also stated that they did not have laptops, tablets, iPad and WiFi facilities and are facing problems to get their children attend the online classes. Garima Khosla, a resident of Dugri, said, “My kids are studying in a private school and, on March 19, the school authorities declared the result and asked parents to purchase books as per the list available online on the school website. I decided to purchase the books on March 22 but, due to Janata curfew, all the shops remain closed and then lockdown was imposed the next day in the state.”She added, “On April 2, the school sent a message that classes will be conducted online but, in the absence of books and notebooks, children are not able to complete the assigned work. School authorities have been sending many assignments in bulk due to which children are stressed.”Another parent, Arvinder Kaur, a resident of Model Town, said, “Videos and textbook images, sent by teachers, are very helpful. My six-year-old son enjoys online classes, but is not ready to note down the lessons in the rough notebook. He demands new books but I am unable to buy new books and stationery.”She said school authorities must give assignment of one subject daily as, in the absence of notebooks, it will be tough for the children to complete the work once they get notebooks.”Ravi Rajput, a parent, said, “My eight-year-old daughter remains glued to my smartphone daily for two hours to note down the work sent by the school. In the absence of a laptop or a desktop at home, she struggles to write down the work and is complaining of irritation in her eyes. I have contacted the school authorities to stop sending online work as children are spending more time by looking at gadgets, which are causing eye discomfort.”However, school principals of private schools say teachers are sending work of two to three subjects daily. The images of pages of the books are sent daily to the students to make them read the lessons online and then videos are sent to explain the concepts. The idea is to make the students busy for a few hours and videos of teachers giving tips to children to remain healthy (exercises, yoga asanas) are also being shared by a majority of schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-children-suffering-due-to-lack-of-stationery-items-at-home/story-wHPuC0RVOs9Y5e4KNv8vNN.html

The bodies will be cremated in gas chambers and steps have been taken to ensure social distancing of attendants. A recent incident in the city, where a son refused to cremate the body of his mother, who died of coronavirus, had sent shock waves among city residents. Finally, the administration had to step in and perform the last rites of the deceased. MC commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar also visited a few cremation grounds, including those in Model Town Extension and near the Dholewal military complex on Friday. According to the officials, the cremation machinery kept at the Model Town Extension ground was not operational following which a decision was taken to finalise the cremation ground near the Dholewal military complex, where population is also low.Brar said, “So far, we have not received any information regarding any cremation ground management disallowing the cremation of Covid-19 positive victims. But, now we have finalised the Dholewal military complex ground, where bodies will be cremated in the gas chamber. Markings have already been made to ensure social distancing and only a limited number of people will be present during cremation.” President of the Ramgarhia Education Council Ranjodh Singh said he had asked the MC to sanitise the ground after and before cremations.He added personal protection equipment (PPE) kits should also be provided to the three staff members of the cremation ground, who would be present during cremation.He said only five persons would be allowed to be present during cremation.BOXVOLUNTEERS STEP IN TO CREMATE UNCLAIMED BODIESAfter the son of a woman refused to cremate the body of his Covid-19 positive mother, two groups, led by IAS officer Manpreet Singh Chhatwal and in-charge of traffic marshals in Ludhiana, have voluntarily come forward for cremating unclaimed bodies in the city. Special secretary, animal husbandry and higher education, Chhatwal said he, with other volunteers from the Maa Baglamukhi Dham, Pakhowla Road, have sought permission from the state government for this purpose and, if allowed, they would perform last rites of unclaimed bodies with full precautions. Four traffic marshals, Mandeep Keshav Guddu, Charanjit Singh Fateh, Prince Kapoor and Sanjeev Kumar Tinku, have also offered to cremate unclaimed bodies across the state.They said, “There have been reports that people are refusing to cremate bodies of their relatives. They want that no family should suffer at this time of crisis and every person, who dies due to this disease, should be properly cremated.”They would work on the directions of the administration and take all precautions while cremating the bodies, the marshals said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unclaimed-bodies-to-be-cremated-in-gas-chamber-at-cremation-ground-in-ludhiana/story-iygEFjATGEh1tbF9mI1qjJ.html
10-04-2020||Jaipur||When Rajasthan’s Pali made reusable PPE kits from umbrella fabric||When Pali, a textile town in western Rajasthan, had its first coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patient on March 19, Rohitashva Singh Tomar, a 2016-batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer posted as sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), understood that in days to come the district would require many personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and the government supply may not be sufficient.According to a health ministry official, Rajasthan has been allocated 16,500 PPEs. Although health minister Raghu Sharma has repeatedly said there was no shortage, but supply to the districts wasn’t enough.Until April 10, when Pali had two Covid-19 patients, the district had locally produced 2,500 PPE kits and supplied many to neighbouring districts, too. And guess what came handy for this – the fabric used to make umbrellas in Falna, a small railway station on the Ahmedabad-Jaipur rail route.After approval of district collector Dinesh Chand Jain, Tomar called a meeting of local textile units and officials of the industries department to discuss if they could locally produce the PPEs. Syed Rajjak Ali Khan, general manager of District Industries Centre, suggested using fabric from Falna to make PPEs.“Falna is famous for production of umbrellas and its parts. There are about 80 units. After the lockdown, the factories were shut and had about 20,000 metres of the fabric in their inventory. We got 10 metres from there and gave it to local tailors to stitch,” said Tomar.He said a sample was made and given to Pali Medical College for testing. According to Dr Harish Kumar Acharya, professor and head of forensic medicine department, the kit passed the test. “It was fit to be autoclaved, and given a green signal by the colleagues from the microbiology department for infection control,” said Acharya.After the go-ahead from the experts, Anil Gulechha, chairman of Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CEPT) Foundation, an association of textile unit owners, procured the fabric from Falna. “Local tailors stitched the kit in my factory. We began supplying the kits to the district administration by March 25,” said 48-year-old Gulechha of Bherawa Textile Industries.The USP of the local PPE kits is its reusability, says the collector. “The PPEs given by the government are use-and-throw kits. For one patient, from collecting samples to get him to hospital, around 10 PPEs are used. That drains the small government supply. The kits produced in Pali can be disinfected and reused,” he said.According to Tomar, the CEPT Foundation has supplied 1,000 kits to district administration free of cost. “We have also given 400 kits each to Jalore and Jaisalmer districts, 200 to Kota and 100 to Beawar. The wildlife department of the district has also taken PPEs from us. For us, the kits are free, for the other users, they are priced Rs 485 each,” said the SDM.Acharya, who is involved in design and development, said the kit has undergone several modifications and is now being made at three levels – level 1 for use by field staff, level 2 for use by use health care workers involved in care of suspected and positive cases, and level 3 for use by people in ICU where surgical interventions are needed.Gulechha said the kit comprises a face shield, an overall, an apron and a pair of shoe covers, and taken around 4.15 mts of the fabric. Pali has around 800 textile units and the annual turnover is about Rs 8, 000 crore. Like Bhilwara textile industry is known for suiting and shirting, those in Pali are known for printing and processing of ladies wear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/when-rajasthan-s-pali-made-reusable-ppe-kits-from-umbrella-fabric/story-Gjyigfdd8OVzD6hQ5HlEdN.html

Initially, 40 beds on the third floor will be used and more space will be taken up, if needed. The decision was taken at meeting of the health department, the district administration and the vice-chancellor of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, the parent institute of ACI, on Friday. On Thursday, hospital staff, including doctors and attendants of cancer patients had protested against moving covid-19 patients to the institute.Bathinda civil surgeon Dr Amrik Singh told HT on Friday that now all suspected or positive coronavirus cases will be taken directly to the ACI for treatment at the isolation facility. “The institute will ensure separate passage for covid patients and their movement near the cancer wards will be strictly restricted,” he said, while admitting that cancer patients had low immunity and should not be exposed to the virus.“Cancer patients will have to be extra cautious at the ACI due to their compromised immunity level. BFUHS has decided to provide the X-ray test station to the covid facility. Separate lab facilities may also be started,” the civil surgeon added. He said AIIMS Bathinda cannot be used as the inpatient department (IPD) was not complete yet. The decision to rope in private institutes, including a private medical university in Bathinda may be taken, in case of emergency. Parvinder Sandhu, an oncological surgeon at ACI, said, “I put-off scheduled surgeries since Wednesday. Due to the lockdown, patients from nearby towns who used to visit Chandigarh, Ludhiana or Rajasthan for chemotherapy and radiation therapy are also coming to us, leading to 20% more load. Due to the covid facility, we have to shift ICU-ward patients to other rooms. For chemotherapy patients, we will have to use the dharamshala on campus.”ACI medical superintendent Dr Deepak Arora said the institute will need to issue advisory to its patients and attendants due to the threat of the virus infection at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bathinda-cancer-hospital-to-be-used-as-covid-isolation-facility/story-Y3sAmfJpzkKtJOwNmhK5EI.html
10-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab brings private hospitals under ambit for corona battle||The Punjab cabinet on Friday approved the Punjab Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Ordinance 2020, to regulate the functioning of the private hospitals with a capacity of over 50 beds. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had chaired the meeting held through videoconferencing. “It is necessary for private hospitals to join the battle against covid 19,” the CM said in a statement. He added it was important to activate all resources, in the larger interest of the state, in the light of the current battle that threatened to be a long-drawn one. The council of ministers has authorised the CM to approval the final draft of the bill after legal vetting. The ordinance provides for registration and regulation of clinical establishments in a professional manner to ensure compliance of clinical standards and protocols and transparency in the functioning of these establishments for fair and proper delivery of health services to the common man.IMA fumes over timingThe Punjab chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has condemned the move, saying the state government was demoralising medical practitioners by such unwarranted and ill-timed decisions. It also held an emergency meeting on Friday. “When we are fighting Covid19, our energies should be focused towards tiding over this crisis. This is a double whammy for the private health sector. After unjustly labelling doctors in private practice as ‘bhagodas’, the state government has delivered another blow, demoralising private practitioners,” said Dr Rajinder Sharma, former Punjab IMA chief and central working committee member of the national unit of IMA.He added, “The bureaucrats seem to have misguided the government. When the Disaster Management Act is already in force, functioning of all private hospitals automatically comes under the government. What is the agenda behind bringing this cowardly act, nobody knows?,” Dr Sharma added. DCs to declare new mandis as per need The cabinet has also authorised deputy commissioners to declare new mandis in their respective districts, as per local needs to meet demands of social distancing, while ensuring smooth procurement of the grain. These mandis would be in addition to 3,800 already notified.  It was also decided that procurement arrangements should be finalised and notified by April 11 so that each grain is procured, though in a staggered manner. The state has already decided to extend procurement till June 15 and has sought incentives from the Centre for delayed transportation to the mandis by the farmers due to the covid-19 criris. The Centre is yet to respond.Depts to send expenditure cut proposals by Monday The cabinet also authorised the CM to nominate four additional members on the Cabinet Sub-committee on Fiscal Management for broad-based discussion and decision on expenditure cuts needed to get over the crisis. Departments have been asked to send their proposals for expenditure cuts by Monday. Finance minister Manpreet Badal informed the meeting that Rs 30,000 crore of revenue earned through procurement operations would be infused into the state’s economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-brings-private-hospitals-under-ambit-for-corona-battle/story-4Tu60hOOgXwU6mF2fioS5N.html

At present, the National Institute of Virology in Pune is the only institution in the country capable of providing a well-coordinated medical and public health response to such an emergency, he added.In the present scenario, wherein the world is in the grip of the highly infectious novel coronavirus, an advanced virology centre as a regional reference laboratory for virus diagnosis and research is much required, the CM stressed.The state government has thus proposed a specialised centre in Medicity, New Chandigarh, which would be well-placed to serve the interests of the northwestern region given Chandigarh’s international air connectivity, the Capt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capt-asks-centre-to-set-up-virology-hub-in-punjab-offers-land/story-UxpnRF9CZNiwxBQd3wAW9I.html

Sran, a tehsilder-cum-sub-registrar (Ludhiana east division) had received the body from a private hospital and when the fear-struck family refused to cremate it, he acted sagely, and thinking on his feet, ensured that the last rites were performed. He was among the few district administration officials present at the cremation. Sran, who had joined the Punjab government in 1991, admitted that he felt surreal and strange, while claiming the body of someone who he had never seen or known. “I am a pure Punjabi by heart with a daredevil attitude. When I saw the family was not cremating the woman, my first reaction was to execute the task assigned to me,” adds Jagsir, adding his own family of wife and sons were and have been very supportive. “Most of my family is abroad. My wife knew about my going to cremation ground and was initially worried. I assured her I am taking all precautions. Now, my family is proud of my work,” he adds. Jagsir said he, and other officials present, managed to get the sewadar at the cremation ground to light the pyre after Kaur’s family members, including her daughter and son-in-law, refused to step out of the car. “I stayed on to ensure that she was cremated. I kept praying, with a sad heart. I kept thinking no one should ever meet such an end, where one is disowned by his own family members. It was tragic,” he added, in a choked voice. Additional SHO of Shimlapuri police station, sub-inspector Simranjeet Kaur was tasked with ensuring that no overcrowding took place during the cremation. What actually transpired surprised her. “My duty was to cordon off the area leading to the cremation ground and ensure that no overcrowding took place and social distancing norms were followed,” she said, adding, “I was also called to oversee the cremation. Emotions run high at the cremation ground, and people hug each other. However, at this cremation, not a single family member was present.” She added that duty came before everything else for her. “My father takes pride in my work. He sanitised my vehicle, when I reached home after duty. I also wash my uniform daily and ensure that belt, badges and even shoes are sanitised,” she adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-officials-recall-trauma-of-cremating-woman-after-family-shunned-responsibility/story-AD4KThGJo63lxve7suNskN.html

Now, each beneficiary will get 30kg highly subsidised ration.Till April 1, the authorities in Punjab were worried as the state’s godowns with a total storage capacity of 240 lakh tonne were to receive 135 lakh tonne more wheat in the rabi season. The warehouses are nearly full to the brim with 190 lakh tonnes stored. “We still have large stocks with us.

10-04-2020||Delhi||Community spread on in Punjab, claims CM; Union ministry differs||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday said community transmission has started in the state with 27 positive cases coming from secondary sources, the claim that has been contested by the Union health ministry. Addressing a news conference through video-conferencing, Amarinder said: “The number of positive Covid-19 cases will increase as is happening across the world and even in India. How can Punjab be isolated from it? We have contained the pandemic to some level as compared to other states. But this will spread. We have kept our contingency plan ready and lockdown is one of the methods to cut social contacts,” he said.Punjab, which was one of the first states to impose a statewide lockdown and stop public transport, has reported 132 Covid-19 patients till Friday.The chief minister admitted that the community transmission has started in Punjab following 27 fresh positive cases with no travel history and most of them are due to secondary infection.Responding to a question during the daily Covid-19 press conference in New Delhi, Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Aggarwal said there is no community transmission in the country yet and there is no need to panic.“Today, the challenge is not local or community transmission. Whenever the community transmission stage comes, we will inform you. There is no community transmission in the country yet. There is no need to panic,” Aggarwal said.According to the World Health Organisation, community transmission is “evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases”The WHO in the latest Covid-19 situation report number 80 has termed India’s virus transmission classification as “cluster of cases” and not “community transmission” as of now.Expressing concern over the prevailing situation, Amarinder said: “We had around 1,40,000 NRIs and foreign returnees, including from those countries where the virus had spread. They were the primary ones. Now, with 27 positive cases of secondary transmission we have entered the stage of community transmission. That is a serious cause of worry,” added Amarinder.The CM said 651 people have come to the state from the Tablighi Jamaat’s congregations in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area, which emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hotspots in the country. Of them, 636 have been traced and 15 remain untraced.Community transmission is the third of the four stages of the spread of an infectious disease. The first is travel history, the second is local transmission, the third is community transmission, and the fourth is epidemic. He admitted that there has been slow testing in Punjab due to lack of such facilities. “Out of the 28 million-population in Punjab, only 2,877 have been tested. It is nothing. That is because the Centre had initially approved only three centres and later added one more. Now, we have sought permission for more such facilities.”Quoting experts and reports by some national and international institutions, including Chandigarh-based PGIMER and John Hopkins University, the chief minister said the Covid-19 situation will peak in India in mid-September at a point when 58% of its population will be infected, with 87% of people likely to get affected in Punjab.“These figures are frightening. Predictions by health experts about the spread of the pandemic are horrendous. So, we have to do what we can and lockdown is one of such measures,” he added.The chief minister also rejected as “absolutely insufficient” the ₹15,000 crore announced by the Centre on Thursday for the health infrastructure in the country.“How can this be enough for the nearly 1.4 billion people of India? No state has the resources needed to fight the battle without the help of the central government and they have to come forward to help the states,” Singh said.PGIMER REFUTES CAPT’S CLAIMCHANDIGARH: Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, has clarified that the institute has not undertaken any study which predicts that number of Covid-19 cases may peak by mid-September.“Assistance provided at the personal level by some faculty member should not be projected as the viewpoint of the institute. Head, department of community medicine and School of Public Health of the Institute has confirmed that the no such study was conducted and thus there is no proof regarding the numbers being projected,” PGIMER spokesperson, Dr Ashok Kumar said. PGIMER in a statement said that institute is not aware that any expert or faculty member from the department of community medicine and School of Public Health of the Institute has carried out any study or estimate that the Covid-19 may peak by mid-September and can infect 58% of country’s population. Amarinder’s media adviser Raveen Thukral, however, said the report cited by the CM is assessment of Dr Shankar Prinja, additional professor of health economics, department of community medicine and School of Public Health, PGIMER, and his team, using mathematical models on the basis of Punjab data provided to him. “State Committee on Health Sector Response and Procurement headed by Vini Mahajan (a senior IAS officer) with ex-PGI director Dr KK Talwar as professional advisor had sought an urgent assessment of Punjab’s Covid-19 scenario from Dr Prinja to plan its preparedness,” he tweeted. Dr Prinja did not respond to calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/community-spread-on-in-punjab-claims-cm-union-ministry-differs/story-Anh9ilyOelk4XpnJSsml6M.html

Delivery workers will wear gloves and use safety equipment. Uninterrupted supply of electricity and water will be ensured in these zones. The buses of the state transport department have been deployed for the movement of employees involved in this process.Meanwhile, the district authorities have also pressed in teams of Asha workers and ANMs to do a door-to-door screening in these areas that will also be sanitised. Masks, gloves, caps, sanitisers and shoes have been provided to the staff deployed for the task, the official said.In Kaithal, ward number 2 of Mahadev Colony has been declared as containment zone, while 13 areas in Faridabad have also been declared as containment zones.Similarly in Panchkula, Nada Sahib, civil hospital in Sector 6, Command Hospital and bus stand have been declared as containment zones.

We want the government to ensure that the permission can be availed from local offices as well,” said Sumit Kumar, a farmer from Jamba village.Another farmer Mohit Kumar, of Bijana village, said, “As per the government norms, we have to take all our workers for medical examination, and later we need to apply for the movement pass at the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) office, but there is huge rush at the government offices for the permission.”The farmers demand that the government should ensure that they get the permission in their local tehsils without any delay, so that they can start the harvesting soon.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav, while talking to Hindustan Times, said, “We have directed the SDMs to get the medical checkup of all the people associated with combine harvesters and other harvesting machinery done soon and issue certificates immediately after it.”As per the information, 1,100 combine harvesters are registered in Karnal and among them, 700 have got the permission for the movement pass, while the applications of remaining 400 are still pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-lockdown-getting-movement-pass-for-harvesting-machines-a-tough-task-karnal-farmers/story-eRtdJyviKFs5yEFf0TkgsO.html
10-04-2020||Chandigarh||Allow farmers to store crops in govt schools: Hooda||Leader of opposition in Haryana assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Friday asked the state government to allow farmers to store wheat and mustard crops in the government schools across the state.The former Haryana chief minister, while talking to Hindustan Times on phone, said that the state government should allow farmers to store crops in the government schools in their respective villages and purchase it from there only. “Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the schools will remain shut for the next two months. The best way to initiate crop procurement is to utilise government school buildings for storing the grains after purchasing it from the farmers. Most of the farmers in Haryana do not have storage facility and if they leave grains in open, it can be spoiled due to untimely rain. The state government should soon take a decision on it. The decision will also help in avoiding mass gathering at mandis and procurement centres,” Hooda said.As per the state agriculture department, during this Rabi season, Haryana is expecting 135 lakh tonnes of wheat and 125 lakh tonnes of mustard crop.Welcoming the state government’s decision to increase the number of wheat procurement centres and mandis for mustard procurement, the former CM said that the government should purchase each and every grain of the farmers at the Minimum Support Price (MSP).“In the recently held all-party meeting, I had suggested CM Manohar Lal Khattar to provide gunny bags to farmers and arhtiyas so that they can start storing grains,” he added.On being asked about government’s decision to procure mustard in just five days, Hooda said that it depends on the government, how they will purchase the entire crop in such a short time span. “The government had assured us that there would be no limit on the procurement of mustard crop in mandis,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/allow-farmers-to-store-crops-in-govt-schools-hooda/story-6TNG0coD1iK4NHm1wUpFAJ.html

10-04-2020||City||Community transmission has begun in Punjab: Capt||New Delhi: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday claimed that community transmission has started in his state with 27 positive cases coming from secondary sources and insisted that the lockdown is the only way out to fight the deadly coronavirus.Addressing a news conference through video-conferencing, Singh said, “The number of positive Covid-19 cases will increase as is happening across the world and even in India. How can Punjab be isolated from it? We have contained the pandemic to some level as compared to other states. But this will spread. We have kept our contingency plan ready and lockdown is one of the methods to cut social contacts,” he said.Punjab, which was one of the first states to impose a statewide lockdown and stop public transport, has reported 132 Covid-19 patients.The chief minister admitted that the community transmission has started in Punjab following 27 fresh positive cases with no travel history and most of them are due to secondary infection.“We had around 140,000 NRIs and foreign returnees, including from those countries where the virus had spread. They were the primary ones. Now, with 27 positive cases of secondary transmission we have entered the stage of community transmission. That is a serious cause of worry,” added Singh.The chief minister said 651 people have come to the state from the Tablighi Jamaat’s congregations in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area, which emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hotspots in the country. Of them, 636 have been traced and 15 remain untraced.Community transmission is the third of the four stages of the spread of an infectious disease. The first is travel history, the second is local transmission, the third is community transmission, and the fourth is epidemic. The Union health ministry has been consistently denying that India had reached the community transmission stage, insisting that it was still at the local transmission stage.He admitted that there has been slow testing in Punjab due to lack of such facilities. “Out of the 28 million-population in Punjab, only 2,877 have been tested. It is nothing. That is because the Centre had initially approved only three centres and later added one more. Now, we have sought permission for more such facilities.”Quoting experts and reports by some national and international institutions, including Chandigarh-based PGIMER and John Hopkins University, the chief minister said the Covid-19 situation will peak in India in mid-September at a point when 58% of its population will be infected, with 87% of people likely to get affected in Punjab.“These figures are frightening. Predictions by health experts about the spread of the pandemic are horrendous. So, we have to do what we can and lockdown is one of such measures,” he added.The chief minister also rejected as “absolutely insufficient” the ₹15,000 crore announced by the Centre on Thursday for the health infrastructure in the country.“How can this be enough for the nearly 1.4 billion people of India? No state has the resources needed to fight the battle without the help of the central government and they have to come forward to help the states,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/community-transmission-has-begun-in-punjab-capt/story-8Q9HgETWnacKrzS0CFMjfM.html
10-04-2020||City||Punjab extends curfew till May 1||Chandigarh: The Punjab government on Friday extended the ongoing curfew in the state till May 1, 2020.The decision in this regard was taken at the state cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh through videoconferencing. Notably, Punjab was the first state in the country to enforce curfew on March 23 as a precautionary measure to check Covid-19 pandemic.According to an official spokesperson, the decision to extend the curfew was taken to check the community spread of the virus. The CM cited the grim projections about the spread of the pandemic in the coming weeks and said the curfew restrictions were essential so that the medical infrastructure is not burdened beyond its capabilities. “There was general consensus in the medical community that the lockdown curbs would only delay the spread of the disease,” he said, hoping that some cure is available soon.The cabinet also decided to set up a multi-disciplinary task force to formulate an exit strategy for gradual relaxation in curfew. The 15-member task force comprising representatives from trade, business, industry, agriculture, civil society and health care will submit its report in 10 days. The CM has been authorised to decide on the composition of the task force.The cabinet also approved setting up a high-powered committee to suggest a road map for state’s economic revival in post-COVID era once the crisis softens and normal working is restored. Amarinder said he will request former Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Ahluwalia to head the committee.The cabinet set up a task force under the principal secretary (PWD) to look into the quick upgrade of the state’s health infrastructure to combat the current crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-extends-curfew-till-may-1/story-MesFIKkgSPrk8ia2QnPPOM.html

The Haryana government released an order to this effect on Friday evening, making masks compulsory for all who are out in public spaces even if they are inside their vehicles.A similar order is in effect in several adjoining areas in the national capital region including Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad.The order released by the district authorities in Gurugram says “all persons in public places like streets, hospitals, markets, offices, etc must be wearing a 3-ply mask or cloth mask compulsorily.”It goes on to specify that any person who is moving around in his personal or official vehicle must be wearing these masks compulsorily.The order also says that any person or officer will attend any meeting or go to the workplace wearing the facemasks. It further states that any violation of this order will be punishable under Section 188 of the indian penal code and will also be penalised.States like UP and Odisha have made the wearing of masks compulsory in the entire state with Odisha even instructing all petrol pumps across major cities to not dispense fuel to anyone who is not found wearing a mask.Several NGOs and other organizations have been roped in for manufacturing masks, which are either being supplied to state administration or distributed among the providers of essential services.The health ministry has also released guidelines on the specifications for homemade masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/wearing-masks-now-compulsory-in-gurugram-violators-will-pay-hefty-fine/story-a5IgdAjLv1RKPhnDdcVRwK.html
10-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police book 137 for not wearing masks||The Delhi Police on Friday said that they had so far booked at least 137 people for violating a government order that made wearing of masks in public places mandatory.The north-west district led in terms of prosecution, with 32 offenders being booked from the area on Thursday. The south and north districts followed with 23 and 20 such cases respectively, said a statement released by the police . All the alleged violators have been booked under Indian Penal Code Section 188 that deals with disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant. If convicted, they can be jailed for up to six months, or be fined Rs 1,000, or both. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday had made it mandatory for people to wear masks while stepping out of their homes. Cloth masks too will be acceptable, he had said, adding that wearing of masks could “reduce the spread of Coronavirus substantially”. District police officers said that they have dealt firmly with people they found on the streets without masks.“The police officers on the ground are able to identify those who are regular and repeat offenders. If someone without a mask had a genuine reason, their response was considered before deciding to book him or her,” said Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police of north-west district that booked the most number of violators. “For example, if someone was just outside their house without a mask, they were warned not to repeat the mistake,” she said. She said that the prosecution would get more strict as people get to know of the criminality of not wearing masks.Meanwhile, the police also acted against people trying to violate the lockdown during the Shab-e-Barat. In south district, an FIR under IPC section 188 was registered at Mehrauli police station after some people came out on the streets. In North district, 240 persons were detained before being let off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-book-137-for-not-wearing-masks/story-4edtj5C4RrJkHFRwyxbxSN.html

10-04-2020||Delhi||Destitute roam the streets in search of food, govt says plenty of room at shelters||The strict imposition of the 21-day nationwide lockdown rules in the national capital has deprived the destitute of their only source of income — seeking alms outside religious places or at traffic signals.While social activists say the government should make efforts to ensure all destitute people are placed in government-run shelter homes and screened for Covid-19, Delhi Police officers said measures have been taken to ensure that they don’t roam the streets in search of food.Delhi Police said as prohibitory and lockdown orders are being strictly enforced in the city, no one, except those who are part of essential services, is being allowed on roads.But social activists say many still seek alms on the road. Indu Prakash, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed a committee on homeless shelters, said, “I have got calls from homeless people in need of help. The police and the Delhi administration should ensure that all destitute people are taken to shelter homes.”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal Friday said his government has taken numerous steps to extend help to the poor. He said the availability of food at their hunger relief centres has exceeded the demand. “We are giving 7.5kg free ration to 71 lakh ration card holders in the city and 60% have already availed of this. Besides, we have been offering free lunch and dinner for all through 1,780 hunger relief centres. More than 12 lakh people are eating at these centres every day,” he said. The chief minister also said the government has set up shelters at 328 locations for migrant workers, destitute and those in need. “These 328 shelters have the capacity to accommodate 57,270 people. But, only 11,443 people are currently using these facilities. So there is no dearth of room at shelters,” Kejriwal said. A senior police officer, who did want to be named, said on the orders of Delhi’s lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, each police station has been given a bus to shift migrants, the destitute and the homeless to shelter homes.The police personnel deployed on street patrolling have been asked to stop such people, and send them to the permanent shelter homes as well as schools that have been converted into temporary homes.“Those having homes are asked to immediately return there, while the homeless are shifted to shelter homes,” a Delhi Police officer said. In government-run shelter homes, the number of destitute has increased since the lockdown. Nishu, caretaker of a shelter home in Yamuna Pushta, said there are a lot of people at the shelter who used to beg on the streets.Ashok Pandey, convener of Shehri Adhikar Manch, said, “The main problem is that not all homeless people have got space in shelter homes. You can still find people sitting on the pavement outside shelter homes. During this time, social distancing is essential. The government should ensure that all those who live on the streets are taken to shelter homes. They should also start mobile health vans to screen these people for Covid-19 symptoms.”Apart from destitute people, a senior police officer said there are many living in poor neighbourhoods who also come out on roads and ask for money from motorists stopping at traffic signals. “We constantly warn them and send them back whenever we see them at it,” the officer, requesting anonymity, said.“We arrange food packets from various volunteers and distribute them among the destitute and all those who are not able to arrange food for themselves and their families due to a lack of daily income. The food is distributed twice a day,” deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said.According to the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), all of its 238 night shelters are seeing an average occupancy of 9,000 per night, which before the coronavirus outbreak used to be around 7,000. “Usually, we keep our night shelters closed during the day since the purpose is to provide a comfortable roof for the homeless and daily wage earners to sleep. But, now we keep our shelters open 24x7. Sanitisation is also being done at least twice a day,” Bipin Rai, member, DUSIB, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/destitute-roam-the-streets-in-search-of-food-govt-says-plenty-of-room-at-shelters/story-GWCjHpIK2hIUomQe8bscgO.html
10-04-2020||Mumbai||BMC risking lives by continuing Coastal Road work: Citizens’ group||A citizens’ group has issued a legal notice against the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), alleging that they are risking the lives of Mumbaiites by continuing the Coastal Road construction work, despite the Covid-19 lockdown in place.The notice was issued on Wednesday and circulated on Friday by Save Our Coast, Mumbai, a group of citizens from Nepean Sea Road, Bhulabhai Desai Road, Haji Ali, Worli and other areas of Mumbai. HT has a copy of the notice.The 9.9-km current phase of the Coastal Road project, proposed at Rs 12,969 crore, is to be an eight-lane highway which will connect Marine Drive to the southern end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. The BMC said it was carrying out pre-monsoon work including sea wall construction and completing reclamation and bringing activities to a ‘safe stage’ to ensure there was no flooding during monsoon. “We aim to complete all work by last week of May. We already lost precious time in February and March due to the coronavirus outbreak as we failed to procure crucial equipment from China. Now, massive armour rocks and boulders are being brought from quarries for remaining reclamation work,” said Jayashree Bhoj, additional municipal commissioner.Attaching pictures, the notice claimed that the work was in violation of several sections of the Indian Penal Code, Disaster Management Act (DMA), 2005, and orders passed by the Centre and state. The notice, filed through lawyer Karma Vivan, called for immediate termination of construction activity, failing which both civil and criminal proceedings would be initiated against the civic body. “In the context of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the DMA, the word ‘essential’ can only be understood to mean something that is required to be done for the safety of the citizens. The ongoing work is not of the nature that will protect the area from flooding. Therefore, the argument that this work is essential is a fallacious one,” stated the notice, adding that bus-loads of labourers were being brought to the site posed a high risk. “Moreover, requiring labourers to work even during the lockdown, endangers their safety and of millions in the city.”Bhoj countered the allegations. “The health checkup for all workers has been done. They have been provided personal protective equipment (PPE), are following social distancing norms and using sanitisers regularly. Even though we want more labourers, they are not available. We are making do with the numbers we have,” said Bhoj.The work not only includes completing reclamation but also conducting testing work for the bridge which will connect to the Bandra Worli Sea Link road. “This cannot be classified as essential pre-monsoon construction work. Also, we need to be careful about several contaiment zones in Worli, especially the Koliwada area. Partially completed reclamation work poses losses to the contractors. It is not a risk to the safety of residents,” said Shweta Wagh, petitioner before the Supreme Court who is challenging the Coastal Road project construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-risking-lives-by-continuing-coastal-road-work-citizens-group/story-At4t1p0VPSUxZLK1cX9JwN.html
10-04-2020||Mumbai||Zoos in Maharashtra have to submit details of suspected Covid-19 cases in animals by Sunday||The Maharashtra zoo authority (MZA) has issued directions to all zoos and rescue centres towards the containment of suspected coronavirus cases in captive animals.Zoos have been asked to send reports on animals displaying medical issues such as coughing, nasal discharge, respiratory distress, diarrhoea, anorexia, nervous symptoms and fever, as well as on the overall sanitation, regular health check-up of zoo workers, bio-containment and safety measures taken and the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) while feeding the animals.The 13 zoos, rescue centres and national parks (having captive animals for safaris) across the state, including Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and the Byculla Zoo, have to submit the report to the authority by Sunday.“Until now, we have no report of any animal showing unusual symptoms or poor health across any captive animal centre in Maharashtra,” said Ravikiran Govekar, member secretary, MZA.“However, considering the seriousness of the issue, this checklist has been prepared to understand the current status of all centres. If any suspected case is found, the sample needs to be collected immediately and remedial measures need to be provided according to the central government guidelines,” Govekar added.Zoological parks and animal safaris across the country have been asked to be on high alert and inspect if animals show any symptoms of the Covid-19 virus after a tiger in a New York zoo developed the infection last Sunday, in the first such case in the world. On Monday, the Centre appointed three animal health institutes to initiate Covid-19 testing for animals.“The testing method for animal samples was developed at our Hisar facility almost a month ago. Captive or wild animals need to be tranquilised first, following which their throat swab must be collected and transported to Bhopal [National Institute of High Security Animal Sciences] or to Hisar under cold chain. Results will be declared within a day,” said Dr BN Tripathi, director, National Research Centre on Equines at Hisar, Haryana.MZA has further directed every zoo to demarcate its premises with different colour codes (using coloured ribbons), indicating restricted entry even among staff (in some areas only certified veterinarians would be permitted). “Zoos have been asked to keep a record of staff exiting and entering the premises, restrict entry for any unauthorised person, keeping records of treatment to animals discreet and documentation of bio-safety measures taken,” said Govekar.Meanwhile, the Byculla Zoo said it had consulted the Maharashtra government for PPE acquisition. “Since the outbreak, our staff who are in direct contact with animals have maintained appropriate social distancing and have not stepped out of the zoo premises. Also, they are maintaining physical distancing guidelines while feeding or taking care of animals,” said Sanjay Tripathi, director of the zoo.Currently, the number of captive cats across zoos and rescue centres in Maharashtra include 36 tigers, five lions and 88 leopards. “There is no reason for panic. All animals in SGNP are healthy and eating well (buffalo beef and chicken). We haven’t noticed any specific symptoms such as nasal discharge, coughing or respiratory distress. Maximum care for personal hygiene, sanitation and bio-security measures are being taken,” said Shailesh Pethe, veterinarian, SGNP. US authorities on New York caseThe United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories issued a statement confirming SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19 in humans) virus in the New York zoo tiger. “This is the first instance of a tiger being infected with Covid-19. Samples from this tiger were taken and tested after several lions and tigers at the zoo showed symptoms of respiratory illness. Public health officials believe these large cats became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was actively shedding the virus. All of these large cats are expected to recover. There is no evidence of this virus affecting animals at any other facility in the United States,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-asks-zoos-to-submit-details-of-suspected-covid-19-cases-in-animals-by-sunday/story-6C6kPVfJd20Dz3acr9hr7K.html

10-04-2020||Lucknow||How Yogi’s Team-11 is tackling Covid-19 challenges||Uttar Pradesh had no laboratory to test the Sars-Cov-2 pathogen when the first coronavirus positive case was reported in the state on March 3. The state now has 10 such laboratories.“When UP reported its first coronavirus positive case, we had no testing laboratory. We now have 10 laboratories. We are setting up a lab at each of the 18 divisional headquarters,” chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, while recently speaking about capacity building for laboratories, setting up of new hospitals, quarantine and isolation wards and ensuring the supply of medicines.The challenges are, however, manifold for the most populous state. Besides threatening human lives, the lockdown is adversely affecting the economy. In order to meet these challenges, chief minister Yogi Adityanath constituted 11 committees, called Team-11, for expeditious action.Yogi’s Team-11 is now coming in handy as the state begins acting tough to fight the coronavirus. It was after a review with officers of Team-11 that Yogi Adityanath decided to intensify the lockdown in nearly 105 hot spots of 15 districts that have reported six or more coronavirus positive cases. “Yes, the chief minister decided to intensify the lockdown and seal the hotspots after a review meeting on Wednesday,” said additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi, who is part of Team-11 and has been monitoring enforcement of the lockdown. “The chief minister decided to set up 11 committees soon after the lockdown. We have regular meetings and the progress made by the 11 committees is reviewed at the chief minister’s level every day. Although the agenda for the committees is already set, the points for action are worked out for any new issues and the action taken is reported,” said chief secretary RK Tiwari, who heads the committee set up for coordination with the union government and other states, and oversees the functioning of 11 committees.Adityanath and his Team 11 worked almost round the clock to set up shelter homes, arrange transportation, establish quarantine centres and isolation wards after a flood of migrants was reported soon after the lockdown. A decision to disburse financial relief, give free food to the poor, run community kitchens and ensure supply of essential commodities and doorstep delivery are some other major steps taken after the setting up of the 11 committees.“We got three bank holidays on April 2, 6 and 10 cancelled to ensure that funds being transferred to beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana, the state government’s pension for aged persons, widows, disabled and leprosy patients reach the people. We are also overseeing implementation of other schemes as asked by chief minister,” said additional chief secretary, Finance, Sanjiv Mittal, who heads the committee set up to monitor the availability of funds, study the impact of the lockdown on the state’s economy and recommend the future course of action.Director general of police HC Awasthi heads the committee that has been asked to ensure that all the coronavirus positive cases linked to Tablighi Jamaat are quarantined. Another major task for the committee was to protect the police force and jails from infection, he said.UP produces 30 to 40 million litres of milk every day. As the demand for milk has gone down due to the lockdown, its transportation to cities and maintaining the supply chain is also proving to be a major task. “Besides maintaining the supply chain of milk in urban areas, we have ensured that 22 private companies make milk powder out of excess milk. These units used to run in winter to make milk powder and meet the rising demand during summer. They are now making milk powder. To a large extent, this is ensuring that the milk producers get the price for their produce,” said principal secretary, animal husbandry Bhuvnesh Kumar, who, as head of one of the 11 committees, is ensuring the supply of fodder to animals. “We are also working with the Society for Prevention of Cruelty against Animals (SPCA) so that stray animals and monkeys also get regular food,” said Kumar.THE COMMITTEESThe chief secretary heads the committee set up to coordinate with the union government and other states and oversees the functioning of all committees. The infrastructure and industrial development commissioner (IIDC) heads the committee set up to ensure implementation of various schemes launched by the Centre and the state government for welfare of workers and ensure payment of wages. The agriculture production commissioner heads the committee to monitor the supply chain and ensure doorstep delivery of food grains, milk and vegetables. The additional chief secretary, home, heads the committee set up to check blackmarketeering of essential commodities. The additional chief secretary revenue’s committee oversees the setting up of community kitchens. The principal secretary, rural development and panchayati raj, leads the committee set up to take care of cleanliness, sanitisation and supply of clean drinking water in rural areas. The principal secretary, medical and health, heads the committee working on strengthening surveillance setting up of level 1, level2 and level 3 hospitals, testing labs and provides other facilities. The principal secretary, animal husbandry, heads the committee set up to take care of the welfare of stray cattle, birds and ensures the supply of fodder. The DGP’s committee is working on protection of the police force and jails from infection. The ACS finance heads the committee set up to monitor implementation of schemes for the people’s welfare, provide finance and recommend follow- up action after studying the economic impact of the lockdown. The principal secretary, agriculture, heads the committee set up to look into the problems of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/how-yogi-s-team-11-is-tackling-covid-19-challenges/story-Q2BicCMhAFE3LZw9rVXXFO.html
10-04-2020||City||Himachal’s pharma units gear up to meet rising global demand for HCQ to treat Covid-19||SHIMLA: Drug manufacturing units in Himachal Pradesh are gearing up to meet the rising global demand for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an anti-malarial drug being used to treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19).There are 40 drug units in the state that have the approval to make the anti-malarial drug. They are based in the pharmaceutical hubs of Baddi and Nalagarh in Solan district, Kala Amb and Nahan in Sirmaur district and Sansarpur in Kangra district.The small-scale units in Baddi have the capacity to produce about one to five lakh tablets daily, while the bigger companies can produce about one crore tablets a day.ADEQUATE STOCK FOR COUNTRYIndia produces 70% of world’s hydroxiychloroquine supply and has adequate stock for itself.“The government has ordered the drug manufacturing units to enhance the production of HCQ. The units in Himachal Pradesh can meet the bulk supplies,” state drug controller Navneet Marwah said, adding that the state has adequate stock of HCQ to meet its own needs.“Not only can we meet our own needs but also that of other states,” Marwah said.Panacea Biotech, Glenmark, Zydus Cadila and Unichem are some of the major pharmaceutical companies manufacturing hydroxichloroquine in the state.GOVT ASSURES FULL SUPPORT TO UNITSChief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Thursday held a video-conference with drug manufacturers and asked them to increase the HCQ production to meet the rising demand. The government has assured full support to drug manufacturing units of the state.However, the availability of raw material and labour shortage at the units are a concern for the drug manufacturing units. “Drug manufacturing units in the state can produce 30 to 40 crore tablets in a month but it all depends on the availability of raw material,” said Dr Rajesh Gupta, the president of the Himachal Pradesh Drug Manufacturing Association.The units producing active pharmaceutical ingredients for the manufacturing of hydroxychloroquine are based in Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh.There is no China link in the supply chain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-s-pharma-units-gear-up-to-meet-rising-global-demand-for-hcq-to-treat-covid-19/story-clkz7llWLSYZ599g8wIBeI.html
10-04-2020||Mumbai||Rapid increase in leopard movement in Aarey Colony: Forest department||Over the past two weeks frequency of leopard sightings at Aarey Milk Colony in Goregaon has increased significantly, the Maharashtra forest department said. From an average of two a week, camera traps captured images of free roaming big cats daily during the past 16 days of the lockdown.Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), said, “We have observed a noticeable increase in leopard movement, especially during evening and night, on a daily basis during lockdown. This type of movement has not been observed before by any of the four camera traps in the area. Images of not only adults but quite a few cubs have also been observed from different units in Aarey.”Limaye said the department along with a team of researchers spotted big cats at locations inside Aarey where they had not been seen before. “This indicates that these big cats are moving freely without any fear due to lack of human movement across roads or along hamlets. We cannot disclose the exact locations where the animals have been spotted for safety of those zones and their habitats, but these are all case studies of wildlife reclaiming their habitat,” said Limaye.Sharing its boundary with Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), which is home to at least 47 leopards (according to wildlife biologist Nikit Surve and SGNP officials), the 16-sq km Aarey Colony has a resident population of six to seven leopards including cubs, as well as a transient population moving from SGNP. The forest department shared latest images of the cats. “One of our researchers, Kunal Chaudhary, took a few photos apart from camera trap images of big cats moving along a boundary wall inside Aarey. He, too, has confirmed daily sightings,” said Limaye.The department added that there was a spike in free movement of Sambar, Chital deer and a host of primates across SGNP as well. Citing that the numbers are unprecedented, Limaye said, “Similar observations have been recorded in Karnala and Tansa.”Meanwhile, captive big cats in SGNP’s safari section, which were being fed chicken during the first week of the lockdown, will be given frozen buffalo meat as Deonar abattoir has agreed to supply the meat for the next two months from April 4 onwards. The meat was originally meant for export purposes, which has been put on hold due to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rapid-increase-in-leopard-movement-in-aarey-colony-forest-department/story-eM2QtHjqGa23kL1zhuaZZM.html
10-04-2020||Lucknow||UP govt provides financial aid to over 11 lakh workers amid lockdown||The Uttar Pradesh government has provided Rs 1,000 financial aid each to over 11 lakh construction workers in the state till date amid the nationwide lockdown, said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday.Addressing media here, the Chief Minister said: “The State government had decided to extend help to those people whose livelihood has been affected due to COVID-19.

10-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh move to make masks a must in public not in tune with WHO, Union ministry guidelines||The Chandigarh administration’s recent decision to make the wearing of masks mandatory in public places is not in tune with the guidelines of World Health Organisation (WHO) and Union ministry of health and family welfare.The administration, in its media release on Wednesday, cited Maharashtra’s example – where confirmed COVID 19 cases are exponentially higher than Chandigarh – to make wearing a mask mandatory in public places to tackle coronavirus crisis. The UT police have also been asked to warn people to wear the masks in public places. Chandigarh has seen 18 coronavirus cases so far but no one has tested positive since Monday, whereas in Maharashtra, the positive cases have crossed 1,100.The Punjab government has also made wearing masks a must in public spaces as a preventive measure.‘CREATES FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY’In its updated guidelines on April 6, the WHO said: There is limited evidence that wearing a medical mask may be beneficial as a preventive measure. Moreover, it may create a false sense of security, with neglect of other essential measures, such as hand hygiene practices and physical distancing.Also, Union Ministry of Health in its advice on masks too said that the masks should only be worn if one is ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have symptoms.The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against Covid-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter.PREVENTIVE MEASUREDr JS Thakur, a professor at the department of community medicine in PGIMER, agreed that except patient, hospital staff and attendants, not everyone is required to wear mask. There is already shortfall of masks in hospitals, recommending it to the general public will create further shortfall, he said.The president of the Chandigarh chapter of Indian Medical Association, Dr Rajesh Dhir, however, said that WHO’s recommendations are just advisories. “Wearing a mask is definitely an additional protection from the virus. But one must understand it is not dilution of other prevention measures. Secondly, people must know how to use and dispose it of,” he said.When contacted, Dr G Dewan, the director of health services, UT, said that the move will help in stopping community transmission. Neighbouring states have also followed it.LACK OF AWARENESSOn the ground, the UT lacks an awareness drive despite pressing for the use of masks in public spaces.Local resident welfare association president Hitesh Puri said that people are using the same mask multiple times, while the medical superintendent at the government hospital in Sector 16, Dr VK Nagpal, clarified that the maximum life of a surgical mask, normally available in chemist shops, is not than eight hours or even less if it gets dirty.UT adviser Manoj Parida’s tweet on Wednesday suggesting that homemade masks are less effective in dealing with the virus has also added to confusion at a time when the Centre is advocating home-made masks, which according to experts, can be reused after washing. TIPS TO GET IT RIGHTPlace the mask over the nose, mouth and chin and ensure there is no gap.Avoid touching the mask while in use.Don’t leave the mask hanging from the neck.Don’t touch potentially contaminated outer surface while removing it.Change the mask after six hours.Never reuse disposable masks.Dispose the used masks in a closed bin after disinfecting them.Source: Ministry of health and family welfare||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-move-to-make-masks-a-must-in-public-not-in-tune-with-who-union-ministry-guidelines/story-mldNzITKQVyGlzFHQw3AWP.html

Even the staff will not leave the prisons.The order would apply to Arthur Road jail and Byculla jail in Mumbai, jails in Thane and Kalyan, and Yerawada jail in Pune. Additional Director General (Prisons and Correctional Services) Sunil Ramanand said this preventive step was being taken as these jails are located in coronavirus-affected areas, and house a large number of inmates, much beyond their capacity.“Medically examined prison staff will lock themselves up until further orders and administer the prisons without stepping out,” he said.In an official statement, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the decision was aimed at preventing the contagion from spreading in prisons.Arrangements will be made for food and stay of jail staff inside prisons, he said. “Steps will be taken to keep the main gates of the prisons completely closed during the lockdown,” the statement said. Contact numbers of senior prison officials will be shared with families of staff so that they can call up the senior officials if there is a problem, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/five-prisons-in-maharashtra-to-be-locked-down-over-coronavirus-fears/story-IlIs3vtddHOChJFFAQ1VBL.html
10-04-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown effect: At PU, monkey business becomes a thing of past||Amid reports of wild animals straying into urban spaces, including Chandigarh, due to the Covid-19 lockdown, Panjab University that was plagued with simian menace is witnessing a reverse trend, as all of a sudden monkeys are nowhere to be seen on the campus.Hundreds of simians, who had made Panjab University their home over the years, are a rare sight now. Panjab University has been grappling with the monkey menace from past many years but with no success.Before the lockdown began, hundreds of monkeys used to be spotted at the Students Centre, University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), University Institute of Legal Studies (UILS), hostels and other places.According to university officials, the lockdown has resulted in lack of food compelling the simians to move to nearby forests. PU chief security professor Ashwani Koul said, “I have not seen monkeys ever since the lockdown began. They had made PU their home because they could feed on garbage and left-over food. They will return as soon as things return to normalcy.”PU suspended its classes since March 15. Only few students are still residing in the university hostels. With the rise in monkey menace at the campus over the years, monkey bites had also been reported several times.Monkeys were a common site at PU hostels especially at boys’ hostel number 4, 5 and 6. Nikhil Narmeta, who resides in boys’ hostel number 5, said, “We seldom see a monkey now. Earlier, hundreds of monkeys used to be at the rooftop of our hostel. They used to topple dustbins to get food and sometimes take away the clothes of the students. There has been a drastic decline in the number of monkeys ever since the university suspended the classes.”The most striking fallout can be witnessed at the Student centre. Security Guard, Manjit Singh, who still visits Student Centre many times during the day said, “Monkeys used to feed on leftover food of students. There has been a drastic decline in monkeys around Student Centre, UIPS, UILS and department of laws since university was shut down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-effect-at-pu-monkey-business-becomes-a-thing-of-past/story-0D9jvHCE2NS2qBJNuVmdxJ.html

And it’s the men in uniform who aren’t just maintaining law and order but also doubling up as counsellors to help people stay safe and sane amid the coronavirus scare. Mitali Khuranna, a resident of Delhi’s Moti Bagh, says, “I live alone with my house help; my kids are settled in London. So, when the lockdown was announced, I was so scared about the whole scenario that I called on the Delhi Police helpline number for senior citizens, and was directed to a personnel at the Covid-19 helpline. And I must say that the cop on the phone were really patient, heard me, and even asked me if I needed them to visit my place. It’s satisfying to know that someone is there for me.” READ | Delhi police head constable posted at IGI airport immigration tests Covid-19 positiveThere have been instances of people, who had stocked up ration in their homes much before the lockdown was announced, also calling the cops out of panic. Asif Mohd Ali, DCP Licensing — who is heading the Covid-19 helpline of Delhi Police — says, “Many want to store maximum ration in their houses. We told them there is nothing to worry. And our beat officers are even meeting the senior citizens who feel depressed and alone at home in these times. We have clearly briefed our staff to be gentle and caring towards the people who are already in a state of panic right now.”   The 24X7 helpline number issued by the Delhi Police (011-23469526) received a total of 10,352 calls from the day the lockdown was announced till April 3. And there are also personal interactions that the cops on beat have been having with public in general. Ali adds, “Our role has evolved from just being cops who look after law and order to be counsellors. A few days back, we got a call on the helpline where a family wanted to take their relative’s body to their hometown in Bihar, for cremation. We met them, and made them understand the whole scenario where all of us are expected to follow social distancing, and then we helped them cremate the body in Delhi itself.” READ | Social distancing in Delhi: Grocers say stuck between defiant customers and police booking violatorsBesides, don’t be surprised if you see cops distributing food packets to the needy.

10-04-2020||City||Covid-19 infection can’t spread through cremation, burial: Mohali civil surgeon||There is no chance of disease transmission when cremating or burying people dying from Covid-19 if health authorities and families follow defined disposal procedures, Dr Manjit Singh, civil surgeon, Mohali, said on Thursday, to dispel myths around the pandemic.Covid-19 was transmitted mainly through droplets, not through bodies if safety procedures were followed. “Temperatures generated during burning of bodies reach 800-1,000 degrees Celsius, in which the deadly virus can no longer remain viable,” Dr Singh said in an advisory released on Thursday.Quoting the World Health Organization and Union health ministry guidelines, he said there was no evidence of people becoming infected from exposure to bodies of persons dying from Covid-19.Appealing to people not to panic or object to such cremations or burials, Dr Singh said even the ash did not pose any risks and could be collected to perform the last rites. He said as per health ministry guidelines crematorium and burial ground staff had to ensure hand hygiene after the cremation/burial and while handling the body and use masks and gloves.What was allowed, Dr Singh said, was viewing of the dead body by unzipping the face end of the body bag (by the staff using standard precautions) to let relatives take a last look at their loved one, as well as reading from religious scripts, sprinkling holy water and any other last rites that did not require touching the body.However, bathing, kissing or hugging the body was not allowed.Large gatherings at the crematorium/ burial ground should also not be allowed as a social distancing measure, the advisory added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-infection-can-t-spread-through-cremation-burial-mohali-civil-surgeon/story-uhldyNR7XhmVsxYhBseGLO.html

Any person moving around in his personal and official vehicle must be wearing these compulsorily.”“These masks may be standard mask available with the chemist or even homemade washable masks and can be reused after proper washing and disinfecting them. Violation of these instructions will be punishable under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, and the police are empowered to immediately arrest the violators,” it stated.Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) entails imprisonment of up to six months, or fine, which may extend to ₹1,000, or both.“Masks are mandatory for persons working at any site/office/workplace, etc. No person/officer/officials will attend any meeting/gathering without wearing these masks. It shall be the responsibility of the employer to ensure that the employees wear the 3-ply mask or cloth mask without fail,” the order read.It elaborated, “It has been observed in some studies that wearing of facial masks can reduce the spread of coronavirus substantially, from and to persons coming in contact with each other, apart from compulsory social distancing measures. It has become imperative that in the larger public interest, Covid-19 being contagious in nature and already strict observance of lockdown and isolation measures being enforced by Chandigarh administration, now wearing of masks by any person who is moving in any public space is essential to protect themselves from the infected persons.”The decision to make masks mandatory in public places was taken at a meeting held by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-in-chandigarh-no-mask-in-public-will-land-you-behind-bars/story-QsEik5bDjQErlILLHlBXZP.html
10-04-2020||City||Three Panchkula men who attended Sikar Jamaat +ve; 1 more case in Dera Bassi||Three Panchkula men, who attended a Tablighi Jamaat event in Sikar, Rajasthan, last month, tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, taking the district’s count – stable at two over the last eight days – to five. In Mohali, one more Covid-19 case was reported from Dera Bassi’s hotspot, Jawaharpur village, pushing the count there to 22 and the district’s to 37, the highest in Punjab.As UT, with its count of 18 over the last eight days, did not register any new case, the number of positive patients in the tricity now is 60 (Mohali with 37 cases and Panchkula with five ).Three new Covid-19 cases were reported in Panchkula eight days after a 36-year-old staff nurse at the local civil hospital tested positive on March 31. The men, aged 18, 37 and 80, residents of Banoi Khuda Baksh and Bakshiwala villages in Pinjore block of the district, had returned from Sikar on March 30 after attending Tablighi events for about 40 days.District nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajiv Narwal, said the men, who were related, were traced at Banoi Khuda Baksh village on April 1 and were moved to quarantine facilities at Nada Sahib gurdwara with other persons who had attended Jamaat events in other states. “Their samples were sent for testing among 50 others on Wednesday and returned positive on Thursday. The remaining tested negative. The three patients are admitted in isolation ward of the civil hospital,” Dr Narwal saidOfficials said the 80-year-old man, on his return from Sikar, did not go back home to Bakshiwala village, but stayed with the 18-year-old man at Banoi Khuda Baksh village, which was cordoned off after the men tested positive. Till now, about 127 persons who had attended Tablighi Jamaat events in different states, including Maharashtra and Rajasthan, have been quarantined in Panchkula. Around 60 of them have tested negative in the past two days.In Dera Bassi, the 67-year-old father-in-law of the sarpanch of Jawaharpur village was admitted to Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur, after testing positive.With the cases in the village climbing from 1 to 22 in five days, health authorities have declared the village a “containment zone”.With this, 14 members of the extended family of the sarpanch and her cousin, a panch, have contracted the disease. The panch was the first to test positive on April 4.The two, it is believed, did not observe social distancing norms. They organised community meals and distributed masks and medicines among the needy and migrant labourers in their area. “All 22 patients are responding well to treatment. The reports of 16 more residents of the village are awaited,” said Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh. “Five coronavirus patients have been cured and discharged from various hospitals of the district over the past four days,” he added.Meanwhile, Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan took to Twitter on Thursday to confirm the number of cases in the village. “House to house survey on in neighbouring villages also. 54 more samples taken. Sealed villages of Mukandpur, Devi Nagar and Haripur Kurha as well,” he tweeted.The Covid-19 test reports of senior Congress leader Deepinder Singh Dhillon have come out negative. Mohali’s health department had taken his samples on April 7 after a spate of Covid-19 positive cases in Dera Bassi. Dhillon had participated in some meetings in the area to check the state of preparedness. These meetings were also attended by some locals, who later tested positive. Dhillon said his reports were negative and he had not been put under quarantine by authorities. “I am observing self-isolation like many others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-panchkula-men-who-attended-sikar-jamaat-ve-1-more-case-in-dera-bassi/story-MA3UV4e8QjidLKm63qAnIP.html
10-04-2020||Lucknow||‘Padhne-likhne walon ki liye koi taklif nahi hai…’||Actor Atul Srivastava’s approach of taking long breaks to select projects is coming handy during the lockdown. Quarantined in his house with wife, son and mother-in-law in Mumbai, the Lucknowite is keeping himself busy with his second favourite thing after acting – reading!“It’s for my son and others like him that this lock down period is a big issue. ‘Padhne-likhne walon ki liye koi taklif nahi hai,’ (there is no problem for those who love reading and writing). I am enjoying reading books that I was longing to complete since a long time. I have collected a lot of books over the time but was not able to read them as had no me time because of shoots. So currently, I am all into reading most of the time,” he said over phone.Besides, he is catching up with old classic movies and digital shows on OTT. “With hectic shooting schedules and travelling health takes a backseat but these days I am following a strict timetable to be keep fit. Staying home has regulated my exercise routine and I myself have started feeling good about myself,” he says.The ‘Stree’, ‘Luka-Chuppi’ and ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan,’ actor did shoot for a digital show ‘Mannphodganj Ki Binni’ two years back in Lucknow that was recently released. Where he plays father to the protagonist, talking about the show, he says, “We shot 95% of the show between Lucknow, Kakori and Malihabad. Only, a small portion has been shot in Allahabad as Mannphodganj is a very popular locality in the Sangam city. It’s a very interesting family-oriented story and is being well received. I enjoyed shooting every bit of it in my hometown.”Before the shooting came to a halt in the wake of the coronavirus spread, he was scheduled to go Badayun near Bareilly for the last leg of his next. “We have shot ‘Sonam Gupta Bewafa Hai’ last year. The shooting of the film is nearly only over. There is some patchwork left to be completed. But everything has been put on hold. Let’s see when things get back on track. I hope this phase gets over soon.” Srivastava has also shot for Partho Ghosh’s ‘Pyar Main Thoda Twist’ in Lucknow last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/padhne-likhne-walon-ki-liye-koi-taklif-nahi-hai/story-4pGKqgWmaOOIUmCcAkfvqL.html
10-04-2020||Lucknow||‘Initiatives by Akshay & Salman will help all in a big way’||Actor Jameel Khan was in Delhi for one of his upcoming films when Section 144 was imposed. “I had left for the shoot and we were in prep rounds when this was announced, we had to rush back before the lock down. I don’t know when will we be able to restart the shoot. I don’t think it will be possible before September because we need to match the dates of all the artistes which is a difficult task,” says the UPite.As the nationwide lock down was announced Khan managed to reach Mumbai in time. “My wife did deter me from leaving for Delhi but as the entire cast and crew had reached Delhi so I couldn’t say no to the team. And, as the situation got tough everything was halted. I desperately required a break to spend time with my kids but definitely not like this and of course not this long. Like all, I too want to go back to work.”After a string of roles in films like ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’, ‘Baby’, ‘Setters’ and the web show ‘Gullak’ made him a household name. “Yes, the series did give me a much-awaited instant recognition and we were all set to start the shoot of second season too. But, due to the Covid 19 crisis everything is on hold,” said the versatile actor over the phone.Hailing from UP’s Bhadohi, Khan has spent much time in Lucknow, Aligarh before reaching Delhi and then Mumbai, “I too had to start from scratch and struggle a lot. This crisis scares me for small artistes, technicians coming from small districts and cities. Many amongst them must be hand to mouth. Too much is on stake and we all fear the repercussions. But there is a hope as big actors like Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan have come up with initiatives that will help all in a big way, I am sure and hopeful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/initiatives-by-akshay-salman-will-help-all-in-a-big-way/story-2SJPJeg6v3QpLIby2owYVO.html
10-04-2020||Gurugram||Eight arrested for assaulting migrant workers||The police on Thursday said that eight people were arrested for allegedly assaulting at least four migrant workers with sticks at their rented room in Aliyar village, IMT Manesar. The alleged incident took place after the migrant workers allegedly protested the closure of a vegetable shop by the members of a committee which was created by the village panchayat and given the responsibility of making sure that residents follow the lockdown order, the police said. However, the migrant workers denied the claim and said that they were being harassed by the arrested men, who are part of the committee, for getting out of their house to get drinking water and groceries.The arrested men were identified as Ravi Singh, 36, Narendra Chauhan, 39, and Sudhir Singh, 31, who were nabbed on Wednesday. The five other men were arrested on Thursday and identified as Pritam, Ramesh Kumar, Alok Singh, Ravindra and Rahul Singh. The police said all of them are residents of Aliyar village. In the police complaint, Krishna Kumar, one of the victims, alleged that on Wednesday around 11.30am, he and his friends, all of whom are migrants who work at different automobile industries based in the area, were sitting in their rented room when at least 20 people came there with sticks and began beating them. “One of the men hit me on the head with a stick, after which I began bleeding profusely. The men assaulted and abused many people who stay in my building. They threatened to kill them and fled the spot,” he added in the FIR. Arvind Kumar, station house officer (SHO), IMT Manesar police station, said, “The arrested men are part of a committee which was set up by the panchayat to make sure that village residents follow the orders of the lockdown. On Wednesday morning, when the members of the committee reached near where the migrant workers live, they saw a vegetable shop open. They then asked the owner to shut down his shop. However, when the migrant workers saw this, they began protesting, hooting and created noise. Subsequently, the committee members went to their building and assaulted them.” He added that only one migrant worker sustained an injury during the incident and his condition is reported to be stable.The police said that the committee had decided that grocery shops and other shops of essential items will remain open in the morning between 8am and 11am and in the evening between 4pm and 8pm. Chotu Kumar Singh, one of the victims, refuted the police’s version and said that the suspects have been harassing him and the other migrant workers for the past five days. “We do not get clean drinking water in our building. So, we have to go to our workplace which is located nearby and get the water. These men have been abusing us and threatening us against getting out of our house. But we need to get groceries and water for our survival. Eight of our friends have sustained injuries due to the assault and one of them is in the hospital currently,” he added. A case was registered against the men under sections 148, 149, 323, 452, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at IMT Manesar police station on Wednesday.

10-04-2020||Gurugram||RWAs ask police to ensure people maintain social distance during food distribution||The residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) of Sector 21 and 22 on Thursday wrote to the local police demanding deployment of more police personnel at the food distribution centres in their respective sectors to ensure that the beneficiaries maintain adequate social distance.The RWAs had said in the letter that a large number of people gather at the food distribution centres and alleged that the people are not able to maintain social distance. The RWAs further alleged that adequate police personnel is not deployed to ensure that people who walk to the centres from their homes for meals twice a day follow social distance norms.Like many other municipal wards in the city, the community centres at sector 21 and 22 ( Ward 4) have been developed by Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) as food distribution centres where meals are provided to daily wage earners, migrant workers, and those living in slums and villages. After the nationwide lockdown came into force on March 25, many people have been left with little or no money and do not have access to food and other essential goods.Residents said that at least 2,000 people from Salapur, Mulahera and other areas in the vicinity come to the two centres to collect their food.“On their way to the, the people walk almost touching each other. It is the responsibility of the police and MCG appointed nodal authority to ensure they maintain social distance. We have written to the station house officer(SHO) of Palam Vihar to deploy adequate police to ensure everyone stands in queue at the centre and walks maintaining at least a one-metre distance from one another,” Bhim Singh Yadav, president, Sector 22 RWA, said.The residents have also appealed the area councillor to approach the police in this regard. “We have observed that people wait for at least an hour or so two hours for meals daily. This long wait is the main reason that a large crowd swells up at the centres. We have requested the councillor and MCG officials to address the issue,” Shashi Pal Yadav, president, Sector 21 RWA.Beneficiaries who collect meals from the food distribution centres said maintaining social distance becomes harder during the long wait at the facility. “We wash our hands, cover our faces and usually maintain social distance, but at the Sector 21 food distribution centre we wait for hours for food due to which a crowd swells up there and we are unable to avoid standing in close proximity, ” Mohan Singh, a daily-wage earner who lives in Mulahera, said. Virender Yadav, area councillor, said, “ After residents raised concerns, we spoke to the food distribution in-charge in this regard. We will ensure people at these two centres stand in queue and we will also ensure they do not have to wait long for food.”MCG has set up over 40 food distribution centres and set up a team of officials and volunteers to distribute food in the city with the help of police during the lockdown.Vivek Kalia, one of the two nodal officers appointed by MCG for the purpose, said, “I will ask the officials concerned and in-charge of these centres to make people aware about the importance of social distance. Police should also step in and ensure people stand in queues at the centre.”The police said they will look into the matter and take adequate steps to ensure people follow social distance.Rajender Yadav, SHO, Palam Vihar, said, “If required, we will deploy more personnel to ensure people follow social distancing guidelines. I also take rounds every day in the entire area to observe the law and order situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rwas-ask-police-to-ensure-people-maintain-social-distance-during-food-distribution/story-Smq0SXADaqGNmPj7FSStVK.html

Two workers, who had flu-like symptoms (common in Covid-19 patients), were shifted to a quarantine centre after being tested at RML Hospital. The test reports are awaited.The owner of the shop did not respond to calls and text messages from HT seeking a comment.The NDMC on Thursday sanitised the area and sprayed 6,000 litres of disinfectant.The area was surveyed on Wednesday after three persons were found positive for the coronavirus disease from the neighbourhood between April 4 and April 6. Deepak Yadav, additional deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi), said the three people found Covid-19 positive in Bengali Market are the owner of Bangla Sweets in the Gol Market area, his son, and a cook.There was no response from the owner of Bangla Sweets when HT tried to contact him.“The first person who was infected with the virus was admitted to Apollo Hospital with fever on April 4. His son also developed symptoms and had to be admitted on April 5. Their cook fell ill the next day (April 6). Both of them tested positive later,” said YK Anand, president, Bengali Market residents’ welfare association.A senior administration official said the tracing of their contacts is still on, and that they are unsure if any of them have any history of travel to foreign countries.The surveillance team, which comprised officials of the district administration and those from NDMC, on Wednesday screened 325 houses, two markets and about 2,000 people in the Bengali Market and Mandi House area.Bengali Market, which was founded in 1930, has now been sealed by the police, who have blocked all entry and exit points to the neighbourhood. According to an order issued by New Delhi district magistrate Tanvi Garg, the adjoining areas of Todarmal Road, Babar Lane, and School Lane have also been blocked.“An extensive disinfection drive on the sealed containment area of Bengali Market, Babar Road and their adjoining lanes, sub-lanes, residential complexes, parks of the area, was carried out to prevent the spread of the virus,” said S Chellaiah, director (horticulture) at NDMC.“A case was registered against the shop owner for violating social distancing norms, prohibitory orders and keeping workers under unhygienic conditions amid the coronavirus pandemic.

All emergency services, such as ambulances, have been stationed near pickets. The live footage of the CCTV cameras installed in the neighbourhood is being monitored to keep a check on residents. Those found violating orders will be booked,” additional DCP Yadav said .Yadav said drones cannot be used for surveillance in Bengali Market containment because the area comes under the “no-fly zone” . No supply of essentials: ResidentsAfter being declared a containment zone, residents are not allowed to step out of their homes, even to buy essentials. Authorities said these essentials will be delivered to doorsteps of residents when they need them.Contacted over phone, residents, however, said they had already begun facing problems, with essential food items not being delivered.Vinod Juneja, a resident of Babar Road, said the police had circulated the contact numbers of 14 vendors authorised to deliver these goods.“However, all the vendors we call are refusing to come. For example, the vegetable vendor I called said he did not get fresh supply today as his truck was stopped somewhere. The milk vendor said he has no staff to send ,” Juneja said.District magistrate Garg admitted that there may have been some problems since it was the first day of containment. “We will keep a stricter vigil from tomorrow and ensure that everybody get their essential supplies,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/case-against-sweet-shop-owner-in-bengali-market-containment-area-residents-claim-no-home-deliveries/story-0fITnjDwScB34SsPGEOkaP.html

The other 13 members of the group recovered from the disease and were released between March 21 and March 30.Doctors at Medanta said the woman was the worst affected in her group. The 14 Italian tourists were moved to Medanta from an Indo-Tibetan Border Police’s (ITBP) Chhawla camp in Delhi on March 4. Dr Yatin Mehta, an intensive care expert at Medanta, who handled the treatment of the group, said the woman was struggling with illness despite showing some signs of improvement. “She was on the ventilator for almost a month. Her health condition improved in between while undergoing treatment, but her lungs did not show any major improvement. She struggled with her health condition as she had chronic kidney diseases,” he said.The woman died around noon on Thursday. Mehta said her family has been informed. “It is up to them to decide what is to be done next. We will get more clarity on Friday,” he said.Another Covid-19 patient, a 65-year-old man from Fazilpur village in Jharsa, near Sector 39, died on Tuesday. He was undergoing treatment at Artemis Hospital and died of a heart attack due to co-morbidity issues, officials said.District health department officials said the Jharsa resident had tested positive on April 4.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, Gurugram’s chief medical officer, said: “he patient was coronavirus positive but he had comorbidity issues that led to death. He was highly diabetic and had leg wounds, for which he was already undergoing treatment in a private hospital.”It was not clear how the man was infected.VS Kundu, the monitoring incharge for all Covid-19 cases in the district, confirmed the two deaths. “There are two deaths in the district. The 65-year-old man died on Tuesday. He was a Covid-19 positive patient but the exact reason for his death is a heart attack. He had other complications and was under observation. The post-mortem examination report clearly shows that his Covid-19 symptoms were not so intense that they could have led to death. In another case, an Italian tourist who was undergoing treatment in a private hospital for Covid-19 has also been declared dead.”A statement issued by the district administration said that the Fazilpur patient admitted to Artemis hospital died due to uncontrolled diabetes and heart attack, and that his death should not be linked to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/78-year-old-italian-woman-dies-of-covid-19-in-gurugram/story-Q9WsQULSV2BTrVanOc64sN.html

The chief minister, making the announcement, warned those misbehaving with healthcare personnel in of strict action.Addressing the media via video conference, Kejriwal said, “We have begun Operation SHIELD in the containment zones. The S in SHIELD stands for sealing the immediate area or surroundings after geographical marking, H for home-quarantine for those living in the area, I for isolation and tracing of people who have been first and second contacts, E for essential supplies, which involves doorstep delivery to the people in those areas, L for local sanitisation and disinfection of those areas, and D for door-to-door checking of these areas, so that people having symptoms of coronavirus are isolated, and testing done,” he said.Till Thursday, Delhi had 720 coronavirus positive cases, which included 12 deaths and 25 recoveries. For the first time since the cases linked to Tablighi Jamaat were revealed, the number of fresh contact history-related cases (35) was more than those linked to the Nizamuddin Markaz (4) on Thursday. The total foreign travel and local transmission cases are now 249, and the Markaz cases are 430.The declared containment zones comprise individual buildings — the Markaz in Nizamuddin, and three apartment complexes in east Delhi and one in Dwarka, neighbourhoods of Bengali Market, two blocks in Nizamuddin and one in Malviya Nagar, and congested alleys in Sadar and Laxmi Nagar.Earlier in the day, Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal chaired a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), Kejriwal, other ministers and top bureaucrats, and directed officials to strictly implement containment strategy in high-risk zones.“Strict geographical quarantine with preventive control, rigorous contact tracing and enhanced surveillance should be the priority at the moment,” a statement quoting Baijal said.Photos released by the L-G’s office later showed that all participants, including Baijal, Kejriwal, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendar Jain and others, wore masks during the meeting. This came a day after the government made it mandatory for people to wear masks in public places. Not wearing one could land a person in jail for a period between 1 to 6 months, a fine or both under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, as per an order issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev on Wednesday.During the meeting, the health department officials said the government has secured supply of 3,500 personal protective equipment (PPE) kits per day and 28,000 N95 masks, per week, for front-line health workers and health professionals. The L-G’s office stated that 5,995 ASHAs and 1278 ANMs have been trained as the second line of support.Referring to an incident of assault on two women doctors in Gautam Nagar, Kejriwal said the government will not tolerate such incidents. “These days, doctors and nurses have been putting their lives in danger by treating Covid-19 patients. We will take strictest possible action against those misbehaving with healthcare personnel,” he said.The warning comes a day after two women were allegedly assaulted by a 42-year-old man, who accused them of “spreading” the disease in their neighbourhood.Kejriwal said that the government has cut its expenses as tax collection “has almost come to nil”. “Everyone will also have to cut their expenses at their level in view of the current situation. Besides, we are giving free ration to 71 lakh people in the city. We are facing some teething problems in disbursal of free ration to non-card holders. It will be resolved soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-launches-operation-shield-to-tackle-virus-spread-in-containment-zones/story-e4MQj214R5xN7F8jgXTdFN.html

10-04-2020||City||DHFL scam accused received Maharashtra home department’s nod to travel amid lockdown||Amid the national lockdown, a senior home department official’s letter allowing the Wadhawan family, which is caught in the multi-crore Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) scam, to travel from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar on Wednesday has left the government red-faced. Home minister Anil Deshmukh late on Thursday announced a probe into the issue, as the letter was leaked to the media.The safe passage was given to DHFL promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, along with 21 other members of their family and friends, in five cars. The letter allegedly signed by Amitabh Gupta, principal secretary, home department, states: “This is to just inform you that following are my family friends and travelling from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar for family emergency. Particulars of the cars are given below.”The letter, which HT has a copy of, goes on to give details of the five cars, their numberplates and names of the persons travelling in every car. The Wadhawans were allowed to travel from Pune district to Satara district, bypassing the state norms that district borders be sealed. After they landed in Mahabaleshwar in the Dewan bungalow, residents protested, which brought the issue to light. Deshmukh tweeted: “We will probe how permission was granted to allow 23 members of the Wadhawan family to travel from Khandala to Satara. I had no idea about this letter. This was given by Gupta that’s true, but I don’t know the details over why this letter was given. So, we will conduct a probe and tomorrow a strict decision will be taken. This was not appropriate, I completely accept this.”A senior state secretariat official said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is irked with the incident as it embarrasses his administration which has been stringent with the lockdown measures. As per the government protocol, the home department is currently giving such leeway or travel pass only to those who have family emergencies, including hospitalisation or death of a family member. “The CBI had issued non-bailable warrants against the Wadhawan brothers, who are accused in Yes Bank/DHFL fraud. Instead of handing them over to the police, the government gives them VVIP treatment. Deshmukh owes the country an explanation,” said former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya. At the time of going to press, Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan were detained in Mahabaleshwar. Milind Bharambe, inspector general of police (law and order), said “They are in quarantine.”When asked, if Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan have been detained in Mahabaleshwar, in violation of Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code( CrPC), Suhas Warke, inspector general of police (Kolhapur range), said, “An offence is being registered against them. They are kept in institutional quarantine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dhfl-scam-accused-received-maharashtra-home-department-s-nod-to-travel-amid-lockdown/story-4VpZbYm0I08ri60hGtj0CJ.html
10-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: At funerals, distance between the living and the dead gets wider||Five masked men stood a few feet from each other around a pyre while a weeping teenager walked around it as part of a funeral ritual. Every now and then, he pulled down his mask to wipe his nose. A short distance away, a girl recorded the rituals on her phone while two other women held her and wept even as the priest repeatedly asked them to stand apart.“I have been cremating bodies for a decade. Never before did we have to interrupt relatives grieving over a dead body,” said another priest Arun Sharma, while he watched the proceedings at the Shiv Shamshan Ghat in east Delhi’s Geeta Colony.Several kilometres away, at the Shaheen Bagh cemetery in south Delhi, Habib Ahmed is resting after three hours of digging a grave with his colleague on being intimated about a death in the neighbourhood. “Often, the relatives of the dead choose to dig the pits. But we have disallowed that for now. We have to hurry up the burial process for social distancing,” said Ahmed, adding that residents here were told to ensure that the cot carrying the body is shouldered by only four persons.Amidst the spread of the Covid-19, the nationwide lockdown has led to unusual scenes at the crematoriums and burial grounds.The funeral rites are done quickly, the mourning is subdued, the attendance at crematoriums is unusually thin, close relatives are deprived of a chance to say their final goodbyes and the last rites have a changed format.“My uncle Amrit Lal wanted his last remains to be submerged at Haridwar. But we beg his forgiveness and will submerge it in the Yamuna near our home,” said Amir Chand, a resident of Karawal Nagar at north Delhi’s Nigam Bodh Ghat – one of the biggest crematoriums in the national capital region.A dozen relatives and friends of Lal -- who died of old age -- turned up at the Nigam Bodh Ghat in north Delhi. Only four of them were allowed to board the hearse van while others followed on motorcycles. Lal’s daughter couldn’t visit Delhi from Mau in Uttar Pradesh due to the lockdown. She tried to make it to Delhi, but couldn’t get beyond a couple of police checkpoints. “We will share a live video of the funeral with her,” said Chand.Behind them, another family walked in with a body on a bier. “My grandfather was loved by all and every relative wants to shoulder his bier. It has been painful for me to deny them the chance,” said Gautam Singh.Singh’s family will keep his ashes at their home for how long it may take, but they will submerge it in Haridwar.At the same crematorium, four pyres burnt adjacent to each other without anyone in attendance. “We are requesting the kin of the dead to leave immediately after hitting the pyres with sticks (as part of the rituals),” said Vishal Mishra, the supervisor at this crematorium.The supply of wood at the crematoriums has been hampered and the staffers are asking the kin of the dead to opt for the CNG cremation. “But we don’t want to add to the pains of a grieving family, so we don’t insist on it,” said Mishra.He said that there are many who have put off or even cancelled their immediate plans to carry out the last rites – which mostly involve submerging the ashes of the dead in the Ganges at Haridwar. “They are either submerging it in the Yamuna or leaving them in earthen pots in our lockers,” said Mishra.The 228 lockers at the crematorium here are fast filling up, but Mishra said that they have relaxed the rule of collecting the last remains within 15 days.Suman Kumar Gupta, the chief manager of the Nigam Bodh Ghat, said that while he expects the kin of the dead to collect the last remains after the lockdown ends, those that still get left behind will be submerged in the Ganges by his staff who will take the ashes to Haridwar.At the Shaheen Bagh cemetery, caretaker Abdur Raziq, said that when the kin of the dead alert them about a burial, they are in turn told to ensure not more than 20 people visit the cemetery – as per government orders for the lockdown. “During the burial, they are required to stand around the grave and not in a huddle. We keep a watch on them when they take turns to throw mud at the grave as part of the last rites,” said Raziq, adding that having the local police station right next door has helped with enforcing social distancing.‘Fewer unnatural deaths’Delhi has about 50 crematoriums and 10 cemeteries which are run by the civic agencies, apart from a few which are privately managed.Not only has the attendance of people visiting the major crematoriums have dipped, the number of bodies being cremated here too have reduced.“There are much fewer unnatural deaths, almost no accidental deaths in the city. Earlier, we would cremate 60 bodies a day on an average. During winters, when homeless people died, I remember two bodies being cremated on one pyre on multiple occasions. After the lockdown, the number has dipped to 30-40,” said Gupta.The dip in funerals at Delhi’s crematoriums is also because hardly any bodies are brought from the neighbouring cities. “Many from Noida, Ghaziabad and other parts of Delhi preferred crematoriums like Shiv Shamshan Ghat and Nigam Bodh Ghat due to their proximity to the Yamuna. But now they are cremating them at the nearest crematorium,” said priest Sharma.From 10-12 bodies a day, now only about five-six bodies are brought to the Shiv Shamshan Ghat, he added.While a few are able to arrange vehicles for bringing the bodies for cremation, during the lockdown most others are relying on hearse vans run by crematoriums and hospitals. “RWAs and people in residential neighbourhoods usually have the contact numbers of our hearse vans. The numbers are also mentioned at hospitals, at the crematoriums and other such places,” said Gupta.The people venturing out of their homes for cremations do not require a special permission, said the police. “They are not stopped at the checkpoints. Our only focus is to ensure social distancing everywhere, be it in the hearse van and other vehicles accompanying the bodies. Our PCR teams are also helping move bodies and arrange for hearse vans if needed,” said Anil Mittal, Delhi Police’s additional spokesperson.The crematorium staffers said most kin of the dead have behaved responsibly because of which social distancing has been possible during the funerals. At the Shiv Shamsham Ghat, about 10 relatives accompanying the body of an 85-year-old woman repeatedly reminded each other to stay apart.“On another day, there would be 300 people attending my mother-in-law’s funeral. But we didn’t allow relatives from even other parts of Delhi to visit us,” said a woman, Mridula.The last rites, which as per the Hindu customs are performed after 10 days of the death, too have witnessed a change.Ram Singh, whose mother Chameli succumbed to tuberculosis a day after the lockdown was announced, said that he not only regrets not being able to throw a feast for his mother’s death, even the prayers and rituals 13 days later were curtailed. Upon much insistence, a priest visited his home to perform the hour-long prayers in just 10 minutes. “We’ll ask other priests if we can hold another prayer and feast maybe a year later,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-funerals-distance-between-the-living-and-the-dead-gets-wider/story-mgIFdVSbOFPrwZofPYTLLJ.html
10-04-2020||Delhi||FIR against Maharaja Agrasen for negligence after patient dies of Covid||The Delhi Police on Thursday registered a case against Maharaja Agrasen hospital in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh for alleged negligence after two patients, one of who later died, and six staff members tested positive for Covid-19. The hospital, however, denied any wrongdoing.The Delhi government also ordered the hospital to shut its out patient clinics. The hospital claims it had done so from March 20 itself.According to police, the hospital had referred a 72-year-old woman to Sri Ganga Ram hospital on March 10. There, when she presented with inflammation of the lungs, doctors tested her for Covid-19. Her results came back positive. Over 100 staff of the hospital were asked to be in quarantine.The government then ordered that all patients and 82 employees at Maharaja Agrasen hospital who had been in the vicinity of the woman be tested. Deputy commissioner of police (West) [DCP] Deepak Purohit said six staff members and another patient were found positive. “When the patient died at the hospital on April 4, the hospital handed over the body to the family without alerting the government and violated the dead body management rules,” said the DCP. The cremation was subsequently attended by many people and the patient’s brother turned out to be positive later. The police registered a case under the Indian Penal Code, the Endemic Act and the Disaster Management Act.“We were the first private hospital in the city to shut the clinics in March to maintain social distancing. We had also stopped the elective surgeries as per government directions. So, right now we take in only emergency cases and there are very few patients in the hospital,” said Dr Deepak Singla, medical director of the hospital. “We took all steps suggested by the government. The entire hospital has been sanitised.”He said that both patients had been admitted to the hospital around March 10, much before the infection was widespread. “We had not tested them for the infection as neither they nor their family members had any history of travel. Later on, they tested positive for the infection,” he said, adding the 72-year-old went to Sri Ganga Ram hospital against medical advice. “When the second patient tested positive, we immediately informed authorities and were trying to coordinate his moving to a government hospital. However, no ventilator beds were immediately available. And, by morning he died. We followed protocols, and gave the body the relatives after explaining about Covid-19. They assured us they would take the body to the nearest crematorium, but took it to Sonipat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fir-against-maharaja-agrasen-for-negligence-after-patient-dies-of-covid/story-u8QT3CKcaYEeP2xgZg3bAO.html
10-04-2020||Noida||Noida uses drones, disinfectant tunnels to contain coronavirus spread||The Noida authority is using disinfectant tunnels to ensure that its staff members, who are engaged in providing essential services to the public, are sanitised properly. In order to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the authority has also started using drones to spray sanitising solution over densely populated hot spots in the city. On Wednesday, the authority installed two disinfectant tunnels—one at its Sector 39 office and other at its main administrative building in Sector 6—to disinfect its employees, who are working on providing all essential supplies such as milk, grocery, fruits, vegetables to the residents and food to those in need amid the 21-day nationwide lockdown.People other than the authority’s employees can also use the disinfectant tunnels, said officials. The authority plans to install five more disinfectant tunnels in the city. The authority uses sodium hypochlorite solution in these tunnels that take over 30 seconds to disinfect a person who walks in it, said, officials. “We use anti-bacterial solution spray in the tunnel. In 30 seconds, it will kill all germs, bacteria and also help in containing the virus. Now, our employees will pass through these two tunnels before entering the office premises,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer, Noida authority.Apart from the tunnels, the authority is using drones to spray sodium hypochlorite solutions on some hot spots, which are sealed till April 15 in order to contain the spread of Covid-19, officials said.“We are using drones to disinfect those hot spots which are densely populated. We are using the drones to disinfect clusters in sectors 5, 8, 9 and 10,” Maheshwari said.The authority has plans to continue disinfecting hot spots with drones for at least the next three or four days until these areas are sanitised thoroughly. The administration and health department has taken at least 200 people in the slum cluster of Sector 5 to a quarantine facility after they came in contact with a Covid-19 positive family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-uses-drones-disinfectant-tunnels-to-contain-coronavirus-spread/story-S2OOyGPwmgfJZ5MnfYOCUK.html
10-04-2020||Noida||Don’t throw away used masks, hand them over to waste collectors for proper disposal||The Noida authority has appealed to residents that they should help in the scientific disposal of used masks. The staff of the agency appointed by the authority for sanitation work will collect such waste from each household. “All residents are using masks to protect themselves from the Covid-19 infection. We are requesting residents that they should hand over used masks in a separate packet to the staff that collects waste from households in the city. The masks will be treated as medical waste and handled as per rules to contain the spread of Covid-19,” Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority, said.The request was made after reports emerged that people were dumping used masks in wet and dry waste bins. Collecting them separately is crucial as medical waste is disposed of in a different way. If they are mixed with household waste, they will not be treated properly, officials of Noida authority said.Noida produces at least 650 metric tonnes of solid waste daily and the staff collects waste from each household and transport it for remediation to the Mubarakpur,Sector 145, storage site. All biodegradable, degradable and construction waste is treated there.The district administration also reiterated that citizens in Covid-19 hot spots should stay at home and not worry about obtaining daily need items.“Our vehicles will carry out deliveries of essential goods at doorstep. We are trying to provide all services so that people do not face any inconvenience,” Suhas LY district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/don-t-throw-away-used-masks-hand-them-over-to-waste-collectors-for-proper-disposal/story-wZEWbaM0qSmIKuPa7U3EZP.html
10-04-2020||Noida||Containment work underway in 22 hot spots in GB Nagar||A total of 300 containment and surveillance teams have surveyed 5,52,130 families by late Wednesday night. On Tuesday, these teams started containment and surveillance work and, on Wednesday, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath ordered to seal all the identified hot spots in 15 districts of the state for containment and surveillance.Gautam Buddh Nagar reported its first Covid-19 case on March 12. Teams were constituted, and containment and surveillance exercise of the hot spots started after 25 days of the first incident.Each team consists of a health worker, a revenue department worker and a policeman or an official from any other department. These teams cover an area of three kilometres around each hot spot. There are in total 22 hot spots in the district. During the drive, officials have identified 338 persons with travel history.Officials are visiting each house in the 3-km area to spread awareness about Covid-19. These teams are informing residents about the precautions required to avoid infections, techniques to sanitise the house and proper hand washing techniques. Officials will also be collecting information about people who have a travel history in the last one or two months. Officials will also be finding out if any of the locals have any symptoms of the infection.“The containment work is underway in all the identified hot spots. Our officials are maintaining data of each and every house and persons who have travel history. We will keep a tab on the health of all these identified persons,” said Dr Sunil Dohre, additional chief medical officer, GB Nagar.One new case was confirmed in Noida during the wee hours of Thursday. A 67-year-old woman from Sector 50 of Noida was tested positive. The woman had got herself tested at a private lab, after which she informed the officials. The total number of cases in the district has reached 63. The woman is undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital. Two other patients, a 58-year-old woman and her 14-year-old son from Sector 37, had also gone for treatment to a private hospital in Delhi on March 31. Presently, these three Covid-19 patients from GB Nagar are undergoing treatment in Delhi.The 67-year-old woman is a heart patient, which makes her case a bit serious. Her son had returned from Scotland on March 18. He has been put under home-quarantine as he has no symptoms. The patient developed symptoms after which she got herself tested at a private lab. Officials haven’t taken samples of any other member of the family yet as nobody has developed any symptoms of Covid-19.Officials have increased the number of sampling in the district and are collecting around 100 samples everyday. Samples of 41 persons, out of the 366 people who were quarantined as a part of the cluster containment exercise in JJ Colony in Sector 5 and Sector 8 have been taken on Tuesday. These people were quarantined after four people related to the employees of Ceasefire, a firesafety solutions company in Sector 135, were tested positive for Covid-19.On Wednesday, four cases of Covid-19 were found, including the wives of two Ceasefire employees, who had tested positive earlier. Till now, 41 persons attached with Ceasefire have been found to be positive for the infection.Patients include a 35-year-old wife of a Ceasefire employee from Sector 74 and a 27-year-old wife of another employee, living in Chauda Village in Sector 22. The other two cases are of a man in his 50s from Sector 93A and a woman from Greater Noida.“We have three patients till now who are undergoing treatment at Delhi hospitals. They got themselves tested at private labs and later informed us,” added Dohre. By Thursday night, the health department had notified 1,862 travellers and 809 people have been put under surveillance. A total of 1,168 samples have been collected. A total of 63 cases have come out positive while 12 have been discharged. There are 51 active cases in the district.

10-04-2020||Noida||People cry foul in Noida hot spots as administration fails to deliver essential goods at home on Day 1 of sealing||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration’s promises of ensuring the doorstep delivery of essential commodities to people living in 22 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hot spots or containment clusters, which were sealed by the authorities from Wednesday night till April 15, rang hollow, as residents encountered enormous difficulties in sourcing the ingredients for one square meal on Thursday, the first day of the complete lockdown.On Thursday morning, the district administration released a list of dedicated suppliers of milk, vegetables, fruits, and medicines to each of the 34 localities that come under the purview of these hot spots.But, a first-hand reality check showed the vast difference between promises made and deliveries denied.For instance, in neighbourhoods adjacent to the district magistrate’s (DM) camp office, which included the upscale sectors 27 and 28, chaos reigned supreme on Thursday. Vinod Kumar, a resident of Sector 27, said that he was unable to contact the vendor assigned for his locality. “I have run of out of milk and fruits at home. My six-year-old son is crying for bread and cheese. The vendor’s mobile phone number is switched off since morning,” he said.Similarly, Dinesh Sharma, a resident of Sector 28, said that he couldn’t get any green vegetable for his diabetic father. “I was worried that with only potatoes left at home and how could my father eat lunch? Fortunately, my neighbour gave me some bitter gourd and capsicum to tide over the crisis,” he said.HT tried to verify the sectors 27 and 28 residents’ complaints and called up the vendor, Viseem Subodh Imran, on his mobile phone, but it was switched off until the time of this report was filed.Similarly, Sanjay, who goes by his first name and has been assigned by the district administration to supply goods to high-rises in ATS Dolce Zeta-1 (Greater Noida), started speaking even without listening to the queries. “Hum doodh nahin sabji supply karte hain. Kam se kam char ghante lagenge (I don’t supply milk. I only supply vegetables and it’ll take at least four hours for me to deliver).”Kale Choudhary, the designated supplier for Logix Blossom County and Paras Tierea in Sector 137 and Wazidpur village in Sector 135, didn’t answer his phone, despite repeated attempts.Supreme Court advocate Abhinav Ramkrishna, who lives in Omaxe Grand in Sector 93B, said, “We’ve been told by our supplier that we can buy fruits and vegetables from our apartment complex’s main gate at 5pm. Our society has 1,300 families and there will be just one seller. Imagine the inconvenience faced by hundreds of residents, as they will be queuing up to buy at the main gate within a stipulated timeframe. The idea of social distancing will go for a toss if a few hundred people gather near the gate to buy vegetables together. And, I am still unable to reason why the administration ordered the closure of the only Mother Dairy booth in the society and the medical store.”The situation was equally bad in Wazidpur village, another hotspot in the district. Sushil Kumar, a carpenter and a resident of Wazidpur village, said that his family has run out of rice, as his last bit of stock was exhausted during Thursday’s lunch. “When my seven-year-old son asked me what we would eat at dinner, I told him to have faith in God. We’re at the mercy of the district administration since we’re holed up here,” he said.The plight of 130-odd workers’ families, living in Harijan Basti in Sector 37, is even more deplorable. Their hutments are located around the hot spots of Sectors 27 and 28, and the residents have chosen the Gandhian way of protest to go on a mass fast, albeit for half a day, while pinning the blame on a ‘callous’ district administration.Nitish Modi, who was working as a painter in Arun Vihar society before the ongoing nationwide 21-day lockdown started on March 25 to contain the spread of Covid-19, said both the district administration and the police authorities didn’t pay any heed to their entreaties. To make matters worse, most of the vendors said that it would take up to seven hours to get the orders delivered, he added. “All 75 workers living in this colony were on fast for half a day. Women and children, however, didn’t take part in this protest against the district administration,” he said.Dilkhus Pandit, a plumber living in the same colony, questioned the district administration’s “cruel joke” on them. “How can we get these vendors to deliver essential suppliers to us when they never answer their calls?” he asked.Subhas Singh of the same area also alleged that the residents of his society did not get supply despite repeated calls. “The Noida authority, administration and police must look into the issues hampering supply,” he said.Sudarshan Awasthi, a resident of Sector 22’s A-block, which is also a hotspot, also said that many persons from his area kept calling the vendors’ numbers for supply but they refused to supply. “Then we called an integrated number advertised by the administration (18004192211). They provided a vendors’ mobile number who was assigned for hotspot areas, which are sealed. That person also refused to supply anything, saying he will not do it. Despite trying the whole day we failed to get essential goods at home. We borrowed vegetables from neighbours for today evening. Let’s see what will happen on Friday,” he said.In non-hotspot areas such as Shahdara village in Sector 142, workers engaged in unorganised sectors were also denied groceries and vegetables. “We’re fast running out of cash. Unfortunately, none of the administrative officials has come to our village to take stock of the situation. We’ve no ration left at home. I don’t know how long will we survive amid this crisis,” said Jyoti Sahu, who works as a domestic help in a neighbouring high-rise in Sector 137, a Covid-19 hotspot.“We called and gave our family details on the Noida authority’s hunger helpline on Monday, but no one came to deliver food till now. On Wednesday, we called emergency number 112, the police took the details and promised to visit, but no one has come yet,” she said.Bhure and Prahlad, migrant workers who chose to stay back in Noida, echoed Jyoti.The newly appointed DM, Suhas LY, however, allayed the harried residents’ concerns. “There is nothing to be worried about. We’re looking into the discrepancies. The additional chief executive officer of Noida authority is identifying the spots where meals will be delivered soon,” he said.Ritu Maheshwari, the chief executive officer of Noida authority, however, claimed that designated dedicated vendors are supplying essential goods including vegetables, fruits, grocery and medicine to hotspot areas. “If there are gaps in the service line, they will be streamlined and sorted out soon,” she said.

The workers were headed from Pune to Uttar Pradesh and were taken to relief camps, according to the police.The driver has been identified as Govind Ram Sukhhari, 24, a native of Uttar Pradesh who was residing in Chikhali, according to police sub-inspector Amardeep Krushna Pujari of Bhosari MIDC police station who is investigating the case.A case under Sections 188 and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against the driver. However, he was later released on bail by a local court.“We have been getting such cases regularly. A few days ago, 132 people were crammed in one truck and were headed north. After getting hold of these workers, we sanitise them, note down their information and send them to relief camps where they are provided with essential items. These workers are in a state of panic, so explaining to them that they cannot go any further is difficult,” said senior police inspector Rajendra Kunte of Bhosari MIDC police station.In Pune region, there are 699 relief camps which are home to 66,123 stranded labourers, according to a statement issued by Deepak Mhaisekar, divisional commissioner, Pune region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/police-intercept-truck-with-82-up-bound-labourers-in-bhosari-driver-arrested/story-KYkCowiscZVqEHN3vSEjlM.html

Such as provision for waste collection and disposal from quarantined households, where PMC has asked quarantined households to keep the quarantined person’s waste separately. PMC has given instructions to hand over segregated waste and sprinkle Sodium Hypochlorite solution or Ethyl Alcohol before handing over this waste to PMC. We have provided separate bags to collect waste from quarantined homes. This bag needs to be kept at a designated place given by PMC. The waste is being collected by ghantagadis on a daily basis. It is treated as bio-medical waste and is disposed of by an incinerator as per the state government’s guidelines. PMC has ensured a ghantagadi for each ward office and has given proper training to the driver and assistant to handle and treat the contaminated waste.Protective Personal Equipment (PPE) such as cap, mask, hand gloves gumboot, soap and protective eyewear has also been provided to the drivers and workers.We have also provided guidelines and equipment for spraying of sodium hypochlorite solution on waste and vehicle. All the vehicles need to be kept clean and disinfected and disposable PPEs should be incinerated after work.How does your day begin and rolls out?My day begins very early, with the handling and management of the PPE distribution and other allied issues and management of vehicles.I conduct awareness workshops conducted with all coordinators and supervisors of SWaCH in batches and detailed information is disseminated. The sanitary inspectors and supervisors are also given training about handling any waste related to Covid-19, biomedical waste and household level hazardous waste.What precautions are you taking?I exercise regularly even at home; follow a proper diet and ensure adequate sleep which is important. The moment I reach home, I first wash my hands and feet as I have elderly people at home. I also disinfect my house twice and use triple layer cloth mask once I leave home for my duties. What is your assessment of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune? How is it unfolding?Covid-19 spread is increasing day by day. We have imparted training to the additional staff for handling this increasing amount of waste. Provision for PPEs , disinfectants and collection bags has also made’ but it is very important to maintain the morale of sanitary workers and wastepickers. We have also undertaken health check-ups and awareness activities of more than 500 contractual workers on various processing plants with the help of private doctors to keep a balance of their duties especially while handling waste from quarantine homes.What gaps do you see in health and relief work? There needs to be greater awareness about social distancing among the general public and etiquette of mask usage and handling of this special waste, which we are trying our level best to make people understand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-the-frontline-there-is-need-for-greater-awareness-on-social-distancing/story-YPWtRd16oKVQPVbcF9YPHI.html

Kulkarni said, “Efforts are underway to ensure that the flow of newspaper distribution is restored at the earliest,” The main issue discussed during the meeting was related to the challenges of newspaper distribution due to the lockdown and no sale of newspapers at residential societies. The PUWJ in its release stated that a misconception was prevalent among the citizens that coronavirus spreads through newspapers which has stopped newspaper buying habits among the citizens. The World Health Organisations (WHO) has made it clear that the infection does not spread through newspapers and they come under the category of essentials, the release stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/puwj-advocates-setting-up-of-stalls-to-increase-sale-of-newspapers/story-GR9AY6JvsVFwd06YwkBZFJ.html

Revenue minister Balasabheb Thorat said vegetable markets in urban areas could be closed to check spread of Covid-19 (coronavirus).According to the Pune APMC, “PMC had sealed Gultekdi, Kasewadi, Nana peth, Bhavani peth, Rasta peth, Mahatma Phule Mandai, Somwar peth, Mangalwar peth, Budhwar peth, Guruwar peth, Shaniwar peth, Raviwar peth and Kondhwa areas. As maximum people visiting Market Yard, mainly tempo drivers, potters, retail traders and middlemen are residents of these areas, traders and staff are unwilling to continue operations because of health risks involved.”Deshmukh said people living near Market Yard are facing inconvenience as police are not allowing them to leave the area. Vilas Bhujbal, president, Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard traders’ and agents’ association, said, “With some positive cases reported from Gultekdi area, APMC has decided to close operations. We have appealed to traders to not bring vegetable supply from outstations and farmers till further instructions.’“There is a rush to buy vegetables, ever since the news arrived that the Market Yard will be closed. Since there is less supply of vegetables, the prices have increased,” said Mayur Kalate, a retail vegetable vendor at Jijamata Bhaji Mandai, AundhMeenal Patil who came along with her mother-in-law to buy vegetables for the week said, “The prices of the vegetables are skyrocketing and some vegetables like ginger and coriander which are used in most of the dishes is not even available.” Markets closed to check footfallEven as Pune APMC has decided to close operations from Friday, traders and Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB) officials claim that it will not affect residents. Residents and retailers say the decision will escalate the prices of vegetables and fruits.A MSAMB official on condition of anonymity said, “Residents used to crowd markets and hoard vegetables and fruits despite telling them that supply will be regular. Hence, it is necessary to close markets for at least a week. Grocery shops selling cereals and other edibles would remain open and direct supply from farmers is also not stopped. “I have been going to Market Yard on alternate days to buy vegetables and sell it at the retail market. The prices have already shot up because of short supply. The closure of wholesale market for an indefinite period will cause further price escalation,” said Sarika Deshmukh, a vegetable vendor from Pune-Satara road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wholesale-market-at-pune-s-market-yard-to-remain-closed-from-friday/story-WPEElTO045J3TOpA2iIHBK.html
10-04-2020||Pune||Shadow practice at Pune home helps Pritha Vartikar paddle through the gloomy lockdown||One of the finest paddlers from the city, 13-year-old Pritha Vartikar, is definitely upset with the lockdown as she had planned to participate in internationals tournaments, but she believes this is necessary to win the war against Covid-19 and is following a strict practice routine.Coach Soumen Saha’s video calls, shadow practice of different shots and fitness drills at home or on the terrace – sum up Vartikar’s day, who is no. 2 in sub-junior girls category in Table Tennis Federation of India ranking.Vartikar had a memorable 2019 as she became a national champion in the sub junior category in the UTT 81st Cadet and Sub-Junior National Table Tennis Championship, Dharamshala in November. Good form continued till January as Vartikar won the under-14 title in UTT 65th National School Games table tennis championship in Vadodara. Along with her practice routine, Vartikar is also in touch with NGO Lakshya. Every Tuesday, Lakshya conducts a conference call from 11am to 2pm where all supported athletes are updated about their diet, fitness and mental training. Vartikar, is currently locked down at her home at Sus road, Pashan.Morning session: I wake up at 8:30am and from 9am, shadow practice starts. The session is of one hour and after that 20 minutes is allotted to exercises like skipping. My coach has fixed the schedule and every day, I have shadow practice of a different shot. Shadow drills actually help a lot as you start getting the feel of how your shot will be played. I finish my training by 10:30am and then, have my breakfast and take rest. (In a shadow drill, a player practices the shot without using a ball. Only action of a shot is repeated to get it done perfectly. It helps players to get feel of one’s shot. Player can also practice footwork drills along with shadow drill.)Afternoon session:After having my lunch, I listen to music or watch the television. I also sleep for an hour and spend time with my mother.Evening session:In evening, I dedicate one hour to fitness in which focus is on core exercises and stretching along with squats, push-ups, lunges and burpees.I like to write so once my fitness routine is complete, I spend time writing. It is basic writing like reading text from my English textbook and writing it down in my notebook. After all these activities, I have my dinner and then, again I watch television for sometime or read a book.GymI don’t have gym sessions in my normal days as well. The work out which is given by my coach takes care of my fitness level. I do miss training on the court as it was the season of international tournaments and I was preparing to take part in those tournaments. I was selected to play the 2020 ITTF World Junior Circuit Premium, India Junior and Cadet open, Kolkata, Belgium Junior and cadet Open and French Junior.Situation is not conducive to play and as players we need to be focussed on our fitness drills during this time. I hope the situation improves soon as I am eager to see all the sports action in the city getting back on track.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/shadow-practice-at-pune-home-helps-this-india-sub-jr-girls-no-2-paddle-through-the-gloomy-lockdown/story-SPL9Y51P5a16fMajclivtL.html
10-04-2020||Delhi||City hospitals start giving HCQS to health care workers to protect them from Covid-19||Government hospitals across the city have started giving the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQS) to doctors and health care workers in Covid-19 wards as prophylaxis (a medicine given to a person to prevent the onset of a disease). The Indian Council of Medical Research had recommended the drug for people at a “high-risk” of contracting the virus, such as close contacts of Covid-19 patients and health care workers taking care of Covid-19 patients. As on Wednesday, Delhi has reported 669 Covid-19 cases and nine deaths. “The scientific evidence that HCQS helps is not very strong. It is voluntary and we have circulated a message to those working in Covid-19 wards that the medicine is available and whosoever wants it, can get it from the administration,” Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said.The health care workers have to consume two 400mg tablets of HCQS on Day 0, followed by a tablet once every week for seven weeks, a doctor said.However, hospitals have also warned their staff about contraindications of the medicine.“We don’t know how effective the drug is in preventing the infection, but we do know that it is cardiotoxic, so we have warned that people with existing heart conditions should not take it,” Dr BL Sherwal, director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital, which is treating the second highest number of Covid-19 patients in the city, said. The hospital has also started giving a combination of the antimalarial drug and antibiotic azithromycin to its critical patients. A French study published recently in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents found that a combination of the two may be effective against Covid-19.The doctors have, however, warned against people against indiscriminately consuming the medicine without a valid doctor’s prescription. “It is only recommended for those at a high risk of contracting the disease. We still do not know the effects of the drug. Not everyone should start buying and consuming it,” Dr Sherwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/city-hospitals-start-giving-hcqs-to-health-care-workers-to-protect-them-from-covid-19/story-wrbFBZf3jFhrpLnEcFA9IP.html
