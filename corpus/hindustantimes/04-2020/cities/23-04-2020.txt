23-04-2020||Chandigarh||Abhay Chautala alleges flaws in wheat procurement, cites his own case||Indian National Lok Dal leader Abhay Chautala on Thursday alleged irregularities in the ongoing procurement of mustard and wheat in Haryana.Briefing mediapersons, the Ellenabad legislator said that he was a member of the group formed by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to discuss various issues pertaining to Covid-19 as well as the mustard and wheat procurement. The group comprises representatives from all political parties.“I had suggested that mustard and wheat be lifted from villages either by the government or commission agents. Farmers have been suffering from day one as they are being asked to bring their produce to the mandis but on doing so are being told to go back ,” he alleged.Citing his own example and showing an official list of farmers which had his name as well, he said that he got a message that he could bring 5.2 quintals of wheat from his farms.“I have 76 acres of agricultural land with an average produce of 20 quintals wheat per acre. Shockingly, I have been asked to sell only about five quintals,” he said.After already having suffered because of such messages during mustard procurement, the farmers urged the government not to follow the same system in the procurement of wheat, yet the government is being adamant, he said.‘WILL NOT VISIT MANDIs’Stating that he had visited grain markets to get the stock of situation, Abhay said that he would not go to mandis henceforth, as many farmers gathered wherever he visited.“Since such gatherings could be problematic for the farmers, I have decided to not visit mandis from now onwards,” he said, adding that his decision was not taken under any pressure from the government. 3.58 lakh MT wheat bought on Day 4The procurement agencies in Haryana on Thursday purchased about 3.58 lakh MT of wheat from 42,357 farmers across the state. Additional chief secretary, agriculture, Sanjeev Kaushal, said about 9.07 lakh MT of wheat has been procured in the last four days from nearly 1.11 lakh farmers. He added that 23,907 MT of mustard was also procured from 8,321 farmers on Thursday.

We have to finish this quota by April 30.”Government sources say the Centre has promised to provide 60,000 MT additional wheat under Covid-19 quota (over and above regular quota) without any charge in April, May and June. However, the state will have to bear handling and transportation cost that is about ₹175 crore and include the cost of sugar and mustard oil.According to Anil Kumar, Karnal district food and supplies controller, 42,000 quintal atta and 42,000 quintal wheat has been distributed in April. “This is almost two times more than the fixed quota of March,” he added.FREE OF COST, LITERALLY!The 2.56 lakh pink ration card holders (11 lakh units/person) under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana every month get fixed 35kg atta per family, 2lt mustard oil, 1kg sugar, 1kg daal, 1kg salt. During the lockdown, AAY families will now also get additional 5kg wheat per person. For example, A family of five is entitled to 25kg additional wheat.The state has issued 8.49 lakh yellow ration cards under the BPL category covering 39 lakh people who are given 5kg per person per month atta, besides 2lt mustard oil, 1kg sugar, 1kg daal and 1kg salt per card.“Apart from their regular quota, the BPL families due to Covid-19 are also entitled to 5kg wheat per person per month,” an official said.The third category is of 18.31 lakh other priority household Khakhi card holders comprising near 82 lakh people, who apart from their regular quota of 5kg per person atta and 1kg daal, are being given additional 5kg wheat per person during the lockdown.In Ambala, Karnal, Hisar, Rohtak and Yamunanagar districts, fortified wheat atta is being distributed among the beneficiaries. “But under the Covid-19 quota of additional 5kg wheat per person, we are supplying wheat only in these five districts,” said another official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/half-of-haryana-population-is-eligible-for-free-ration/story-Su3itmGbw90UOHmfLpycfL.html

We will collect nasal and throat swab samples from fruit and vegetable vendors, hawkers, chemists and grocery store owners on a voluntary basis. These people are exempted from lockdown norms as they provide essential services, and thus interact with the maximum number of people. The aim is to check if they have come in contact with any corona positive patient.”District surveillance officer Dr Ranjan Gautam said, “The mobile medical unit visited Mandi Samiti and railway hospital on Wednesday and collected seven samples whose reports are awaited. Already, around 30-40 of the vendors and chemists who have been given lockdown passes, have approached the district medical team for their samples to be collected and tested.”Meanwhile, reports of 31 suspects tested on Tuesday arrived on Wednesday and all of them turned negative.”According to officials, the mobile medical unit will collect pool samples. One pool contains at least 10 samples.If a pool tests negative for Covid-19, it means all 10 people whose samples were in the pool are Corona negative. However, if a pool is found positive, all 10 persons have to undergo individual tests for Covid-19.The health department on Wednesday had also collected 22 pool samples from journalists working in the area and 45 individual samples from suspects. All of these will be sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) for testing on Thursday. Officials said 47 teams had conducted door-to-door survey in the buffer zone around the house of the family of six that tested positive and screened 3,440 houses on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/covid-19-free-but-on-toes-bareilly-collects-pool-samples-of-vendors/story-e0FOdw9awtOZzEKUwxrffO.html

Everyday, 93-year-old Vidyavanti sits behind her sewing machine and churns out masks to be distributed among the poor and underprivileged. Vidyavanti and her seven decades old machine have become a household name in Karnal as her videos are being shared widely by local YouTubers to encourage people to do their bit.“I had bought this sewing machine by selling some of my ornaments in 1947. Back then, I was quite famous for my stitching skills,” said the grandmother of three, who had come from Pakistan after the Partition. “With my son and grandchildren, I have stitched hundreds of masks for the people, who are unable to buy them or get them due to shortage,” she said. Never since the Partition have I seen such a mayhem, said Vidyavanti, referring to the rising death toll due to the pandemic. She, however, appreciated the “timely measures” taken by the government to plug the virus spread. Her two granddaughters, a grandson and her son, who works for Bharatiya Vikas Parisad, also lend her a helping hand, while an NGO, Seva Bharti Foundation, provides them raw material at free of cost to prepare masks.Vidyavanti’s granddaughter Nupur, who is pursuing her graduation from Chandigarh, said, “My grandmother inspires many.

This year, by Thursday, 1.18 lakh MT wheat has been purchased at the mandis in Fazilka and sources say that the peak harvesting in the semi-arid belt is expected from next week.Official sources said that scores of farmers from Rajasthan are fully dependent on Punjab mandis and purchase centres due to organised procurement and better pricing.But amid Covid-19 outbreak, the district authorities are trying to keep the Rajasthan farmers away from local mandis.Deputy commissioner Arvind Pal Singh Sandhu said this year Fazilka expects to procure 9 lakh metric tonne food grains. “The administration has no choice but to prohibit arrival of farmers from outside Fazilka. Mandis near Abohar remain preferred for Rajasthan farmers due to proximity to their respective villages,” he added.“We are taking assistance of community leaders and district journalists to spread the message about not allowing farmers from outside t enter local mandis across the state border,” said Sandhu.Located along Indian-Pakistan border, Fazilka is among three Punjab districts with no Covid-19 positive case so far.“The inter-state border has been sealed and police have been instructed to ensure that farmers from Rajasthan do not cross the border. Panchayats are assisting to keep an eye on any unwanted movement,” the DC added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fazilka-admn-dissuades-rajasthan-farmers-from-entering-punjab-mandis/story-rSjAkZLEAII4chyMpgK4uI.html

23-04-2020||City||Punjab to slow procurement to avoid glut, match grain movement||Chandigarh: To avoid a glut in grain markets and to coordinate the pace of procurement, lifting and movement of food grain out of the state, the Punjab government on Thursday decided to slow the pace of procurement by at least one-third, with issue of fewer curfew passes to farmers. The availability of labour for all these tasks has been an important input into the decision. “From Sunday, we will issue 60,000 passes a day to farmers for bringing their produce to mandis for procurement,” said additional chief secretary (development) Viswajeet Khanna, who heads the state committee on wheat harvest and procurement. He added that he was satisfied with the pace of procurement, but the movement of grain from the state to other consuming states was also a priority.On Wednesday, 10,000 labourers across the state were engaged with 50 goods trains that were in the state to take away rice and wheat for distribution in consuming states. The demand for food grain has picked up after the Centre announced its PM Garib Kalyan Yojana, which has decided to double the allocation for the poor, free of cost. For Punjab, updated figures of procurement till Thursday, its ninth day, show that of the total expected arrival of 135 lakh tonne wheat, around 29.4 lakh tonne or 20% had arrived in grain markets. Due to labour shortage, however, lifting from mandis has suffered with 13 lakh tonne yet to be lifted.State food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said a steady pace of crop arrival had been maintained at between 4.5 lakh tonne and 6 lakh tonne a day on average, but this would be slowed to streamline the backlog in lifting and the grain outflow from the state. The mandi board, a subsidiary of the agriculture department which regulates mandis for procurement, has decided to issue 90,000 passes to farmers on Friday and Saturday, with 60,000 from Sunday. PAYMENT AWAITED: FARMERSBharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president BS Rajewal said four state procurement agencies were yet to make any payment to farmers, with only the Food Corporation of India, a central agency, paying up. Minister Ashu, however, contradicted this by saying, “We have released Rs 686 crore to arhtiyas and I expect they are making payment to farmers. As per norms, the agency is to pay the arhtiya in 72 hours, who is supposed to pay the farmer within 48 hours of receiving the payment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-to-slow-procurement-to-avoid-glut-match-grain-movement/story-aEuMmfQTTvtVWSDClBvi0J.html

Around 550 policemen are currently staying in these hotel rooms. Till Thursday night, there were 28 positive Covid-19 cases among police personnel and at least 500 were in home-quarantine.A senior police officer who asked not to be named said that three categories of police personnel live in such hotels. “The first group is policemen who live in containment zones or have houses out of Delhi. They are important field officers and cannot return to those locked down areas after work, so they are living in hotels. Another group is those who are quarantined and are being monitored. The third category is that of people in isolation. Some hotels have given us their premises for free, while we are paying the others. Rooms vacated by personnel who have completed the isolation period are being taken up by others, after sanitisation.”The third group(isolation) are of those police officers who worked closely with the 28 police personnel who have tested positive. They have not shown any symptoms of Covid-19 disease. The police are on the front lines of the fight against Covid-19 — managing containment zones, conducting checks, ensuring social distancing, even feeding the hungry.A second officer said on condition of anonymity that booking separate facilities for the police is important because many junior personnel, carrying ranks of constables, head constables and assistant sub-inspectors, live in barracks inside police stations.In Chandni Mahal, the police station had to be sealed after two constables, who lived in the barracks, tested positive for Covid-19. With Chandni Mahal emerging as one of the biggest containment zones in the city, the local police personnel are currently working out of the nearby Jama Masjid police station.Special commissioner of police, Robin Hibu, confirmed that the police has made arrangements in hotels for the junior constabulary, keeping in mind their safety as well as that of their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hotels-to-house-cops-dedicated-testing-facility-in-the-works/story-yOXCvyeCuBmJ1LNusGoj2J.html
23-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government should allow liquor shops to open to earn revenue: Raj Thackeray||Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray has asked the state to open liquor shops to generate revenue for the cash-strapped government.Raj, in a letter to his cousin and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, stressed that the state should not be caught in “moral issues” and must ensure the opening of liquor shops, as it was uncertain how long the lockdown would continue.“At such times, by keeping open the wine shops, the state will start getting some revenue. However, opening the wine shops does not mean we are catering to the needs of alcohol consumers. The only purpose behind this step will be to start the process of income flow into the shrinking revenue of the state,” he wrote in the letter.Raj justified his stance stating that the Maharashtra government generates duty from liquor worth ₹1,250 crore every month, which translates into ₹14,000 crore annually, but due to the ongoing lockdown, it has already lost a substantial amount. He said that the state should not be caught in moral issues as there is no liquor ban in the state. Raj signed off the letter by saying the state should seriously consider his plea to become economically reliant in such an environment.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has condemned the stance taken by the MNS. “Right now the priority should be food for the poor, medical care, as well as ensuring that migrants are sent home safely. Instead, Raj Thackeray like always focuses on non issues like now on liquor, which is very sad,” rued Priti Sharma Menon, national spokesperson, AAP.Earlier, actor Rishi Kapoor had also demanded that wine shops be kept open in view of the “depression and uncertainty” all around and also outlined that the government desperately needs money.Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Shiv Sena Raj Thackeray has demanded the opening of liquor shops to generate revenue for the cash strapped state government.

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved an ordinance making acts of violence and harassment against healthcare personnel deployed in combating COVID-19 a non-bailable offence with maximum punishment of seven years imprisonment and ₹5 lakh fine, meeting a key demand of health professionals in the wake of recent attacks on them.Dr Jagat Ram, director of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, said: “It will surely boost the morale of the healthcare workers who were disappointed by the violence against the people of their ilk in the front line. The government has taken a step in the right direction and the PGIMER appreciates the concern shown towards us. It is for the betterment of society.”The ordinance will also be invoked if healthcare personnel face harassment from their landlords or neighbours over suspicion that they may carry the coronavirus infection due to the nature of their work. “By bringing the ordinance, the central government has provided a big relief to the doctors and other health workers. Doctors have been abused, beaten up, denied entry to their houses. The IMA whole-heatedly welcome this move and requests the state government to issue strict directions to police to implement the new provision,” said Punjab IMA president Dr Navjot Dahiya.Echoing similar sentiments, director endocrinology, Fortis Hospital Mohali, Dr KP Singh, said the community will suffer if the people in the front line are not treated in the way they deserve. “Healthcare workers deserve to be protected so that they can render their duties in the best possible way. The aim of the medical professionals is to save lives and people on the forefront should not feel insure in such testing times,” he said.Senior director and chief operating officer of Max Hospital Mohali, Col Harinder Singh Chahal (retd), said the ordinance has given a lot of confidence to the medical fraternity. “The healthcare workers are duty-bound to serve without discrimination, for which the cooperation and support from society is a fundamental need. During the pandemic, we have had incidents where they were harassed and even assaulted. The government has done the right thing by bringing in stringent punishment to those who perpetrate this outrage,” he said.Principal of Government Medical College, Amritsar, Dr Sujata Sharma, said: “The doctors and health care staff are risking their lives and instead of appreciation, at times, they are assaulted. The ordinance approved by the President is a welcome move as it will provide security and to the medical professionals.”Principal of Patiala’s Government Medical College, Dr Harjinder Singh, said the new legal provision will go a long way in boosting the morale of the medical professionals. “The stringent law will surely help curb attacks on medical professionals. However, it will be challenging to implement the legal provisions. The foremost thing is to ensure that the patients should be aware about not only the rights of medical professionals, but complexities and challenges we face in carrying out the medical procedures. Results will be much better if the communication gap between doctors and patients is minimised.”Dr Vitull Gupta, a health activist from Bathinda, was of the view that the legal shield should be made a permanent feature and not just for the pandemic period. “The Epidemic Diseases (amendment) Ordinance 2020 is half-baked as provisions will last only till the pandemic crisis is on. There is a need to introduce a central Act to safeguard doctors and paramedical staff under all situations. In case of an attack on the medical staff, the state should be a complainant and the victimised doctor could be the witness in the case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-boost-our-morale-medical-fraternity-welcomes-legal-shield/story-8LJaPegKkrW0KW9UnClm5N.html

All the ongoing work at the site has been stopped for safety reasons. The MSRDC engineers have been alerted about it. The ongoing work of the new bridge might be the reason for the eroding of the soil,” said Bharat Patil, ward officer, Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation.The traffic police immediately barricaded a portion of the bridge.“We barricaded around 20-foot area of the bridge so that vehicles steer clear of the portion. Although there are fewer vehicles plying on the road, we will take safety measure till engineers fix the portion of the bridge,” said Sukhdev Patil, senior traffic police inspector, Kalyan.An official from the MSRDC said, “We will check what caused the erosion and take measures to ensure safety at the bridge construction site.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/soil-concrete-chip-off-patripool-bridge/story-ZZZPC20PN6BPA9MqtZXluN.html

The matter came to light on Wednesday night, said officials. The migrants, from Palia Mafi village under Barkhera police station, had returned home from their places of work elsewhere. When villagers of Palia Mafi did not allow them to enter without undergoing medical screening, they went to the CHC.A number of other people quarantined in the district hospital campus in Pilibhit also attempted to escape by climbing down from an attic window using a rope made of bedsheets but their attempt was foiled by health staff.The migrants had been asked to wait till an ambulance arrived from the district headquarters to take them to their quarantine facility. “But when the ambulance got delayed, the migrants decided to sneak out. We have conveyed this information to Barkhera police station, requesting them to trace the migrants, said Dr S K Singh, the medical officer in-charge at Barkhera CHC. He said this could happen because of lack of police surveillance at the CHC.On the escape attempt by quarantined people in Pilibhit, additional chief medical officer Dr CM Chaturvedi said 50 people, who were quarantined at the district hospital campus, had attempted to flee on Tuesday night, but were thwarted by vigilant health staff.“We have now locked the quarantine centre from outside and the police have deployed two constables, each for 12-hourly shifts there, to prevent any untoward situations. Prior to this, police used to take a brief round of the campus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/taken-to-community-health-centre-for-screening-12-migrants-run-away-in-bareilly/story-AhZNLQlDLNgJaVB2ifVtoK.html

23-04-2020||City||Capt orders detailed audit of Covid-19 deaths||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday said he had ordered a detailed audit of every Covid-19 death by experts to understand and check the high mortality rate in the state.Giving this update to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi during a video conference, the CM said the state government was being guided by a group of experts in handling the Covid-19 crisis. The group comprises Dr KK Talwar, former director of the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh; Dr Raj Bahadur, vice-chancellor of the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Faridkot; Dr Rajesh Kumar, a former head of the School of Public Health at PGIMER; besides experts from John Hopkins University.Amarinder said the mortality numbers in the state were high largely due to co-morbidity and lack of health-seeking behaviour (patients come late to hospital). “Despite the high mortality rate of 6.2%, the rate of growth of Covid-19 in Punjab is lower than India, with the cases doubling in 16 days against the national average of nine days,” he said.The CM cited the example of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar as a case of effective containment. In the district, which was one of the first hotspots in the country, all 18 treated cases, besides the initial death of granthi Baldev Singh, had recovered and no case had been reported since March 26, he informed the party leadership.He also said that Punjab had to be compared with Kerala and Gujarat, which were also states with high NRI population. The state was doing significantly better than Gujarat, and in terms of cases per million population, even lower than Kerala (9/million in Punjab vs 12/million in Kerala), he pointed out.ASKS STATES TO SEEK BAILOUT PACKAGEAfter suggesting a three-pronged strategy to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bail out states from the COVID crisis, Amarinder has now urged his counterparts in all the states to pursue the matter with the Centre.Amarinder has written to the chief ministers of all the states to also approach the Prime Minister, urging him to consider the strategy he had suggested to combat the crisis. In his letters, he underlined the urgent need to request the Government of India to give a special 3-month COVID revenue grant with flexibility to states in spending as per local conditions. He has also urged the states to seek review by the Finance Commission of its recommendations for the current year since the ground situation had completely changed due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capt-orders-detailed-audit-of-covid-19-deaths/story-NL9Jnpx43slp7RVYo24ZeN.html
23-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai gets 117 new containment zones||The number of containment zones in Mumbai shot up by 117 between Tuesday and Wednesday, taking the total to 930 as of Wednesday evening, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The total number of Covid-19 positive cases in the city also increased by 522 on Thursday, taking the total to 4,205. Mumbai has seen a total of 167 deaths, with six new deaths recorded on Thursday.However, a presentation made by municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi and chief secretary Ajoy Mehta to the Centre said there are 771 containment zones in Mumbai. Explaining the difference, Pardeshi told Hindustan Times, “The number of containment zones increases every day, and fluctuates as some zones finish their 14-day quarantine period, and show no patients with symptoms.” Pardeshi confirmed that as of Wednesday evening, there were 930 recorded containment zones in the city. The G-South ward in Worli crossed the 500 Covid-19 positive cases mark, and recorded 507 cases as of Wednesday. The same data revealed that 62.8% (2,360) of the total cases in Mumbai fall in seven wards — G-South, E ward of Byculla, L ward of Kurla, K-West ward of Andheri West, F-North ward of Wadala, G-North ward of Dadar and Dharavi, D ward of Tardeo and Malabar Hill, and K-East ward of Andheri East.However, the silver lining is that most new cases are among people already quarantined by the BMC. “It is a good thing because it means we have been able to contain the spread to the area which is already a containment zone. In containment zones, there is rigorous contact tracing, testing, fever clinics, and strict lockdown,” said Pardeshi.Also, the BMC removed 187 containment zones from its list until Wednesday, as these are areas have finished their 14-day quarantine period and showed no new cases.The solution for BMC going forward is quarantining more people, who are contacts of Covid-19 positive cases. Another method of containing the outbreak in these areas is monitoring human movement with drone images. “We are flying drones every day, all the time, and carefully inspecting feed from them for any crowding, lathering, or even one or two stray humans walking around. Police or ward staff is immediately intimated, and these people are moved indoors. Food packets are delivered on time to ensure people are not prompted to venture out of home for any food.”Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G-North ward, said, “We are increasing our quarantine facilities and ensuring that our hotspot areas and containment zones have a regular supply of food and medicines.”Dharavi recorded 25 new cases and one death on Thursday taking the total count to 214 cases, and total 13 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-gets-117-new-containment-zones/story-TeppCdfqQZJzyyFUQHzp3M.html

Singh Sahib Giani Harpreet Singh will address this plea and give his verdict after discussing the matter with the heads of other Sikh temporal seats,” said Jaspal Singh, personal assistant to Akal Takht jathedar, Giani Harpreet Singh.Sialka, who has also been member of SGPC executive, was elected to the general House of the gurdwara management body on a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) ticket from the quota of Damdami Taksal, a Sikh seminary that has a militant background. The Taksal, however, has remained mum on the issue.SGPC members are upset at the entire controversy. “If the SGPC wants to back-track, and now blame the employees, then such employees should be demoted to a level where they will never have such power. For House member, Sialka, let Damdami Taksal answer,” said SGPC member Kiranjot Kaur. SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal and jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh have not commented on the issue.Strap/BlurbTwo other managers of Golden Temple transferred; trio had given a ‘siropa’ to the officer, who is an accused in 2015 Kotkapura police firing case||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sgpc-member-who-honoured-suspended-ig-umranangal-apologises-to-akal-takht/story-C2B2ORxiNrn0CFbHnsAMxK.html
23-04-2020||Mumbai||Palghar lynching: Congress links two accused in mob to BJP, saffron party denies claim||Maharashtra Congress on Thursday alleged that two of the 101 accused arrested in the Palghar lynching case are Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office-bearers and the saffron party was trying to communalise the episode for the political gain. The party also raised questions over the Centre’s alleged reluctance on enacting independent law on mob lynching despite a Supreme Court directive on the same. Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant, in a press conference on Thursday, produced documents to establish the claim that two of the Palghar lynching case accused are BJP office-bearers. Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday released the list of 101 accused arrested in Palghar mob lynching case. Sawant said that accused number 61 and 65 on the list, Ishwar Nikole and Bhau Sathe respectively, are local office-bearers of the BJP and were featured on party’s official Facebook page of Dahanu circle.“The two accused were felicitated by the BJP’s local office-bearers in a programme organised during Fadnavis government’s rule in the state. We have released the pictures of the programme establishing the identity. Not only the two but even few more accused in the Palghar lynching belong to the saffron party. The party has not taken any action against the accused, ” Sawant said.Sawant also questioned why the central government is sitting on the Supreme Court directives of enactment of a special law against mob lynching.“ Former chief justices of India, Dipak Misra in July 2018 and Ranjan Gogoi in July 2019 had directed the central government to enact the special law. Why is the Centre sitting on these directives for over two years? Union home minister, who was quick enough the call Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray after the Palghar lynching, has done nothing to enact this law,” he said.The BJP’s spokesperson Madhav Bhandari, however, said that the accused do not belong to their party. “Sawant’s claims are false and the Facebook page he is talking about could be fake. In fact, our allegation is that the police have booked the people who were not involved in to save the actual accused. How can there be 101 arrests when the number of people seen in the videos is not more than 50. Workers from Nationalist Congress Party and Left parties were present when the incident took place, but they have not been booked by the police,” he said. On April 16, three men — two seers and their driver — were dragged out of their vehicle outside Gadhchinchale village, located about 110 km from Palghar, and were beaten to death by a mob. The incident occurred when the victims were going from Mumbai to Surat to attend a funeral.The deceased were identified as 70-year-old Kalpvrush Giri, 35-year-old Sushil Giri and 30-year-old driver Nilesh Telgade. The seers belonged to Varanasi-based Juna Akhara and were slated to attend the last rites of their guru Mahant Shri Ram Giri in Surat.The gram panchayat of the village is with the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/palghar-lynching-congress-links-two-accused-in-mob-to-bjp-saffron-party-denies-claim/story-v83qlpaeGDw4uVDLCvF7OM.html
23-04-2020||Delhi||11 kids escape observation home after attacking caretakers, police||Eleven children fled from an observation home for boys at Delhi Gate in central Delhi, after allegedly attacking caretakers, private guards and police personnel on Wednesday evening, the police said. One of the boys returned to the observation home on Thursday, while the police are trying to locate and bring the others to the home, which is run by Prayas NGO, in collaboration with the Delhi government’s department of women and child development. A senior police officer, on the condition of anonymity, said that the incident took place around 7.30pm on Wednesday, when a caretaker was serving dinner to 13 children, aged over 15. They were brought from two separate correctional homes in north Delhi, to be kept in quarantine. “The children cornered and assaulted him with wooden sticks and other objects available to them. When the private security guards and another caretaker intervened, the children beat them up, vandalised some items, broke the main gate lock and fled,” the officer said. Four personnel of the fifth battalion of Delhi Armed Police tried to catch them, but the children allegedly attacked them as well and escaped. Five persons, including two caretakers, suffered minor injuries, the officer said.Amod Kanth, the founder of the NGO, said that apart from the 13 recently shifted children, there were around 20 more children aged below 15 staying at the facility for the last some months. “This home is meant only for children aged below 15. The 13 other children, who were shifted, were repeaters and hardened. They came with an intention to take advantage of the Covid-19 situation and escape. Our home manager had already requested the juvenile justice board that the older children should not be kept here. It was an unfortunate incident,” said Kanth. “Since the incident was related to juveniles, who cannot be kept in observation homes forcibly, no case can be registered. Only efforts can be made to bring them back to the home,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/11-kids-escape-observation-home-after-attacking-caretakers-police/story-SWhh3gPC1CK7XA0KwRoTCK.html

Bhupinder Singh Minhas, president of the Takht Sri Hazur Sahib Management Board, said, “Though the Punjab government is working to bring back the stranded pilgrims and has approached Union home minister Amit Shah and Maharashtra CM Udhav Thackeray, there is a confusion because all these things are verbal and we have not get anything in written.” “Still, we have arranged 15 buses and 15 Tempo Travelers which will leave for Punjab with nearly 1000 pilgrims aboard on Friday because the Punjab government has taken the entire responsibility of ensuring passage to them from Nanded. We have been advised by the Maharashtra government to not send the pilgrims in one go. We will be able to send them in groups”, he added.In a fresh tweet, the Punjab CM also requested his Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh counterparts Ashok Gehlot and Shivraj Chouhan to facilitate the pilgrims to travel through their states. As per the management, over 4,000 pilgrims are stranded at Nanded and are staying at serais there. “Everything we are hearing is from the online news channels. We have already spent money on booking train tickets twice for which no refund was made by the railways.

The government also prohibited private schools from hiking the tuition fees or introducing hidden charges in the fee, and asked the schools to to collect the tuition fee on a monthly basis.“Private schools should only collect monthly tuition fees. Payment of other funds such as building fund, maintenance fund, entrance fee, computer fee among other additional heads should be deferred in light of the unprecedented situation due to Covid-19,” stated the education department in a letter shared with district education officers across the state on Thursday. The department has also asked schools to not introduce any change in the uniforms and books.The government order also stated that schools cannot take any punitive action against students for non-payment of fees. “Schools should abide by the rules and ensure that no student’s name is struck off the roll or students are deprived of online classes due to non-payment of fee,” stated the department. The department also said that parents could share their grievances as per Rule 158-A of Haryana School Education Rules, 2003, if schools were found not complying with the directive.Pooja Mihani, a parent, said the order had brought relief to parents, and was an improvement over the previous orders. “The April 12 order said that schools could collect the monthly fee but it did not specifically mention tuition fee or anything about fees being charged under additional heads. The new order is definitely a source of relief, especially in the current financial situation where most people are facing pay cuts,” Mihani said.While some parents welcomed the order, others have sought a concession in the fees in light of the lockdown. “Most people are facing salary cuts, business is also getting affected. In view of all this, a 50% concession in tuition fees should be given,” said Himanshu Sharma, a parent, who is also a member of a consortium of parents who had earlier written to the chief minister seeking relaxation in fee payment. Sharma also added that the government had not said anything about the annual fee.Kailash Sharma, general secretary, Haryana Abhibhavak Ekta Manch, a parents’ body, said the government had only deferred the payment of fees, and schools would charge an exorbitant fee after the lockdown.On the other hand, schools said they could face a fund crunch soon and are having trouble paying salaries. Colonel (retired) KR Pratap Singh, president, Haryana Progressive School Conference, a consortium of private schools, said schools could come under financial strain if the deferment of complete fee payment continued for long. “While the administration is talking about a deferment of fees during the lockdown and not a waiver, schools will be badly affected if the transport charges are not collected on time as schools need to pay salaries of the employees engaged in running the buses. This fee deferment cannot be prolonged for too long,” said Singh. He added that some schools had failed to pay the complete salaries to employees due to financial hardships. “Schools might be able to manage till May with difficulty, but beyond June, they won’t be able to pay salaries to their staff which might pave way for retrenchment of employees such as drivers and conductors,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-prohibits-private-schools-from-hiking-fee-asks-to-charge-monthly-tuition-fee-only/story-obsyy51gVSx6AuPaQQU5LP.html
23-04-2020||Mumbai||HC stays publication of first merit list for PG medical courses||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday stayed the publication of Maharashtra’s first merit list for admissions to postgraduate (PG) medical courses that was to be published on Friday.Justice SJ Kathawalla passed the order on separate petitions filed by two PG aspirants through advocate Madhav Thorat. One of the petitioners, Dr Rajdeep Deshmukh, has sought admission to a non-surgical PG course through ‘physically handicapped’ category, as he is affected by congenital deformity, leading to the shortening of index and middle fingers of both his hands and toes.Dr Deshmukh moved HC after he was declared ineligible for admissions to the course. He contended that despite the deformity, his functional capacity of upper limbs is very strong and he is able to carry out all the routine activities without any difficulty.“In other words he does not have any functional impairment of upper limbs inasmuch as there is only shortening of the fingers and not absence of limb or fingers,” said his petition.Thorat pointed out that Dr Deshmukh was admitted to the MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) course through physically handicapped category, pursuant to the order passed by the HC. He further pointed out that the court allowed him to pursue medical education in spite of the deformity in upper limbs after experts said he can undertake general practice and can also choose non-surgical branch for PG studies.The other petitioner, Dr Abhinav Bhute, has challenged the government resolution (GR) issued by the medical education department on March 19 last year, granting only 4 ℅ of the additional weightage to in-service candidates who have rendered service in rural areas, instead of the 10℅ weightage given by the Medical Council of India (MCI).Thorat pointed out that the MCI had in April 2018 issued a notification granting 10℅ additional weightage per year of service, subject to cap of 30℅, to candidates serving in tribal areas, difficult terrains and rural areas.Bhute has served in rural areas for six years and accordingly sought 30℅ additional weightage last year. But when the department refused to give him the 30% weightage, he moved HC. The court had on March 12 last year directed the state government to extend additional weightage as contemplated by MCI notification to in-service candidates who have served in rural areas. But despite the HC’s direction, the department has refused to give the 30% weightage to Bhute, Thorat added.After assistant government pleader sought time to respond to the petitions, justice Kathawalla posted the petitions for further hearing on Monday and till then stayed release of the first merit list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-stays-publication-of-first-merit-list-for-pg-medical-courses/story-iw8EqZ8iKHSEeVNYOaYIPJ.html

The pumps, valves and pipes are out of shape, and need to be replaced. The immediate need is to rectify the problem of poor water quality,” said Dharamvir Yadav, a resident.Canal water is supplied to Mayfield Garden by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). The supply to the underground tank is distributed locally through a gridded distribution system. Locals said that a number of deficiencies in water, power and road infrastructure are yet to be fixed, due to which a takeover by the municipal corporation is pending.Colonel (retd) Santpal Raghav, a government-appointed administrator of the colony, said that he has been trying to resolve the matter since it arose and attributed the delay to the lockdown. “I would also like to point out that this problem is with only a few houses and the issue is being blown out of proportion. I have escalated the matter to government authorities as well,” said Raghav.Inder Singh, a resident, said the water supplied to some houses in N-Block has a foul smell and could not be used for drinking or other uses. “A group of residents on Wednesday had tried to check the fault themselves, with help of few repair workers, but could not resolve it,” said Singh.Raghav said that only 180 of the 700 families in the colony had paid their full maintenance dues. “Around 320 families have made partial payments and 100 don’t pay at all. In such a situation, how am I going to maintain the colony?” he said. Residents have contacted the authorities and the town and planning department, seeking action against the developer, for fixing basic amenities in the complex.A representative of the developer said that they have no role to play in this matter as maintenance is being done by the RWA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-of-mayfield-garden-s-n-block-complain-of-poor-water-supply/story-GeghNMMYOSgErdrybgKadO.html
23-04-2020||Gurugram||Cops rescue 150 daily wage workers being ferried in trucks; 5 arrested||The Gurugram police, on Thursday morning, arrested five persons from Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway for allegedly ferrying more than 150 daily wage workers in trucks from Ludhiana in Punjab despite restrictions on movement within or outside the state amid the ongoing lockdown for Covid-19, said the police.According to the police, the two trucks were transporting 75 daily wage labourers each to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. A sticker was pasted on the truck glass window that read, “Agriculture Farmer Pesticides” to avoid any checking, said the police.The police intercepted one of the two trucks near the Jhajjar border on KMP Expressway around 5am after receiving a tip-off. On checking the truck, the workers were found to be sitting inside with a canvas sheet placed over them to mislead the police.The police said there was no social distancing maintained and none of them had any masks. At least 75 workers were rescued and three persons, including the driver, were arrested from the first truck, said Deepak Saharan, deputy commissioner of police (Manesar).Another truck that was half a kilometre behind dropped the workers and his two co-drivers at KMP on seeing the police, and took a U-turn and drove off on the wrong side of the road, said the police. The police also said all the workers and the two co-drivers ran into a field. However, the police team chased and caught them.Saharan also said among those found in the truck, there were four women and three children.The workers were employed with private contractors, real estate developers, and electronic repair units in Ludhiana, the police said. They were allegedly abandoned by their employers after the lockdown was announced, said the police.The truck drivers had taken ₹2,000 each from the labourers and, while on their, way threatened them and extorted another ₹1,000 from them to ensure their safe passage.The police said the labourers were from Aurangabad in Bihar and Gorakhpur and Mahrajganj in Uttar Pradesh, nearly 1,200 kilometres away from Ludhiana, the police said.Saharan said that these workers used to live in Jeevan Nagar in Ludhiana. With the outstation bus and train services suspended, the truck drivers offered to drop them to their home towns in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, in exchange for money. “The drivers during the questioning said that they were charging the labourers only for the fuel cost and other expenses during the 1,200km journey. They wanted the money to pay the EMIs of the trucks and due to the lockdown they were under immense financial pressure,” he said.The police placed all the labourers and drivers under quarantine and distributed masks, gloves, and sanitisers among them. They were given breakfast and space was provided to them at the Manesar police lines to rest in accordance with the social distancing norms, the police said.Saharan said the workers revealed that after the lockdown was announced their employers had asked them to vacate the factories where they usually lived. Thus, they were heading back to their home town. “We will write to the officials in Ludhiana to ensure strict checking at the checkpoints, he said.A case under sections 384 (extortion), 188 (Disobedience), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270, 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and sections 51 and 51B of Disaster Management Act, 2005 at the Farukhnagar police station was filed .Police commissioner Muhammad Akil said that all the workers will be sent back to Ludhiana soon. “We have provided them with space to rest. Food is being prepared in the police station for them. Their medical check-ups are being conducted,” he said.Meanwhile, the police team of Sohna on Thursday intercepted an essential services trucks transporting six passengers. The passengers, mostly daily wage labourers, were trying to get back to their native places as they were stranded in the city. “We intercepted the vehicles and arrested them from the spot,” said Saharan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-rescue-150-daily-wage-workers-being-ferried-in-trucks-5-arrested/story-ojir6LU2j4qjIAF7o9oZqJ.html
23-04-2020||Mumbai||Aspirants may put foreign university plans on hold due to Covid-19||The Covid-19 lockdown has dampened the hopes of aspirants who want to study abroad. Many students who got their admission letters from the universities are still awaiting dates for start of their semesters. Aspirants are also apprehensive about classes going online.“I wanted to study abroad to experience their teaching methodology and their focus on practical projects over theory. However, this year most universities might go for online classes. If that happens, I would apply for the course next year,” said a 22-year-old student who aims to bag a seat in the MBA programme at George Washington University. She is currently pursuing her graduation in management from the University of Mumbai and has been saving to study abroad for the past two years by working part-time. “Meanwhile, I will also try applying for AIMS Test for Management Admissions (ATMA) and see if I can get through a good management institute in India,” she added. Simranjeet Singh Chawla, 26, from Borivli, has been accepted to the Master’s in Data Science course at the RMIT University in Melbourne for the July intake. While no official word has come from the university on the semester dates, he is weighing his options. “Even though my admission is confirmed, I’m still waiting for an official word on lectures and start of the semester from the university. If they are organising only online lectures for this semester then I might defer my admit to the February intake,” said Chawla. According to experts, students will take tougher calls about their prospects in the next few weeks. “Most students would want to experience studying abroad in the real sense and won’t go for online classes. I feel more students will take a break from studies this year and focus on getting work experience, if at all, or try to get through the same course next year,” said Abhijeet Kumar, a career guidance coach who runs a private firm in the city. Some students, however, are still hopeful of a shift in scenario by October. “I am scheduled to head to the UK in October on a scholarship. So far, I have not received any intimation of the academic year being postponed. There’s certainly a chance that they might move classes online but that won’t change much for me,” said Anish Gawande,23, a Rhodes scholar, scheduled to be at the Oxford University from October 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aspirants-may-put-foreign-university-plans-on-hold-due-to-covid-19/story-2KoT6ZLjwe82KB5OrlvKcJ.html
23-04-2020||City||Muslims in Nuh asked to stay indoors this Ramzan, not hold gatherings||With the month of Ramzan expected to begin on April 25, Muslims in the district will stay confined to their homes due to the nationwide lockdown. Due to the restrictions in place thanks to Covid-19, residents will stay indoors as they fast and offer special prayers.Arshad, a Nuh resident, said that Ramzan this year was going to be unlike any other that he had seen so far. “Every year, there is a lot of excitement for Ramzan. People step out to purchase special food items and meet and greet each other. Due to the unprecedented circumstances, the mood is dull, but we will pray at home for the betterment of society,” Arshad said.He added that the ulema (religious scholars) and elders of Nuh had collectively decided that the lockdown would be observed in accordance with the rules. Taraweeh (special prayers offered every night of Ramzan), an important aspect of Ramzan, will also be offered at home. “Every year, mosques are brimming with people, especially during the Taraweeh. We have been asked to offer Taraweeh at home. There will no gathering of any kind,” Arshad, who goes by his first name, added.Earlier this week, the Nuh administration met religious leaders and asked them to reach out to the Muslim community and reinforce the message of abiding by restrictions during Ramzan. The administration has assured residents that electricity supply will be maintained for the whole day and water will be supplied at homes through tankers.Mufti Zahid Hussain Qasmi of Nuh’s Badi Jama Masjid has appealed to residents and asked them to stay at home and observe the ritual fasts. “We are currently facing the coronavirus disease and the only way of escaping it is to maintain physical distance. No one needs to step out of their homes. People should offer Taraweeh prayers at home just as they are offering prayers five times a day,” Qasmi, who also asked people to pray for the eradication of Covid-19, said.Khalid Izak, Maulana, Darul Uloom Mewat, has advised residents to break their fast with family members since no Iftar gathering will be held. “This year, people will not be gathering together to break their fasts. People will be doing small Iftars at their respective homes. Gathering of people at mosques and other places for Iftar will not happen this time,” Khalid said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/muslims-in-nuh-asked-to-stay-indoors-this-ramzan-not-hold-gatherings/story-2e05tQPKX77i025JiO8chN.html

23-04-2020||Mumbai||42% Class 11, 12 students review career options in view of pandemic||With a lot of uncertainty surrounding future educational prospects, 42% of Class 11 and 12 students surveyed from across the country said they are reconsidering their career plans in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.The findings are part of a survey, wherein a total of 47,560 students from across the country were surveyed, recently conducted by Mindler, a career counselling and guidance platform. Given the postponement of entrance exams and deferred admissions in international universities, many students are now rethinking their career plans, revealed the survey.While 19% of the respondents had plans to go abroad, 78% said they were considering changes in their plans. “The ongoing pandemic has triggered scepticism about travelling overseas. Students, and their parents, are perhaps the most worried about attending an overseas university in such times,” read the report. Around 55% students said they would cancel their plans to study abroad altogether while 35% said they were planning to defer the plans for a year. 10% students said they were looking at other options. Nearly half the students who had planned to study abroad intended to go to the USA and UK.Students said there was a lot of anxiety and uncertainty due to the outbreak owing to which they were restless. Nearly half the students surveyed said they spent most of their time in procrastination and lethargy. With 66% of students showing positive inclination towards online entrances, it is a relief to universities as students seem comfortable with the idea of online evaluations. 79% students said they would be comfortable with online interviews if the need arises.Prateek Bhargava, Founder and CEO of Mindler, said, “While the ongoing crisis will have a long-lasting impact on every sector, for students and online education platforms the need of the hour is to give them the right direction so that their career plans are not disrupted. The end goal for all stakeholders would be to make sure that the learning process continues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/42-class-11-12-students-review-career-options-in-view-of-pandemic/story-KSDty0pnJ971edZA0aa0RJ.html
23-04-2020||City||Punjab ramps up corona testing, but still behind national average||CHANDIGARH: Punjab has ramped up the Covid-19 testing, but it is still way below the national average.The state, where the Covid-19 positive count rose to 287 on Thursday, has more than doubled the number of tests conducted to trace the coronavirus infection cases in the past two weeks amid a push for more testing. Against 108 samples tested per million of the population as on April 9, the figure stood at 266 tests per million on April 22, an increase of 147%, according to the comparative testing data of various states compiled by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the state health department.Despite the increase, the state’s testing numbers are not just below the national average of 344 tests per million of the population, it also trails behind some state experiencing similar-scale or lower outbreaks such as Haryana, Odisha, and Uttarakhand.Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Anurag Agarwal said the state was doing testing in a very scientific manner through extensive contract tracing as 80% of the positive cases were asymptomatic. “The situation in SBS Nagar and SAS Nagar (earlier known as Nawanshahr and Mohali, respectively) has been controlled through this strategy. We have increased testing substantially in the last one week. As testing capacity has got enhanced, more testing will be done in the coming days,” he said. Of the 7,716 samples tested so far, 3.6% have come out Covid-19 positive.STATE AHEAD INITIALLY, THEN FELL BEHINDPunjab was testing more samples than the national average till about 10 days ago as the number of Covid-19 tests conducted per million of the population stood at 151 against the national average of 138 on April 12. However, Punjab then fell behind as other states ramped up their testing faster subsequently. By April 22, neighbouring Haryana’s number of tests per million people climbed to 568 from 108 as on April 9 – an increase of 426%. In Odisha and Karnataka also, the number of tests per million have increased by 477% and 245%, respectively. Besides Punjab, other major states where the count of tests for the virus per million inhabitants is lower than the national average are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal. With 1,543 tests per million people, Delhi has tested a higher proportion of its population than any other state as per the ICMR data.Dr KK Talwar, former director of the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, said the state’s testing capacity was very low to start with but has been increased substantially since. “There are five approved government and private labs in the state and the process for approval of some others is underway. Constant efforts are being made to scale it up further. Pool testing will also improve the numbers but we are limiting it only to green zones,” said the renowned expert who is advising the state government on the health sector.44% TESTS IN ONLY 3 DISTRICTSThe three districts of Jalandhar, SAS Nagar and Ludhiana, two of these are among the hotspots with large outbreaks, accounted for 44% of the Covid-19 tests conducted until April 22. Of these, 1,364 tests have been conducted in Jalandhar where eight containment zones have been identified to curb the virus spread. Similarly, 954 samples have been tested in SAS Nagar from where 62, or say 22%, of the total 283 positive cases in the state have been reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-ramps-up-corona-testing-but-still-behind-national-average/story-H26Qf6lXkZ2cBwOrCmzwEK.html

Under this PMGKAY scheme, the Centre is providing 5 kg of foodgrains per person free of cost for three months. This is over and above 5 kg per person per month foodgrains distributed under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) to over 80 crore people in the country for Rs 2-3 per kg. Only 8.57 crore beneficiaries have been brought so far under the NFSA in Bihar, as against 8.71 crore people who are eligible, Paswan said in a tweet.The minister said he had already communicated this gap of 14 lakh to the state government on April 17. The Bihar government, Paswan said, has sent a beneficiary list of an additional 7.4 lakh people and requested to allot free foodgrains under the PMGKAY scheme.The minister said he immediately sanctioned allotment of foodgrains for these 7.4 lakh people. Paswan also requested Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to include the 14 lakh people who still do not feature in the beneficiary list of the NFSA, so that they can get the subsidised foodgrains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/additional-7-4-lakh-people-given-foodgrains-under-pmgkay-in-bihar-ram-vilas-paswan/story-ve25tpbmFQKyMiJHCUjbPL.html
23-04-2020||Lucknow||Prayagraj: Teachers cry foul over DIOS order making virtual teaching mandatory||Teachers of government-aided high schools and intermediate colleges of Prayagraj affiliated to UP Board are up in arms against a recent order issued by District Inspector of Schools (DIOS) warning of disciplinary action and adverse entry in service record of teachers who fails to form WhatsApp groups and virtually teach students during the lockdown.The teachers have threatened to move court against the order if it is not withdrawn.The DIOS-Prayagraj RN Vishwakarma, in a order dated April 21, had ordered teachers to connect all their students to a specially formed WhatsApp group and start teaching them through the medium from April 20. He had also conveyed that henceforth senior education department officials would also join these WhatApp and social media groups and monitor the teaching process.“Teachers who do not have smartphones can still guide and teach students through the regular mobile phones that they have. They can even motivate students to undertake self study and help them with support of their teaching colleagues who have smartphones. Online or virtual teaching of students is not optional for teachers but mandatory during the lockdown,” said Vishwakarma.All teachers were instructed to strictly adhere to their virtual teaching schedules.The order has irked the teachers who point out that it mistrusts them and also threatens them of adverse entry in their service record for failing to take interest in their work and duties while also talks of disciplinary action through the managers and management of their respective institutions.“The order is completely inappropriate and unjust. Many of our colleagues, especially the older ones do not have smart mobile phones and are not very comfortable on WhatsApp and social media etc. Moreover, we have a definite service rules that govern us and there is no provision that bounds us to teach virtually in it. If the order is not withdrawn, we may even move court against it,” said a senior teacher of a government-aided school in Prayagraj unhappy with the DIOS order.“Majority of teachers are themselves voluntarily taking virtual or online classes and such a threatening order is unacceptable. I urge officials not to intimidate the teachers or we will be forced to kick-start a demonstration to protest such attitude once the lockdown gets over,” said Suresh Kumar Tripathi, Teacher MLC (Allahabad-Jhansi)“Officials of state education department are on one hand sending misleading reports to the state government to earn a pat on their backs while on the other they are sending letters to school principals and college managements and threatening action against the teachers. All teachers are trying their best to help students in these trying times and if still any action is initiated against teachers, it would be strongly opposed and if needed we will also move court,” said Lalmani Dwivedi, state general secretary, UP Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh (Thakurai faction)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/prayagraj-teachers-cry-foul-over-dios-order-making-virtual-teaching-mandatory/story-WSkZljHFR0MvoXrNHzf2SM.html
23-04-2020||Mumbai||Indian researchers set to study Covid-19 link with loss of smell, taste||India has joined a global scientific consortium to draw a link between Covid-19 and a change or loss of sense of smell or taste – anosmia and dysgeusia – following tests from infected patients and observations of clinicians from various parts of the world since the outbreak of the pandemic.Four Indian research institutes have collaborated with the Global Consortium of Chemosensory Researchers (GCCR) to collect data via an online survey (http://gcchemosensr.org/) to find the connection between chemical senses and the novel coronavirus. The investigation will determine if anosmia is a reliable ‘early indicator’ of the disease, and when and how the change or loss of sense occurs. The Indian collaborators are also working on a self-assessment test to help monitor change/loss of smell and taste.Indian collaborators include National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TFIR), Hyderabad, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi, Coimbature-based Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, and CSIR- Central Scientific Instruments Organisation.Researchers said several studies from countries like China, Italy, UK, Belgium, France, Spain and the United States have shown a connection between changes in smell and taste and Covid-19 infection. In April, Harvard researchers in a yet-to-be peer-reviewed study in bioRxiv suggested that the novel coronavirus may be interacting with a certain type of cell inside the olfactory epithelium (tissue inside the nasal cavity) and not the actual neurons involved in processing smell.Shannon Olsson, who heads the Naturalist-Inspired Chemical Ecology group at the NCBS which is a centre of the TIFR, and is a collaborator, said the rate of occurrence for loss of smell and taste, however, varies widely in these studies, possibly because they used different methods.“Many other factors affect the senses of smell and taste such as other respiratory illnesses, medicines, lifestyle choices (smoking), genetics, and environment. These also differ within and between countries. Our survey has several questions designed to try and separate these factors,” said Olsson.She added, “To make the picture even more complicated, there are also genetic variations in Covid-19 viruses themselves in different regions, which could potentially change how they impact smell and taste.”The India team has translated the questionnaire into Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Marathi, Kannada, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bengali, and Urdu, with more languages planned. The objective of the common survey translated in local languages, said collaborators, is to compare the results across borders, find country-specific factors and support policy decisions for India and other countries worldwide.GCCR comprises over 600 clinicians, neurobiologists, data scientists, cognitive scientists, sensory researchers, and technicians from 50 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/indian-researchers-set-to-study-covid-19-link-with-loss-of-smell-taste/story-UBaUT7sf8VgYuoz9t2WeJM.html
23-04-2020||Mumbai||BMC starts mobile testing vans for sample collection of suspected Covid-19 patients||With many housing societies not allowing visitors inside their premises even for home testing for the coronavirus, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation(BMC) has now introduced mobile testing vans. These vans will be operated by private labs in the city and can collect swab samples at the gates of housing societies. Two private labs have so far signed up to provide this facility. The first such mobile testing van did a round at Vikhroli earlier this week. The vans will be requisitioned by the ward officers depending upon the requirement in the area. Civic officials said these vans can also be stationed at selected locations and those given appointments for testing can reach there in different time slots. Apart from this, BMC has three other alternatives like getting tested at private labs of civic-run hospitals, representatives collecting samples from homes and drive-through testing which has been started at 18 public parking lots. A BMC official said, “If going from gate to gate is too much, we can also decide a central location in a particular area where several people can be tested. Each person can be given a time slot for testing. With these vans, we can also go to different hospitals for collecting samples and getting them delivered.”P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “We are offering mobile van testing as an option for those wanting to make use of it. We can collect samples from entry and exit points of housing societies.”Meanwhile, SRL Diagnostics, associated with BMC, that has started mobile van testing in a statement said, “Mobile-testing facility is being used to fast-track sample collection for Covid-19 testing. Using this mechanism we would save time and energy of both patients and our personnel. The vehicle can be taken to any part of the city without much difficulty and thereby also ensures easy access...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-starts-mobile-testing-vans-for-sample-collection-of-suspected-covid-19-patients/story-qMo37GsTAVZs5aTNolHkNK.html

23-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 recovered couple says didn’t tell kin about the infection||A month after recovering from Covid-19, the first couple in Mumbai to be diagnosed has kept their illness and recovery a secret from relatives, fearing stigma. The Andheri-based couple spent 14 days in Kasturba Hospital and have recovered completely.The 70-year-old man and with his 69-year-old wife were diagnosed with Covid-19 on March 11. They were among those tested following contact tracing of the first patient from Pune. The couple told their son and daughter, both of whom live abroad, that they’d tested positive, but did not disclose this information to other family members.When the couple was admitted, there were 20 beds in the ward, but more were added in the 14 days that the husband and wife spent in Kasturba Hospital. The 70-year-old, who has a history of diabetes and hypertension, said he hadn’t felt afraid until the 11th day, when his condition deteriorated. “My wife had recovered earlier than me so she was shifted outside. I thought I would recover soon. But suddenly, I started vomiting. I thought I wouldn’t survive,” he said, adding that hospital staffers looked out for him when he was feeling low. The most unsettling day was when a Covid-positive patient passed away. “There was sudden noise in the ward,” he recalled. “I inquired with a nurse. She told me that a 65-year-old man had succumbed to the infection in the isolation cabin next to mine. A cold chill ran down my spine,” he said.The couple was discharged on March 24, after testing negative for the virus. Back home in Andheri, they isolated themselves for another 14 days. “The domestic help didn’t come and we were too weak to cook. So our neighbours provided all the help,” he said.More than a month after their recovery, the couple are yet to tell their extended family of their illness. “I come from a village where people don’t understand this disease is curable so I haven’t told them we were infected with Covid-19. Our family members will be stigmatised,” said the man, who is the first of his family to settle in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-recovered-couple-says-didn-t-tell-kin-about-the-infection/story-oPc8fnAw8bXdN3tJ8s5wyO.html

23-04-2020||Bangalore||1 Covid-19 death, 18 new cases in Karnataka, partial lockdown relaxations come into force||Results of over 3,000 random samples tested in ten coronavirus-free districts in Karnataka so far have returned negative results, the government said on Thursday as one more death was reported and 18 people tested positive for the contagion elsewhere. With the latest updates, the toll due to COVID-19 in the state has risen to 18 while the total cases to 445. The day saw the partial lockdown relaxations, allowing certain activities including in IT and ITES sectors outside COVID-19 containment areas, coming into effect that also led to traffic snarls in parts of the city. Joining states like Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka has made it mandatory for pharmacies to maintain contact details of customers who purchase drugs used for influenza like illness, the government said. Ten districts in the state so far continue to remain “corona free” and the government had asked the officials there to collect at least 100 samples each and screen them for the virus, Minister S Suresh Kumar, who is the spokesperson for COVID-19 in Karnataka said. “So far in 10 districts, 4,631 samples have been collected. Among them positives are nil so far. Negatives are 3,146, results awaited are 1,485,” he told reporters here. Late on Thursday, official sources said a 75-year old woman, who was among the 18 new COVID cases, died at a hospital in Mangaluru. Hailing from Bantwal, she had history of hypertension, stroke and pneumonia. Earlier, the health department bulletin said ten of the new cases were from Bengaluru Urban district, as its total infections breached the century mark and stood at 101. Fourteen patients were discharged after recovery on Thursday, taking the total number of people recovered to 145, the bulletin said adding there were 283 active cases in the state. Responding to question, Additional Chief Secretary- Health and Family Welfare Department Jawaid Akhtar said about 62 per cent of the patients who have tested positive and undergoing treatment in the state were asymptomatic. Among the 18 cases reported on Thursday, nine are contacts of a 54-year-old man, a labourer with a history of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI), who tested positive on Wednesday, while the other is contact of another patient earlier tested positive, here. Others are two each from Vijayapura, Hubballi in Dharwad district and Mandya; and one each from Bantwala in Dakshina Kannada district and Kalaburagi. In all, 17 out of the 18 fresh cases, including 13 men, are contacts of patients already tested positive, while contact of a woman from Vijayapura was being traced. Most number of cases have been reported in Bengaluru Urban district (101) followed by Mysuru (88) and Belagavi (43). As many as 2,798 samples were tested on Thursday, taking the total to 32,122 so far and of this 28,174 reported negative with the day’s tally at 2,750. A slum in Hongasandra municipal ward in the city has become a COVID-19 hotspot and has been completely sealed after some people contracted the coronavirus from a migrant labourer. Kumar also said the state government has issued a notification making it mandatory for chemists and Druggists to maintain a list of customers who purchased certain drugs used for Influenza Like Illness or Severe Acute Respiratory Infection along with their contact details. Earlier, governments in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha have issued such advisories to chemists in their states in a bid to ensure that people are not hiding symptoms of coronavirus. As the relaxations in the lockdown came into effect, officials sources said Information Technology and IT Enabled Services (ITES) companies, that have been allowed to function, will work out the essential minimum staff requirement and mobilise them. Besides these, certain construction activities, manufacturing of packaging materials, courier services, ice cream and juice shops, flour and dal mills, recharge facilities for pre-paid mobile connections, shops of educational books for students are among the services that figured in the relaxations announced. All these activities will be permitted only outside COVID-19 containment zones, the government has made it clear. As parts of the city witnessed large scale traffic movement, opposition Congress criticised the government, accusing it of proper planning. “Announcement of partial relief to ease Lockdown by @BSYBJP has created chaos in #Bengaluru today. Massive traffic jams are reported across city with confusions & no proper guidelines. This shows lack of co-ordination in Governance with improper planning,” it tweeted. Meanwhile, taking into consideration inconvenience faced by renal patients in view of 23 government hospitals offering dialysis services having been designated COVID-19 facilities, it has been decided to use 45 private hospitals for them as per the cost prescribed under the Ayushman Bharat-Arogya Karnataka scheme. The government has also issued a circular for resuming immunization services at all health facilities except in containment zones and follow strict infection prevention and control measures and social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/1-covid-19-death-18-new-cases-in-karnataka-partial-lockdown-relaxations-come-into-force/story-ve2N1mKQmN4tSsRk8ph9QK.html

The 13-storey Vivaan Heights has numbered chairs as per the flat numbers and lined them in the society’s lobby. Delivery persons are asked to leave the essential items on the chair from where the members can collect it. The building has a total of 48 flats. Dr Umesh Kapuskar, chairman of the society, said that they have enforced the system since the lockdown was announced. “This way, we do not allow any outsider to enter the building premises,” said Kapuskar adding that they have also closed one of the two entrances of the building. Kapuskar, who practices in Kalyan, said that the building committee collectively arrived at this decision when the state government had announced the lockdown. He also said that most of the members have not left the building premises since the lockdown was imposed.

The Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP) government have already made provisions to bring back students stuck in the coaching capital of India.On behalf of the students, 18-year-old Aditi Thorat from Solapur has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray as well as other ministers and legislators. Students have also been sending messages on social media to the state authorities to take a cue from the UP and MP governments.“The number of cases in Kota has been on the rise. We are staying in hostels and paying guest accommodations where we interact with mess and other staff. We are scared of contracting the disease,” said Thorat, who is in Kota to prepare for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET). Every year, thousands of students from different parts of the country go to Kota to prepare for various competitive exams. With the nation under lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, students have not been able to return home.Last week, the UP government sent around 300 buses to retrieve students stuck in Kota, and soon after, the MP government followed suit. The Maharashtra government has made no such announcements yet.“The situation is becoming grimmer every day. I stay at a paying guest accommodation and since all mess facilities are shut, my roommates and I are not able to get proper food. We have been surviving on biscuits and packaged food. We hope the Maharashtra government comes to our rescue,” said 18-year-old Om Ghadling from Buldhana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-000-students-stranded-in-kota-plead-for-govt-help/story-nKgatvt5wXJSb7TO7bUGNI.html

23-04-2020||City||Delhi child rights body launches campaign to fight hunger, malnutrition||New Delhi: The Delhi Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has started a programme to help children whose parents have lost work during the nationwide lockdown, which has been in place since March 25, to control the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).As part of the ‘Delhi Against Malnutrition’ campaign, the commission is providing support to children up to the age of 6 from families of out-of-work daily wage labourers. The DCPCR regularly stores data of poor children. The DCPCR has also joined hands with the Centre For Advocacy and Research (CFAR), an NGO that works with marginalised communities, to distribute milk packets to these children on a daily basis.Covid-19 continues to spread in the national capital, where the contagious disease has so far infected 2,248 people, and killed 48.Around 2,000 families are being benefited by the initiative, which began last week, on a daily basis.DCPCR member Ranjana Prasad said the commission has curated a list of food items for children based on the nutritional values of each product and suggested distribution of the same through Anganwadis and food distribution centres.“Based on the list DCPCR has created nutritional kits for children, which includes but is not limited to baby food, milk (fresh/powdered), energy biscuits, and distributing them among the underprivileged families on need basis,” she said.Prasad said the commission has also partnered with private companies that produce and sell eatables to channel their products to these children, to ensure a continuous supply of nutritious food.“We have also provided 10,000 packets of glucose biscuits to the district magistrate’s offices in all the districts of Delhi. The commission is also sending cornflakes and biscuits packets to the government’s hunger relief centres across the city,” she added.Juhi Jain, CFAR’s senior programme specialist said the NGO had identified children from poor families, whose parents neither have cash reserves nor wages to afford a daily supply of milk.“Relief agencies had so far probably overlooked milk as a food item necessary for children, but DCPCR immediately used its networks to arrange the same for children in our project areas,” Jain said.The areas of distribution include Mazdoor Kalyan Camp, Okhla, JJ Camp Anand Vihar; Transit Camp Khichdipur; B 45 Sanjay Camp; Gautampuri; Lal Kuan, D Block JJ Camp, and Indira Kalyan Vihar.The initiative brings relief to many parents struggling to provide milk to their children amid the lockdown.Jyoti, a mother of two children , said, “My husband is a daily wage worker and I do domestic work. We have both lost our jobs and have limited cash reserves to take care of our daily needs. The government and relief agencies are providing dry ration kits, but no milk powder or any other nutritional supplements for our children. We, therefore, had to feed our children rice, dal, and water.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-child-rights-body-launches-campaign-to-fight-hunger-malnutrition/story-G6SLDxidlqJOa61RxIioYM.html

23-04-2020||Delhi||Sexually abused minor’s four-year struggle comes to an end||It has been a long, arduous journey for a 17-year-old girl who went missing from her home in an Assam village four years ago. She is a victim of trafficking and sexual abuse, is HIV positive and has been pregnant. The girl was rescued from the New Delhi Railway Station last month, was able to terminate her pregnancy last week and is now waiting to return home once the nationwide lockdown is lifted. The nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has been extended till May 3. According to the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), the minor was rescued from the railway station on March 5 by an NGO when her medical examination revealed that she was 12-weeks pregnant. A Zero FIR was registered in Delhi and the case was transferred to Assam’s Gauripur police station. “The girl, in her statement (under Section 164 of the CrPc), said that she was taken from her village by her 60-year-old neighbour. He took her to Punjab where he handed her off to another person. She said she was sexually abused for two years continually. She managed to escape and reach Delhi and has been living at the railway station,” Jyoti Rathi, member, DCPCR, said. As per her medico-legal case report, the minor was again abused at the railway station by a stranger about three months ago, she added. “It was a challenge to locate the girl’s family to get their consent to terminate her pregnancy, which is necessary in the case of minors. As per the law, a pregnancy can be terminated only up to 20 weeks. We wrote to the Assam state child protection commission to locate her family at the earliest,” the member said. Meanwhile, the girl was medically assessed to check if she was fit to undergo the termination. A team of doctors submitted their report to the concerned child welfare committee (CWC) looking into the case and later to the commission. On April 1, the commission facilitated a conversation between the minor and the district child protection officer (DCPO), Assam where she told them about her family and the village she is from.“It took a few days to locate her family. A missing complaint had been filed by them. On April 4, I visited the girl’s house with staff,” Kishori Baruah, district social welfare officer and probationary officer/DCPO, Dhubri, Assam, told HT over the phone. Baruah added that the girl is from a poor family. Her mentally ill father passed away some years ago. She lived in the village with her mother and four siblings off a small patch of land here. “We organised a video call for the girl and her mother. The mother gave her consent for the termination of pregnancy, which was sent to the commission,” she said. Following the mother’s consent and on the orders of the CWC, on April 13, the minor was admitted to a government medical facility for the termination of pregnancy, which was done successfully. She was discharged last week. “However, during the medical assessment, we found that the minor was HIV positive. After the termination, we arranged for her to stay at a shelter home run by an NGO until the lockdown is lifted and she can go home. All the girl wants is to go back home,” Rathi said.

23-04-2020||Noida||Noida police urge people to beware of Covid related cyber frauds, issue advisory||The Gautam Budh Nagar police department has urged the public to beware of cyber fraud cases amid the ongoing lockdown and has also advised people to steer clear of any suspicious messages and links that offer “free tests”.Police said there have been a few cases wherein people have been defrauded of money after clicking on such links.“It is not a very significant number but there have been isolated incidents. Some people have also lost money to a fake PMCares fund ID. The idea of issuing the advisory is to ensure that such cases don’t pick up in the days to come,” Ashok Kumar Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, said.According to police, most of these frauds are perpetrated through social media sites and range from fraudsters asking for money from victims as a fee for conducting a medical test to determine Covid-19 or by cloning the social media ID of a person and then asking that person’s friends and relatives for money citing some difficulty. In some cases, the fraudsters offer free telecom recharges, police said.“If any demands for money are made through social media, people should verify if the information is true and only make any money transfer. Also don’t clicks on links send via text messages, offering free recharges or free services,” the advisory issued by the district cyber cell said.The advisory further said unverified messages or links related to Covid-19 medical tests or provision of essential services should be ignored. On April 18, an engineer was duped of ₹1.5 lakh in the name of donating to a relief fund. According to the complainant, he received a call and the caller asked if he would want to donate money help those in distress and the engineer agreed. The fraud happened in eight instalments and a case was registered at the Sector 39 police station. In another incident, a Sector 77 resident was duped of ₹80,000 on the pretext of online delivery of liquor after he clicked on an ad on a social media site. The victim had placed an order for ₹6,200 after which he was sent a QR code. The fraud happened after the code was scanned and a case was later registered at the Sector 49 police station. In the district, most cyber fraud cases are related to unified payments interface (UPI) and KYC of e-wallets, followed by fake offers of lottery and jobs. The third most reported offence is bogus ATM withdrawls. In 2019, the cyber cell received 3,050 complaints related to various online frauds. When the commissionerate was formed in January, cyber crime became a special focus area and the department was working on revamping the cell before the lockdown was put in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-police-urge-people-to-beware-of-covid-related-cyber-frauds-issue-advisory/story-AR55xF3up9X7eRVOkWmHEL.html

The officials said after sealing the Noida-Delhi borders, the next step to halt the spread of the coronavirus is to test the vendors who are supplying essential goods to the residents in the district. Officials said if vendors contract the deadly infection, they can act as carriers and the virus can spread to others.“We have decided to test vendors for coronavirus to ensure they are not infected with the virus as they are engaged in delivering supplies, often door-to-door, in Noida and Greater Noida areas. The state government has asked us to test the vendors who are supplying essential goods amid the lockdown. If the state government will ask us to test others who are engaged in essential services, then we will follow the orders immediately and make arrangements for their tests too. Our objective is to completely break the chain of the virus spread,” said Narendra Bhooshan chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority, and officer-in-charge for Covid-19 in Gautam Budh Nagar.The health department is likely to start testing the vendors soon.“We will start testing all vendors in the next one or two days. We are in the process of making arrangements for conducting the tests,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.The Noida and Greater Noida authorities have registered all vendors supplying essential goods in Noida and Greater Noida, respectively amid the lockdown. At least 900 vendors in Noida and 700 vendors in Greater Noida are authorised to supplying vegetables, fruits, medicines, etc to households during the lockdown. The district has 33 hot spots, where vendors are delivering supplies at doorstep, while in other areas essential goods are being delivered at gates of housing societies, said officials.The officials added that they will also ensure that all vendors wear masks and gloves to ensure they don’t contract the infection and do not spread it to others.All top officials of the Noida authority, the Greater Noida authority, and the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) have been told to brief their staff to follow all safety guidelines while distributing food or ration at shelter homes and distribution centers in their respective areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-to-test-vendors-supplying-essential-goods-to-residents-during-lockdown/story-Hk98kt4TmYnwDM1Ez0dZNN.html
23-04-2020||City||Ludhiana Hand Tools Association moves SC against GOI orders to pay full wages to workers amid lockdown||The Ludhiana Hand Tools Association has moved the Supreme Court against direction issued by the central government to pay full wages to workers amid lockdown. The petition has been filed challenging the validity of Section 10(2)(l) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and for setting aside clause (iii) of order issued by the ministry of home affairs under this section on March 29,2020. The order directs all the employers to pay full wages to its workers, without any deduction, during the lockdown period. The association alleged that the orders issued by the Union government also violates Articles 14 (equality before law),19 (freedom of expression) and 300A (persons not to be deprived of property save by authority of law) of the Indian Constitution and the Industrial Disputes Act, 1948.The petition has been filed by advocate Rajeev M Roy on behalf of 41 members of the association, including various sole proprietorship firms, partnership firms and private limited companies, engaged in manufacturing and distribution of hand tools.President of the association, Subhash Chander Ralhan, said that with this petition, the association has contended that the Disaster Management Act, 2005, does not empower the Government of India to direct the private establishments to pay full wages to its workers during the lockdown. The government orders violates Article 14,19 and 300A of the Constitution of India and it is also in violation of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1948, which provides for payment of 50% wages under natural calamity, he said. Ralhan said that the Union government had issued the order in undue haste and without considering financial ability of private establishments to bear the burden of full wages during this period of crisis. The petition further contended that hundreds of crores of unclaimed provident fund and Employees State Insurance Corporation contribution is lying in banks attracting interest and union government is enjoying benefit out of it. Instead of using this contribution of the industry towards the welfare of workers/employees, the direction to private establishments to pay full wages by the Government of India is completely arbitrary and unreasonable.Ralhan said that the government order does not provide any clarification in respect of its applicability to workman class or to all employees of all private establishments, otherwise this will have grave financial implications on all private establishments.Further, the association has sought a declaration from the court that Section 10(2)(l) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, in the event it confers power on the Central Government to direct private establishments to make full payments of wages to the employees during the lock-down period, as being illegal, arbitrary and violative of articles 14, 19(1)(g), 265 and 300A of the Constitution. In the alternative, it is sought by the association that the court should hold that Section 10(2)(I) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, does not empower the central or state government or any authority to direct the private establishments to pay full wages during the period of lock-down.Earlier also different industrial organisations, including the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) and All Industries and Trade Forum had raised hue and cry over the orders issued by the government claiming that they are not in condition to pay wages due to lockdown, but they will take care of labourers in these times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-hand-tools-association-moves-sc-against-goi-orders-to-pay-full-wages-to-workers-amid-lockdown/story-QnUPzVITIF6WT0ab0Wf7hN.html

Hospital staff was not ready to touch his body in the absence of PPE, which delayed the procedure.”Dr Pinakin Gujjar, dean of RN Cooper Hospital, said, “Without police personnel, we cannot hand over dead bodies. We informed police at night, but they came late.” Refuting these allegations, Pandharinath Wavhal, a senior inspector of Juhu police station, said, “We have deployed our staff at each COVID ward. The hospital administration should check before making such allegations.” The last rites were performed around 1:30pm.

There is a huge scope for the bicycle industries and e-vehicles, including e-bikes, e-rickshaws and e-loaders, in post lockdown period, said Pankaj Munjal.“After the lockdown gets over, the industry needs to focus on direction rather than speed. Focus should be on the objectives and the industry should aim for bull’s eye,” said Rohit Mehra.FICO bicycle division head Harpal Singh Bhamber said that due to the Covid-19, the world is looking for a manufacturing alternative to the Chinese bicycle market and India being the second largest manufacturer of bicycles in the world has a huge opportunity to capture the export orders of Europe and United States of America.Post lockdown, the industry should concentrate on the cycle valley project and develop high end products for the international markets, said FICO president Gurmeet Singh Kular. Meanwhile, raising concern over the government’s guidelines for the industry owners if any employee is found positive for the virus, FICO general secretary Rajeev Jain said that as per the guidelines of the Union home affairs ministry, if any employee in a factory is found positive with coronavirus, there is a direct conviction and criminal proceeding for the owner, which is totally wrong and unjustified. Rather, the government should cover Covid-19 under the Employees’ State Insurance (ESI), and treat the employees at ESI hospitals if found positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/post-lockdown-huge-scope-for-the-bicycle-industry-and-e-vehicles/story-Gq8YVn3nbjVf8rMyuYyVpK.html

While patients and chemists say medicines are becoming scarce, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said concerns of shortage were baseless and blamed the unavailability on problems in the delivery chain. Parel-resident Vidyut Shah has been searching for anti-depressants, which have been prescribed for a family member, but could not find the medication either at local chemists or online. After days, he was able to source a few strips and has now ordered three months’ supply online to avoid this situation in the near future. Nilesh Chiplunkar, who works as a manager at a chemist in Parel, said supplies of medicines have been erratic during lockdown. “Generally, all medicines are in shortage,” said Chiplunkar. Gastroenterologist Dr Ameet Mandot said his patients were also unable to get prescribed medication. “I am giving substitute medicines in such cases,” said Mandot.Retailers say the problem is in the supply chain. “Chemists are going out of their way to ensure regular supply and are themselves lining outside wholesalers’ and getting their supply,” said Prasad Danave, president, Retail Drugs and Chemists Association (RDCA). He also said wholesalers are refusing to give medicines on credit and demanding cash payment, which makes procuring medicines difficult for many retailers.However, the FDA maintained that there is adequate stock. “We have a stock of three months and patients need not worry about shortage. Such are localised issues due to problem of manpower, but the overall situation is normal. We have taken adequate precautions to ensure no one is deprived of medicines,” said FDA commissioner Arun Unhale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-lockdown-chemists-allege-shortage-of-meds-fda-dismisses-claim/story-DexJRPsmBuFGEzk4DBbm5I.html

She had been waiting in the step-down unit of the Covid-19 facility of Christian Medical College and Hospital since Monday, however, no one turned up to take her home. The woman’s son stated that as she was a victim of a pandemic and as there was no vaccine to cure the decease, the government should pay the hospital’s outstanding bill of Rs 4.77 lakh.

They claim that despite the risk, the administration is forcing them to attend to patients.Medical colleges under BYL Nair and King Edward Memorial (KEM) hospitals have already reported cases of infection among resident doctors, nurses, and staffers. But Sion hospital is the only civic-run medical facility where the number of infections has gone up to 17, with 19 others being quarantined.Though infected students have been kept in isolation wards, the nursing students claimed that the hospital is risking their lives by violating safety rules.“In the initial days, we were given duty in the non-Covid ward, without protective gear like N95 masks or other personal protective equipment (PPE). Soon, the infection started spreading from asymptomatic patients and now, the cases have gone up to 17,” said a second-year student from the general nursing and midwifery (GNM) course.Being the nearest civic-run hospital to the Dharavi, Sion hospital has received the highest number of Covid-19 cases from the slum, which has already reported 214 infected people.Students have alleged that due to the shortage of staff, quarantined students are being forced to take care of patients. “High-risk contact students were tested on the ninth day of quarantine. But as their reports came back negative, they are being forced to work. They were not allowed to complete the 14-day quarantine period. Now, two of them have started showing symptoms,” said an 18-year-old first-year student.The students said that social distancing is not feasible in their hostel with 275 women sharing rooms and bathrooms with quarantined students. “If my roommate gets infected, I will certainly contract the virus due to the congestion to students showing symptoms,” the student said, adding that the hostel has not been fumigated yet. “We are mere students with no health insurance. We don’t mind the work but we should be provided with safety kits,” said another student.Dr Ramesh Bharmal, director of major hospitals, said, “Due to staff crunch, the students have been pulled in but they have been given duty in non-Covid wards.” An official from the United Nurses Association, said, “Nurses play an important role in taking care of Covid-19 patients. If the authority can’t provide safety to the frontliners then they shouldn’t admit patients. A medical system can’t function without nurses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sion-hospital-nursing-students-forced-to-work-without-ppe-social-distancing/story-DOLg4FyEN29BojveLAlFCN.html

The petitioner has also prayed for provision of ambulance services for both Covid-19 and other ailments as well as directions to the authorities to announce the area wise list of hospitals providing treatment for Covid-19 and other ailments for the benefit of the common man. The PIL filed by advocate Mutahhar Khan has cited the instances of persons approaching various hospitals for availing treatment of non-Covid-19 related ailments but being turned away on the grounds that the hospitals have been ordered by the state health authorities to singularly dedicate its facilities for combatting the pandemic. Khan has said that after he came across media reports about the same, he verified it independently too and found hospitals refusing to admit non-Covid patients.Khan has further pointed to the fact that ambulance services have become scarce as a result of which the needy persons are suffering.In light of the above averments, Khan’s PIL has prayed for directions to the state and health authorities to provide sufficient facilities for persons suffering from non Covid-19 ailments in hospitals and to provide ambulances and announce list of hospitals for the benefit of the common man. The PIL is expected to come up for hearing on April 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pil-complains-of-lack-of-non-covid-hospitals-ambulances/story-CutsFBNhnjz4Qw8nXeB77H.html

Measures like social distancing are the need of the hour in our collective fight against the pandemic.”“All members must observe ‘roza’ and ‘iftar’ and perform ‘namaz’ and ‘taraweeh’ (night prayer said during Ramzan) inside their houses. The devotees will get the same blessings at their homes which they get in the mosques during the time of fasting and prayer,” said Maulana Ashrafi.Maulana Hameed Nadwi said, “Many of our top religious scholars have given their view that Ramzan must be observed in the houses and nobody should venture out during the holy month. The Muslim community must follow all the guidelines of the government and cooperate with the police and health department with regards to reducing the spread of Covid-19 in society.”“The community has stayed indoors during the entire month and will stay indoors during Ramzan as it in the larger interests of the society,” he said.Qari Idrees, a cleric from the city, said, that the Ulema has unanimously appealed to the Muslim community to observe the holy month indoors and have cited Quranic references for observing ‘roza’ and ‘namaz’ inside the house. “During the lockdown, the Muslim community will be observing the rituals inside their houses and nobody will be coming to the mosques. The appeal has been sent through various channels of communication to the community,” said Idrees.Saleem Mulla, a social worker, said, “ The Muslim community in the city will diligently follow the directions of the state government and the Ulema Council while observing the holy month of Ramzan. We have been actively working for spreading awareness about the same and the community has responded to the call of the Ulemas and the government.”“We will jointly work with the government in curbing the spread of Covid-19 in the city,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/religious-leaders-scholars-call-for-home-ramzan-prayers/story-I7yRel3jPvzzIDROJsSKrN.html

23-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh RPO official granted bail in graft case||Observing that an accused incarcerated for a long period may end up like Dr Manette in Charles Dicken’s novel “A Tale of Two Cities”, who had forgotten his profession and even his name in the Bastille, the special court of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has allowed the bail application of Rajiv Khetarpal, assistant superintendent at the Regional Passport Office (RPO), Sector 34, Chandigarh, in a graft case.CBI special judge Sushil Kumar Garg pronounced the order over a WhatsApp video call.Khetarpal and one Balinder Singh, a resident of Kumaun Colony, Nayagaon, Mohali were arrested by the CBI in March for allegedly accepting ₹30,000 bribe for renewal of a passport.“Detaining of the accused behind the bars is not likely to serve any purpose... Often this (concluding of trial) takes several years, and if the accused is denied bail but is ultimately acquitted, who will restore so many years of his life spent in custody?” observed the court, while ordering the accused to furnish personal bond of ₹50,000 before the Burail jail superintendent, who will submit it in the court as and when the court reopens.THE CASEOn March 2, an FIR was registered under Section 7 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The complainant, Jagdeep Singh, said that on January 27, he had submitted an application through online RPO portal for renewal of his passport. Singh telephonically contacted Balinder, who sought ₹25,000-30,000 bribe, threatening “to delay infinitely or reject the renewal file.”The CBI had laid a trap and caught Balinder while accepting the bribe “on behalf of” Rajiv Khetarpal. Balinder was asked to make a call to Khetarpal and inform him about the bribe amount, following which he was caught the next morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-rpo-official-granted-bail-in-graft-case/story-FxsgKspUpFpnTvXOTlvWYP.html
23-04-2020||Chandigarh||Curfew in Chandigarh: Zone allocation for utility services ‘faulty,’ far from home, say repairmen||Though the Chandigarh administration has allowed utility service providers to visit clients’ homes to make life easier for residents under lockdown due to Covid-19, it appears to have inconvenienced electricians, plumbers and air-conditioner repairmen here.Many service providers authorised by the administration to operate in six zones in the city have been allotted areas far from their homes, making movement difficult in a curfew and that too with the virus outbreak.Vikas Kumar, who has been assigned to handle plumbing jobs in zone 1 for Sectors 1 to 13, Kaimbwala, Khuda Jassu and Kishangarh villages, is a resident of Sector 48. “It doesn’t make sense for me to go all the way to Manimajra now, especially in these times when it’s best to travel short distances,” he says. Other plumbers too allocated this zone have a problem, as Surinder Singh lives in Sector 48 and Angrej Singh in Maloya.Electrician Himanshu Gosain has been allocated zone 2, comprising Sectors 14 to 17, 22 to 25, Dhanas and Sarangpur. “I live in Sector 38, yet I have been assigned areas that are far from home. We have to bear travel costs and customers will accordingly have to pay up if we have to move long distance,” he says.Shiv Mohan Singh, allotted zone 3 with Sectors 18 to 21, 27 to 30, Mauli Jagran, Daria and Raipur Kalan, lives in Sector 41, “right at the opposite end of where I’m supposed to go,” he says.REPAIRS INEFFECTIVE AS MARKETS CLOSEDAnother problem that the service providers have is that though they are receiving 20 to 30 calls a day, many of them can’t do much as parts are unavailable because markets are closed.Parwinder Singh, an AC repairman in zone 3, says gas refills for ACs are unavailable. That is the reason why, says Sukha, an electrician in zone 6, that they were only attending genuine emergencies even though they were receiving many complaints.Commenting on the matter, UT chief engineer Mukesh Anand said, “Distance is a trivial issue. What matters most is fixing people’s issues. In two days, we have solved 475 complaints and have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/curfew-in-chandigarh-zone-allocation-for-utility-services-faulty-far-from-home-say-repairmen/story-ukPYlfnVb2SByXPb8qlPgK.html

The zone-wise screening process will begin from April 27 and the sweepers will be screened first. Currently, there are around 7,000 class-IV employees in the MC including the contractual staff.MC health officer Jasvir Kaur said that the decision has been taken to ensure safety of the field workers. During this process, thermal screening would be conducted to check fever and the employees would be asked if they have Covid-19 symptoms.Meanwhile, the schedule for the screening is being prepared, she added.“The decision has been taken as a precautionary measure. The civic body employees especially the sweepers come in contact with many residents while working in the field. Also, the MC employees have been involved in sanitisation of houses and areas from where Covid-19 positive cases have been reported, therefore it is necessary to screen our field workers,” MC secretary Neeraj Jain said.There is also fear among the MC employees after assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Anil Kohli, district mandi officer Jasbir Kaur, SHO Basti Jodhewal police station Arshpreet Kaur among others, had tested positive for COVID-19 couple of days ago. It is suspected that ACP Kohli who died after getting infected with the virus, had contracted it while he was deputed at the main vegetable market near Jalandhar bypass.Earlier in the mid of April, the fire brigade also conducted screening of over 100 staff members and quarantined two fire fighters as a precautionary measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-mc-to-conduct-screening-of-field-staff-from-monday/story-GQFVCBzAs04yC5oJKUvGTK.html

Led by the leader of opposition in general house, Harbhajan Singh Dang, the councillors assembled at Zone D of the MC on Thursday to make the announcement. Dang said they will demonstrate outside the DC’s house on Monday if the administration fails to streamline the distribution.The councillors alleged that the administration is working in connivance with the congress leadership, which is providing ration through only their leaders . They said the Congress leaders were being selective and providing ration only to their friends and family, while the general populace of the district is facing shortage of food and is busy making the rounds of councillors’ office. They also claimed that the helpline number -1905- is also not working properly.Harbhajan Dang, BJP councillors’ leader Sunita Rani and SAD councillor Jaspal Giaspura claimed that in their meeting with mayor Balkar Sandhu on Monday, the mayor had assured that ration would be delivered to the councillors by Wednesday. However, nothing has been provided and the mayor is now asking the councillors and the residents to dial 1905 for ration. LIP leader Swarandeep Chahal said that the Congress leaders are asking for voter cards before distributing ration and are providing it only to those who voted for the party. SAD councillor from ward number 2, Gurmail Singh Jajji, had also staged a protest against the alleged pick and choose policy in his ward last week.Punjab food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister and MLA (Ludhiana west), Bharat Bhushan Ashu, refuted the allegations. Ashu said that DC Agrawal is monitoring the distribution of ration in the district and it is being supplied through block level officers and other staff members. He said that if residents are facing any problem, they can contact the elected representatives, administration or give a call at 1905.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/anomalies-in-ration-distribution-councillors-of-oppn-parties-to-protest-outside-dc-s-house/story-DwyZ7rokfEaJBdhuYquXzM.html

Though farmers will have to face financial loss, the decision has been taken unanimously for the welfare of humanity as the country is facing tough times,” said Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU- Ekta Dakaunda).The union leaders also demanded that the government revoke any fixed date for paddy transplantation as there was acute shortage of migrant labour since many of them had left for their hometowns on villages.“The condition that paddy will be transplanted from June 13 or on another fixed date should not be imposed on farmers. Also, according to prior promises, cases on farmers for paddy stubble burning should be quashed,” he added.Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary, BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan), said that his union will convince farmers to not burn crop residue when the pandemic was raging.“The residue of wheat crop is very low in quantity as compared to paddy. However, we advise our workers not to burn crop residue this time. During the paddy harvest season, farmers have to arrange for sowing of the next crop in a hurry, but now they have enough time left to manage the residue,” Kokri Kalan told Hindustan Times.Disobeying ordersMeanwhile, Dharamgarh police arrested a farmer, Bikkar Singh, fromKanakwal Bhanguan village on Wednesday for burning wheat residue.A case against him was registered under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code at the Dharamgarh police station. Bikkar Singh was later released on bail, said Narinder Singh, station house officer of the police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-farmer-unions-want-crop-residue-burning-stopped-due-to-covid-19/story-MxGM9baLZFVYZ1ViUMrVjK.html
23-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 lockdown cuts PM2.5, PM10 levels by half in Delhi: CPCB||With very few vehicles on roads, only essential commercial units functioning due to the coronavirus-forced lockdown and a weather favourable for dispersion of pollutants, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has reported 46 per cent reduction in PM2.5 levels and 50 per cent depletion in PM10 concentrations in the national capital.The apex pollution control body has analysed data from continuous ambient air quality monitoring network of 38 stations in Delhi between March 16 and April 15. Air quality trends have been studied in two phases -- pre-lockdown phase of March 16 to 21 and the lockdown phase from March 25 to April 15.In its report, the CPCB said, “Significant reduction in PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 levels observed. Overall, 46 per cent reduction in PM2.5 and 50 per cent reduction in PM10 concentration observed during the lockdown period.” PM2.5 refers to particulate matter having diameter less than 2.5 micrometers which can enter the lungs and even the bloodstream.The CPCB said reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 levels primarily indicate depletion in combustion and industrial sources of pollution which are common to both fractions of particulate matter.Since 81 per cent of Delhi’s nitrogen oxide comes from the transport sector, according to TERI Emission Inventory, 2018, restrictions on vehicular activity led to 56 per cent reduction in NO2 levels and over 37 per cent cut in carbon monoxide (CO) concentration during the lockdown period, compared to the pre-lockdown period, it said.Due to restrictions on the transport sector and industrial operations, the two major sources of benzene emissions, a 47 per cent reduction in benzene level has been observed, the CPCB report stated.“However, only 19 per cent reduction was seen in sulphur dioxide levels which may be due to the fact that over 70 per cent of Delhi’s SO2 originates from power plants located around the national capital (as per TERI Emission Inventory, 2018) and power plants were operational during the lockdown period,” it added.Since most of the eateries and industries in Delhi have shifted from coal to other less polluting energy sources, power plants appear to be the most likely source of sulphur dioxide.The CPCB also analysed data from 13 pollution hotspots in Delhi.Anand Vihar recorded 62 per cent, 69 per cent and 72 per cent reduction in PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 levels respectively during the lockdown period, the report said, adding Vivek Vihar, which is near major traffic corridor GT Road, saw a 60 per cent reduction in NO2 levels.In Dwarka Sector-8, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 levels depleted by 48 per cent, 61 per cent and 68 per cent respectively, while Okhla recorded a 72 per cent reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels, the CPCB said.The apex pollution control body recorded 24 hourly average PM2.5 and PM10 levels within National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for 20 and 15 days respectively in 22 days of the lockdown period. NO2 levels were 75 per cent less than their 24 hourly standard.Twenty-four-hour averages of PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 levels dropped as low as 24 microgrammes per cubic meter, 39 µg/m3, 15 µg/m3 and 10 µg/m3 respectively during the lockdown period, the report said.A 27 per cent increase in PM2.5 level and a 65 per cent increase in PM10 concentration was observed in between April 7 to April 15 compared to the first two weeks of the lockdown -- March 25 to April 6.However, the CPCB said, PM2.5 and PM10 levels were still lower by 39 per cent and 35 per cent respectively than pre-lockdown concentrations. This may primarily be attributed to change in meteorological conditions.The onset of summers has led to dry and dusty conditions. A mild dust storm from the western part of the country and the gulf region hit Delhi on April 14-15 rapidly increasing PM10 levels in Delhi and NCR, the pollution control body said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-lockdown-cuts-pm2-5-pm10-levels-by-half-in-delhi-cpcb/story-qSX5Xjrl3bJ1ePbKE1EqPK.html
23-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM orders detailed audit of every Covid-19 death by experts to check high mortality rate in state||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday said that he had ordered a detailed audit of every Covid-19 death by experts to understand and check the high mortality rate in the state, and the government was also strengthening its pandemic containment measures, under the guidance of an expert team.The chief minister gave this update to Congress president Sonia Gandhi during a video conference, at which he informed the party leadership that the state government was being guided by a group of experts in handling the Covid-19 crisis. The group comprises Dr KK Talwar, former director of the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research; Dr Raj Bahadur, vice-chancellor of the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences; Dr Rajesh Kumar, a former head of the School of Public Health at PGI; besides experts from John Hopkins University.CO-MORBIDITY FACTORS,DELAY IN SEEKING HELPThe mortality numbers in the state were high largely due to co-morbidity and lack of health-seeking behaviour (patients come late to hospital), said Capt Amarinder Singh.Despite the high mortality rate of 6.2%, the rate of growth of Covid-19 in Punjab was lower than India, with the cases doubling in 16 days against the national average of nine days.In percentage terms, cases in Punjab had steadily declined from 2.57% of the total cases in India (as of March 31) to 1.22% in 3 weeks (till April 22), revealing effective containment of Covid-19 in the state, he said.EFFECTIVE CONTAINMENT IN SBS NAGARCapt Amarinder Singh cited the example of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, earlier known as Nawanshahar, as a case of effective containment, that had been appreciated by the Government of India and the media.In Nawanshahar, which was one of the first hotspots in the country, all 18 treated cases, besides the initial death of granthi Baldev Singh, had recovered and no case had been reported since March 26, he informed the meeting. The chief minister said Punjab had to be compared with Kerala and Gujarat, which were also states with high NRI population. Punjab was doing significantly better than Gujarat, and in terms of cases per million population, even lower than Kerala (9/million in Punjab vs. 12/million in Kerala), he pointed out.At present, Punjab has 257 positive cases, with 16 dead and two critical patients, while 53 have been cured. The state has three containment zones, places with more than 15 cases, at Jawaharpur in Mohali district, Safabadi Gate in Patiala district, and Budhlada in Mansa district, while the three districts of Ferozepur, Fazilka, and Bathinda are green zones with no cases.TESTING FACILITIESAs many as 7,887 tests have bene done so far, with regular testing facility of 400/day each at the government medical colleges in Amritsar and Patiala; 150/day at the medical college in Faridkot and IMTECH, Chandigarh; and 60/day at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.In addition, testing facilities are available in private hospitals as follows: 40 a day at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, and 100 a day at Tuli Diagnostic Lab, Amritsar. The clearance for testing at Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, and SGRD Medical College, Amritsar, is in process, he said.At present, the testing rate in the state, at 248/million, is slightly lower than the national average of 309/million (excluding rapid testing).Regarding rapid testing, the chief minister said 3,502 cases were tested before the Indian Council for Medical Research suspended such tests.The state has 10,500 rapid testing kits supplied by ICMR, while 10,000 have been ordered by the state government, with deliveries in progress. The government has also floated a tender for another 50,000 kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cm-orders-detailed-audit-of-every-covid-19-death-by-experts-to-check-high-mortality-rate-in-state/story-A70ByRCNl6xiNuMW6WmITL.html

A division bench, comprising Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad, directed the Jharkhand government to file its response whether any legislation has been formulated for the benefit of advocates clerks of different courts in Jharkhand, including the high court.“If yes, then details should be filed as to how it is being implemented,” the bench said, posting the next date for hearing on April 27. Hearing a bunch of petitions, the bench observed that all the writ petitions “have common cause, pertaining to grant of financial aid to the advocates and advocates clerks working in the High Court of Jharkhand and the district courts within the state of Jharkhand, with consent of the parties, are being considered together.” The parties were asked to exchange their respective replies through email.“Since the State Bar Council has already framed a scheme known as Special Welfare Scheme, 2020 which has come into existence with effect from 06.04.2020...let the State Bar Council also file its response as to what steps it has taken to provide assistance to the needy advocates and what is the position of the fund available to the State Bar Council.“It goes without saying that since the state government has already come up with a policy to assist all the needy persons who are not in a position to maintain themselves by providing them with food, ration etc, it should not exclude such needy advocates or advocates clerks,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-hc-seeks-responses-on-steps-taken-to-assist-needy-advocates/story-6IuJPTHvhcQJ6dRsm0HjSP.html

Till now, Pakistan had been supporting terrorists and now it is exporting coronavirus patients to infect people of Kashmir. This is something on which there is a need to take precaution,” Dilbag Singh told reporters in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district on Wednesday after reviewing security and measures taken in view of Covid-19 outbreak.The DGP also attended a meeting chaired by RR Bhatnagar, the adviser to lieutenant governor GC Murmu, to review the security and the prevailing ground situation in the valley in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Referring to the recent terror attacks, Dilbag Singh said when the entire world was making efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic, Pakistan and its sponsored terrorists were making all out attempts to disrupt the measures being taken to safeguard the lives of the people in Jammu and Kashmir.“Even during the present health crisis, our forces continue to consolidate peace, while maintaining the security and law and order grids. Pakistani agencies are engaged in various activities at their launching pads in PoK to push in terrorists this side, both from the international border and Line of Control, to further their nefarious designs of disturbing peace and normalcy and lives and livelihoods of the people without bothering about their own people who have become coronavirus victims,” the DGP said.A recent report suggested that terrorists at training centres and launching pads in Pakistan and PoK are suffering from coronavirus infection, Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pakistan-exporting-coronavirus-infected-militants-to-j-k-says-dgp-dilbag-singh/story-cvHZKxr0029vQS3ayxAO0N.html

23-04-2020||City||Srinagar admn draws up care package for 6,330 women expecting babies in four months||The Srinagar administration has reached out to more than 6,300 women expecting a baby in the next four months, allaying their fears about proper care during the coronavirus outbreak with a package that includes regular checkups and the availability of ambulances. The plan was chalked out after a team went door to door around Srinagar city and its outskirts to identify women needing help during these difficult days, when all of India is under lockdown, officials said. Jammu and Kashmir has more than 400 cases of COVID-19 and five fatalities. With panic about the pandemic rising, several people in the Kashmir Valley are under quarantine. It is in these difficult times that pregnant women need both help and reassurance, officials said. And so, Srinagar Deputy Commissioner Shahid Iqbal Choudhary got together with some officials to draw up a plan for special care to expectant mothers. It includes a dedicated 24x7 helpline to facilitate end-to-end assistance, regular medical checks, ambulance services, hospital line-ups as well as counselling and vaccinations. The condition of the woman, pre-and post delivery, will be monitored on a web-based application which will have details such as expected date of delivery, administrative action, hospital assistance and vaccination schedules, officials said. After the baby is born, the administration will give the new mother a ‘baby kit’ that includes nutrition supplements, lotions and soaps and sanitiser. The kit will be enough to last the mother and baby three months, they added. The aim of the administration is to ensure that a baby is born healthy and in a safe environment keeping in view the threat of COVID-19, Choudhary said. “The assistance for expectant mothers is important to avoid any medical complications and to ensure that both mother and the newborn are healthy and get proper nutrition as well as vaccinations,” he added. Explaining the logistics of how the details were finalised, officials said the administration roped in 1,200 odd anganwadi and healthcare workers across the district to conduct a survey for pregnant women with a tentative delivery date in the next four months. Choudhary drew up a team led by Zeenat Ara, a Kashmir Administrative Officer who is district coordinator of the Integrated Child Development Programme. She has been dealing with issues being faced by women since March 17, when Srinagar shut down. Around a dozen officials were also deputed for the job. Sixteen localities have been declared ‘red zones’ in the entire district. The district has been divided into four administrative zones and 6,330 women identified for assistance -- 2,155 from North Srinagar which comprises some rural areas, 1,435 from Eidgah and 1,445 from Khanyar-East divisions of downtown areas of the city and 1,295 in west Srinagar, they said. Though there are ambulances, the district administration has procured five new ambulances specifically for the project. Another fleet of six vehicles is dedicated for various aspects of the project, including movement of teams to homes, medical check-ups and ensuring that a team of doctors in readiness to respond on call are able to reach the patient. The 24X7 helpline will be manned by four officials who will be put on six hour shifts. The project is being funded by “converged funds” from several schemes such as ‘Beti Bacho Beti Padao’, district plan and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). “It needed sufficient funds and convergence was the only way,” the deputy commissioner said. He said convergence of not only funds but also manpower, human resource and expertise is required to make such a plan a success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/srinagar-admn-draws-up-care-package-for-6-330-women-expecting-babies-in-four-months/story-wvMgzFnC0yLgGTBu5HRDkO.html

23-04-2020||Delhi||Ramzan under lockdown: The indomitable spirit of the Walled City||Ramzan is one month when all eyes are on Old Delhi. From the festooned stores to restaurants that come alive by night, Old Delhi is one place where you get to see the festivities in all their glory. But this Ramzan that starts on the intervening night between today and tomorrow will tell a different story. Owing to the lockdown, everyone is following precautions and staying indoors. This means no congregations and no lavish iftaar spread with friends. So how do the locals plan to bring in the holy month? Well, it starts with realising the true spirit of Ramzan — to help those who need it the most. “We have made kits which include dry rations, dates and fruits. These are the food items with which the faithful break their fast. We are in a continuous process of raising funds for these families. We have also come across such people who refuse to accept kits for free; for them, we have offered a subsidised rate. We are also urging everyone to pray from their homes,” says Abu Sufiyan, member of Delhi Youth Welfare Association. Since movement is restricted, and many localities within the Walled City have been completely sealed, locals are helping migrant labourers living in their neighbourhood. Mohammad Iftikhar, owner of Al Amaan Foods, has helped his staff and some of their friends with food and lodging. Adding to this, he says, “Since the restaurant is closed, we’ll try and make as many meals at home and make them available to anyone in need.”Mohammad Naved, whose family has been in the sweets business for over 80 years in Matia Mahal, has been moving around in Chawri Bazaar and Choori Walan, distributing ration and food. “Many of the homeless people we were feeding earlier have been quarantined. So we have shifted focus on whoever we can find within our neighbourhood,” he says.Read: Eid Mubarak: Singing the tunes of the Walled CitySome volunteers have been made smaller teams for distribution to other parts of the city. “Our ration kits, which include 10kg atta (wheat flour), 5kg rice, 5 litre oil, 3 kg sugar, pulses, salt and dry masalas can feed one family for a month. Our teams have already stored these in their respective areas, which include Shakurpur Basti, Sadar Bazaar and other areas,” says Asim Husain, president of Red Fort Bazaar Shopkeeper’s Association. Special kits for iftaar, which include packets of namkeen (dry snacks), soft beverage, dates, bananas and samosas, will also be distributed daily by their team.

23-04-2020||Chandigarh||BRO builds permanent bridge on Ravi||The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has constructed a permanent bridge on river Ravi, which connects Kasowal enclave in Punjab to the rest of the country.The defence ministry said the bridge was completed and opened to farmers ‘much ahead of its schedule’.“The 484-meter bridge was built by 141 Drain Maintenance Coy of 49 Border Roads Task Force (BRTF) of Project Chetak. The bridge cost ₹17.89 crore, excluding the approaches. It consists of 16 cells of 30.25-metre length each,” a defence ministry release said on Wednesday. According to the release, the BRO had planned to open the Kasowal Bridge in time for Vaisakhi so that farmers could transport their harvest to the market comfortably. “All available resources were diverted and approach work of far bank was completed in a short time. On the first Monday after Vaisakhi, the bridge was opened to farmers, who transported their harvest on tractors,” the ministry said. Director general border roads (DGBR) Lt Gen Harpal Singh said the BRO teams did the work while taking precautions against Covid-19. As per the release, the enclave of around 35 square kilometers, had been connected via pontoon bridge of limited load capacity. “The pontoon bridge used to be dismantled every year prior to the monsoon so that it wouldn’t wash away in the strong currents of the river.

23-04-2020||Education||Bihar cabinet nod to create 33,916 teaching posts||State cabinet on Tuesday paved the way for the appointment of 32,916 secondary school teachers and 1,000 higher secondary computer teachers by giving its nod for creation of posts in the schools being set up at panchayat level.The sanction will expedite the process for setting up higher secondary schools in all such panchayats that lacked secondary school.The move is part of government’s ambitious plan to provide higher secondary level education in all the 8,386 panchayats of the state. Existing high schools were being upgraded for the purpose. But, 2,963 panchayats did not even have a high school of their own.To ensure the delivery of higher secondary education at the panchayat level, in the vicinity of villages, efforts were on to start teaching for Class 9 students with the help of retired teachers, who were to be roped in on deputation basis, from April this year.The lockdown imposed in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent closure of educational institutions had pushed back the start of the new academic session. But the nod for the appointment process will help in putting back the session back on rails with the availability of teachers.For the time being, education department has roped in Doordarshan Bihar for extending an hour long online teaching session for Class 9 and 10 students everyday and efforts are on to book a slot for extending the facility for Class 11 and 12 students too.This fits in the exigency plan, prepared at the departmental level, to kick start the process before the Covid-19 disruption. It was envisaged that at least two rooms of existing facility would be earmarked for Class 9, in all such panchayats where new infrastructure for higher secondary schools is yet to get completed.These classrooms were to be equipped with smart class facilities for helping students to access interactive learning, through pre-recorded videos of chapter-wise lectures. The pre-recorded videos, prepared as part of the ‘Unnayan Bihar’ programme to make up for the lack of quality teaching facilities, also have a module for student assessment.“The cabinet sanction coupled with smart class facility and the initiative to make up for the lost classes by beaming online education facilities on DD Bihar is likely to come to the aide of students in these difficult times,” said an official of the education department.THE SCHOOL SCENARIOTotal panchayats: 8,386Panchayats with high schools: 5,423Panchayats without high schools: 2,963Middle schools with two extra rooms for Class 9: 1,482Two rooms being built in middle schools for Class 9: 1,139Schools with one extra room, another being built: 191Schools to run Class 9 in two shifts due to lack of space: 151||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/bihar-cabinet-nod-to-create-33-916-teaching-posts/story-Il1yh6sa219qKNahba28qI.html

Theory is important. But for engineering student, the application part of what is being taught, is equally important,” said Pathak.AKTU sought guidance of experts from IITs, including prof Ranjan Bose from IIT Delhi, prof Kantesh Blani from IIT Kanpur, Pushpadeep Mishra from IIT Mumbai, and prof Venkatesh from IIT Hyderabad.Prof Ranjan said virtual lab is a project of ministry of human resource development, government of India.He said on this platform, practical work of all engineering streams is possible.He said on virtual labs, practical teaching can easily be conducted because the required software is free for all students. Pushpdeep Mishra and prof Venkatesh informed on how to carry out practicals on the virtual lab.AKTU vice chancellor prof Pathak said, “In the present scenario virtual lab is a good option to start practical work.”He said the university will form a committee to explore the possibility and from the next semester it will become an essential part in AKTU teaching learning module.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/aktu-to-start-virtual-lab-for-engineering-students/story-2Axk5wC9dfPkRs8LYvXJzM.html

23-04-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Ghosts of Khan Market||No clacker-clacker of high heels on the front lane pavement. No one saying, “My daughter, who is doing her MBA in New York...” No famous face is to be seen—no litfest author, no foreign ambassador, not even a has-been politician. It’s all empty.What’s the point, then, of coming to Khan Market? One of Delhi’s most upscale shopping destinations, it has been for years a place to see and be seen. But these days, it is as quiet and unhappening as the adjacent Jewish graveyard.“Never thought I’ll see such a thing,” exclaims Abhinav Bamhi, one of the very rare Delhiwallas who happen to live in Khan Market. On his way to a vegetable shop, he is walking along the front lane. He’s the only one there.His family have been running one of the area’s longest surviving shops, Faqir Chand and Sons. When Khan Market was founded in 1951 to rehabilitate Partition refugees, it was designed to have shops downstairs and houses upstairs. Today, only four homes survive; the others have been turned into cafés and restaurants. The Bamhis live at No. 59.Mr Bamhi’s house shares its wall with the Town Hall restaurant, which, in BC (Before Corona) era, would teem with Sushi-loving crowds. His kitchen window looks to Cafe Turtle, where a cup of masala chai is priced 155 rupees plus taxes. The young man —he is 22—is conscious of having an extraordinary address. His Instagram handle is called @myhomeiskhan.“Each time I come out of the house to get groceries, I walk along the lanes, looking at the shuttered shops,” he says, chatting on WhatsApp. “I see the notices announcing ‘Closed due to COVID-19 alert’.”Mr Bamhi stops by a cake shop and turns his phone camera lens towards its locked glass door. The counter inside, that was once filled with whole portions of carrot cake, chocolate hazelnut cake, blueberry cake, salted caramel brownie, chocolate gooey cake and red velvet pastry, is now empty. Many will remember how this place used to be super-crowded at all times — now, it is looking like a relic from a previous civilisation.As the Khan Market Instagrammer takes a round of the area, showing the middle lane and the back lane through the phone screen that connects him to this reporter, the surreal aspects of the coronavirus-triggered lockdown become starker. Here, on these lanes, would walk some of the country’s most powerful and rich. Even the world of those super-privileged haven’t been spared by the pandemic. Nothing living is to be seen except for the market’s much-cherished stray dogs. “A lady who lives in (nearby) Sujan Singh Park used to send food for the strays,” Mr Bamhi explains. “She is still sending the food daily.”Further ahead, a showroom’s security guard in blue uniform is sitting cross-legged on the floor, his eyes focused on his mobile phone. Gazing upon the haunting emptiness in front of him, Mr Bamhi talks of missing the so-called Khan Market people—“the dignified elderly women in handicraft saris, politicians with bodyguards, young people passionately discussing democracy and fascism, journalists and activists...”He heads towards the middle lane, turns left into a staircase and returns to the flat that he shares with his parents, brother, sister-in-law and niece, Aradhana. At 19 months, she is Khan Market’s youngest resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-ghosts-of-khan-market/story-ENA8Qhp8nw7h5c1X6HMXEO.html
23-04-2020||Kolkata||Mamata slams Centre over ‘faulty’ Covid-19 testing kits||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday alleged that the federal government was trying to malign the state and that “canards” were being spread about the state’s testing figures when the “real problem” was with the testing kits supplied to the state. Her comments came a day after the West Bengal government and the Centre clashed over the arrival of two central teams in the state tasked with assessing the Covid-19 situation and the local government’s handling of it.On Wednesday, West Bengal claimed that all 10,000 rapid testing kits (RTKs) allocated to it by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) were defective. Following complaints from some states, the ICMR on Tuesday had asked for a two-day suspension in the use of these kits while it revalidated their performance. West Bengal previously complained about the poor quality of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests supplied to it by the ICMR. “The Indian Council of Medical Research was supposed to supply the testing kits. But either the kits are in short supply or they are defective and are being withdrawn. Who is to blame for this?” Banerjee asked. The Bengal government has drawn flak for its low rate of Covid-19 tests. Till date, the state, which has a population of around 100 million, has tested 7,037 samples out of which 423 tested positive; 15 people have died because of Covid-19. “Luckily the state health department didn’t depend on the Centre and had ordered testing kits from various other organisations. Health hazards are taking place. We are not responsible. We have to do tests on time. Else patients will die. Who is responsible for this situation?” the chief minister said.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) denied the allegations, and said that the Mamata Banerjee administration was crying foul to hide its own inefficiencies.Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BJP are bitter rivals in the state, which goes to polls in 2021. On Wednesday, West Bengal said the RTKs it received were faulty. “All 10,000 rapid test kits supplied to Bengal have been found to be faulty. We conducted 220 tests with these kits. It was a waste of time and energy,” said Rajiva Sinha, chief secretary of West Bengal. “We had to make our own arrangements. While supply was scarce we are being blamed for low number of tests.”Meanwhile, Apurva Chandra, who is heading the inter-ministerial central team for south Bengal, wrote to chief secretary Sinha on Wednesday seeking a “detailed presentation” on a number of issues, including the level of testing carried out by the state. It also asked about the availability of safety equipment for doctors, and the system created by the state for the approval of “cause of declaration of death” for Covid-19 patients. The government has come under flak for attributing some of the deaths of Covid-19 patients to co-morbidities. Most states are attributing even uch deaths to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/mamata-slams-centre-over-faulty-covid-19-testing-kits/story-hhFmF7QQ5WDCbLXMxbUGnO.html

23-04-2020||City||Thane sees 13 new cases; 3 suspected Covid patients die||Thirteen new cases of Covid-19 were reported from Thane on Wednesday.Thane Municipal Corporation said they have also recorded three deaths of people suspected to be Covid positive.Three patients admitted to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa with symptoms of coronavirus died on Wednesday. Their swab test reports are still awaited. Their funeral will be carried out as per the norms laid down for Covid patients.An official from Kalwa hospital said, “A 69-year-old man from Kharegaon was bought to the hospital on Tuesday in an unconscious state. He had high blood pressure, sugar and suffered a paralytic stroke. He died on Wednesday morning. A 74-year-old man from Shahad, who had breathing problems and pneumonia, died at 10.30am. The third patient is a 63-year-old man from Diva, who was brought to the hospital unconscious. He too died on Wednesday.”The three patients will be treated as suspected coronavirus deaths. The city has six coronavirus deaths.Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “On Wednesday, 13 new cases were recorded, taking the total positive cases in the city to 168.

Two more policemen from Mumbra have been tested positive.”Twenty seven patients have been discharged so far.Twelve new cases of Covid-19 were reported from Kalyan and Dombivli on Wednesday, taking the total count to 97. Those infected include a man from Kalyan police department and a 57-year-old nurse.After learning about the crowd of people at the newly set-up onion-potato market near Durgadi Chowk in Kalyan (West), KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi said market would shift back to APMC market. The market will be open from 7am to 5pm.The civic body found that several trucks, which claimed to be travelling to Vashi APMC market, halted at Kalyan market at Phadke ground and other places in the city instead of going to Vashi. This too is leading to crowding at the ground and other places in Kalyan. “To ensure the trucks don’t halt at Kalyan, we will only allow in only those trucks which has taken permission to pass through Kalyan while going to Vashi APMC market. Those without permission will not be allowed and face legal action, “said Suryavanshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-sees-13-new-cases-3-suspected-covid-patients-die/story-ItBmRW69tEXDsTxcZmMjmM.html
23-04-2020||City||One month of Covid-19 curfew in Punjab||There is complete shutdown in Punjab since March 23. HT spoke with people from different segments, encapsulating their daily routine, challenges they faced and the worries they have. Excerpts:YOUNG COP BALANCING IT BETWEEN DUTY, SAFETY(By Anil Sharma)AMRITSAR: For the last six weeks, he’s been waking up at 5am and going to the bed around 11pm. A 12-hour shift is not the only hardship, once back home, he has to isolate himself from the family members — mother, brother and sister.Punjab Police constable Shivjit Singh, 21, joined the force in July 2018 after his father, a police head-constable, died. He is among the eight cops deputed on rotation basis outside the isolation ward of Amritsar’s Guru Nanak Dev Hospital where Covid-19 patients are being treated.Wearing a mask and surgical gloves, Shivjit notes down the details of the patients in the ward and also ensures that no one except doctors and nurses cross the ward’s threshold.“My duty hours are from 8am to 8pm, but that gets stretched often due to emergency admission of patients. I mostly reach home between 9pm and 10pm,” he says.“As soon as I reach home, I take a bath in the courtyard after sanitising my uniform. I sanitise my body before entering the house. I have been living in a separate room since March 10,” said Singh, who lives in Verka village, around 8km from the hospital.PADDY SEASON COMING, LABOUR PANGS BOTHER THIS FARMER(By Vishal Joshi)BATHINDA: After a good wheat harvest this season, Balwinder Singh, 55, a small farmer from Bathinda’s Deon village, is worried about the paddy season two months later.Ever since the curfew was imposed, arranging labour for the paddy season has been keeping him worried. The migrant labourers from Uttar Pradesh are nowhere to be seen.“Every year I used to hire 6-8 migrants to prepare paddy fields and sowing. I contacted them telephonically a week ago, but they say it is not feasible and as well as safe. I have no idea what to do no,” he says.“The curfew came when wheat was near ready for harvesting. My two sons completed the harvesting on five-acre land on Monday and got a token to sell the produce,” he adds.With no other source of income, Balwinder is now apprehensive on taking another five-acres on lease for paddy cultivation. Balwinder is relieved that no one in his seven-member family required any medical help during the curfew. “Till now there has been no shortage of fodder or food,” he says.Balwinder, too, advises his family members to stay indoors, but then there is no work from for a farmer.HOMESICKNESS SEEPED IN FOR STUDENT FROM SOUTH SUDAN(By Deepa Sharma Sood)LUDHIANA: For Jambu Lukudu, 22, from South Sudan, staying away from family was normal. However, last six weeks in the hostel were different and he has started feeling homesick. A commerce student at Bhutta Group of Colleges, Lukudu has been residing in the hostel for two years. Now, he misses his parents and video calls them daily.“On March 16, the classes were suspended and then came the curfew. But cases in India are on the rise and we are concerned now,” he says.“Teachers are taking classes online. There’s no clarity on the exams which were due in May?” He says the lockdown has changed his daily routine. “I used to attend classes from 9am to 2pm and then would work in the college call centre from 3pm to 8pm to earn some money. Now, if I am not making a call or attending online class, I am sleeping. Also, baking is my new hobby,” he says.“I am not able to step out of the college to get money which I will run out in the next ten days. I am worried. Hostel administration arranges a doctor for check-ups every week and we are taking all precautions,” he said.DOCTOR CUT OFF FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS(By Vishal Rambani)PATIALA: Life was going smooth for Dr Nitin Chhabra, 34, an ENT specialist, till mid-February when the ICMR asked the medical colleges to train doctors to take samples of Covid-19 patients. Dr Chhabra was among the first batch of such trainees. And, life is not the same since.“As I would get exposed to Covid-19 patients, I shifted my wife and two-year-old son to my in-laws’ place in Amritsar. I haven’t met them since the first week of March. Video calls are the only solace,” says Dr Chhabra, who was in the team that took samples from Covid-19 hotspot Nawanshahr.His doctor wife was having a good private practice in Patiala before Dr Chhabra moved her to Amritsar for the safety of their son. “I am happy that I am a Covid warrior,” he says. “Hopefully, I will meet them by June-end.”“Not only family, I am cut off from friends, relatives except those from the fraternity,” he says.For six weeks, he is having meals at the medical college canteen. “Initially, people used to avoid me. But, slowly now they are understanding,” he said.BIZMAN BUSY WITH FAMILY AS FISCAL CONCERNS LOOM (By Harsimran Singh Batra)LUDHIANA: The industry has been among the worst hit due to the curfew. For 44-year-old Rahul Verma, the owner of a dyeing unit in Ludhiana, the pandemic has brought about an unprecedented change in his life.Verma’s highly active life has undergone a sea change in the last 30 days. His regular day prior to the curfew used to be hectic. Verma confesses he never got this much time to spend with his near and dear ones in the last many years.“I have been spending time with my family for the last one month and I am also concerned about my daughter who is studying in Australia,” he says, adding that he spends most of his time watching movies.Even as he is managing, the rising burden of bank interest and stress to pay salaries of workers is a major cause of worry. He has a workforce of 250, including labour. Verma says he has planned that from now on he will putting a system in place to provide labourers a healthy diet on the factory premises.HAIR DRESSER’S SAVINGS ARE VANISHING FAST (By Gagandeep Singh)JALANDHAR: The life of Liaquat Ali, 48, a hair dresser from Kabir Nagar, has come to a standstill since the curfew was enforced amid the Covid-19 outbreak. With no earnings, he has the responsibility to also pay his two helpers who are sitting at home, besides paying the shop rent and meeting his own family expenses. Ali has five daughters and wife. Savings are vanishing fast and he is concerned about the pending fee and other education expenses of his daughters.Ali says he would get around 100 customers daily at his shop before the curfew and life was comfortable. “I have to pay around ₹5,000 rent for the shop and salary of ₹15,000 each to my two helpers,” he says. Since there are no earnings now, Ali is spending from his savings to run everyday affairs.He has been receiving more than 30 to 40 calls daily from customers, asking him to come to their houses for haircut or shave. “I am declining all such requests. There is a risk to my customers as well as me. You never know who may contract the virus from whom.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-month-of-covid-19-curfew-in-punjab/story-qoccMiURtF4f0gRIbR70ML.html
23-04-2020||Entertainment||‘I’m shocked to see the spike in domestic violence complaints…’||Actor Annup Sonii is taking the quarantine in his stride and fears that it will be difficult to break his newfound routine. “My last working day was March 15, so in a way I am in a lockdown for five weeks and that’s a reason why my quarantine pattern is all set. So now going back to professional life will definitely be difficult. But ‘kaam toh karna hai’ and we have to go back to our professional selves soon,” says ‘Gangaajal’ actor over phone.Sonii was in Meerut shooting for an international film and left for Mumbai for another shoot when he got the lockdown news. “We were well informed about social distancing norm that we had to follow but soon the shoots stopped. The film is nearly complete. A bit of shoot is left that will be done in Baghpat (UP) probably in August or September. Also, my web film and series are in post-production. Hopefully, that too can be released this year end,” he said. He feels pattern of shoots will change. “Shooting with less people and following social distancing we can get back to work after a month or two.”The versatile actor has been associated with a crime-based show for years now and has connected with the viewers to a great extent. “My ‘Crime Petrol’ journey has been truly inspiring. And the appreciation I have received is so rewarding. We plan to shoot fresh episodes after two months as it’s set up is not as vast as films.”Sonii was shocked to see the spike in domestic violence cases during the lock down, “It shook me completely when I read the numbers of complaints being received during such unprecedented times. Crime has reduced in the lockdown phase but rise in such cases is alarming. Some steps need to be taken and such people require counselling,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/i-m-shocked-to-see-the-spike-in-domestic-violence-complaints/story-5hLgdM9adhF2iXvauzCyTI.html
23-04-2020||Mumbai||Amid case surge, dire estimate, state says do not panic||Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded 431 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, the fourth day in a row 400 or more cases have been reported, taking the number of infected people in the state to 5,649. However, the state government said the hotspots in the state have reduced to five from 14 a few days ago.The toll rose to 269 with the deaths of 18 people. Of these deaths, 10 are in Mumbai, two each in Aurangabad and Pune, one each from Kalyan-Dombivli, Solapur, Jalgaon and Malegaon.The state government has claimed that the mortality rate had reduced and the rate of doubling of cases has improved to 7.01 days, up from 3.1 days earlier this month, even as a Central team that visited Mumbai and Pune projected a sharp spike in cases in the next two to three weeks. The team has advised the Maharashtra government to prepare for a worst-case scenario. However, state health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said there was no need to panic over the projection of a massive surge in the number of cases in Mumbai between April 30 and May 15, saying that the projections were based on the rate of increase in cases, which would not be applicable now. “There is panic among people about a spike between April 30 and May 15. It is a mathematical model. There is surely a science behind it, but certain things have been assumed in this, such as the doubling rate at 3.5 and that it is kept static We have taken a lot of preventive measures. We are carrying out surveillance, tests, etc.” He said that such a spike would only happen if the state government wasn’t taking any measures.In the past four days, 2,001 cases have been reported in the state, while 58 people died during this period. So far, Mumbai has 3,683 cases and 161 deaths.Of the 431 new cases, 232 are in Mumbai. Of the 18 deaths, five were above that age of 60, while 12 were in 40-60 age group and one was below 40 years. Twelve of these patients had high-risk comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, asthama and heart ailments.The mortality rate in the state dropped 4.80 % on April 21, much below the rate of 7.21% on April 11. During a presentation before chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, the five-member inter-minister Central teams reportedly projected an exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai. It believably said that cases in the city may touch 42,604 by April 30 and increase to 6.56 lakh by May 15. Officials from the health department, however, said that the figures do not substantiate the present trend. “Those are figures assuming the doubling of the cases to be two days. But at present, cases are neither rising at that rate, nor are we conducting testing to reach that number by May 15. Even the percentage of cases against testing ranges between 5-8% and with that rate, figures appear to be unrealistic,” said the official.Tope said the doubling rate now is 7.01 days, and added that it will go up further. He added that the mortality rate has also improved in the state. Tope said, ”Earlier, it was 7%, now, it has come under 5%, and with efforts, it will reduce further.” The minister said that the hotspots in Maharashtra have reduced from 14 to five — Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, Nagpur, Nashik.Meanwhile, Tope rejected the notion that the Central government had sent a team to Maharashtra as it felt that lockdown measures are not followed properly in the state. The minister said the state is faring well in terms of mortality rate and the doubling rate now, which are crucial parameters to judge the size of the pandemic.Tope said, “Nobody has said that lockdown norms have not been followed [in Maharashtra]… In an epidemic, the situation is always serious. The cluster containment strategy is being properly implemented. If there is any lacuna, we are immediately identifying and resolving it… There are two important things — doubling rate and mortality rate. The doubling rate has improved. Earlier, cases doubled in three days, then in five days, now it is happening in seven days. It is will increase further. The death rate is also improving. Earlier it was over 7%, now it is under 5%. The number of cases are increasing and would increase in the coming days. But they are not growing exponentially.”A senior state government official said that the Central teams, which visited Worli-Koliwada on Tuesday, Dharavi and other slum pockets in Andheri (East), has sought data of residents of the slums, from the government. It has also sought the number of tests conducted in these areas. An official added that the team has advised that people should be shifted to quarantine facilities to curb the spread of infection in densely populated areas. “In Mumbai, around 75,000 people have to be taken from their homes and shift them into institutional quarantine facilities. We have spaces, including schools and grounds, where this can be erected. Institutional quarantine will aggressively start in Mumbai from Thursday,” Tope said.The health minister said that the Centre anticipates a spike in the number of cases in the city and added that the state has reviewed its preparedness plan. “According to the preparedness plan, we are checking the availability of hospital beds, oxygen, PPE kits, etc. We are considering the worst possibility and the BMC is preparing for it. I have instructed BMC to increase testing facilities and quarantine facilities as well,” he said.The minister also hinted that the lockdown could be extended beyond May 3 in areas where the number of cases are high. “Wherever cluster containment strategy is implemented and if there is any hindrance in implementing it and if the cases increase, we will have to take stricter steps,” he said.After 67 patients were reported to have recovered fully on Wednesday, the total number of the patients to be discharged from the hospitals has reached 789. A total of 1,09, 072 people are home quarantined and 8,051 are under institutional quarantine.State authorities have conducted 90,223 tests at government and private labs, of which, 83,979 tested negative. State has got 465 containment zones, with 6,798 health teams, which have 25.61 lakh people.During its interaction with chief minister Thackeray, the IMCT [the central team] has asked the state government to prepare for the worst-case scenario. “They have directed the government machinery for strict monitoring of containment zones and aggressive outreach to curb the spread of the virus further. They also have pressed for contact tracing and aggressive testing of people in hotspots. The government has also been told to increase the number of health teams to trace more high and low- risk contacts,” said an official from the state government, on the condition of anonymity. The official also said that the Central team has asked the state government to take steps to avoid crowding on the roads during the month of Ramadan.CM Thackeray apprised the team about the initiative taken in by the government to contain the spread in the hotspots, especially the slums in Mumbai and Pune. The team was told that the civic body in Mumbai has been reaching out to people, without waiting for them to report about symptoms. “We have increased the number of tests and it has resulted in the rise in the number of cases in the state. We expect the ICMR nod for the rapid testing at the earliest. The centre should also respond positively to the demand raised by us concerning the supply of PPE kits, N-95 mask and other equipment,“ he said.Meanwhile, the state government fears an extreme reaction from more than 5.7 lakh migrants living in 4,618 camps across the state if the lockdown is extended again after May 3. “We do not want to repeat the Bandra migrant crisis after second phase of the lockdown ends. We have been getting harsh reactions from these migrants, who have been put up in camps for more than four weeks with every facility at their disposal. The state has already spend around ₹90 crore and huge machinery is engaged for the arrangements. At a few camps, the migrants have boycotted food, demanding for transport arrangements to take them to their respective states. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is keen on sending them back at the earliest,” said an official from the state government. Meanwhile, reacting to the allegations of former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis that the BMC is suppressing the Covid-19 related death count in Mumbai, Tope said that the civic body has assured him that the deaths referred to by Fadnavis were not related to coronavirus. “I have spoken to Praveen Pardeshi, municipal commissioner. He has studied the cases; the patients were old and had comorbidities. The ICMR guidelines say that if a patient arrives in a critical or a serious condition, he or she must be stabilised first, and then swab should be taken. In this case, during the period of stabilising the patients had died. The ICMR guidelines also do not say that swab samples should be taken of [such] patients who died. The commissioner has told me that these are non-Covid-19 deaths,” he said.Fadnavis, in a letter to Thackeray on Tuesday, said that patients registered as suspected Covid-19 patients were not tested and after deaths, the bodies were releases as non-Covid ones.. He said at least 44 bodies of “suspected Covid-19” patients have been released from the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital — a dedicated Covid-19 facility now — without the coronavirus test. There are several such instances from other hospitals too, said Fadnavis, who tweeted details of the letter he’s sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “We are not hiding any information; there is no reason. The directives of the government of India, the protocol of ICMR, is being followed completely,” Tope added.The minister added that there is a “question mark” over the rapid test or antibody test after the Centre directed the state government not to use the Chinese kits provided for tests. “There is still a question whether to do it (rapid test) at all. In the Chinese kits, the IgM and IgG bands are not visible properly. We will act as per the corrective instructions of the Centre.”Meanwhile, Tope said that the state has got the go-ahead from the ICMR to try out the plasma therapy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-case-surge-dire-estimate-state-says-do-not-panic/story-GamMkz4s9W2sut6OsKB7CN.html
23-04-2020||Lucknow||UP: Plan for red zones, corona-free dists gets green light||The state government is working on a two-pronged strategy to control the spread of the Covid-19 disease in red zones and give a momentum to economic activities in 32 districts that are coronavirus-free.Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, additional chief secretary, Home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said the state government has directed all district magistrates to implement the Covid protocol strictly in their respective districts to check the spread of the coronavirus. The DMs and SPs were also directed to take strict action against lockdown violators.Even the authorities in districts that had been declared corona free were directed to remain alert as any laxity could lead to revival of coronavirus, he said. The state government has also decided to start works in industrial units and construction in 32 non- Covid districts.The industrial development department has already started work in 6,980 industrial units where 1.25 lakh labourers are engaged.The state government also granted permission to 12,027 brick klins to start operation and around 15 lakh labourers were working in these units, he said.Out of 119 sugarmills in the state, 96 were functional with 60,000 labourers during the crushing season. The labourers will continue to remain in the sugar mills after the crushing season ends.The district magistrates have been directed to ensure smooth movement of trucks carrying raw material and finished products. The micro, small and medium enterprises department asked to ensure export of manufactured goods, he said.The state government has also started construction works on the Purvanchal, Bundelkhand and Gorakhpur link expressways. Around 8,500 labourers, engineers and other staff had started work on the expressways, he said.The industrial units and the respective district authorities were directed to implement the lockdown guidelines strictly by ensuring social distancing, regular hand washing and wearing of masks.As much as 77% harvesting of the Rabi crop was completed with the state government and private agencies purchasing 30 lakh quintal wheat, he said, adding that 62% of wheat was procured from the farmers’ doorstep.In the remaining districts in which the coronavirus cases were reported, the district and health department teams were directed to screen people in hotspots, admitted infected people in isolation wards and quarantine the suspected patients, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-plan-for-red-zones-corona-free-dists-gets-green-light/story-M3rrSSOsFbvE2ffW6bFsYN.html
23-04-2020||Lucknow||Experts need to find leakage in Agra Model: MP||With coronavirus positive cases crossing the 300-mark in Agra, questions are being raised about the Agra Model of Covid-19 management.Earlier this month, officials had said the local administration’s proactive approach in identifying cases, a door-to-door survey, the number of samples sent for testing, adequate quarantine measures and recovery of infected people made the “Agra Model” special in the fight against the coronavirus.Now, Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Agra SP Singh Baghel has called for finding ‘leakage’ in the Agra Model.“The initial stress was on the supply of essential items and people had faith in the Agra Model which also earned applause from joint secretary, union ministry of health, but no one had guessed there would be such a rise in the number of positive cases in Agra, which has crossed the 300-mark and now stands at 313,” said Baghel.“It is high time experts find ‘leakage’ in the Agra Model,” said Baghel.‘Para-medical staff are asking for gloves, masks and PPE kits, which seem to be a justified demand. Already, two dozen health workers have tested positive. If frontline corona warriors like medical staff and police personnel test positive, then who would look after the preventive measures?” the Agra MP asked.A meeting of elected representatives, including Agra MP and MLA, is being held to gather feedback and forward it to the appropriate authorities.Vivek Sarabhoi, convenor of the voluntary initiative ‘Covid-19 Agra Support’, said, “There is a huge gap between what needs to be done and what actually is being done.”However, Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh defended the Agra Model and claimed the administration was on right track. The stress was on testing more and more people as the source of the infection spread was known in all cases, he said, ruling out community spread.“There is a series of meetings with stakeholders. New guidelines are being issued in consultation with the SN Medical College principal, chief medical officer, chief medical superintendent, SSP Agra, IMA Agra, Help Agra, Bajaja Committee, besides Dr BS Chandel, representative of the World Health Organisation,” the Agra DM said.‘We have decided to keep suspected Covid-19 patients in institutional quarantine after having their sample tested so that they can be moved to isolation once they test positive,” the district magistrate said.“A dedicated five-member team of Indian Medical Association (IMA) will ensure compliance with the corona protocol at private hospitals,” Singh said.“Medical mobile units would be stationed in Hariparvat, Loha Mandi and Shahganj areas of city. Medical waste is to be disposed of on priority and we are updating arrangements for the availability of blood,” the Agra DM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/experts-need-to-find-leakage-in-agra-model-mp/story-K4uMIP4his1H4xZtUQiOxJ.html

He said a probe was on. “I came to Mumbai on February 22 on a tourist visa and was staying in a Bandra hotel till March 31,” the woman stated.The woman stated that she had approached the Colombian embassy in Delhi after she exhausted her money. “Accordingly, an officer of Mumbai Police helped me check in a lodge in Marol in Andheri on April 1,” she said in the complaint. She alleged that the officer first asked her for a drink, which she refused. However, he kept sending me “flirtatious” messages on my phone, she alleged. “A couple of times he tried to force himself on me, but I pushed him out of the room,” she stated. An NGO helped the woman shift to a hotel.

23-04-2020||Lucknow||Five test positive in pool test, health officials fear community transmission in Meerut||Five persons tested positive in the pool test done in Lakhipura locality, a development that has got the health officials worried for they now fear outbreak of community transfer of virus in Meerut. “It indeed is a matter of concern for all,” said Dr Rajkumar, chief medical officer adding pool test in the district were being conducted on Wednesday as well. The findings of the pool test done on Friday in which five tested positive was confirmed on Sunday, health officials said. “Apart from these five , two positive cases have been found without a contact chain,” said Dr Rajkumar. In one such case a pregnant woman, wife of vegetable seller, tested positive in Rajban Bazaar locality. Her husband tested negative. But the virus’ contact link to her is missing, health officials said. Similarly, the contact chain of a private hospital’s accountant, who died of Covid 19, is also missing.He explained the pool test is done to check if the virus has moved to the next stage thus opening the possibility of community transmission. “In this stage it becomes very difficult to know who is spreader and carrier,” Dr Rajkumar said. Till now, 82 persons have tested positive in Meerut (since March 27) when the first positive case was detected. Of these 82, 3 have died while 15 have been discharged, health officials said. Dr Anil Noushran, secretary of IMA’s Meerut chapter, too expressed his worry and concern for missing contact chain. “It could be an indication of moving towards community transfer which is indeed a matter of great concern,” he said. He held peoples’ casual approach in following rules during lockdown a major reason behind possible threat of community transfer in the district. He also emphasized on strict implementation of lockdown to prevent possible community transfer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/five-test-positive-in-pool-test-health-officials-fear-community-transmission-in-meerut/story-spcBbdo957MdkfTdzU98WL.html

The police have booked three identified people and six others and were planning to impose National Security Act on them, said a police spokesperson.Reports said a police party patrolling along a railway track in Kasaibada locality asked a group of youths sitting near railway track to go home.They argued with the cops and later heckled a constable. “During the scuffle, the constable received injury on his nose,” said deputy commissioner of police (DCP) east Somen Barma. He, however, rubbished the reports of stone-pelting on cops. Later the injured cop was taken to hospital for first aid.Barma said, “There were nine people who entered in a scuffle. We have registered a case against them for attacking a cop on duty. We are in the process of identifying them.”They had been booked for rioting, assaulting a government official, disobeying the government orders, indulging in a negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life and under relevant sections of Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act, said BarmaKasaibada was sealed after 12 people from the locality tested positive for the coronavirus on April 3.RESIDENTS DENY VIOLENCE, ALLEGE ESSENTIALS SHORTAGEHowever, residents of Kasaibada locality alleged shortage of essentials.

23-04-2020||Mumbai||Bhatia Hospital staff in Mumbai steps forward to treat colleagues tested positive for Covid-19||For 32-year-old doctor Shalaka Patil and 36-year-old nurse Ansa Sam John of Bhatia Hospital, the outbreak of Covid-19 has required them to treat not just patients, but also colleagues who contracted the infection while on duty. So far, over 100 members of medical staff from hospitals across the city have contracted Covid-19 after treating patients who were positive for the infection. Since April 9, 35 staff members of the privately-run Bhatia Hospital, in Tardeo, have been diagnosed with Covid-19. Patil and John are among an additional team of 25 that has stepped up to treat the 35 Covid-positive medical staff at the hospital. On Monday, 11 of the 35 were discharged after recovering, but eight of the additional staff, including doctors and nurses, on Wednesday tested positive for Sars-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19. At present, all the Covid-19 patients in Bhatia Hospital are staff members who had been treating patients. All outsider patients have recovered and been discharged.John, who has worked as a nurse at Bhatia Hospital for over 15 years, said, “We are taking necessary precautions like wearing personal protection equipment, but there is still a chance that we might get it. All staff members are prepared for this.”At Bhatia Hospital, three teams have been formed to treat Covid-positive patients, each one comprising three doctors, four nurses and two housekeeping staff. A total of 27 staff members are on rotational duty. The medical staff do rounds to check on their Covid-positive colleagues twice daily, in the morning and evening, and do follow-ups over video calls. Repeated swabs are taken of all staff and swabs are also collected from patients showing only minor symptoms, said Bhatia Hospital authorities. “When we see our colleagues recovering, we get the confidence to keep going,” said Patil.A team is on duty for seven days at a stretch, during which time they stay at the hospital. Then they go into a 14-day isolation and are replaced by another team.Patil, who is an intensivist and has been working for six years, said they are all aware that treating their colleagues increases chances of them getting infected despite taking necessary precautions. She also said part of the challenge was to comfort the families of those who have tested positive. “We do regular counselling of family members over video calls. We being their colleagues are doing everything possible to handle this situation,” she said.It is also necessary for those on duty to reassure their own families. “Along with being mentally prepared, my family members are also proud of us,” said Patil, who calls home twice a day. “We make them [family members] understand that as a healthcare worker, it is our responsibility and it [Covid-19] might come to any one among us,” said John.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhatia-hospital-staff-in-mumbai-steps-forward-to-treat-colleagues-tested-positive-for-coronavirus/story-hDS0j2QeEGTttI6DPduaTK.html
23-04-2020||City||Vashi toll plaza sees traffic congestion as govt staff resume work||With around 10% of government employees reporting to their offices along with essential services officials, there has been a significant increase in traffic at Vashi toll plaza. On Wednesday morning, there was severe traffic congestion at the plaza leading to more than one-hour delay. Officials attributed the same to lesser number of toll staff.Sunil Lokhande, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), said, “We are vigilant about who is leaving the city limits. The traffic at Vashi toll plaza is a result of APMC vehicles being allowed to ply along with vehicles carrying few government officials who have started reporting to work.”“The staff at Vashi toll plaza is working with less than half manpower hence, they take time to collect toll and clear vehicle, resulting in a delay,” said Lokhande.Vashi toll plaza has resumed toll tax collection from April 20.Bhanudas Khatavkar, traffic inspector, Vashi traffic police, said, “As local trains are not running and many government employees are now going to work, there are more private cars are on the road. And in a bid to maintain social distancing, carpooling is also not happening, thus adding to the number of vehicles.”“In addition, goods transport has been allowed along with other essential services. Hence, there is an increased influx of vehicles for two hours in morning and evening each,” said Khatvakar.Traffic police are ensuring that only people with passes travel. They have also set up a separate dedicated queue for checking goods vehicles to ensure other commuters are not inconvenienced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vashi-toll-plaza-sees-traffic-as-govt-staff-resume-work/story-e0F6Dei1PAGDhBagmUOHgP.html
23-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai 3rd most polluted among 10 int’l cities during lockdown: Study||The city was the third most polluted among 10 international cities during the first three weeks of the lockdown imposed owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a report published on Wednesday.Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, the report released by Swiss-based air quality research group IQAir collated real-time PM2.5 concentrations from monitoring stations over the three-week lockdown period. While the timeframe for seven of 10 cities was March 23-April 13, the period was different for Rome (March 9-30), and Wuhan and Seoul (February 26 to March 18).Even though Mumbai witnessed a 42% reduction in average PM2.5 levels recorded between March 23 and April 13, compared to average PM2.5 levels (during the same period) over the past four years, and a 34% reduction compared to the same period in 2019, the city ranked third most polluted with PM2.5 concentration at 28.8 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³) during the lockdown period. Wuhan, China was the most polluted at 35.1 μg/m³ followed by Delhi, second most polluted at 32.8 μg/m³. New York had the lowest PM2.5 levels at 4.4 μg/m³, which had the cleanest air across 10 cities, followed by Los Angeles USA at 5.5 μg/m³, and Madrid, Spain at 6.4 μg/m³. Sao Paulo, Brazil recorded 10.1 μg/m³, London UK 16.2 μg/m³, Rome, Italy 16.7 μg/m³, and Seoul, South Korea 24.1 μg/m³. Nine of 10 key global cities experienced PM2.5 reductions of 25-60% from the same period in 2019, the study said.PM (particulate matter) is a mix of organic and chemical particles suspended in the air and can aggravate respiratory illnesses. PM2.5 is breathable particulate matter (solid and liquid particles) which is 2.5 microns in size or smaller, which can cause health ailments. The annual mean safe limit for PM2.5 is 10 μg/m³, according to the World Health Organisation. A recent US-based study suggests that even an increase of just 1 μg/m³ of PM2.5 in breathable air is associated with a 15% increase in the Covid-19 death rate.“Although Asian cities had higher average PM levels, we observed that cities with historically higher average PM2.5 levels such as Delhi, Mumbai, Seoul, and Wuhan, experienced more drastic reductions in particulate pollution,” said Kelsey Duska, air quality outreach specialist at IQAir through an email response to HT. “It is likely that cities in India are still observing higher PM2.5, relative to cities in Europe or the US, because people are still using energy. This energy may be sourced from dirtier sources, such as coal-based power plants. Similarly, biomass burning or fossil fuels used for domestic heating or cooking can further contribute to this effect,” said Duska.During March, Mumbai experienced average PM2.5 levels of 34.5 µg/m³ – making it the cleanest March on record, despite lockdown measures only being implemented in the later part of the month, the study said, adding, “There is high possibility that April too would be the cleanest April on record if measures are to continue throughout the month.”Significant reductions in particle pollution were primarily the result of restrictions on movement (greatly reducing traffic congestion) and industry, the study said.Duska pointed out that overall air quality improvement for Mumbai was still unprecedented. The study examined the amount of hours spent in different AQI categories (as classified by the US), from March 23 to April 13. AQI levels are categorised as 0-50 as good, 51-100 as moderate, 101-150 as unhealthy for sensitive groups, 151-200 as unhealthy, 201-300 as very unhealthy, and 301-500 as hazardous. “It was observed that Mumbai’s ‘unhealthy’ and worse rated air quality hours fell from 22.5% in 2019 to 0.4% during this lockdown period. This means that of all the hours between Mar 23 and April 13 (528 hours), only two were classified with ‘unhealthy’ air quality,” said Duska. As compared, Delhi’s ‘unhealthy’ and worse rated hours plummeted from 68% in 2019 to 17% during the lockdown period.The study also presented a chart visualising the distribution of air quality hours during the lockdown period, which were classified into AQI categories. For Mumbai’s lockdown period, the chart showed that 66.2% of hours were classified as ‘moderate,’ while 33.4% of hours were ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’ and only 0.4% were ‘unhealthy.’ In 2019, the distribution for ‘moderate’, ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, and ‘unhealthy’ was 51%, 23.3% and 22.5% - showing significantly more hours in the worse rated AQI levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-third-most-polluted-among-10-int-l-cities-during-lockdown-study/story-ttmBVK1SrB8m0PsehfsYmL.html

23-04-2020||Mumbai||Four hospitals in Mumbai turn away constable with Covid-19 symptoms; he’s in the ICU||A 57-year-old police head constable attached with the Kurla traffic division was allegedly refused treatment by four civic hospitals after he developed coronavirus symptoms. When HT contacted Dr Daksha Shah, deputy heath officer, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC), she said, “I am not aware of this case. I will inquire with the hospitals before I comment on it.”Shivaji Sonawane had developed fever on Monday and after consulting a private doctor, his son Sharad rushed him to Rajawadi Hospital on Tuesday around 2pm. “My father had developed fever and cough and had difficulty in breathing. The doctors at Rajawadi Hospital checked his temperature and conducted preliminary analysis, after which they recommended to keep him in isolation at home. But when I asked the authorities to admit him to the hospital’s isolation centre, they claimed there was no bed available and asked us to take him to Kasturba Hospital,” 25-year-old Sharad told HT.He then rushed Sonawane on his motorcycle to Kasturba Hospital. “Doctors there checked his temperature and gave him some oxygen. They said they do not have enough beds available and asked me to take him to Nair Hospital. They did not even bother to take my father’s swab for testing,” Sharad alleged. When the authorities at Nair Hospital also refused to admit Sonawane, Sharad rushed his father to KEM Hospital. “At Nair Hospital, too, they said there was no bed available and that they do not test patients. On their recommendation, I took my father to KEM Hospital, where doctors initially refused to admit him. Then I contacted the police, following which some officers requested civic officials to admit him. My father was finally admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU) around 11pm on Tuesday night,” Sharad said. Sonawane’s swab samples have been collected and the reports are awaited. “My father has given 28 years to the service. If anything goes wrong, the doctors are responsible,” an emotional Sharad said. Despite repeated calls, Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital, did not respond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/four-hospitals-in-mumbai-turn-away-constable-with-covid-19-symptoms-he-s-in-the-icu/story-Rhti4IVXDZuQR5iGjullvM.html

In a letter shared with district education officers in the state on Tuesday, the department wrote, “Due to the lockdown, students are not being able to meet their teachers and classmates with whom they share an emotional attachment. In the absence of interaction, the mental health of students can be affected. During this difficult period, counsellors of Umeed Centre are available to resolve any mental or emotional concerns that students and teachers might face. Counsellors must continue their services during the lockdown period so that students remain cheerful and are able to share their concerns if any [sic].”Counselling and guidance centres called Umeed Centres have been operating in the state for the past two years. The tele-counselling service was started last year to address the grievances of students remotely. As per the new directive, counsellors across 15 districts in the state will be available to provide these services regularly during the lockdown period. Students in districts where the centres don’t operate can reach out to the nearest Umeed Centre counsellor. The helpline—6283848585—will cater to students in the Gurugram district.The education department has shared the list of helplines operational across the state with school principals who have been asked to communicate the information to students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/education-department-asks-counsellors-to-continue-with-tele-counselling-during-lockdown/story-281OnqbaX068ygUwGwxfIN.html
23-04-2020||Delhi||Not just red, orange zones central to Capital’s anti-Covid cleaning drives||New Delhi:  The Delhi government has started an intensive cleaning and disinfecting campaign in the city, particularly in areas on the periphery of Covid-19 hot spots and those that are densely populated, by demarcating them as the “orange zones”, according to officials aware with the matter and government documents reviewed by HT.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on April 12 said that his government was focusing on zones designated “red” and “orange” to isolate and control the outbreak of the coronavirus disease that has so far infected 2,248 people in Delhi and killed 48. The government has imposed a hard lockdown in its 89 containment, or “red” zones, with people not allowed to step out of their homes and authorities home-delivering essentials. Along with this, a rolling list of “orange zones”, prepared every two to three days, identifies areas that are not yet infection clusters but could potentially turn into red zones. The Delhi government updates the list of orange zones regularly. For example, in the April 19 and 20 list -- seen by HT -- Kailash Kunj and Kailash Hills in East of Kailash were included in the list of about 180 orange zones. Some other localities that were listed were Blocks A1, A4 & B5 of Safdarjung Enclave; the entire unauthorised colony of Sangam Vihar; Paschim Vihar; Dwarka Sector 6; Block C of Vasant Kunj; Savitri Nagar near Shekh Sarai; Wards 73 & 75 of Ashok Vihar; D Block of Malkaganj; Okhla Vihar; Block C of Yamuna Vihar and Boulevard Road in Chandni Chowk.While some of the orange zones are lanes and blocks, others include entire localities – the contours of the high-risk zones depend on the demographic spread in the areas, a senior government official said on condition of anonymity.A senior government official said that these areas are broadly chosen either based on their proximity to localities from where cases are being reported, on the basis of their vulnerability due to risk factors such as high population density. These zones are earmarked for large-scale disinfection and sanitation drives every few days. The Delhi government recently acquired Japanese machines, which can sanitise an area of 20,000 square metres in an hour, to spray disinfectants in high-risk areas.To be sure, Delhi’s red and orange zones are different from the Centre’s district-wise classification on similar lines. Nationally, the central government has classified districts into red, orange and green areas. While red zones, as defined by the Union health ministry, are “highest caseload districts”, also called hot spots; and orange zones are areas where no Covid-19 case has been reported in 14 days. All 11 revenue districts in Delhi are currently hot spots. The orange zones, as defined by the Union government, can be reclassified as “green zones” once no fresh cases are reported for another two weeks. A second government official, requesting anonymity, said many congested areas have not reported any cases so far but they were included in Delhi’s list of orange zones because infection may spread very quickly there.Some other areas on the April 19 and 20 list as per Delhi’s classification of orange zones were Mandoli; Ashok Nagar; West Jyoti Nagar; East Gokalpur; Rajgarh Colony in Shahdara; Blocks 52 and 52 of Karol Bagh; Kewal Park Extension and Majlis Park in Adarsh Nagar; F Block of Mansarovar Garden, Madan Park & Chhagan Park in Moti Nagar; Blocks 27 and 32 of Trilokpuri; and Nawada village in Uttam Nagar.“People in buffer areas are in a state of risk because of proximity issues. They stay close to clusters that have recorded three or more cases. Several orange zones include areas around quarantine centres and hospitals. The reason is the same – proximity,” said the first official, asking not to be named.“So far, all red zones have been covered for sanitation. They shall witness multiple rounds of disinfection in the days to come. Work on orange zones is part of our regular progress,” said Raghav Chadha, Rajendra Nagar MLA and vice-chairperson of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) – the agency that is leading the sanitisation programme though sanitation in the Capital normally comes under the municipal corporations.The municipal corporations and the Delhi Fire Services continue to operate sanitisation programmes in containment zones across the city. While Chadha said that the sanitisation efforts of the MCDs were “not up to the mark”, spokespersons of all three municipal corporations in the city asserted that they have been working round-the-clock and meeting goals set by the area district magistrates, who are the nodal officers under the Disaster Management law currently invoked across the country.Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department at the Safdarjung Hospital, suggested that the government go for “targeted sanitisation”.“Targeted sanitisation means, instead of randomly spraying disinfectant on roads and walls, the programme should focus on surfaces that are more likely to retain the virus and more prone to human contact. They include railings, stairs, gate handles, knobs, etc. The government can also explore the idea of disinfecting the indoor surfaces of residences in containment zones,” said Kishore, who leads one of the teams that is helping the Delhi government in tests and assessment of the burden of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/not-just-red-orange-zones-central-to-capital-s-anti-covid-cleaning-drives/story-EtGI7Vzd68kLyOIVdhJduO.html
23-04-2020||Gurugram||In Raheja Vedaanta, common areas within society also remain off limits||The residents of Raheja Vedaanta, a condominium in sector 108, have barely ventured out since the country went into lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease. The RWA has put in place a stringent screening process and ensures that residents step out only for essential services. “People are staying inside and following the guidelines very strictly. We are not stepping out at all, not even in to the common areas. As a community, everyone has been watchful. There are hassles, but this is the only way out for breaking the chain (of the disease),” said Urvi Sukul Singh, 58, a resident.Ram Singh, a member of the team formed to coordinate efforts aimed at containing the coronavirus spread, said that the team was closely monitoring the implementation of the lockdown. “We are ensuring that people are not moving out unless absolutely necessary. We are educating people in the society about the necessity of the lockdown and even call the police to make rounds on alternate days so that people don’t violate the rules. Some people were continuing to play in the tennis court but we gave them an ultimatum, following which they stopped,” said Singh.The condominium has barred the entry of all domestic help such as maids, cooks, drivers, car washer among others. Senior citizens who may require assistance have been asked to house their domestic help with them house or ask them to avail passes issued by the district administration. Entry for food delivery persons, meanwhile, has been restricted. All entering the building with deliveries are scanned and are required to mandatorily use sanitisers. Within the condominium, common areas are regularly sanitised. “We are ensuring that everyone including residents sanitise their hands as many times they enter the condominium. Common areas are regularly disinfected too and MCG also helps in the process,” said Singh.In view of the lockdown, the apartment has cut down the strength of its staff and is managing with a skeleton staff to keep essential services running. The staff has been provided with boarding and lodging facilities within the condominium to reduces the chance of exposure from outside. “The number of staff at the condominium has been reduced to curtail unnecessary movement. We have made arrangements for the staff to stay within the condominium. Cooked meals are provided to them and we have tied-up with a food delivery service for the same,” said Singh. Security guards have also been provided with protective gear including masks and gloves.The condominium has grocery and vegetable shops within the complex. In addition, in the area around the general store, the floor has been marked to facilitate social distancing. “We have made circled markings on the floor at a distance of two metres from each other so that people maintain a gap while standing outside the shop. Guards are monitoring and ensure that people do not crowd. It’s difficult but people are cooperating,” said Singh. Apart from relying on the service of the grocery shop on campus, residents can also procure essential items from the MCG which delivers the items twice in a week. “We have two chemist shops adjacent to the society. People can simply call the chemist shops and the medicines are delivered. The security persons or volunteer deliver the medicines till the apartments,” said Singh. He added that most residents had been compliant of the restrictions in place and so far, people had managed by helping each other out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/in-raheja-vedaanta-common-areas-within-society-also-remain-off-limits/story-WuKauLiXnlNpP2lIgI6Z4K.html

Any person violating this directive will be fined ₹1,000, on the spot by MCG officials,” Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, said.MCG officials said that no specific teams will be formed for this task; however, sanitation officials and those engaged in essential services will be empowered to fine violators if they spot them anywhere in the city.As per MCG officials, if a violator does not have the fine amount with him or her, then they need to submit an identification card such as UID, license, passport, with the official as surety and recover it after paying the fine.Officials said that in the eventuality that a violator does not possess any identification card with them at the time, then a photo of the violator would be clicked by the MCG official, along with their address, family details, and mobile number to ensure the amount is recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-fine-gurugram-residents-1-000-for-urinating-or-spitting-in-public/story-cB0lZqvYXwLBOWcrG6UEAL.html
23-04-2020||Noida||Commuters screened at Delhi-Noida borders, media persons to be issued passes||A day after the administration issued an order to seal the Delhi-Gautam Budh Nagar borders to contain the spread of coronavirus in the district, all commuters at the major entry/exit points were screened on Wednesday for any Covid-19 symptoms, officials said. Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said that the enforcement of lockdown at the Delhi-Noida borders is strict. “Teams from health department also conduct thermal screening at the borders and return people if they have any symptoms of Covid -19,” he said. The officials said that no traffic chaos was witnessed on the borders due to proper arrangements by the police.The sealing order was issued on Tuesday under the National Disaster Act 2005. The decision was taken based on a report submitted by the health department which suggested that the travelling by people to and from Delhi increases the chances of spreading the infection in the district.On Wednesday, GB Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh reviewed the lockdown preparations in the district and directed police officers to ensure that the vehicles be properly checked at the check posts.On the issue of cross-border travel of media persons, the district administration and Noida police issued a joint press statement saying that they held discussion over the issue and it has been resolved.The statement issued by district magistrate Suhas L Y and the police commission said that they would issue passes to media persons commuting between Delhi and Noida from Friday. “We have received 17 applications from media persons for the passes. More applications/emails are expected to come that will also be processed. We have decided that on Thursday, entry of media personnel will be based on their official identity cards. From Friday, they would be required to produce the passes issued by the administration and their official ID cards,” it said.The district administration clarified that the transportation of newspapers falls under the essential goods and hence it does not require any pass.The police commissioner also directed cops to ensure social distancing among people during Ramzan, which will start from Friday. He asked the officials to hold meetings with influential persons from respective areas to ensure that people follow the lockdown orders.Sankalp Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said that all kinds of social, cultural, and religious gatherings are prohibited in the lockdown period. “We have contacted Muslim clerics and sensitized them over the issue. They are informing people in their neighborhoods to maintain social distancing, and pray and have iftar at home in Ramzan,” he said.The police commissioner also suggested conducting surprise checks of the check posts by senior police officers to make sure that personnel are not negligent of duty. He also said that all police personnel on duty must wear masks and gloves, and use sanitizer.“Patrolling should be done at main roads, inside sectors and villages through PCR vans and motorcycles. The police officers should also monitor wheat procurement centres and ensure that farmers do not face any inconvenience in reaching these centres,” he said. On Wednesday, the district police booked 23 persons and registered seven cases for lockdown violations. The police also issued challans to 312 vehicles and seized four vehicles. The police teams are conducting checks at 200 spots across the district, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/commuters-screened-at-delhi-noida-borders-media-persons-to-be-issued-passes/story-KkkfTpefmvnBmbLTILL2lN.html
23-04-2020||Gurugram||Well-stocked Gurugram civic body shares protective gear||Officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Wednesday said they have sufficient stock of gloves, masks and personal protective equipment (PPE), and have started sharing the gear with Mewat and Faridabad, where there is a shortage. Last week, the municipal corporation distributed over 10,000 masks and gloves, each, to the local administration and municipal bodies of Mewat and Faridabad.Since March 25, the MCG has been storing protective gear at its central facility in Sector 42. As per a report on April 20, a copy of which is with HT, the civic body has 550,000 hand gloves, 250,000 face masks, 15,000 hand sanitizers and 1,600 PPE kits.Besides these, the MCG also has a stock of around 7,500 litres of sodium hypochlorite solution, 260 bodysuits, 2,400 eye care glasses, 500 pieces of face shields, 200 dead body kits, and 1,000 pieces each of head and shoe covers. MCG officials said that they have, so far, issued over 300,000 gloves and masks, each. MCG officials said they have been able to maintain a stock due to advance preparation and fewer coronavirus cases in Gururgam, compared to neighbouring Delhi. Gurugram has so far recorded 45 cases of the coronavirus disease, in comparison to 2,248 confirmed cases in Delhi, as of Tuesday. Hariom Attri, joint commissioner of MCG, who is also the nodal officer of the civic body’s central store, said that between March 20 and 25, even prior to the opening of the central store, a large stock of PPE kits, gloves, masks, and hand sanitisers was distributed by the MCG to the workers of health department, district administration, GMDA, HSVP, and Gurugram police officials.“We made advance preparations to combat the coronavirus disease and started stocking up in early March. Simultaneously, we also appealed to private companies to donate such items under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative, and managed to procure a large stock of items over time from them,” said Attri. He said that since the central store was opened, protective equipment has been largely dispatched to adjoining districts of Faridabad and Mewat.“Last week, we distributed over 10,000 masks and gloves, each, to the local administration and municipal bodies of Mewat and Faridabad, where their supply was running low. Even within the city, the few times there has been a requirement, we have distributed items immediately. We ensured that we are in a position where there will be ample supply to initiate preventive measures against the spread of the infection if the situation in the city worsens on the lines of Delhi, where the cases have been higher in number,” said Attri, who said that the MCG is also open to sharing stock with other cities that have a requirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/as-demand-for-protective-gear-rises-gurugram-jumps-to-rescue/story-w1XWCuyhiVHZAOIuUQ2SKP.html
23-04-2020||Noida||Noida sees cleanest Earth Day since active pollution monitoring began in 2018||With Wednesday marking the 50th anniversary of ‘Earth Day’ – a day that aims at enhancing environmental education and awareness -- Noida saw the cleanest Earth Day in the past three years with particle and gaseous pollutants well within prescribed limits. According to data assessed through the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 88 or ‘satisfactory’ on Wednesday, against 168 or ‘moderate’ the same day last year, and 262 or ‘poor’ in 2018.Interestingly, while the theme for 2020 is climate action, it’s not the mitigation measures taken by the authorities but rather the nationwide lockdown that has given the city the cleanest Earth Day since active monitoring of the pollution levels began in 2018.According to the data assessed, the average PM2.5 for Noida for Earth Day 2020 was 54.9 microgrammes per cubic metres (Ug/m3), against 78.97 Ug/m3 on Earth Day 2019, and 98.46 Ug/m3 in 2018. The PM2.5, or particles with diameter less than 2.5 microns, are coarse particle pollutants produced from industrial and vehicular emissions. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 Ug/m3, going by national standards.The average PM10 also dropped, though not under the prescribed limit just yet, with Wednesday seeing an average of 111.84 Ug/m3, while last year the same was 203.24 Ug/m3, and in 2018 it was 280.21 Ug/m3. The PM10 safe limit is 100 Ug/m3, going by national standards.The gaseous pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which comes from industrial and vehicular fuel combustion, however, fluctuated. Wednesday saw an average of 21.61 Ug/m3 of NO2, while the day in 2019 saw 18.19 Ug/m3 and 2018 saw 29.45Ug/m3 in NO2 values. The safe limit for NO2 is 40 Ug/m3 for industrial areas and 30 Ug/m3 for eco-sensitive zones, going by national standards.Though the lockdown has reduced pollution levels due to lesser vehicular movement and industrial activities, experts believe they will spike sharply when the lockdown is over.“One of the major reasons the air is cleaner is the reduction in the vehicular movement. However, there are chances that the pollution levels will spike sharply after the lockdown is over, people might prefer personal vehicles and avoid public transport in fear of the pandemic. The government has to ensure trust among people to ensure that public transport areas are safe. Also, local authorities must work on parking policies to discourage private vehicle movement,” said Shambhavi Shukla, senior project associate, air quality, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said.According to Noida-based environmentalist Vikrant Tongad, strict measures would be required to minimise the likely risk of sharp spike in pollution.“The air quality will obviously deteriorate after the lockdown is over. In such a case, the best that could be done is to minimise the impact of pollution on the local environment. The authorities will have to implement proper waste management rules, for both industrial and local waste, and ensure that industrial effluents are not discharged into rivers. Also there has to be accountability, so in case pollution levels spike, there could be liable agencies that could be held accountable,” said Tongad.According to officials, while taking cars off the road has had a major impact on pollution levels, the post lockdown scenario will depend on the meteorological conditions.“It’s obvious that the pollution levels will as the lockdown is in place, as the major reason (for emissions) is vehicles. You take the vehicles off the road and pollution drops. However, it also depends on the meteorological conditions. There would be a spike in pollution levels once the lockdown is over, but meteorological conditions will play a major role in controlling them,” said Utsav Sharma, environment engineer, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board.“Though Covid-19 is the major crisis that we are handling currently, the authority is already doing a lot of sprinkling for sanitisation, which also acts as a pollution cutting measures. There are a number of measures to be taken post lockdown, which are currently on hold due to the ongoing pandemic, such as water sprinkling, grassing and massive plantation. Controlling pollution will be our priority,” said Rajeev Tyagi, general manager, Noida Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-sees-cleanest-earth-day-since-active-pollution-monitoring-began-in-2018/story-U79HlssjUkJv4haQ4dfgFK.html
23-04-2020||Delhi||Domestic violence cases down, says Delhi govt; DCW warns can’t draw any conclusion||Delhi women and child development minister Rajendra Pal Gautum on Wednesday said the number of domestic violence cases being reported in the city had come down during the lockdown period. Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal, who had shared the data with the department, however, said though the number of calls being received on its 181 helpline of crimes against women had decreased, no definite conclusion can be drawn on its basis. “This is mainly because it can be assumed that victims might be hesitant in reporting the crimes due to fear or inability to move away from the perpetrator to seek help,” said Maliwal. The minister held a meeting with officials of his department and with the DCW chief to discuss the situation days after the National Commission for Women (NCW) had reported a spike in the number of cases of domestic violence in Delhi. The nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 was announced on March 24.The DCW said it had received 337 calls of domestic violence between April 7 and April 20, as compared to 808 calls between March 12 and March 25. A statement issued by Gautum’s office said, “Upon analysis of the calls received by the Commission’s 181 Women Helpline, it has been observed that there has been no rising trend in domestic violence cases being reported on the helpline.”On the contrary, it added, that the number of cases reported to the Commission had decreased. Under the normal course, the 181 helpline receives between 1500-1800 calls per day. According to DCW chief, during the lockdown, the commission received a higher volume of calls between March 26 and March 31. “The commission received 4,341 calls on March 27, 5522 calls on March 28 and more than 3,000 calls on March 29-30. Most of these calls were regarding confusion about the imposition of the lockdown,” she said. However, she added, from April 1, the commission is again receiving around 1300 to 1500 calls per day.Along with 181 helpline number, DCW has also launched a WhatsApp Number --- +91- 9350181181 -- to register complaints regarding domestic violence.The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights also launched a helpline number -- 011- 41182977 -- for children who need any kind of mental health counselling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/domestic-violence-cases-down-says-delhi-govt-dcw-warns-can-t-draw-any-conclusion/story-QnYK0sTIAYDT3G7J0Ve9OI.html
23-04-2020||Noida||GB Nagar prepares strategy till July to fight Covid-19||A team comprising top five officials in the Gautam Budh Nagar district has developed a plan that incorporates infrastructure, resources and the consumables required to fight Covid-19 challenges till the end of July.“As part of the infrastructure, we have already developed facilities comprising 400 beds for Covid-19 patients in the district and also identified facilities with 2,000 beds for future use, along with ambulances, kits, gloves and other equipment. In terms of resources, we have brought retired government officials, retired army medical staff, Nehru Youth Centre staff and self-help groups as well as other volunteers on board. In terms of consumables, we have stocked adequate medicines and other goods required for treatment. The district is completely ready even if Covid-19 cases keep rising till July-end. The curve is on the decline here but we are ready to handle any challenge and keep people safe from the disease,” Narendra Bhooshan, CEO of the Greater Noida authority who is in charge of handling Covid-19 operations in the district, said.The five officials in the team leading the mission to fight Covid-19 in the district are the three chief executive officers from Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway industrial authorities, the district magistrate and the police commissioner. These five officials are assisted by additional CEOs in the three authorities and deputy police commissioners along with the chief medical officer and his staff.“We are working on a 2+2+2 strategy to contain the spread of the disease. Once a patient is confirmed positive, it takes two hours for our staff to identify all contacts, including family, friends, relatives, neighbours or domestic help. And in the next two hours, our teams are at the doors of all the contacts of the positive case; in another two hours, all these contacts are either transported to quarantine or put into isolation while following proper guidelines. The objective is to take immediate precaution and strictly follow protocols to ensure the infection does not spread further,” Bhooshan said. He said that they also have the capacity to test 980 Covid-19 cases daily without having to depend upon other districts.Gautam Budh Nagar teams promptly sealed the Delhi-Noida border after they realised that those who travel to Delhi are getting infected.“Strict action may inconvenience people, but the need of the hour is to completely break the chain to contain the spread of this infection,” Bhooshan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-prepares-strategy-till-july-to-fight-covid-19/story-h93Mh63OU2uny4AlOq2MUJ.html

23-04-2020||Delhi||Death of Jamaat attendee sparks protest at Sultanpuri quarantine facility||A 50-year-old man, who had participated in the Tablighi Jamaat at the Nizamuddin Markaz last month and was housed at a quarantine facility in northwest Delhi’s Sultanpuri, died on Wednesday morning. The death triggered protests by the occupants of the facility. The occupants staged a sit-in inside the compound, alleging that the man, a diabetic patient, died as he did not receive medical attention and food on time. A number of videos of the protests were circulated on social media and messaging platforms as well.A relative of the person who died, also an occupant of the facility, said the man, an engineer from Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore, had tested negative for Covid-19 but was not sent home despite completing his quarantine.“He was diabetic and needed to take his medicines after proper meals, which has been an issue at the facility. There were long gaps in the meals and even medicines are not available. The ambulance arrived late, even though I had been calling up the authorities for long,” said the relative, who had attended the Jamaat congregation with the man and was lodged at the facility with him. Confirming the death, a North West district official said that the person died around 11am, when he was being shifted in an ambulance to be taken to a hospital and that he was given medicines when he fell unwell. “His body has been sent for a post-mortem examination,” the official said.Dispelling allegations of food not being served on time, the official said, “There are 700 people at the facility. There is a standard protocol for serving food to Covid and suspected patients. We are trying to provide food on time, but there could be a delay of 15-30 minutes. Yesterday (Tuesday), a lot of new patients were shifted to this facility. As per protocol, we have to stop other activities when new patients are shifted.”Hafiz Javed, a Delhi-based social activist, said that the government must arrange transport for people who have completed their quarantine period to their home towns or shift them to mosques, where they can be provided with proper food and medicines. “Now that Ramzan will start from April 25, it will become really difficult for them to live at the quarantine facilities, as one needs to follow a different routine during the fasting period. The government must ensure steps are taken to resolve the issue at the earliest,” said Javed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/death-of-jamaat-attendee-sparks-protest-at-sultanpuri-quarantine-facility/story-QBrt6FmObxRkonx06Bi6FI.html
23-04-2020||Delhi||Video calling a luxury for family of Covid-19 infected hospital staffer in Delhi||When a 46-year-old janitor of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC)’s Charak Palika Hospital fell ill around the end of March, his family of 12 took great pains to isolate him at their rented two-room set in Moti Bagh. “We cleared an entire room for my father. It was difficult for 11 of us to adjust in the other room, but we had to do it for everyone’s safety,” his son said.But that compromised way of living was clearly not enough to escape the infection.On April 4, the oldest of this 12-member family, which belongs to Samastipur in Bihar, tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Three days later, four more—his wife, son, daughter and daughter-in-law—were found to be infected. A fortnight later, members of this family feel they were better off staying packed in one room. “After the test results arrived, my father was sent to AIIMS in Jhajjar. My mother, sister, brother and wife are in different wards of Lok Nayak Hospital,” said the son, who is a janitor, as are his father and brother at the same hospital.The other seven, including his two-year-old son and his sister’s two daughters—who are two years’ and two months’ old—were quarantined in a facility in South Delhi’s Chhattarpur.The only good news they got in the last fortnight came from doctors who allowed the three children to stay with their mothers in the same ward. “The children would keep crying. We struggled to console them. They also needed their mothers’ milk. It was impossible to keep the crying children with us at the quarantine centre. The mothers requested the doctors to let their children stay with them. They allowed the children to stay with their mothers in the same wards, but sleep on different beds and get tested frequently. So far, the children have undergone three tests and all have turned out to be negative,” the man said. However, there is little else to cheer up the family. In fact, they can communicate with each other only occasionally. “My father who is hospitalised in Jhajjar doesn’t receive mobile network. When he does, the calls keep getting disconnected midway,” he said.The only other members of this family who own a mobile phone are his wife, his sister and him. “When I want to speak to my mother or brother, I call the patient next to them. Sometimes they connect us to them, other times they get irritated,” he said.Unlike many other patients and quarantined people who spend their time video calling each other, such a facility is a luxury for this family. As it turns out, only this man owns a smartphone while the three others have basic phones. “If another patient obliges me with a video call, I get to see my family members from a distance. We wave at each other, but can’t talk from such a distance,” the man said. He feels that his father was infected first while going about his janitorial duties at the hospital. “He may have come in contact with some infected patients or staffer,” he said.But a senior NDMC officer said that the man’s wife also worked in a similar role at the AIIMS trauma centre. “Since both of them worked at hospitals, the doctors aren’t able to say whether the man passed on the infection to his wife or the other way round,” the officer said.In any case, his father’s test result was followed by the immediate testing of the other members of the family. “On April 7, we were returning home from the hospital with our own test results when the police sealed off our building. We had to leave for the hospital and quarantine centre with just the clothes we were wearing. We couldn’t take our phone chargers or even essentials,” he said.At the quarantine centre, the man says, he and his three relatives wash their clothes at night and wear them the next day. “Thankfully, we are provided with soaps to bathe,” he said.He also values his smartphone a little more than he did earlier. “When we walked into the quarantine centre, my phone was taken away. It was returned to me after five days. Now, my relatives and I take turns to use the phone to make calls and watch films. Sometimes I play songs for the four of us in quarantine,” he said. On Wednesday, a fortnight since the four of them were quarantined, they sat worrying.“We were told we would be tested after 14 days. But that hasn’t taken place. We don’t know if they plan to let us go anytime soon,” he said.This is also a time when this family has been remembering God more. “It feels like our family has been destroyed. So, we chant God’s name. And sometimes we sing bhajans together”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/communicating-with-each-other-a-luxury-for-this-family-eight-are-in-hospitals-four-in-quarantine/story-M1m7bsvREebqj7afyHUFRM.html
23-04-2020||Delhi||Six cops in Jahangirpuri test positive after duty in red zone||New Delhi: A day after four constables in central Delhi’s Nabi Karim containment zone tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), six more Delhi Police policemen from north-west Delhi’s Jahangirpuri were found positive on Tuesday evening, highlighting how front-line workers are vulnerable to the pathogen.All the six police personnel were asymptomatic, and have been moved to isolation units, where they are being monitored and treated, the police said.The total number of infected Delhi Police personnel in the city is now 26. Deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Vijayanta Arya said the six policemen — two assistant sub-inspectors (ASI) and four constables —were on duty in and around the Jahangirpuri containment zone. He added that the wife of one of the infected police personnel also tested positive for Covid-19. She displayed symptoms, and is also in isolation.“The wife of one of the ASIs has also been tested positive. They have all have been moved to isolation and are under treatment. We are tracing all those who may have been in contact with these people. We have disinfected and sanitised the police station, as four of the constables used to live in the barracks,” Arya said.The Delhi government has imposed a hard lockdown in 89 containment zones, or “red” zones, where people are not allowed to step out of their homes and authorities are home-delivering essentials. These zones are guarded by policemen who control the pickets at all entry and exit pickets.Eight police personnel from Chandni Mahal police station in central Delhi had tested positive for the virus over the past week. Two of them tested positive on April 14, one on April 15, and the rest on April 18. The police station, which falls in a containment zone, was sealed.A second senior officer said that the Jahangirpuri police station did not need to be sealed because no one other than the six who tested positive on Tuesday were suffering from the disease. “Everyone is being examined. Even the six policemen who tested positive were asymptomatic, but all necessary precautions are being taken. They were on duty near Jahangirpuri’s B and C blocks, which fall under the containment zones. The source of infection to these policemen is yet to be identified. We are in the process of tracing their contacts, and every person who was in touch with the six is being monitored regularly by dedicated medical staff,” said the second officer cited above who asked not to be named.Of the 80 police personnel from the Nabi Karim police station in central Delhi screened, four tested Covid-19 positive on Monday. They four were also asymptomatic.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia said that, as of Wednesday, over 200 police personnel from Nabi Karim and Chandni Mahal police stations have been tested; 12 were positive, 140 negative, and the reports of the remaining 48 were pending.“Some of these policemen who had dealt with people who had gone to the Markaz,” Bhatia said, referring to the gatherings in March at the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in the Nizamuddin Basti, which has emerged as India’s biggest Covid-19 cluster.Of the 26 Delhi Police personnel found positive so far in the city, an assistant sub-inspector in the traffic police, who was the first to be diagnosed on date, was discharged from hospital last Friday. Two deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) in the south-west district, and 300 personnel of other ranks who had come in contact with the infected people, are currently in home quarantine.Additionally, 72 personnel of the Delhi Police’s anti-terror wing, the special cell, isolated themselves on Tuesday after a head constable posted with the unit was tested positive for the disease on Sunday. He was admitted to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital on April 11, after being found symptomatic. “Following the standard protocol, 72 police personnel who had come in contact with him were asked to go into self-quarantine. They will also be tested,” said an officer from the special cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/six-more-policemen-test-covid-positive-in-delhi-total-number-up-to-26/story-ikq6uu318tV34pPVxNt9KI.html

23-04-2020||Delhi||North Delhi sanitation staff unpaid for March; MCD, govt trade blame||Nearly 27,000 sanitation workers employed with the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, and mostly deployed on Covid-19 duty, have not got their salaries for the month of March. The workers said they have been struggling to sustain their families and most have run out of whatever little savings they had been dipping into.The north corporation, on its part, blamed the Delhi government for its inability to pay its staffers and said it was yet to receive the quarterly funds from the AAP-led government. On Wednesday, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly, wrote to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urging him to immediately release funds to the corporation.“The financial condition of the north corporation is most serious. Due to an acute shortage of funds, it has not been able to pay salaries to its overall staff of 57,000 and 24,000 pensioners. I urge the CM to provide immediate financial assistance to the civic body,” Singh wrote.North corporation commissioner Varsha Joshi said, “We are waiting for funds to be released by the Delhi government in order to disburse salaries.” However, the Delhi government refuted the civic body’s claims. “These claims are baseless. All dues have been paid. It is unfortunate that the BJP ( which rules the civic bodies) is playing politics in such difficult times, especially when the Delhi government is fully cooperating and working with the Centre to tackle the spread of Covid-19,” a government spokesperson said.cash-strapped corporation is now exploring the option of seeking donations from the public, on the lines of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) that put out an appeal on its website seeking financial help from people to meet expenses incurred on Covid-19 related arrangements. “The SDMC requests all to generously contribute by transferring funds to (this) account...,” read the appeal put out on its website last week.The SDMC said it needed funds as the workload has multiplied and so has the requirement for disinfectants and PPE kits.SDMC chief spokesperson Radha Krishan said, “Our work entails huge expenditure. We have 112 health centres that include general dispensaries, specialised chest/respiratory diseases clinics and maternity centres. Besides these, we also run quarantine centres in areas such as Bakkarwala and at the Poornima Sethi Hospital. We have 37 containment zones where we are carrying out extensive disinfection drives. We need money for these.” The civic body, however, did not comment on how much money it has so far managed to crowd source. The North corporation, on its part, manages six big municipal hospitals, including Bara Hindu Rao hospital, a designated Covid screening centre. Joshi said, “We are in need of money and have had elaborate discussions over whether we should start accepting donations on the lines of the SDMC. However, we felt that it could get complicated. Instead, we are taking donations in kind --- in hand sanitisers, gloves, masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits.”With civic agencies struggling for funds, the worst-hit are the sanitation workers who are at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19.Sooraj (who goes by the first name), 33, employed in the corporation’s Civil Lines zone, said he had to take a loan of ₹5,000 to buy ration and other essentials for his family of six. “I make ₹ 12,200 a month and am not able to save much. I have not got my salary for March. Is this what we deserve after risking our lives every day collecting hazardous waste during the pandemic?” he said. The sanitation workers’ union has raised the matter with the municipal authorities. “They told us they were waiting for funds (from the government). The workers risk their lives every day by going out to collect garbage even from houses under quarantine as well as medical facilities. Is this how the government will reward them? Most of them are unable to arrange two proper meals for their families,” Vijender Bagdi, head of Akhil Bhartiya Safai Mazdoor Sangh, north Delhi, said.He added that the workers are not given any protective gear such as gloves or masks while handling waste from houses and garbage collection points and they are at high risk of catching the contagious infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-corporation-sanitation-workers-not-paid-salaries-for-march-civic-body-says-govt-yet-to-release-funds/story-QDmKuNDcPZvTxVty8qVQ2I.html

23-04-2020||Chandigarh||Biomedical waste collectors lift garbage from houses of quarantined residents||Amid row over collection of garbage from the houses of the residents who have been home quarantined, a team of biomedical waste collectors on Wednesday lifted garbage from 15 such houses that come under zone-A of the municipal corporation (MC). It came as a big relief for the quarantined families as garbage was piling up at their houses since they were quarantined.The team, under the supervision of MC joint commissioner Swati Tiwana and secretary Jasdev Sekhon, wore coverall suits and ensured all necessary precautions during the process. Earlier, the MC staff had demanded that they should not be forced to collect garbage from the houses of those residents who have been self-quarantined fearing the virus could transmit through the garbage. They had also claimed that the MC staff was not trained to carry out the process safely. It was then decided that the company, which has been awarded the contract to dispose the biomedical waste in the city, would collect the garbage and dispose the same at the biomedical waste plant on Tajpur Road. In four zones of the city, there are 89 houses where the residents have been home quarantined. The civic body has decided to take up the garbage collection in phases, MC officials said.“Garbage was collected with full precautions by the team of biomedical waste collectors and houses in other zones will be covered in the coming days,” the MC secretary said.Ensure regular sanitisation of sabzi mandis, banks: MC chiefMeanwhile, MC commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar, during a meeting with the officials of operations and maintenance branch, directed the officials to ensure regular sanitisation of the vegetable markets (sabzi mandis) and banks. As per the reports, it is suspected that ACP Anil Kohli who passed away after getting infected from to the virus, had contracted the virus while he was deputed at the main vegetable market near Jalandhar bypass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/biomedical-waste-collectors-lift-garbage-from-houses-of-quarantined-residents/story-6CXufwgjFmd70yZRuKRTWL.html

23-04-2020||Chandigarh||Unruly scenes amid free ration distribution at Chandigarh’s Mauli Jagran||UT’s social distancing and curfew curbs went for a toss as hundreds of residents at Mauli Jagran Complex near Manimajra jostled for free ration being distributed by the department of food supplies and consumer affairs on Wednesday morning. While several border points remain sealed and more stringent curbs have been put in place after Centre declared Chandigarh a red zone, there is no check on public movement in colonies and slums. Right before the announcement for free ration on Wednesday morning, people went out of control, filling up the entire 2km Railway Road stretch where delivery vehicles had stopped for distribution of ration. Police had a tough time dispersing the crowd and sending them back indoors.POLICE BLAMES FOOD DEPT BUT NO FIRJustifying the rush, area food inspector Manish Sawhney told HT that people often go out of control when they get something for the first time. “The colony has 1,600 beneficiaries under the public distribution system. The process was smooth later in the evening. We will complete the distribution in three days,” he claimed. However, UT senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nilambari Jagadale said the staff of food and supply department had no list of beneficiaries, and just gathered the public. “We immediately wound up the operation to bring order and dispersed the crowd. The staff was asked to return with the necessary preparations and list of beneficiaries,” she said. Later, Mauli Jagran SHO Juldan Singh said they immediately brought the situation under control as the matter came into their notice. However, no case was registered.NOT A FIRST Incidents like these are commonplace everyday as ration is distributed in various area of the city. Dadumajra councillor Farmilla Devi said there were similar scenes near the police station in her ward. “All people were summoned at the time same, leading to a crowd. While police had a tough time controlling the crowd, several residents had to return empty-handed,” she added.Councillor Satish Kainth said while the city had been under lockdown for a month, the administration had still not figured out crowd management in colonies. “UT adviser Manoj Parida had promised a coupon system some days ago, but the system has not been implemented on the ground,” he said. Congress local president Pardeep Chhabra blamed the ruling BJP for mismanagement and making a mockery of the poor in the lockdown. While UT food supplies secretary Vinod P Kavle refused to comment, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore told Kavle at the daily review meeting to ensure beneficiaries were intimated in advance and social distancing was adhered to during distribution of ration.The food supplies department so far claims to have provided ration to 24,000 of the 64,000 registered beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unruly-scenes-amid-free-ration-distribution-at-chandigarh-s-mauli-jagran/story-QvC3pCUmXb2LIGkH9re8OP.html

23-04-2020||Pune||As parents learn to deal with work and children during the lockdown, new relationship dimensions emerge||The spread of the Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to remain indoors due to the lockdown and with the lockdown, comes spending the entire day at home. This routine is new for working professionals, college students and even school-going children. The most challenging part is how to spend quality time with family during the lockdown without clashes, arguments and fights between parents and children. Parenting counsellors and mental health physiologists have been receiving many calls daily during the lockdown to get help on how to tackle children. Dr Anjali Chaudhary of Sangopan-The Art of Parenting, a child counsellor and parenting coach, said, “Since the lockdown has begun, I have received more than 50 calls from parents who want help on how to tackle children. Along with small kids, even the teens and college-going children are easily irritated being locked inside their homes. Parents have to face mood swings, anger and other issues related to children. There are online classes for children, parents work from home, the domestic chores adds to the problems. Parenting has become tougher and people need to understand its basics to deal with it better.”Neha Mundhada, a banking professional and a parent, says, “The lockdown has defined the parent-child relationship in new ways. First few days were spent nicely as we always wanted to spend more time with the children and vice-versa. So, there was no routine and we were happy and busy fulfilling all their demands of food, play time, among other things. But when the work from home pressure started pilling up which has webinars, video calls, audio con calls, and my child didn’t get enough attention and he started with his tantrums. So, we decided that we should have a routine which we had before the lockdown for everyone in the house and we will have to include our child in every activity we do and made a timetable for household work, office work, study time, TV time and family play time. Thee routine helps us do our work and also keeps him engaged.” Some of the measures which Dr Chaudhary suggests is that children should be kept engaged at all times, not only visually but creatively as well. Parents should encourage their hobbies at home, involve them in domestic chores to develop a sense of responsibility towards the household and spend time bonding with them, she adds. Another senior physiologist Dr Anand Nadkarni, a mental health consultant and managing trustee of Institutes for Physiological Help (IPH), Pune and Thane, says that teaching moral lessons should always be included in bonding exercises. “Bonding time can also be doing nothing together. Your kids do not have to learn a moral lesson each time they spend time with you. Time is a very neutral commodity, how we use that time is the goal that we have to set. In a family, parents have to plan their individual goals and should also include their children in planning their family time. Family time can include a healthy dose of time pass.”Family time should include edutainment time (combination of education and entertainment), action time (delegation of work) and personal time for each member, he adds. The biggest challenge for parents during the lockdown is to convince kids that they should not go out and play, maintain social distance and wash hands, says advocate Sheetal Lokhande Waghchoure. “Also, since there is no going out to restaurants, mothers have to take extra effort to prepare tasty food at home. Parks are shut, swimming pools are closed too and this brings in a lot of pent up energy in young kids, which makes parenting tough now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/as-parents-learn-to-deal-with-work-and-children-during-the-lockdown-new-relationship-dimensions-emerge/story-spmIMdyEEnNCIAUsg6gaQK.html

The key responsibility of health and medical facility in the city lies with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad speaks to HT about PMC’s role and his initiatives to handle the situation. He is the first municipal commissioner to seal the entire city using the 123-year-old Epidemic Diseases Act.What exactly is your role in this crisis? As the municipal commissioner, my main role is to coordinate with the central, state governments and various other bodies every day. The major role is to make necessary arrangements to deal with the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 disease at the city level. We have to establish adequate number of quarantine centres, acquire hospitals, hostels and create more healthcare facilities. We also have to provide personal safety equipment to the medical, sanitation and others who are fighting the disease from the frontline. How does your day begin and roll out?As the municipal commissioner’s post is a key post, it is a busy job. However, this is the biggest crisis we have faced in a century and it requires my 100%. My day starts at 6am and ends at 10pm, but coordination through the telephone goes on till late night every day. I take a half hour lunch break. I am mainly busy with coordination of various agencies, divisional commissioner, district collector, police and PMC staff. Various representatives come forward to donate items to PMC and I need to make sure these people are catered to and their items are sent to their place of need.What precautions are you taking?I am taking all precautions like using a mask, hand gloves and I wash my hands regularly and maintain social distance. However, since we are working on the front line, we cannot avoid meetings and meeting key persons. So my duty does not allow me to keep complete social isolation, but I take utmost care to follow all precautions. When returning home, I change clothes and sanitise all the things, I used throughout the day.What is your assessment of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune? How do you see it unfolding?We are well prepared to handle any situation. We can treat almost 25,000 Covid-19 patients and the capacity is being built further. Our main aim is to stop the spread. For that, we sealed the eastern part of the city in the first phase and later sealed the whole city completely. The PMC health staff is conducting the door-to-door survey and checking whether citizens have any symptoms of Covid-19. PMC is also keeping its clinic open for maximum number of hours so that residents can visit it.What gaps do you see in healthcare and relief work?We can’t claim that we don’t have gaps, but as this crisis is emerging, new challenges crop up every day and we are trying to address the issue immediately. There is good coordination among all the government departments and within the PMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-covid-19-crisis-evolves-each-day-but-we-resolve-new-challenges-immediately-says-pune-civic-chief/story-096EXxsSR52e6rSkZhrZlM.html

23-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s Azadpur mandi trader dies of Covid-19, sellers demand market be shuttered||The Azadpur wholesale fruit and vegetable market reported its first Covid-19 related death after a 57-year old jackfruit and pea trader died on Tuesday. The death uncovered two more Covid-19 cases linked to the Azadpur Mandi, creating panic among sellers who demanded the market’s closure and initiation of containment activities. A senior district official, however, said these were not the first Covid-19 cases to be reported from the Mandi. “The 57-year-old man was confirmed positive on Monday after his sample was collected on April 19. He is a resident of Majlis Park and was admitted to a private hospital two days prior to being tested (April 17),” district magistrate (north) Deepak Shinde said.Late on Tuesday, Shinde said the number of people who would need to be put under quarantine was not yet known as surveillance teams were still preparing a list of people from the Mandi and his family who came in contact with the deceased. “He had a business partner, who is also being contacted,” a senior official said. A second senior official from the district, however, said this was not the first instance that someone from Azadpur Mandi has tested positive for Covid-19. “Earlier, a tomato dealer from Shalimar Bagh and a cauliflower seller who had left for his hometown in UP’s Ghonda were both found positive. So, rigorous contact tracing is on,” said the official who did not wish to be named. Meanwhile, traders demanded a complete lockdown of the market. “The authorities are being very negligent about Covid-19 spread in the market. We urge the government to shut the market for the time being. We are ready to do business in the open while adhering to all social distancing norms and regulations at Japanese Park or any other big stadium,” said Anil Malhotra, a trader. The DM said the shop of the 57-year old Covid-19 deceased and its surrounding areas have been cordoned off. “Other containment measures will be decided and put in place Wednesday,” he said. The Covid-19 death comes a day after the Delhi government allowed the Azadpur Mandi--Asia’s largest fruit and vegetable wholesale market—to operate round-the-clock. CROWD CONTROLEarlier on Tuesday, the first day after the government’s announcement of running the Azadpur Mandi 24x7, the police and civil defence volunteers had a tough time controlling crowds as many people jumped the boundary to enter the Mandi. The situation, however, was soon brought under control as 900 civil defence volunteers (CDV) were deployed along the market’s boundary.The police have deployed drones for continuous monitoring and have warned people that violators would be booked. The market traders’ association has also installed loudspeakers to remind people to maintain physical distancing. Gauging the severity of the situation in the market at a time when the city-state of Delhi, which has the second highest number of coronvirus cases in the country at 2,156, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal personally took stock of the situation and directed officials to ensure “no crowding, including vehicular traffic” occurs in the area.Union minister of state (home) G Kishan Reddy also inspected the mandi on Tuesday and reviewed the arrangements in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus, while ensuring the measure achieves its purpose—to help farmers sell their produce and minimise the prices of vegetables which have witnessed a hike due to the ongoing lockdown.Senior Delhi police officers said hundreds of supply trucks and tempos queued up outside the entry gate in the early hours of Tuesday but the situation was “like any other day” before the lockdown. The long queues did not affect the traffic as Delhi remains under lockdown and the roads were largely empty, police said.Under the new arrangement, which came into effect Monday night, entry of only 1,000 persons is allowed every four hours in the market. While fruits and vegetables will be sold between 6am and 10 pm, trucks have been allowed entry from 10pm to 6am. However, on Tuesday, aside from the traders and farmers, the wholesale market saw a huge rush of people who thronged the place after hearing that it would remain open 24x7.“A large number of people living in and around Azadpur came to buy vegetables and fruits for their daily needs. We are allowing entry only through tokens and e-passes, the distribution of which is highly regulated. But a lot of people entered the market by climbing its boundary walls; one side of the grilled fencing was also damaged because of people trying to break in,” a senior officer deputed at the market said on the condition of anonymity.“The crowd was brought under control by late afternoon. We have deployed 900 police and CDVs all along the boundaries of the Azadpur mandi. The situation is under control,” Adil Khan, chairperson of the Azadpur agriculture produce market committee, said, adding that the biggest challenge being faced was that of social distancing.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said the police have put adequate arrangements in place.“Because it’s a vast area that will now be active around the clock, we are using drones for monitoring. The APMC has put in place a mechanism to operate while following social distancing. It will be made sure that all vendors and customers who come are properly sanitized even during the late night hours. We have our deployment to ensure that APMC’s mechanism isn’t violated. Any violation that is reported will be followed by legal action,” Arya said.APMC head Khan said at least 50 public announcement systems have been procured for constantly reminding people about the importance of physical distancing and to maintain law and order.“Besides, six teams have been deployed to do continuous video recording of all activities inside the market. This is being done so people realise they are being watched and it acts as a deterrent to violate the lockdown rules. The footage also helps us think of new regulatory measures,” he said.Khan added that disinfection tunnel that was installed at the entry and exit of the Azadpur mandi has now been discontinued.Measure comes after the Union ministry of health and family welfare in an advisory on Monday urged local administrations to avoid using disinfectant tunnels, which spray sodium hypochlorite over individuals in order to disinfect them. “Spraying an individual or group with chemical disinfectants is physically and psychologically harmful,” the ministry said.The Delhi government has written to the Centre asking for a better chemical solution that could be used for disinfection of humans, Khan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/trader-at-asia-s-largest-wholesale-veggie-market-dies-of-covid-two-more-cases-reported-from-azadpur-mandi/story-C8EjvVp4nrvXXgdPXkQeWM.html
23-04-2020||Delhi||Vasant Vihar: A neighbourhood that works together to protect each other||The well-maintained lanes of south Delhi’s upscale Vasant Vihar, once lively with the chatter of morning walkers, cyclists zooming through, and children hurrying to school, are now enveloped by a comfortable silence.Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) prompted governments to announce a lockdown across the national capital, the residents of Vasant Vihar have come up with a plan for their neighbourhood, ensuring that people stay at home while their everyday needs are taken care of.From introducing helpline numbers for ordering essential commodities such as groceries and vegetables to clearing all doubts about the pandemic, and even issuing regular advisories for its residents, the residents’ welfare association of Vasant Vihar is going all out to make sure that their campus remains free of infection. Gurpreet Bindra, the president of the Vasant Vihar residents’ welfare association (RWA) says that besides the RWA they have formed a volunteer group of over 700 youngsters, who call themselves ‘Vasant Vihar Divas’, and are addressing various aspects related to the pandemic.“When this pandemic broke out, we wanted to reach out to our residents in every possible way. We believe in working with the people of our neighbourhood instead of trying to impose a lockdown. With an efficient plan, we are ensuring that people remain comfortably at home and we all stay protected,” Bindra says.For instance, the community has selected professional experts from the neighbourhood, and made Covid-19 management teams. A dedicated helpline has been introduced for the residents, through which doctors and healthcare professionals in the area help locals get correct information about the disease and its spread as well as address their concerns. Similarly, there is a legal and neighbourhood dispute management team and a senior citizens’ group, each tasked with addressing specific problems. A mental health guidance helpline is also available to help residents deal with problems of anxiety and loneliness during the lockdown. The RWA also issues regular advisories and circulates digital copies of answers to frequently asked questions by residents. “Many residents like me and my wife do not live with our children. During such a time, they can’t come here and we can’t go there. It is a difficult situation, but we are managing with the help of our neighbours. We have one house help who lives with us, but we do not want to expose him to the infection,” a 69-year-old retired army officer, MS Rathore, says.Rathore says that with the help of his neighbours, they just have to call for groceries and other essential requirements.“I do not drive these days because of an accident, so a kind gentleman from our colony has been taking my wife for her chemotherapy sessions. The neighbourhood has truly stepped up,” Rathore says.Varun Grover, the owner of a supermarket in Block C, says that they have set delivery timings for each locality, to ensure that there is no pilling of orders.“It is a well-oiled machine. Since the area is divided into blocks and the density of population is not high, each area market has assigned a two-hour window for home delivery. People living in the particular block call during their allotted time and we try to deliver the items immediately,” Grover says. This local contingency plan also includes the care of street dogs, with a section of the area’s residents feeding animals from time to time. While this exercise was being followed by residents even before Covid-19 hit the city, with residents staying indoors and markets remaining closed, the drill has become pertinent now. “Earlier, street animals could find something from local markets or residents would feed them something while they were on their walks, etc., but where would they find anything now? We have made groups, and we take turns to feed street dogs. Anyone from the neighbourhood can sponsor it. They can either pay us cash for the food or bring food,” says Sangeeta Raghuvanshi, a resident of the area. The residents of this upscale locality are also helping their lesser fortunate neighbours. The RWA has tied up with the Vasant Vihar Gurudwara, to ensure that the residents of the slum cluster near Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) get three meals a day.However, despite this effective neighbourhood plan, the residents continue to struggle with diplomatic missions, who they allege often do not abide by the rules of the lockdown. Residents say that they have written to high commissions and embassies asking them to ensure that expatriates follow the laws of the land and do not risk the health and safety of people here.“They go about their chores like it is a regular day. We have asked the local station house officer (SHO) to intervene, but nothing has happened yet,” says Suresh Goel, general secretary of Vasant Vihar Residents’ Federation.Goel says that it was imperative to impose a strict lockdown in areas like Vasant Vihar because unlike many gated neighbourhoods of Delhi, this area is open to everyone.“This is an important link to reach other parts of south Delhi. So, while in other areas you can impose rules by keeping gates shut, here it does not work,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/vasant-vihar-a-neighbourhood-that-works-together-to-protect-each-other/story-EvR9leD0nPJi8Am0s7RVcM.html
23-04-2020||Delhi||Flights are grounded yet Delhi airport ATC still at work||As soon as a cargo plane lifts off the only functional runway out of the three available at the Indira Gandhi International Airport a controller inside the Delhi’s Air Traffic Control tower leaves his chair to pace the circular room; the next scheduled departure is an hour later. He sanitizes his hands and returns to his workstation and starts arguably interacting with the only other controller in the room. The repartee is part of their routine to stay alert for the duration of their 12-hour shift. This is the scene inside the country’s busiest air traffic control tower, which used to handle an average of at least 1,300 flight operations in a day. Since the lockdown, the usual average air traffic of one flight per minute has reduced to one flight per hour. “We are used to working at a fast pace. With very little work on our platter now as compared to the time before the lockdown, it is tough to stay alert. The new routine is tough and then we will have to tune ourselves back to a more demanding situation when passenger air traffic resumes,” an air traffic controller at the IGIA, who did not wish to be named. India had suspended all international flights on March 22. Three days later, on March 25, from the first day of the nationwide lockdown now extended till May 3, all domestic flight operations were also suspended. Yet, the eyes of the air traffic control staff must stay glued to the screen; always alert.An air traffic controller directs the pilot from the moment the plane is ready for start-up at the airport of departure until the time it is parked at the destination airport.Explaining the sensitivity of their job, a controller said that an airborne plane flies at a speed of approximately 800-900kmph. “It is always a race against time. A pilot has less reaction time to see and avoid an aircraft in the vicinity. There is no room for error or risk. Distraction for a split second can lead to disaster when hundreds of people are travelling at a height of more than 30,000 feet,” the controller said.Senior officers said that because of the country’s air traffic has reduced by 96% to 98%. However, they said, that even at a time when the entire airport is shut, the air traffic controllers are working round-the-clock to ensure smooth movement of cargo, relief flights and defence flights.However, despite less work, the controllers said they can’t leave their workstations. They cannot carry their cell phones inside the tower or listen to songs or watch a movie. “The rules are strict and our work requires a lot of discipline. We can’t take our eyes off the screen even for a minute. When it was business as usual, we used to work at war-like alertness every day as there were flights every minute. Now, the average air traffic handled by the Delhi ATC is roughly around 50-60 flights a day. Even though it’s little easier now, traffic using our air space has to be monitored, which keeps us engaged,” said a controller, who wished not to be named. As all passenger aircrafts are grounded, the Delhi airport is currently using only one of its three runways. While one has been converted into a parking area for grounded aircraft, the other one is kept vacant to handle any emergency situation.Explaining the usual operations, a senior Delhi ATC officer said earlier 60 controllers used to work in one shift, but now they’re engaging only 20 controllers per shift. “Flight operations are not even 5% of what we usually witness; we are managing efficiently with 20 controllers in a shift. With this, we are keeping 40 controllers on standby at any given time. If any of the controllers show signs of an illness, we can ask the entire shift to quarantine themselves and a fresh lot of controllers is available to take over. This way we can ensure round-the-clock functioning of the ATC. Contribution of the ground handling staff, the ground controllers and other staff working to make ATC operations a success, is also commendable in these times,” the officer said, requesting anonymity. Recently, the air traffic controllers were also exempted from undergoing the mandatory breath analyzer tests to avoid any possibility of spreading the infection.Vineet Gulati, member of Air Navigation Service, said the controllers have been given face masks which they wear at all times throughout their shifts. “Since the workstations are also used by controllers in other shifts, we keep sanitizing our hands time to time and regularly fumigate the machines, equipment and furniture. Even in other areas, physical distancing rules are being followed and our staff is seated at adequate distance from each other. All necessary measures are being taken for smooth and uninterrupted functioning of the Delhi air traffic control,” Gulati said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-atc-goes-silent-as-only-select-flights-operate/story-0N2wOkaF1QWjM2wm4v83dJ.html
