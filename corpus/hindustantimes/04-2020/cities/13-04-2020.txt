13-04-2020||Lucknow||Medical stores to maintain data of people buying medicine for flu, fever||The Kanpur administration has asked the medical store owners to maintain data of people buying paracetamol and other drugs usually taken for flu-like symptoms. The move is aimed at tracking possible coronavirus suspects. ​Patients of coronavirus too show similar symptoms though doctors confirm that all those who have fever or cold aren’t necessarily infected with corona. ​Doctors, particularly general physicians running private clinics, too have been asked to maintain data of patients showing corona-related symptoms and report such cases to health authorities.​Kanpur district magistrate Brahmdev Ram Tiwari has ordered all medical stores to note down the name and details of buyers of medicines given for fever, cold and flu and provide it to officials of food and drug authority. ​Kanpur drug inspector Sandesh Kumar said all medical stores in the district had been intimated about the DM’s circular on WhatsApp. There are 6000 wholesale and drug retailers in Kanpur.“The data of buyers maintained at the medical stores would be shared with the chief medical officer (CMO) and then all such people would be tested for coronavirus infection and quarantined for a period of 14 days,” said a health department official requesting anonymity. ​Senior functionary of the Kanpur Drug Wholeseller Association Sanjay Mehrotra confirmed the circular had been received and retailers had been informed about the new directives in Kanpur. While the commissioner Kanpur Division, SM Bobde has extended this exercise to all the six districts of Kanpur division where stores would maintain data though he couldn’t be contacted despite many attempts.​Officials said that the decision to keep details of those buying drugs for fever, cough and cold was taken at the DM’s meeting with health officials two days ago in which great emphasis was laid on tracing and testing of corona suspects. ​Four testing labs for Covid-19 cases would become functional shortly in Kanpur at LLR hospital, Kanshiram Trauma Centre, Ursula Horseman hospital and Infectious Diseases hospital. ​Of the four testing facilities the first one at LLR hospital was inaugurated on Monday. The lab could test 100 samples in a day, said principal of GSVM medical college Aarti Lalchandani.​So far the samples were being sent to King George Medical University (KGMU) and Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute (SGPGI) in Lucknow. ​A senior doctor who is part of the CMO’s team said once all the four centres are operational 400 samples would be tested locally. ​“We were lagging in tests just because of our dependence on Lucknow,” the doctor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/medical-stores-to-maintain-data-of-people-buying-medicine-for-flu-fever/story-6BGb6pX0QVDYs7rIQJosPL.html
13-04-2020||Chandigarh||After 45 in a week, tricity reports no new Covid-19 case||After a sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases, from 35 to 80 in the one week since April 5, the tricity reported no fresh case on Monday.Of the 80 cases so far, 54 are in Mohali, 21 in Chandigarh and five in Panchkula. Of these, 14 patients have recovered (seven in Chandigarh, five in Mohali and two in Panchkula).It was on April 5 last when no positive case was reported in the tricity, when the tally was 35 – Chandigarh with 18 cases, Mohali 15 and Panchkula two. Since then, 37 positive patients were discovered at Dera Bassi’s Jawaharpur village, making it the biggest cluster in Punjab. The village has since been declared a containment zone, completely prohibiting movement of people. Three other villages in its vicinity remain sealed. There was no new case from the village either.The wife of the Panjab University assistant professor, who had tested positive on Friday, was given the all-clear on Monday. Their infant daughter, born on March 20, was also found negative earlier. However, the woman’s 55-year-old mother and eight-year-old daughter were found positive on Sunday. MC’s contact tracing team has traced 115 contacts of the teacher, a resident of Sector 37. Besides his four family contacts, the remaining 111 are community contacts. Four people sampled among them have tested negative.Results of two more primary contacts are awaited.A total of 296 people have been tested in Chandigarh, of which 21 have tested positive, 255 negative, seven have been discharged from city hospitals and results of 13 patients are awaited. Over 1,000 people have completed home quarantine period, while 622 remain under isolation.DISINFECTION AT JAWAHARPUR VILLAGEAfter Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi was declared a containment zone due to the sudden climb in cases, the district administration is paying special attention to extensive contact tracing and sanitisation at regular intervals. On the orders of Dera Bassi SDM Kuldeep Bawa, the third round of sanitisation was undertaken in the village on Sunday night, and every spot of the village was sprayed with sodium hypochlorite, a strong disinfectant, using a fire tender. Sanitisation is the most important aspect of the containment plan to check the spread of coronavirus. Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said they collected 14 samples from across the district on Monday and reports will be out on Tuesday. “All patients admitted in various hospitals are responding well to treatment,” he said.107 REPORTS NEGATIVE IN PANCHKULAPanchkula reported no case for the fourth day in a row. The last positive cases, three Tablighi Jamaat men, aged 80, 37 and 18, came to fore on April 9.District Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajiv Narwal said on Monday, reports of 107 samples were negative. Reports of five members of a family, who were tested on Sunday, were awaited.A man, an employee of the Haryana irrigation department and resident of Pinjore, had visited the hospital on Sunday claiming that their milkman is a relative of a Tablighi Jamaat man, who tested positive recently, and the milkman could have passed on the infection to his family.

13-04-2020||Delhi||AIIMS shuts sanitisation unit after complaints of skin irritation||A sanitisation unit at the emergency department of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi was shut four days after it was installed, due to reports of skin irritation. The unit was installed, on a trial basis, to disinfect staff dealing with coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“The unit is still very much here. But its use has been stopped, for the time being, keeping in mind the scientific evidence. A study of the literature shows that the sodium hypochlorite solution used in the sprays is not very effective for disinfection of personnel and can, sometimes, cause dermatitis (itching), if open skin is exposed,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of the hospital.What is effective, he says, is following hand and cough hygiene while taking care of general patients and using personal protective gear properly while screening or taking care of Covid-19 patients.The disinfection chamber was developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and was being “evaluated for utility” at the hospital.Each unit is in the form of a small chamber that can be used for disinfection of personnel at the areas of controlled entry and exit in hospitals, malls, office buildings and other critical installations.The decontamination is started by using a foot pedal at the entry. On entering the chamber, an electrically operated pump creates a disinfectant mist of hypo sodium chloride for disinfecting through a set of at least 20 nozzles. The mist spray is calibrated to operate for 25 seconds and stops automatically, indicating completion of the process. People undergoing disinfection need to keep their eyes shut inside the chamber.The dimensions of the enclosure are approximately 8 feet (length) x 4 feet (width) x 8 feet (height), with a drainage mechanism, a mounted roof and tanks, with a total capacity of 700 litres, at the bottom.Approximately 650 persons can pass through the chamber for disinfection until a refill is required, and about 80-100 persons can undergo the process every hour. The price of a unit is about ₹1.48 lakh.“A single unit that has been given to us by DRDO was installed at AIIMS, for the time being, to see whether it works well. It is meant for all hospital staff members who are dealing with Covid-19 management. It is a part of the hospital’s infection control practice that the staff will be disinfected before entering and exiting the hospital premises,” said Dr Sharma.If the trials proved successful, the institute had also proposed to install such units in other areas of the hospital, especially the trauma centre, which has been turned into a dedicated ward to treat Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aiims-shuts-sanitisation-unit-after-complaints-of-skin-irritation/story-V37uk5ryvjuKa1uvsWDCZI.html
13-04-2020||Chandigarh||Allow us to collect fees or you pay staff salaries: Pvt schools to Chandigarh education dept||With private schools at their wits’ end over the directive to delay collection of school fees, the Independent Schools Association (ISA) of Chandigarh on Monday wrote to the UT administrator to cite the problems arising out of the education department’s order.The ISA wrote that while private schools were prohibited from reminding parents to pay monthly fees, there was a continuous barrage from all departments to pay full and timely wages to all their employees.It demanded that the education department either withdraw the directive on delayed fees payment or pay salaries of all private school employees of Chandigarh as well as Punjab.ISA has 75 member schools of which 15 are in Punjab.“ISA demands that all monies held by the government in the form of Reserve Fund should be refunded. The bus contractors and other such staff be also allowed to collect at least 50% of their fees or else pay salaries of all the private school employees,” the letter read.The association wrote that all schools were “not for profit” organisations that had no means of income other than the students’ fees. It clarified that schools won’t be able to meet their financial obligations, such as salaries, repayment of loans, agreements for teaching aids, etc., even for April, which were to be cleared in May.Meanwhile, multiple city schools have started sending reminders to parents to pay the school fee, while offering 5% concession if the fee is paid in April. HT has copies of these reminders.Questioning these reminders, Nitin Goyal, who heads the Chandigarh Parents’ Association, said, “Schools are required by law to upload their balance sheets on their websites, but they have never complied with the law. Also, the schools must be directed to submit their monthly salary bills, excluding the profits.”ISA president HS Mamik said, “We share the balance sheets with CBSE. If we collect fees after two months, how will we pay salaries to the staff? The administration owes private schools nearly Rs 8 crore in EWS reimbursements. This is the right time to pay the dues or they should pay the staff themselves.” On his part, UT education secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said the fee collection had only been deferred. “If any parent wants to pay, there is no bar on it. But schools are expected not to insist on payment of fee. Adjoining states are doing the same, why should Chandigarh schools be any different?” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/allow-us-to-collect-fees-or-you-pay-staff-salaries-pvt-schools-to-chandigarh-education-dept/story-o8CC7LGT4pr5rm95y6ngWK.html
13-04-2020||Mumbai||CR uninstalls disinfection tunnel in Jalgaon, cites safety hazards; confusion over usage prevails among state bodies||Less than a week after the Central Railways (CR) set up a disinfection chamber at a loco shed in Bhusaval in Jalgaon, it has decided to uninstall the tunnel on Monday and has also directed its staff not to install such chambers at other junctions. The decision to uninstall the chamber was taken after health experts raised questions on the safety of the tunnel, which was set up on April 7 within two days at a cost of ₹10,000. The move has left a number of state bodies confused about the effectiveness and safety of the technique, with such chambers having been installed at hospitals, police vans and other places. “We were informed that this particular disinfection process might be harmful for those passing through the tunnel. The tunnel has been shut down, and an internal advisory has been issued that no such tunnels will be developed again,” said Sunil Udasi, chief public relations officer, CR. The enclosures of the tunnel have nozzles that spray mist which is a mixture of disinfectants, including sodium hypochlorite solution, diluted in water for three-five seconds from head to toe to kill viruses. The mist is sprayed in quick intervals to ensure a person remains dry. The technique is also used to clean large vehicles or products, and these chambers can also be setup at the back of large vans.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) insecticide department said it will not be installing disinfection tunnels in any of the containment zones in Mumbai.“These tunnels or chambers are not advisable. Spraying disinfectants on body needs a minimum contact time of 10 minutes and it is not good for the clothes or skin. So the BMC has not opted for any such tunnel within its jurisdiction,” said Rajan Naringrekar, insecticide officer, BMC.The practice has been stopped in Tamil Nadu, too, after the director of public health, Chennai, banned the use of such techniques in the state on Saturday.“Disinfection tunnels will create a false sense of security and people may be diverted from washing their hands. In addition, spraying of alcohol, chlorine, lysol on human beings is not only harmful but also ineffective,” read a circular by Chennai’s public health services.However, Worli’s Poddar Hospital, which is one of the quarantine centres in the city, has installed a disinfection chamber, raising questions on the unanimity among the governing bodies towards the usage of the method. “Everything is being managed by the BMC. This was the first disinfection chamber located at any hospital in the city using 2% sodium hypochlorite solution. We do not know how effective this is,” said Narsu Patil, manager, Poddar Hospital.Mumbai Police also has five disinfection vans at each of the city’s administrative regions.“Based on the concentration of disinfectants and health impact, we will soon take a decision on whether to discontinue the practice or not,” said Pranay Ashok, deputy commissioner of police (operations).Similar chambers has also been setup at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Vashi and Vashi police station.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government is planning to install such tunnels across market places, government buildings and railways stations with the help of the Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), Mumbai.“Tunnels that have sprung up at various locations have been designed without any scientific basis. Techniques used previously for pesticide spraying are being modified to spray on humans during the outbreak. This will not work,” said Professor Aniruddha Pandit, vice-chancellor, ICT. “There are World Health Organization guidelines that mandate permissible exposure and intake of such tunnels, and it is perfectly acceptable,” added Pandit.ICT plans to inaugurate its prototype tunnel on its campus at Matunga on Tuesday. “Based on its success, we will consider placing the technology at other locations. We have a capacity to make one tunnel every three to four days,” said Pandit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cr-uninstalls-disinfection-tunnel-in-jalgaon-cites-safety-hazards-confusion-over-usage-prevails-among-state-bodies/story-E8pbiify23oNs7I9D3zqjO.html

13-04-2020||Lucknow||Kashi flat rented to Chinese woman, police not informed, owner may be booked||A 31-year-old Chinese woman was found staying in a Varanasi flat without the flat owner having given intimation to the police about renting out the premises to the foreign national amid the Covid-19 global pandemic, the police said.Regional tourism officer Kirtiman Srivastava said the woman would be tested for the coronavirus as a precautionary measure.Srivastava said a notice will be issued to the owners of PG (paying guest) accommodations to inform the police as soon as any guest shifts to their flat, house or any other accommodation. An officer of the Local Intelligence Unit, who did not wish to be named, said a case would be registered against the flat owner because he didn’t inform police and LIU about renting his premises to the Chinese woman. As per rule, he should have informed LIU and police, the officer said.Zhou Juhua, resident of Hunan province in China, arrived in New Delhi on January 29, a senior officer of the LIU said. Her visa is valid till September.After having spent about three weeks in the national capital, she reached Varanasi on February 26, the LIU official added.Initially staying in a hotel in the Dashashwamedh Ghat area of Varanasi till March 21, she shifted to the flat in Saket Nagar Colony under the Lanka police station limits on March 22, the official said.She had to take the flat on rent as she was unable to return to Delhi due to suspension of flights and train services amid the Covid-19 lockdown, a police officer said.Through her tourist guide, the woman contacted a flat owner who agreed to give the premises on rent to her. Later, the Local Intelligence Unit received information about the Chinese woman staying in the flat.Bharat Bhushan Tiwari, station officer of Lanka police station, said information about the woman was received from the LIU on Monday.An inspection confirmed the Chinese woman was living in the flat. Flat owner Sambhav Chaturvedi, a resident of Varanasi, said that he was stuck in Patna due to the lockdown and therefore could not inform the police. He said he agreed to give the flat to her on rent when he was informed by the tourist guide that the Chinese woman was stranded in Varanasi due to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/kashi-flat-rented-to-chinese-woman-police-not-informed-owner-may-be-booked/story-aV8RwzXmhhLN4TFndJQpZM.html
13-04-2020||Chandigarh||Govt employees term salary cut, disbursal delay double blow||The Haryana government’s decision to delay the disbursal of salaries and pensions due to fiscal severity has dismayed a large section of employees, including officers.As per an April 6 finance department schedule announced for the release of salaries, pensions and social security pensions, the group D employees, contractual and daily wagers would get their salaries on April 7, group C on April 10 and group A and B would get it on April 20.Social security pensions, which include old age allowance, widow and destitute women pension, pension for the disabled, would be disbursed from April 13. Retired employees will get pensions from April 16.Finance department officials said that salaries to all government employees, including contractual employees, pension including family pension to government pensioners and social security pension, involve an expenditure of Rs 2,350 crore every month.“Given the present scenario and Covid-19 crisis, it has been proposed to disburse salaries and pensions this month in a staggered manner,” said a finance department note by finance secretary-cum-adviser Sunil Saran.Reacting to the development, an employee said, “On one hand, the state government is insisting on 10% contributions from group A, B and C employees and 20% from all India service officers towards the Covid-19 relief fund. Delaying the disbursal and a salary cut is a double blow to everyone.”The state government is facing a severe financial crunch due to the nationwide lockdown. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said there was a sizable decline in tax collections and the government fell short of about ₹2,300 crore in revenue collections during March and the shortfall would be around ₹4,000 crore in April.The finance department, however, said that salary bills of all employees will be accepted and cleared in a prompt manner as per the usual procedure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/govt-employees-term-salary-cut-disbursal-delay-double-blow/story-k8DmL247o6mzuwDuk8draM.html

13-04-2020||Chandigarh||Over 77% Tablighi contacts test negative||Health authorities in Haryana have heaved a sigh of relief with 77% of the samples taken from the contacts of Tablighi Jamaat missionaries turning out to be coronavirus negative. The lab test results of these high-risk individuals assume significance in view of the fact that Tablighi missionaries and their contacts account for 121 coronavirus positive cases, about 67% of the 182 positive cases in Haryana. Data accessed by HT showed that out of 662 contacts of Tabilghi missionaries tested, only 13 turned out to be positive. The number of jamaatis found infected are 108. “Though the reports of 61 Tablighis and their 135 contacts are still awaited, I can now say that we have been able to contain the community spread of coronavirus due to relentless screening, intensive testing and isolation of habitations,” additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora said.He said they we would, however, not let their guard down. “The habitations will continue to remain isolated for 14 days. I also expect a slight increase in the number of positive cases. But, the possibility of a substantial increase in the number of positive cases is very less,” he added.As per the statistics, 1,461 Tablighis and 662 of their contacts were tested by the health authorities from across the state. The bulk of such individuals came from the Nuh district of Mewat region, where 353 jamaatis and 12 of their contacts were tested for coronavirus. The lab findings threw up 38 positive jamaatis in Nuh district, the highest in the state, but not single contact of theirs. Also, the remaining 315 samples of jamaatis in Nuh have turned out to be negative. Officials said that Nuh district seems by and large contained now. “We had six new disclosures on Sunday whose samples have been taken. The police, however, are investigating whether they would qualify as Tablighis or their contacts,” Nuh civil surgeon Virender Yadav said.“More than 2.33 lakh households in 501 villages of Nuh district were screened door to door after isolating the habitations. The number of persons screened in this hotspot is about 14.45 lakh,” said a health official indicating the intensity of the containment operation.

13-04-2020||Mumbai||With vegetable, fruit supplies hit, Vishu festivities in Mumbai to remain low-key||The irregular supply of fruits and vegetables in and around Mumbai has dampened the festivities of the Malayalee New Year Vishu, which falls on Tuesday. On the festival of Vishu, which is also celebrated by some Tamilians, families place a variety of fruits, vegetables, rice, ornaments, money and laburnum flowers before a mirror and idols of Gods at their homes, which signify the hope of prosperity for the coming year. This year however, citizens said they are unable to source vegetables such as snake gourd, yellow cucumber, jackfruit and laburnum flowers, which form the crux of the festivities. Shyamala Venkataraman, a resident of Brindavan, Thane, said, “Since the past two days, shops selling vegetables in the area have been shut down. We also have to place fruits such as bananas and mangoes before the deity, but nothing is available.” The Asthika Samaj in Matunga, where thousands of members of the Malayalee community gather for cultural events on Vishu each year, is also gearing up for a low-key affair this time. “There is a shortage of even betel leaves and laburnum flowers,” said Sunder Ramakrishnan, secretary of the Samaj. “We have to make do with whatever is available,” he said. The wholesale Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Vashi, from where the city sources vegetables, has been shut, while retail markets have been shifted and vegetable vendors have been asked to shut shops in containment zones, owing to which the supply has been irregular in many areas and has resulted in the higher prices. Priyanka Muthuswamy, a resident of Mulund, said, “Celebrations apart, vendors are charging a lot for fruits and vegetables. Even a small-sized watermelon costs ₹100.”The festival also marks preparation of a ‘sadhya’ or an elaborate feast served on banana leaves. However, many households have decided to abstain from the celebrations considering the present scenario. Prabha Sreenivasan, a Vashi resident, said, “At a time, when lakhs of daily-wage workers are struggling to get two square meals, we can’t be preparing a feast.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-vegetable-fruit-supplies-hit-vishu-festivities-in-mumbai-to-remain-low-key/story-6sj9D2cmZqYu0nqvy1kFjJ.html

Conscious of this, Punjab industries director Sibin C said that the government procured only SITRA-approved kits. “If any manufacturer tries to sell PPE kits to private players without SITRA approval, it becomes the buyer’s responsibility to check for the nod,” Sibin added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ppe-suits-order-of-the-day-for-ludhiana-textile-industry/story-nQxDTbBaoABkDMN8675aMN.html

Our teams are distributing sanitisers, masks and food to the needy. The work keeps me so busy that I haven’t been able to spend time with my daughter and wife. Though I stay in the same house, I keep confined myself to another room to keep my family safe,” he added.Sonepat has reported 5 positive cases of coronavirus so far. A sub-inspector posted here had also died of the infection in Delhi on April 4.Crime investigation agency inspector Viveik Malik said that he couldn’t be with his wife on her birthday for the first time since their marriage.“I wished my wife on her birthday on video call. She got a bit emotional due to my absence, but I told her for a cop, duty comes before anything else. My family members have been missing me as I have not been able to visit my village since March 27,”Malik added.In an appeal to the citizens, Malik said that people should co-operate with the cops as they were working hard for everyone’s safety.Sonepat city DSP Ravinder Singh said he has been working continuously and hasn’t been home for the past 20 days. “As my duty, I have been urging people to stay indoors. At the beginning of the lockdown, there was less cooperation from the people, but now they have come around and understood the significance of taking precaution in these times,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/not-seen-family-in-weeks-cops-say-duty-comes-first/story-mFNBZZafmayvwFqpvIDHdI.html

13-04-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown, shut hospitals leave dialysis patients in Mumbai in a lurch||With hospitals and ambulance services that provide dialysis to those with kidney failure being impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak, many are faced with potentially life-threatening situations.For those with kidney failure, dialysis is essential as it removes toxins from their blood. “If a patient misses on his/her weekly dialysis, the toxins and fluid in the body get mixed with blood, which can even prove fatal,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital.Jitendra Tandel, 62, has been going to Shushrusha Hospital in Dadar for dialysis thrice a week, for the past 15 yearss. However, after two hospital staffers were diagnosed as Covid-positive, the hospital closed down its dialysis centre for disinfection on April 8. Guidelines issued by the health department require dialysis centres to become operational 24 hours after fumigation, but Shushrusha Hospital is yet to restart operations.Tandel missed his scheduled appointment for dialysis on Thursday and is struggling to find a new centre. “I am surviving on one glass of water for the last four days. Though the hospital said they will start the dialysis centre in two days, it has been four days now,” he said. When HT contacted Dr Shilpa Deshmukh, dean of Shushrusha Hospital, she said, “We had a meeting today about it and will soon start functioning.” The hospital has informed their registered dialysis patients that they must test for Covid-19 as a precautionary measure. On Monday, six new Covid-19 cases, including two doctors, were confirmed from the hospital. Tandel, who submitted an application to be tested for Covid-19 on April 10 and is yet to hear back from the hospital, is among those concerned that the hospital may not reopen soon enough.The lockdown has also made it difficult for patients to reach dialysis centres. Mulund resident Vitaldas Bhatt, 75, said the ambulance service on the telephone number 108 refused to ferry his 65-year-old wife, who is handicapped, to the dialysis centre. Ultimately, a neighbour helped the Bhatt couple.Vasai resident Kamlesh Anuja, 40, said he was harassed by the police when he was going to the dialysis centre about five kilometres from his home. “On Friday, police stopped me and despite showing my dialysis cards and documents, they started harassing me. They told me that I looked healthy and made fake documents to travel,” said Anuja. The police let him go after he showed them the channel for dialysis in his hand.A number of groups are trying to help patients make alternative arrangements and have reported shortage of necessary equipment, like dialyzers (an artificial kidney which filters the blood in dialysis centers) which are usually imported from other countries. “Due to this, dialysis centres are forced to use the same dialyzers 10-12 times which earlier, patients reused for five to six times. Other than this, there is also a shortage of blood thinner,” said Sejal Jobanputra, a coordinator with the group Kidney Warriors Foundation.Additionally, patients with damaged kidneys, known as uremic patients, are particularly vulnerable to infection. “Family members living with dialysis patients must follow the precautions and regulations given to patients to prevent person-to-person transmission of Covid-19 within the family,” said epidemiologist Dr Om Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-shut-hospitals-leave-dialysis-patients-in-mumbai-in-a-lurch/story-ozdscBLINy04Hl4MDy8obO.html

Balwinder is also accused of landgrabbing. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mandeep Sidhu said the accused didn’t give a satisfactory reply as from where he got Rs 39 lakh that was recovered during a search of the gurdwara premises. “He said he sold land but didn’t tell as to whom he sold it and where,” he added.The dera head allegedly used to take money to get possession of disputed land, it is learnt. He even tried to take possession of Gurdwara Karhali Sahib nearly 20 years ago, but at that time the then MLA Harmel Singh Tohra had scuttled his plan by using police force. “We will quiz him on his alleged landgrabbing activities during remand,” said the SSP. It emerged that the vehicle belongs to a Congress leader from Sanaur, Puran Singh, whose son Gurwinder Singh is a block samiti member from Balbera. Puran and his son are close to Congress halqa incharge Harinderpal Harry Mann. Puran said his elder son, who is living in Australia, gifted the vehicle to Balwinder. He produced an undated affidavit of vehicle transfer though it did not have Balwinder’s signatures. Also, the police registered a drug case against Balwinder as 3,000 intoxicant tablets were found in his possession. The accused were produced in court that granted 11-day police remand.Capt speaks to ASI, assures full support Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday spoke to ASI Harjeet Singh, whose hand was chopped off in the attack, to enquire about his well-being. The CM assured his government’s full support to the cop.He expressed happiness at the successful plastic surgery conducted on Harjeet by doctors at PGI, Chandigarh. Amarinder also promised the ASI of the strictest action against those involved in the brutal attack on him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nihangs-attack-on-cops-police-ask-ed-i-t-dept-to-probe-dera-head-s-unaccounted-cash/story-7oGAwuY9bjIveo1cnZv85K.html
13-04-2020||Chandigarh||Long queues outside Golden Temple sanctum sanctorum on Baisakhi||Long queues were seen outside the sanctum sanctorum on Baisakhi on Monday, even as curfew is in place to check covid-19. The number of devotees was larger than that seen at the holy place over the past few days. At some points in the queue, SGPC staff found it difficult to ensure social distancing. People had lined up outside the Darshan Deori as well. Two sanitisation tunnels set upTo sanitise devotees, tunnels were set up on the two entrances (the main one and the one from the serais) on Monday. SGPC-run Guru Ram Das Medical College, Amritsar, and Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla have funded the tunnels, a SGPC spokesperson said. At the inauguration, SGPC senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta said after screening for temperature and washing of hands, devotees would have to pass through the tunnels. Talwandi Sabo wears deserted look Bathinda Talwandi Sabo town on Monday wore a deserted look as devotees with devotees staying away from the Takht Damdama Sahib. Markets remained closed. Religious programmes were held inside the Takht to mark the day symbolically with social distancing implemented strictly. Former Takht Damdama Sahib jathedar Balwant Singh Nandgarh, 78, said, “This is the first Baisakhi when it is so deserted. People came to the at Takht even during times of militancy and in 1984. It is good that devotees understand the gravity of the situation,” he said. CM prays, thanks peopleIn Chandigarh, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh thanked the people of the state for responding to his appeal for ardas from their homes itself on Baisakhi. He also lauded the spirit of cooperation of people of the state.Humanity should fight pandemic collectively: Akal Takht JathedarIn his address, Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said humanity should unite against the pandemic. He also called for strict punishment to perpetrators of the attack on cops in Patiala. “It is wrong to target the whole community for a particular incident. Culprits of attack on Punjab police cops in Patiala should be punished, but attempts are being made to target the whole Sikh community. Similarly, it is wrong to target Muslims, if some attendees of the Nizammudin congregation were found positive,” he said, adding that there should be uniformity in proving relief amid the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/long-queues-outside-golden-temple-sanctum-sanctorum-on-baisakhi/story-h5Dtve6b7xj1gIfi1OdkPO.html
13-04-2020||Chandigarh||Injured ASI in high spirits, recovery may take 6 months||Despite his injured hand being kept in a splint, completely immobilised so that repaired structure is not disturbed, assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Harjit Singh is in high spirits, said doctors at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh. He will have to remain hospitalised for two weeks, they added.50-year-old Harjit was injured in Patiala when a group of ‘nihangs’ chopped off his wrist and left two other Punjab Police personnel injured. This was after the cops stopped them from entering a vegetable market amid curfew to curb coronavirus.Dr RK Sharma, head of plastic surgery department at PGI, said, “The good news is that blood circulation in the ASI’s hand was fine in the past 24 hours. We hope it remains the same in the next four days, which are crucial. The arteries and veins will take 2-3 weeks to heal following which, he will be discharged. We are expecting 90% recovery,” he said.“The cop’s positive attitude is helpful as such patients tend to recover fast,” he said.“While being brought to PGI from Patiala in an ambulance, he was worried about the treatment expenses. In the ambulance, he said I do not have much cash in my pocket,” said Patiala SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu.Dr Sunil Gaba, who led the team in surgery, said, “During the operation, we got connected with Harjit at the personal level. The real challenge was reattaching the arteries and veins attached eight hours so that the hand survives. One team looked after the chopped hand while the other took care of the wrist.”The operation involved reattaching around 50 structures which was done under microscopic vision and is a tiring task. Full recovery of the hand may take up to six months.Dr Jerry R John, an associate professor who was part of surgery team, said that such injuries are common but sharp cut, which was the case here, is an advantage.“Mostly, in such cases, the body part is crushed which makes it difficult to perform surgery. But here the cut was sharp, which made it easier to make assessment and perform the surgery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/injured-asi-in-high-spirits-recovery-may-take-6-months/story-rs4kBXq1I1WxcYlFv4HdWI.html

Haryana saw a spate of cases in recent days, especially on Sunday when as many as 16 new cases were reported in a day, 24 cases on April 8, 33 on April 7 and 20 on April 6. Most of these infected persons were linked to Tablighi Jamaat. They had either attended the event at Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month or were in contact with the attendees, senior doctors of the health department said. The Monday’s case was reported from Sirsa wherein a 33-year-old woman, who worked as a cook at a Rori village mosque, was found to be infected. Doctors say the woman could have contracted the disease from someone with Tablighi Jamaat connection. With her, there are four positive cases in Sirsa. Health officials of Sirsa said the woman, along with her four children and husband, have been admitted to the isolation ward of the local civil hospital. Samples of 13 more people, who were in contact with the woman, have been taken and they were asked to be in home quarantine.

13-04-2020||Lucknow||BJP uses ‘sui-dhagaa’ to stitch dalit connect on Ambedkar Jayanti||Amid ongoing lockdown to contain spread of Sars-Cov-2, Darshana Singh, chief of BJP’s women wing in Uttar Pradesh, was busy stitching masks using cotton cloth, thread and needle was on the eve of Ambedkar Jayanti on Monday. “I don’t have a sewing machine so I am stitching these triple layered cloth masks by hand. There are various other women who are also stitching these masks which we will provide to women from poor and weaker sections on Ambedkar Jayanti. These would be distributed at booth level while maintaining social distancing,” she said from her home in Chakhania village in Chandauli district. In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, the Yogi government has made wearing masks compulsory in the state.“BJP women wing alone has stitched more than a lakh masks and various NGOs and other party wings too were involved in preparing them,” Darshana said. Mask preparation and distribution along with feeding at least two poor families in slum areas are part of the BJP’s latest method to connect with the state’s 21 per cent dalits. The BJP and its allies had won 73 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in 2014 and the party followed it up by an equally stunning performance in 2017 UP assembly polls when it won 75 out of 85 reserved seats in the state. In 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP again dominated in the reserved seats winning 15 of the 17 in the state. This is the reason why the party has over the last couple of years used Ambedkar Jayanti to aggressively woo dalits. Till last year, the party hosted social harmony feasts (‘samarasta bhoj’) on Ambedkar Jayanti in which upper caste leaders dined with dalits to support the RSS’s campaign of caste-free society.This year, though the novel coronavirus has impacted celebrations and party’s outreach campaign among the community, BJP’s upper caste MP in Kushinagar Vijay Dubey quickly seized an opportunity to connect with the community at Bhujauli Khurd village in Kushinagar dominated by Muslims and Jatavs, the dalit sub-caste to which BSP chief Mayawati belongs. On April 5, Dubey had rushed to Bhujali Khurd village in Kushinagar to dine with the people on hearing that some of them had refused to have food that the dalit gram pradhan had prepared for five who were quarantined in village.“They had come from outside and as part of the protocol were quarantined for 14 days. When the two chefs in village refused to make and serve food due to fear that they may get infected if the visitors were suffering from the disease, my wife Leelawati Devi, who is also the village head, made food for them. But one of them refused to have it saying having food from a dalit was not acceptable to him,” said village head’s husband Subhash Gautam, a Jatav.“When the BJP MP, an upper caste Brahmin, got to know about it, he arrived in the village and announced that he would have food prepared by my wife. Seeing BJP MP having it, others too started having it,” Gautam said. There were reports that social distancing protocol wasn’t followed as the BJP MP dined with the villagers though party leaders naturally scoff at such reports. “All in our party are following social distancing,” said BJP’s media cell in-charge Manish Dixit.The Ambedkar Mahasabha chief in Lucknow Lalji Nirmal said that unlike regular occasions when VIPs and community would assemble at Mahasabha office where urns of Ambedkar are kept, this time he had appealed to all to celebrate Ambedkar Jayanti by remaining in their homes.“We have urged people to light a lamp and upload videos of how they celebrated the occasion at their homes while maintaining social distancing,” said Nirmal. He also said since this year Ambedkar Jayanti wasn’t being celebrated as before due to the corona pandemic, the money thus saved would be used to feed the poorest of the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bjp-uses-sui-dhagaa-to-stitch-dalit-connect-on-ambedkar-jayanti/story-QsAIiZuiT0UifS2NLGpQ8N.html

The state government is ready with a work plan. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has constituted 11 committees led by ministers to take necessary steps and suggest measures for the future,” chief secretary RK Tiwari said.Adityanath constituted the committees after holding a closed-door interaction with his cabinet colleagues at his residence here on Sunday.“We discussed conditions during and post lockdown period and, if needed, more such meetings may be held in the coming days,” said Yogi Adityanath after the meeting.Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who heads the committee constituted to restart construction work on major projects while observing social distancing, held a meeting with senior officers.

13-04-2020||Mumbai||Kandivli society sets up disinfectant shower||At Ibis tower at Kandivli, residents used the set-up in their premises, which was used for rain dance during events, and turned it into a disinfectant shower. The set-up is on the lines of sanitisation chambers installed at several public places across the city such as police stations and hospitals.At this 84-apartment housing society with around 200 residents, sanitisers were being kept at gates and near elevator. But the residents then thought they needed a full-body sanitisation machine because people in the society were often stepping out due to various reasons.Mehul Vithalani, a real estate consultant and a resident, said after the lockdown was announced, people from his society would have to go out to purchase groceries, vegetables and fruits. However in a bid to restrict movement, the society tied up with a vendor to provide vegetables and fruits inside the society premises every alternate day. In addition, a pharmacist, who is a resident of the society, assured that all medicines will be delivered to residents’ doorsteps.“People just want a reason to step out. Earlier it was groceries, but after we provided facilities for the same at home, they would go out for bread. Later, we also tied up with a seller who delivers bread to us and we also have a community kitchen. Now, people venture out to go to bank and we cannot stop them from that. Hence, we thought that we need to make arrangement for sanitising the whole body instead of just hands and installed this,” said Vithalani.A water and sodium hypochlorite solution is pumped through the sprinklers.In an open market such chambers can cost ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh. However, members of Ibis tower made the shower at the cost of approximately ₹20,000.Those entering the premises are checked with a thermal scanner first, and then made to stand under the shower for five to seven seconds before they can enter the society.Jay Joshi, a resident who manufactures such booths, said these kind of set-up gives an anti-bacterial treatment and disinfects the body. Joshi said the system was a replica of such chambers set up on the streets of Europe.“All societies need to replicate this because one cannot be free of the virus just by washing hands,” said Joshi.However, experts said such chambers are not required as a normal bath with warm water, disinfectant and soap is enough when a person returns from outside.“Personally, I don’t think such disinfectants should be used on body, because sodium hypochlorite is a surface cleanser and is not meant to be used on skin. Also, I had recently read about a study, which said such chambers could do more harm than good,” said Dr Preeti Mehta, former professor and head of microbiology department at King Edward Memorial hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kandivli-society-sets-up-disinfectant-shower/story-YJ063A3ZEkrQu8bQTYOCmL.html

To ensure the pandemic does not spread further, police in central region have made special teams specifically to stop and, if need be, arrest people found loitering and roaming unnecessarily. “We have formed three special police teams in our police station only to stop people who are violating the norms and are unnecessarily roaming on roads. We are lodging FIRs against such people and are also using loud speakers to raise awareness on social distancing,” said Sukhlal Varpe, senior inspector, Worli police station. Central region covers areas from Byculla to Ghatkopar, Mumbai Central to Matunga as well as Dharavi, Shahu Nagar, Kurla, Sion, Antop Hill and Wadala Truck Terminal.

As these areas have a number of big slums like Dharavi, Nagpada, Jijamata Nagar, Worli Koliwada, which have a common toilet system, crammed lanes and market areas, the police here are finding it difficult to maintain social distancing. A senior police officer from the region said,” The chances of community spread is high in slums. So we have served notices under Criminal Procedure Code and taken action under the Bombay Police Act against thousands of people asking them not to indulge in any unlawful activity and to stop them from loitering. The State Reserve Police Force platoon has been effective and drones are being used for monitoring.”Of the 77 FIRs filed on Sunday in central region, 71 are for gathering in one place.

13-04-2020||City||Ludhiana: Smartphone gifted by DEO comes in handy for Class 10 student||Fifteen-year-old Manvi Dholan was overjoyed after she was able to continue with her studies online with the help of a smartphone with internet facility gifted by the district education officer (DEO), secondary, Swaranjit Kaur, on Sunday.Class 10 student of Government High School, Dholan, Jagraon, Manvi, had not been able to reply for the past two weeks in the WhatsApp group, formed by the district mathematics mentor for the 81 meritorious students, who had scored above 93% marks in the pre-board examinations held in January.The group was formed to check the progress of students in the tests and provide proper guidance to improve the performance of students in the final board exams. To know the reason for not responding to the group, the mentor inquired from Malvi, to which the girl told him that she did not have a smartphone.Manvi, said, “In the absence of a smartphone, I was not able to reply to the messages sent in the group regularly. I, sometimes, used my cousin’s mobile to reply, but it was not regular. I shared this issue with my teachers and yesterday block mentor of mathematics Bhupinder Singh handed over a smartphone, which was sent by the district education officer. I am grateful to the authorities as, by using this gadget, I am able to improve my performance under the guidance of subject experts.”She added, “Since March 23, I had been studying the previous year’s papers, but felt that I needed proper guidance to enhance my performance. Now, I am part of the WhatsApp group and will practice according to the tests sent by the mentors. Today, three-mark questions of science were sent on the group and, in English, short-answer questions have been sent for practice.”Amid lockdown due to the spread of coronavirus, the mentors started sending daily tests to Class 10 students through WhatsApp group.These 81 students have scored more than 93% marks in the pre-board exams and district mentor of mathematics Sanjeev Taneja monitored the progress of these students from where he observed that Manvi was not responding to the messages sent in the group. He said, “She scored 99% marks in the pre-board exams held in January. She scored 100% marks in mathematics and Hindi in pre-board exams and was just short of six marks from the total 555 marks. So, we traced the student and now she is able to practise the tests under the guidance of all subject mentors. I informed the DEO regarding this problem and she immediately arranged a phone and asked the block mentor of Jagraon to hand over the smartphone to the student.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-smartphone-gifted-by-deo-comes-in-handy-for-class-10-student/story-ozRYVzaJGDvYuhlNxhUHLL.html
13-04-2020||Chandigarh||How Haryana is holding hands of its poor during lockdown||When lockdown was imposed across Haryana on March 23, there were just 14 confirmed coronavirus cases in the state. By March 31, the virus was detected in 29 people. And within a week, it managed to spread among 129 people of 16 districts.On Monday, a day before the 21-day long spell of the nationwide lockdown is to end, as many as 182 people were in the grip of the infection that has now crawled into 19 of the total 22 districts of Haryana.Even if the virus has been spreading fast, response of the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government to tackle this challenge of unprecedented size and scale appears heartening if the data prepared by the chief minister’s office (CMO) about steps taken so far is of any indication.After March 22’s ‘Janata Curfew’, lockdown was clamped in seven NCR districts of Haryana. Next day, lockdown was declared across the state.Immediately, senior IAS officers were deputed for coordination, planning and monitoring of the lockdown. On March 27, ministers and MPs were posted as in-charges of districts, while ₹1 crore to each district was released to help the poor and needy people.FINANCIAL ASSISTANCEWhile taking steps at war footing to contain the coronavirus, another challenge before the government was to cushion impact of lockdown on the poor.As per the data, till April 9, the administration had transferred ₹4,000 each to over six lakh families. Hence, ₹212 crore was sent to families registered under Mukhya Mantri Parivar Samridhi Yojana (MMPSY). There are about 12.56 lakh families registered under MMPSY, an official said.Also, the government has released ₹70-crore financial assistance for two weeks to Haryana Board of Construction Workers. The government has promised to give them ₹4,500 per month or ₹1,000 a week.Haryana has about 3.5 lakh workers registered under Haryana building and other construction workers’ welfare board.Government officials said all BPL families not registered under MMPSY or as construction workers will also receive ₹4,500 per month. The government is transferring every week ₹1,000 per family since March 30. “More than six lakh BPL families have received ₹1,000 weekly financial assistance. Till April 9, the government had transferred ₹61 crore to such families,” an official said.The government has also identified 70,000 people such as daily wagers, street vendors, migrant labourers, who were earning their livelihood on a daily basis. An official said if they register themselves with the deputy commissioner concerned, all of them will be eligible for ₹1,000 per week financial assistance that will be transferred directly to their bank accounts. FOOD & ESSENTIAL COMMODITIESAll BPL families are being supplied April’s ration free of cost. The package includes rice or wheat as per their entitlement, 1-litre mustard oil, 1kg dal, 1kg sugar and 1kg salt. As per the official data, a month’s ration was provided to over 27 lakh ration cardholders for free. Officials said as many as 64 lakh cooked or ready-to-eat food packets were being distributed daily to needy persons by district administrations with the help of NGOs, while nearly 4 lakh dry ration packets were being doled out weekly. “All contractual workers with government will receive wages even if they were unable to work during the lockdown,” a government functionary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/how-haryana-is-holding-hands-of-its-poor-during-lockdown/story-Sh0LJNEV4KYs0W6xMFU8hO.html
13-04-2020||Lucknow||Pilibhit becomes first UP district to shed corona tag||Pilibhit became the first district in Uttar Pradesh to shed the coronavirus tag when the district’s only two Covid-19 patients — a woman and her son — were discharged from hospital after they tested negative for the Sars-Cov-2 virus for the second time, officials said.There was no fresh Covid case in the district at present, district magistrate Vaibhav Srivastava said.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath congratulated the Pilibhit district magistrate and superintendent of police Abhisek Dixit on achieving the coronavirus-free tag. The chief minister directed the officers to launch intensive tracking, screening, testing and treatment drives to check spread of the coronavirus in the district.The effort of the district administration and district health department was a major achievement for the state, said additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi and principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad.They said Pilibhit was among the 41 districts in the state in which coronavirus cases were reported. With the exit of Pilibhit from that list now, the number of coronavirus affected districts had come down to 40, the officers said.The Pilibhit DM said the district had a population of 22 lakh. After discharge of two patients from hospital, there were 32 people in institutional quarantine, he said. All of them would be discharged soon as they had completed 28 days in quarantine and their samples had tested negative, he said.Earlier, the district administration was on high alert after the first Covid positive case was reported in west UP, he recalled.“We activated our intelligence network and told all the gram pradhans to alert the district administration if any person arrived from outside the district. On March 19, a gram pradhan in Amaria area of the district informed us that a 73-year-old woman returned from Saudi Arabia with symptoms of the disease. A health department team with four ambulances was rushed to the village at night. The health department transported 36 people, including family members of the woman, to quarantine centres,” he said.The samples were sent for tests. The women and her son were shifted to an isolation ward after they tested positive. The health department sanitized 23 villages in the area afterwards.Srivastava said over 9,000 migrant workers arrived in Pilibhit from various part of the country after the announcement of the nationwide lockdown on March 25. The district administration put the migrant workers in quarantine facilities. All the migrants were screened and examined by the health teams. Fifteen outposts with magistrate rank officer as in-charge were set up on the border to check the entry of outsiders.Patrolling was organised round the clock and a bus transporting people from Noida was seized on Saturday, he said.The district administration is working on a multi-pronged strategy. It includes strengthening health facilities, increasing isolation and quarantine facilities in the hospitals, regular interaction with people through helplines, control rooms and social media platforms, besides providing emergency services to people and supplying essential commodities at their doorstep in villages and localities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/pilibhit-becomes-first-up-district-to-shed-corona-tag/story-ounkh3Kt8SsHnZLAaT4TbM.html

13-04-2020||Gurugram||Covid crisis may push city into water crisis this summer: Irrigation dept||An analysis by the Haryana irrigation and water resources department shows that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may put additional stress on water resources across the National Capital Region (NCR), including Gurugram district, and other metropolitan areas of Haryana. The driving factor behind this increase, according to the irrigation department, is the simple act of washing one’s hands—with an open tap. For the NCR (Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat, Bahadurgarh, Ghaziabad, and Noida), which sources its water from the Yamuna and Ganga rivers, the Bhakra canal and from an array of ranney collectors and tube wells, the projected population of 28 million (280 lakh) people would require an additional 450MLD (million litres daily) to deal with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Gurugram, with a projected population of three million people, will require an additional 45 million litres daily (MLD) to deal with the crisis, show estimates. The tri-city area of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula, with a projected population of two million people, will require an additional 30MLD. EBB AND FLOWSuperintending engineer of irrigation and water resources, Gurugram, Shiv Singh Rawat said, “Washing hands frequently will increase water consumption. A 20-second hand wash with an open tap utilises about 1.5 litres water. We have assumed that, in keeping with World Health Organisation guidelines, if a person is washing their hands about 15 times per day, up from the usual five to 10 times a day, it would require an additional 15 litres of water per person per day. That is an additional 75 liters per family per day, just for washing hands.” Officials in the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) agreed that the domestic water demand has increased but said they would be able to manage supply till the time the curbs on malls and restro-bars continue. “We have seen domestic water use rise by about 1.5 times during the lockdown, but we are able to offset that as many non-essential services, including malls and restaurants, are not operational. Corporate offices are shut, and people are not washing cars. So, at the moment, there is no added stress on the water supply,” GMDA chief engineer Pradeep Kumar said. In the days immediately following the lockdown, the GMDA had reduced its water output from about 440 MLD to 395MLD. Now, just on the basis of domestic consumption in households, this has again been increased to 415-430MLD, Kumar said. WHAT IF THE INDUSTRIES OPEN?According to the irrigation department, the situation may get dire in the summer months, when the GMDA will have to start releasing additional water to make up for rising demand and evaporation losses. “There is a shortage of water in the river Yamuna and it will get worse in coming summer. We are still releasing 600MLD of raw water to the GMDA, as was the case before the lockdown. Efforts are being made to meet the water demand through canals, but it is not enough,” Rawat said. Moreover, when lockdown restrictions are eventually relaxed, it will coincide with the peak of summer season. “This is an additional cause for concern. Even if industries and other non-essential services are allowed to resume operations only by end of May, it will be around the time that evaporation loss and public demand are highest, which will further strain water resources in an area where water is already a scarce commodity. The demand will exceed supply,” Rawat said, cautioning that the scarcity would encourage further exploitation of groundwater in cities such as Gurugram, which lack a perennial source of water to draw from.STRAIN ON GROUNDWATER According to NITI Aayog’s Composite Water Management Index (CWMI) report from 2018, 21 major cities in the country, including Delhi, were pegged to exhaust their groundwater supply by 2020. This would affect water access for 100 million nationally, a cumulative result of groundwater over-extraction, inefficient wastewater management and insufficient monsoons in recent years.Moreover, the looming water shortage holds within it a seed of a larger ecological crisis. “About 80% water consumed domestically is released into drains and sewers as wastewater. In Gurugram, this will further pollute groundwater reserves, and even the Yamuna river. More wastewater also leads to more water borne diseases, such as common diarrhoea,” Rawat said. TURN OFF THE TAP, SHOWERWith this in mind, both, the irrigation department and the GMDA have recommended that residents be more judicious in their use of water. Some of the steps which can be taken to conserve water include two simple steps of running taps only when necessary and taking baths using buckets, not showers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-crisis-may-push-city-into-water-crisis-this-summer-irrigation-dept/story-TAGX3pSTKccPAsdJimJvlN.html
13-04-2020||Gurugram||Princeton Estate’s residents ready to take up maintenance duties||As the extension of the lockdown to halt the spread of coronavirus seems imminent, residents of Princeton Estate in Sector 51 have formed an emergency task force that will take over the maintenance duties and will be responsible for running the society in case, the maintenance staff leaves.With the idea to make the society self-sustained, a team of about 30 volunteers has been formed to look after the maintenance of the society if the lockdown is extended which may leave the condominium with little or no staff. The task force has been divided into different groups which will oversee horticulture work, housekeeping, technical maintenance, and security. Residents who are part of the technical team will soon be trained about running machines such as elevators, gensets, water pumps and overseeing the electricity supply.“We are expecting a situation when the staff will wish to move out of the society and join their families. In anticipation of such circumstances, we have created the task force. The residents in the team will be given an orientation about how different things in the society run. We plan on creating a more detailed action plan soon,” said Arati Pandya, acting secretary of the society’s resident welfare association (RWA). The volunteers will be provided orientation by the staff of the DLF group, said Pandya.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident who is part of the administration group of the task force, said, “The administration team will be responsible for office administration, procurement of essential items, payments and others.” He added that for the time being, the focus was on making sure maintenance activities run smoothly.Since the lockdown started on March 25, the society cut down its staff by 50%. The remaining staff was asked to stay inside the complex to minimise the exposure to the outside world. Close to 30 members of the maintenance staff have been provided accommodation inside the condominium in vacant apartments, reading rooms, basement etc. Residents donated mattresses, bed sheets to help out the staff and make their stay comfortable. The staff has been provided with a cooking station and are responsible for their own ration. The salaries of the staff working in the society currently have been increased.“The staff who are residing inside the society are receiving 1.5 times their usual monthly salary. They are also being provided a separate allowance of ₹150 a day for their daily expenditure. The staff not residing inside the society are also getting their usual pay,” said Sandeep Sahijwani, vice president, RWA.The condominium, which is home over 3,000 residents, has a departmental store, a dairy store, and a chemist shop. Residents have to adhere to social distancing protocols while buying essential items in the society. Markings have been made in front of the stores to designate places for people to stand in queues. “Only two people are allowed to go inside the milk booth at a time. Others have to wait for their turn outside while standing on the markings,” said Kumar.For the common areas, the RWA has made mandatory for the residents. Posters informing the same have also been placed right outside the elevators of all eight towers. Walks, for the time being, have been put on hold and special ‘Covid security supervisor’ has been assigned to keep track of residents moving around the complex.“The Covid supervisor takes rounds around the complex to make sure no resident steps out other than to go to the store. No one is allowed to amble around unnecessarily,” said Sahijwani.Pet owners, who wish to walk their dogs, are only allowed to go up to the closest poop area and not take walks around the society. At the gate, all residents and staff members have to wash and sanitise their hands. Washbasins have also been installed at the entrance of all eight towers. Most deliveries have been restricted to the main gate, while the delivery of some essential goods is allowed till the tower lobbies. Residents are responsible for picking up their deliveries like groceries, milk, newspaper, and others from the lobby. For senior citizens, the estate office has offered to make deliveries up to their door and provide any support required. The society is also maintaining records of all residents stepping out.“With the coronavirus pandemic, a lot of changes in the way we live have taken place. Enforcing them was difficult in the first week, but now residents have become more understanding,” said Sahijwani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/princeton-estate-s-residents-ready-to-take-up-maintenance-duties/story-RPWXtdzZcmYG4UpndGv1KJ.html
13-04-2020||Noida||Gzb Covid hospital sees off first batch of recovered patients||The doctors and healthcare staff at the L1 Covid-19 hospital in Ghaziabad gave a warm send off to four patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) who had recovered and were discharged from the hospital in Muradnagar on Monday. These were the first set of patients to be discharged from the L1 hospital set up in Ghaziabad in the first week of April, health department officials said. Officials said that one of the four patients was a woman from Vasundhara, an employee of the Noida-based company Ceasefire, while three others were Masuri-based men who were exposed to the virus at a religious congregation in March.“The four will now be under home quarantine for 14 days. We counselled them on all the precautions to be taken so that the infection doesn’t recur. They were sent home in an advanced life-support ambulance. We now have a total of 17 Covid-19 patients under our care,” hospital superintendent Dr GP Mathuria said.The state has created a dedicated chain of Covid-19 hospitals—L1, L2 and L3. The L1 category of hospitals deals with uncomplicated cases of Covid-19 and each district has one such hospital, the cases that require more attention are sent to L2 category hospitals and critical patients are sent to L3 category hospitals for specialised treatment. The state has a total of six L3 category hospitals. In Ghaziabad, the Muradnagar hospital is L1 category while the Sanjay Nagar District Hospital is a L2 category hospital. Ghaziabad does not have an L3 category hospital; any critical patient from here would be referred to the Meerut Medical College or to the hospitals in New Delhi.SCC SAPPHIRE SEALEDThe Ghaziabad district administration on Monday sealed B Block of SCC Sapphire highrise in Raj Nagar Extension. The chief medical officer (CMO) said that the decision was taken after a resident, who is a doctor and posted in Delhi, was found positive for Covid-19 infection.“The family stays in the highrise, but the doctor has not visited them in 1.5 months (since the outbreak). So, a decision was taken to not make it a hotspot. In all, we have seen 27 positive cases of Covid-19 in Ghaziabad and seven patients, including four on Monday, have been discharged so far,” CMO Dr NK Gupta said.“The highrise has been sealed as a precautionary measure; it is not a hotspot. The entire highrise has been sanitized and cleaning was taken up,” city magistrate Shiv Pratap Shukl said. As of now, Ghaziabad district has 14 hot spots. The state has 146 hot spots in 15 districts, including Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad, and 1,71,232 houses have been affected with a population of about 9,78,055 people, state government officials said on Monday. “Of the 550 Covid cases, 401 cases are in these 146 hot spots. So, we have about 80-85% Covid-19 cases in these hot spots. We have also identified 62 more hot spots in another 25 districts; these have 1,62,664 houses with a population of about 9,50,828 persons, besides having 80 Covid-19 positive cases. All efforts are being made to control the spread of coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2),” additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said. The total number of Covid-19 cases in UP stood was 550 till Monday afternoon, including 307 cases related to a religious congregation in Delhi in mid-March.Awasthi added, “The chief minister on Monday directed state officials that from now on, in case of non-disclosure, legal action will be taken against people who are still in hiding or have not disclosed their travel history. In case any such instance is found, the respective district magistrates and senior superintendent of police will be held responsible.”POOL TESTINGIn another development, principal secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad said the Indian Council of Medical Research has given permission for pool testing of Covid-19 samples so fewer test kits are utilised. “In pool testing of samples, for example, we will mix the swabs of 10 patients. In case the result is negative, we will know all 10 are not infected and only one kit would have been used. In case the sample turns positive, then we will go for individual testing. This will help save us resources and get test results faster for many patients,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gzb-covid-hospital-sees-off-first-batch-of-recovered-patients/story-N9YO46BfMMHX6iRpAlwv3O.html
13-04-2020||City||Lockdown: Govt school children in Gzb deprived of mid-day meal||Ghaziabad: The students of state-run primary schools in Ghaziabad are one of the worst sufferers of the lockdown imposed to stave off the spread of coronavirus outbreak. With the schools shut, the children from the poor sections of the society are deprived of mid-day meals and also lack facilities for any online classes.About 80,000 children are enrolled in 455 government schools in the Ghaziabad district, which come under the basic education department, officials said, adding it is unlikely that the government schools will reopen before July.“My two daughters study at a government school. Since the school has closed down, the children stay at home and have no access to the mid-day meal. My husband is also finding it tough to get some work. So, we are somehow surviving with bare minimum food,” said Rehana, a parent from Usman Colony at Dasna.Anjum, a class 5 student at the government primary school in Dasna, said that she is eagerly waiting for resumption of her classes. “We have no school work at the moment. The food (mid-day meal) is also not available now and we survive with one meal per day at home,” she said.Notably, the Union human resource development (HRD) ministry had last month asked all states to ensure that eligible students either get their meals or a commensurate food security allowance as building immunity through proper diet is an important element in the fight against Covid-19.Since the issuance of advisory by the HRD ministry on March 20, several states have taken a decision on how to proceed with the provision of mid-day meals to students. But this is not the case in Ghaziabad.When contacted, basic education officer Brij Bhushan Chaudhary said that his department has not received any such directions from the HRD ministry. He also said that mid-day meal would be made available to students only when schools reopen.“All the schools are closed due to lockdown. Providing mid-day meal is an issue as we cannot allow children to gather. Also, the mid-day meal is available only when the schools are open. It is possible that schools will reopen only in July,” he said.“Apart from the studies, examinations have also got hampered. But we have received instructions that the students should be promoted to the next class,” Chaudhary added.Some of the officials of the basic education department whom HT spoke to said that the idea behind the mid-day meal was to attract students to schools and to provide them with daily nutrition.“Apart from a meal each day, milk and fruits were also provided. A survey pointed out that about 30 to 40% students in such schools arrived without breakfast from homes. Children of our schools are primarily from poor section of the society and have no access to laptops, computers or internet connections at home. So, online classes for them are also not possible,” said Pawan Kumar Bhati, block education officer of Loni.Bhati said that some teachers are taking initiative to teach students through mobile application. “Some teachers in areas like Muradnagar have created group on smartphone apps and also asked students to connect to the group. But several students do not have access to smartphones, as most of the families have basic phones,” he added.Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey and chief development officer Asmita Lal did not take calls for comments on this story.However, some villages in the district are providing food to students. Arunima Tyagi, pradhan of Basantpur Sainthli village, said that she is trying her best to make food available to students.“Children are not getting mid-day meal nowadays since the schools are shut. But we are trying that dry ration reaches each family and children also have access to proper food. Also, children do not have access to technology at home. So we have planned that printed assignments be provided to them. We will place the copies of assignments at ration shops. Once the families arrive for taking ration, they can take assignments’ copy,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-govt-school-children-in-gzb-deprived-of-mid-day-meal/story-nsBAbohcnbfJCexpXkbPEN.html
13-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad authority struggles to meet high cost of supplying food to patients||Ghaziabad: In its changed role in times of Coronavirus outbreak, the Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) is working to provide food to patients daily in quarantine centres. However, the agency is struggling to find funds as they are only getting Rs 60 per packet from the administration as against the Rs 250 each packet costs, as they need to maintain calorie requirement of the patients.The authority said that every day, it is supplying at least 500 food packets to patients in quarantine wards and spending about Rs 1.25 lakh for arranging the food through a hired caterer. They added that initially, they started with a kitchen but the idea was shunned and a caterer was hired instead.“We are supplying 500 food packets and it is costing us about Rs 1.25 lakh per day which is very high, as we only get Rs 60 per patient for food. We have written to the district administration to at least hike the rate or make it at least double so that the food provision services are not hampered,” said SK Rai, secretary of GDA.The authority provides four meals which include breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinner.“The menu includes four-six chapatis, or puris in case chapati is not available. Then we have rice or pulao along with pulses and vegetables. If pulses are not available then two vegetables are provided. Apart from this, there is provision of milk and biscuits for minors. To continue with the food supply activity, we are now pooling our own resources so that supply is not hampered. Otherwise it is becoming difficult to provide such food while maintaining the calorie requirement,” he added.A team of GDA officials have stationed themselves at the Pandav Nagar premises of the caterer where they are supervising the food preparation and also ensuring timely supplies to the quarantine centres in Ghaziabad.Chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said a patient requires food which should provide him/her with at least 2,400 calories per day.“Since these patients are not ill, they need to be provided 2,400 calories per day as per norms. Although there has been no measure of the amount of calories each food packet provides, we assume that the present food supplied would be meeting such a requirement. However, we do not know if calorie measure is ascertained by any officials or not,” he added.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Padney did not take calls for comments and chief development officer Asmita Lal remained unreachable.In government hospitals like MMG District Hospital, no outside food is allowed but patients in isolation wards are provided food from the hospital mess. Patients who have spent time in the isolation ward of MMG Hospital said that the food provided is less in quantity of late, and also lacks variety.“We used to get lunch and dinner which included pulses, vegetables and chapati. In breakfast we used to get tea with two bread slices and evening tea was supplemented with biscuits. The food packets which we got at the quarantine centre were better in terms of quantity and also had variety,” said a 22-year-old patient who is presently in home isolation.Dr Ravinder Rana, chief medical superintendent of MMG Hospital, said they do not allow outside food for their patients, unlike the one provided by GDA in quarantine centres.“In our isolation ward, the food is provided from the hospital mess. We try to maintain 2,400 calories per day and no outside food in terms of packets, etc., provided by GDA are allowed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-authority-struggles-to-meet-high-cost-of-supplying-food-to-patients/story-nQnIiQtCwxoGw1W5T9Y3EN.html
13-04-2020||Mumbai||‘Drop in non-Covid deaths for March compared to past 3 years’||The city saw 5,669 non-Covid deaths in March, a drop from 7,155 reported in the month in 2019, 7,436 in March 2018 and 7,815 in 2017, according to a study compiled by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The state government began its staggered lockdown since March 12, when gymnasiums and swimming pools were closed. On March 13, schools and cinema halls were notified to be closed, and March 14, malls were notified to be closed. A strict work from home advisory for all was issued around March 19-March 20. Maharashtra has been on a complete lockdown since March 25. Local trains in Mumbai stopped working on March 22.Authorities have attributed the drop to early diagnosis, as people are urgently seeking medical advice for any illness or ailment and maintaining strict personal hygiene, even in densely populated areas with community toilets, amid Covid-19 outbreak and the lockdown. The lockdown and shutting of public transport have reduced the deaths owing to road accidents, trauma, Mumbai’s suburban train and tracks-related accidental deaths, and crimes.“We got the numbers and noticed today that there is a 24% reduction in mortality. Everyone is maintaining very strict personal hygiene, people are eating better, and upping their immunity to safeguard against Covid-19, so there are fewer deaths due to other vector-borne diseases. These are our obvious inferences and need to be vetted with examples and case studies. That will take some time,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, who is incharge of BMC’s health department.Experts have also attributed this to absence of industrial accidents as factories are shut, better lifestyle due to reduced incidents of immediate and high pressure leading to heart attacks or hypertension, fewer incidents of asthma attacks due to a cleaner environment and reduced medical surgeries.V Ranganathan, a retired bureaucrat and former municipal commissioner of Mumbai, said, “This is not a unique case. It has happened before. During the 1917 flu epidemic, or more recently in Canada, when all medical professions were on a 45-day strike, the mortality reduced. Right now, the number of medical surgeries for other ailments has gone down. Serious medical surgeries have a chance of not being successful, and hence contribute to mortality rate. There is also the general attention to hygiene, upped immunity, and zero industrial accidents, no road accidents... “Rakesh Maria, who was former commissioner of Mumbai, said, “Reduced traffic accidents, train accidents, and crime definitely play a role in mortality rate. People are indoors. However, we cannot draw an inference from this that everyone must stay at home at all times even after Covid-19 has passed.”Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health consultant from Navi Mumbai, said, “This trend is also because people are home. Heart and hypertension patients are relieved as they are with family. Psychologically, it helps them do better health-wise. With social distancing, spread of communicable diseases, which weaken the immune system, has gone down. Similarly, diseases such as gastroenteritis and diarrhoea have reduced as people are not eating out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/drop-in-non-covid-deaths-for-march-compared-to-past-3-years/story-bA2qOWOZBEu5vtxyQ25sDK.html

13-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi University looks at ways to conduct exam online for 9 lakh students||As Delhi stares at an extension of lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 disease, Delhi University on Monday conducted a meeting of all its deans to discuss the possibilities of conducting an online examination for around nine lakh students of the varsity.At least 12 deans and the pro-vice chancellor were present during Monday’s meeting, which was conducted through video conferencing. Submitting answers through audio clips was one of the suggestions that came up in the meeting.“We were exploring ideas on how to conduct the examination and it is all in the discussion mode. We don’t think any social gatherings will be allowed before June. From what it seems, conducting examinations at home seems to be the only option now,” said a dean, who was present at the meeting. “We spoke about multiple options in the online mode, including using phones and laptops. The other deans raised apprehensions on how students who didn’t have internet or device would appear for the papers. The university will be taking all these apprehensions into account,” the dean added.A section of teachers, however, have opposed the move. Rajesh Jha, DU executive council member, said, “In this online meeting, the administration proposed oral submission of answers through a third-party cyber platform, which clearly shows its scant understanding of essence of evaluation in higher education and its utter disregard for the students’ interest.”“There is a possibility that some students may be better in written evaluation than verbal evaluation. There is no training for them or the evaluators,” Jha said, adding that the “deans turned down the proposal.” “The examination in DU is a statutory process, which cannot be altered without approval of AC and EC. In the online process of paper setting, submission of answers and evaluation has very high chances of tampering and pilferage,” a teachers’ group Academics for Action and Development said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-university-looks-at-ways-to-conduct-exam-online-for-9-lakh-students/story-XYZ5E4UEjydlQlWxE2gikL.html
13-04-2020||Lucknow||Youth walks over 1600 km to reach Kashi from Mumbai||A 28-year-old youth walked over 1600 km for almost 14 days to reach Varanasi from Mumbai on Sunday night.A resident of Saptsagar Dawa Mandi area in Varanasi, he was, however, allowed entry into his house after he underwent screening at the government hospital and was found asymptomatic for coronavirus.Ashok Keshari works at a hotel in Nagpada area of Mumbai, said a police official.With his hotel shut in view of lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic, he decided to head towards his home in Varanasi on March 30.“I walked along the rail tracks on roads and remained hungry for most of the time. On way, some generous people gave food that helped me survive,” said Ashok, who reached Cantt station, Varanasi on Sunday.Here, when he called up his friends, they advised him to go for screening first.Ashok then went to divisional hospital, Kabir Chaura.The doctors at the divisional hospital informed him that screening for coronavirus takes place at the district hospital.He then walked to district hospital where doctors cleared him of coronavirus symptoms.He said the doctors advised him to stay in home quarantine for 14 days as a precaution.After the screening when he reached the house, his neighbours informed the police and Kotwali inspector Mahesh Pandey reached the spot.On inspector’s intervention, the youth was allowed entry into his locality and his house.Inspector Pandey said the youth was cleared of corona symptoms and hence was allowed to stay at his place.“The family has been told to keep Ashok in a separate room on the first floor of the house,” said the inspector.“We allowed him entry into the house only after screening as we thought police could take action against us,” said Ashok’s brother Kallu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/youth-walks-over-1600-km-to-reach-kashi-from-mumbai/story-zqfPSu4o2PooTptKogDCzN.html
13-04-2020||Mumbai||Statewide lockdown should continue past April 30: Study||Maharashtra should extend its lockdown beyond April 30 as it has a high proportion of asymptomatic carriers of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, according to a study conducted by Dinabandhu Andrews College and Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. Asymptomatic carriers could spread the virus without displaying symptoms themselves.Researchers Tridip Sardar, SK Shahid Nadim, Joydev Chattopadhyay carried out a mathematical analysis of the available data regarding the spread of Covid-19 across the country. According to their study, the lockdown would be successful in Delhi and Tamil Nadu, where 90% of the reported cases are symptomatic. In contrast, only 35% of the reported cases in Maharashtra showed symptoms. The study has been published on open-access preprint repository, Cornell University arXiv, and is under review process in Elsevier and The Lancet journals.Explaining the study, Sardar said, “When an epidemic curve goes up suddenly, the outbreak comes under control as the number of cured patients increases. This trend is visible in the graphics of Delhi and Tamil Nadu.” In Maharashtra, however, the graph shows a steady growth in the number of cases as most patients are asymptomatic, said Sardar. “This means, even after 35 days of lockdown, the cases will be high in Maharashtra and there will be a need to extend the lockdown further,” he added.The researchers suggested extending the lockdown in areas that have reported more cases. “Divide Maharashtra into different clusters with high rates of Covid-19 cases. Then close down the section with highest cases and provide relaxation to the remaining clusters for agro-economic and industrial growth,” said Chattopadhyay, adding that clusters where restrictions are relaxed would need continued monitoring.The Centre is planning a similar arrangement by which districts across the country would be divided into red (more than 15), orange (less than 15) and green (zero) zones, depending upon the number of reported cases. Restrictions would be relaxed in orange and green zones, to aid the agricultural sector and the economy.According to India Meteorological Department, this year the onset of monsoon in the state is expected earlier than usual, around June 10. “If the lockdown extends beyond May, it will be a huge loss in the agricultural sector,” said Sardar.In Maharashtra, several rural districts and urban areas haven’t reported any cases of Covid-19 like Dhule city, Nandurbar, Solapur, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad Municipal Corporation, Parbhani, Nanded, Akola, Gadchiroli, Wardha among others. Maharashtra is also among the states to have carried out the most number of tests and has the maximum number of testing centres at the moment.Independent health experts have supported the idea of a phased lifting of the lockdown, based on the proportion of asymptomatic cases in an area. “In my opinion, the decision of lockdown should be a mutual decision taking into consideration the condition of uninfected districts. The government can implement the area-wise hotspot containment strategy at the state level,” said health expert Anant Bhan.However, they have also underlined the importance of continued monitoring of those areas were restrictions are relaxed. Public health expert Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, who is with the Association of Medical Consultants, said “If we don’t implement it [lifting the lockdown], we will face economic loss and if we implement it, it can spread infection. So, as a precaution, only Industrial transportation along with social distancing and strong district surveillance should be implemented. Along with that, the government needs to start more fever clinics at relaxed clusters.”Last week, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced the lockdown would continue in Maharashtra till April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/statewide-lockdown-should-continue-past-april-30-study/story-q6ijHlSAHkoMxyIz4Nq66O.html
13-04-2020||Mumbai||18 more medical staffers test positive for Covid-19||On Monday, 18 more medical staffers were tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of infected health workers to 100 in the city. Eleven of those who tested positive on Monday are from Bhatia Hospital in Tardeo and six from Shushrusha Hospital in Dadar. Chanda Jadhav, assistant municipal commissioner, A ward, said one of the doctors from Bombay Hospital’s radiology department has also been tested positive, while the contact tracing for other staffers of the hospital is underway. “While we have sealed Bhatia and Shushrusha hospitals, we have no plans to seal Bombay Hospital as of now. Only one medical staffer has tested positive yet, and the future course of action will depend on the results of the other staffers after their tests,” a civic official said. With 11 more cases on Monday, Bhatia Hospital now has 25 Covid-19 positive staffers. “Around 150 more staff members were tested on Friday as part of precautionary measures, of whom 110 were found negative. The 25 staff members have been quarantined in the ICU and their health is being monitored round-the-clock by the hospital. There are no serious cases,” the hospital statement read. Shushrusha Hospital has already been sealed after two nurses tested positive earlier. On Monday, the civic body in a letter to the hospital management said it will test more than 100 staffers. However, the hospital staff is likely to test other asymptomatic staff too at its own expense. Meanwhile, the infected doctor from Bombay Hospital has been admitted to the Covid-19 ward. “We have also identified around 40 staffers who might have come in contact with the doctor, and will get them tested,” Dr Mehul Desai, president of Resident Doctors’ Association of Bombay Hospital, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/18-more-medical-staffers-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-A0cYPacG3J5Xm84uVemalO.html

Until March 27, Link View Fine Dine restaurant was giving free meal packets to police personnel, and have now started doing the same twice a day for over 12,500 daily wage workers in slums in P North and South wards.“It began with the urge to help, and while we started with a few hundred people in the beginning, soon we were giving away 12,500 packets of food twice a day,” said Y Harish Shetty, owner. “When we saw the number of people striving to make ends meet and feed their families, we increased the number of food packages from 8,000 meals to 12,500 meal packets, twice a day,” added Shetty.The day starts with putting together as much as 1,500kg rice, 625kg lentils, and 750kg vegetables. While Shetty initiated the supply, soon, fellow hoteliers from the North Mumbai Hoteliers Association pooled in their resources as well.“Around 35 hotel staff help with cutting vegetables, cooking and packing food. Our family members have also started helping,” said Karthik, Shetty’s son. BMC vehicles the transport the packed food and civic officials distribute it among the daily wage workers living in the slums.“We are doing our best to reach out to as many people as is possible by us.

13-04-2020||Mumbai||7 wards account for 50% of Covid-19 cases||With 807 cases, seven of the 24 wards in the city make up for more than 50% of the city’s count, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data, as on April 12. Till last week, two wards made up for 50% cases.Also, with the rise in cases, the BMC, on Monday, changed the classification for wards. Wards with more than or 70 cases were termed the one with the highest risk, followed by those with 35-70 cases, 15-34 cases and 1-14 cases. The BMC’s data for April 5 classified wards with more than 40 cases as the ones with highest risk, followed by 21-40 cases, 11-20 cases and 1-10 cases.The most affected ward, as of Monday, is G-South, which covers Worli and Lower Parel, with 280 cases, followed by E ward (Byculla) with 120 cases. Other wards are D ward (Malabar Hill, Walkeshwar) with 97 cases, M-East (Govandi, Mankhurd) with 82 cases, H-East (Bandra, Khar, Santacruz) with 80 cases, G-North (Mahim and Dadar) with 77 cases and K-West (Andheri, Vile Parle) with 71 cases.Meanwhile, in a meeting with senior civic officials on Monday, municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi directed all ward officers to identify open spaces or slots where vegetable and fruit markets can be set up while maintaining social distance. “We need to maintain a distance of 20ft between two vendors and 3.5ft between buyers. We can also allot spaces on major roads in the area,” said a ward officer of a suburban area.The civic body has carried out this exercise in Chunnabhati, where a temporary market has been set up at Somaiya Ground or in Vikroli East, where a market has been set up in an open ground of a school. However, there is no clarity on how the civic body plans to streamline groceries. Currently, with every ward officer giving separate directives on timings and, in some cases, days when grocers can keep their shops open, there is confusion on ground. “I was told by our grocer today, he will keep his shop open. When I reached there, the shutters were down,’’ said Nitin Patel, a resident of Prabhadevi, which so far does not fall in a containment zone. The BMC will not allow vegetable markets in any of the 381 containment zones, areas which are sealed as they saw positive cases or where close contacts of positive patients live. A senior civic official said, “We are taking various measures to ensure that people do not move out. The situation in a couple of wards is bad.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/7-wards-account-for-50-of-covid-19-cases/story-9lyFp9M8f81iu32QsHlCrN.html

Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said the government may even deploy Rapid Action Force (RAF) or Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), if need be, to contain the spread.The force has been deployed in red zones, which have a sizable number of Covid-19 patients, namely Dharavi and Worli-Koliwada in Mumbai, Gultekadi in Pune and Malegaon in Nashik. The hotspots have curfew-like restrictions. “We have given SRPF companies depending on the demand from district collectors or commissioners. Forty such companies of about 90 to 110 personnel have been deployed in various parts of the state,” Deshmukh told HT. “Their [RAF and CRPF] deployment is done in extreme conditions, but I don’t think that will be required. We will be able to handle the situation with the help of local police and SRPF,” he said.Mumbai MLAs and ministers Varsha Gaikwad and Aslam Shaikh had demanded deployment of the SRPF in areas like Worli and Dharavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/40-srpf-companies-deployed-in-covid-19-hotspots/story-X0Z62b8bq1AQQCDvXj6CzI.html

The administration, however, has rejected all such requests. A 21-day lockdown was initiated by put by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from March 25 to curb the spread of Covid-19.An official familiar with the development told HT that close to 2,000 new applications were received in the past two days from people asking for curfew passes after April 14.“But we are not approving any such applications, as there is no government instructions in this regard,” said the official, adding that those applications were rejected as they did not fit the current format.The official said that the district administration of Gurugram received 52,586 applications for curfew passes till date; of which 15,700 applications were approved.Of the 15,700 curfew passes, close to 12,000 passes are active as on date and around 500 passes are valid till April end, while the remaining 11,500 curfew passes will lose its validity on Tuesday.The curfew passes were approved for essential services and salary disbursement purposes only.“We believe around 3,000 to 3,500 curfew passes were approved to employers and employees for salary disbursements for a couple of days between March 30 and April 7 and they must have exhausted. For the remaining, there are multiple reasons. Some applied for supplying essential goods as retailers or main suppliers, while some applied for medical consultancy. Others wanted the passes for essential duties such as water and electricity supply. We rejected almost 70 percent applications on basis of the reasons given. We have no instructions from the government till date to issue passes after April 14,” said the official adding that the administration issued curfew passes with strict restrictions.A team of four officials KS Dhaka, CEO zila parishad, Inderjeet Kulharia, joint commissioner, MCG, Ramesh Ahuja, deputy labour commissioner and Manveer Singh, district revenue officer worked on issuing the curfew passes.In order to facilitate the curfew passes for lockdown period, an online application format was developed and it was integrated with the mobile application that one could easily download from Google playstore and use to send requests.“The process was made easy with few conditions – people had to attach his or her personal identity documents, supporting documents provided by agency or company he or she was associated with and passport size photograph. The entire administration and GMDA and officials of all other department, police worked day and night to make the lockdown successful. Not only curfew passes, GMDA’s I-CCC (integrated command and control centre) did play a crucial role during the lockdown period to monitor entire district with 300 plus CCTV cameras,” said VS Kundu, chief executive officer GMDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ggm-admin-gets-2-000-requests-for-curfew-passes-after-april-14-all-rejected/story-ni4mroCXb9QkMIzCNxb7GN.html
13-04-2020||Gurugram||Ola starts emergency service in Gurugram, covers 100 healthcare facilities||The district administration has allowed private cab aggregator Ola to help people access over 100 hospitals and healthcare facilities in the city. The Ola Emergency service became operational in Gurugram on Monday, after its launch in Nashik, Varanasi, Vizag, Bhubaneshwar and Bengaluru. “These services have been allowed to operate only to pre-approved locations because many people who need to access medical care may not have vehicles of their own,” Gurugram additional deputy commissioner and transport secretary Prashant Panwar said. He reiterated that there was no plan, at present, to resume any public transport services in the city.Anand Subramanian, head of communications at Ola, said, “With over 100 hospitals in the city mapped, the Ola Emergency service will be available round-the-clock for medical trips that do not require an ambulance. Trips to hospitals for medical emergencies are unavoidable, even in the current times. With Ola Emergency, we are able to facilitate trips to and from hospitals across the city through our app.”Ola Emergency’s list of serviceable locations are yet to be released. An Ola spokesperson said they were in the process of mapping additional hospitals and healthcare centres into the app and “customers will be charged a nominal fare according to the rate card”.Competitor Uber has also been operating a similar service, Uber Essentials, since April 7 in Gurugram. Besides hospitals and labs, Uber covers convenience stores and pharmacies as serviceable locations. It services 207 locations in the city for now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ola-starts-emergency-service-in-gurugram-covers-100-healthcare-facilities/story-tRmw2aNeIOMXgiWuXiXu1I.html
13-04-2020||City||Faridabad police using drones to monitor residents’ movements during lockdown||Gurugram: The Faridabad police are using five drones to ensure people abide by the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Sars-CoV-2 virus. The drones are helping the police check vehicular movement, implementation of the social distancing norms and use of masks by residents stepping out of their homes, said the police.Faridabad commissioner of police KK Rao said drones have been made a part of policing during the lockdown. “It is a key surveillance instrument to keep a tab on people’s movement. We have identified locations in 13 containment zones, sabji mandi, slum areas, and major traffic junctions to monitor the vehicular movements and to check violations, if any,” he said.The use of drones, which can help in surveillance in an area of over one kilometre, started on April 11, said the police. These drones have high-resolution cameras, and pictures and videos taken by them are better than satellite images and thus can be used for making a 3D model of the area, the police said. “They can fly up to a height of 250 metres and are equipped with night-vision cameras,” said Rao. The police department has hired four drones and outsourced six technical staff to operate them. “We had one drone and two men are trained to operate it. But one was not enough for the city, so we took a call to hire more so that all the containment zones are monitored,” said the police commissioner.Rao said they are adding another feature, starting Wednesday, using drones to announce the restrictions on the movement of people. “We are flying drones over places where we suspect violations of the lockdown can occur. After capturing the images, we immediately send them to the nearest police station which book those who violate the lockdown norms,” he said.In Faridabad, the police have booked 124 people using drones for allegedly loitering in their areas without mask.On Monday, a boy tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of positive cases to 32 in Faridabad, officials said. As many as 1,267 people are in home isolation, while 558 samples have been sent for testing. Out of 558 samples, 485 have tested negative and reports of 42 are awaited, the officials said.Faridabad deputy commissioner Yashpal Yadav said that 26 Covid-19 patients are still hospitalised.Yadav said they are regularly holding meetings with the police commissioner and chief medical officer to keep a tab on the ground situation. “The drones are of big help as in many areas the staff are unable to keep a tab. The drones are acting as our eyes and ears,” he said.Police commissioner Rao said that drones are being used for monitoring purposes. “Pickets have been set up along main roads and other arterial carriageways. The police can’t be everywhere, so remote monitoring is also needed. We have also requested resident welfare associations (RWAs) to keep a close vigil,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/faridabad-police-using-drones-to-monitor-residents-movements-during-lockdown/story-vEZfRFNjfyuRkvTUJfbTjL.html

13-04-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus lockdown: Delhi Police’s commandos deliver rations to those in need||Until the evening of March 22, when Delhi was placed in lockdown by the state government to contain the spread of Covid-19, the commandos of the Delhi Armed Police were busy transporting prisoners such as Abu Salem and Neeraj Bawana to and from various courts in the capital for hearings in their cases. They were also posted in the north-eastern part of the city, which had been hit by riots recently, to maintain law and order.But as the National Capital came to a halt, with less crime as well as all courts being closed, and court hearings taking place via video conferencing, these commandos are now working to feed the hungry and the underprivileged in the city.The two target shooting simulation rooms of the commandos in Malviya Nagar have temporarily been converted to a space where police personnel stock food, pack it for families in need and make it ready for distribution through the vans parked outside. Before the lockdown, these vans were used for transporting close to 2,000 prisoners from prisons to courts on a daily basis. Sitting near the rifles, used by the commandos to practice shooting until last month, the police personnel are busy packing the rations. Each ration packet has four kilograms (kg) of rice, three kilos of flour, two kilos of pulses, a bottle of cooking oil and a bar of soap.The unit has formed different teams – one to liaison with the Good Samaritans who want to donate food items, another to check that all distress calls are attended to, and a third team to keep stock of the essential food items and their distribution. The distress calls are attended by two NGOs, which the unit has tied up with.“Until last month, we were busy transporting prisoners as part of our job. However, now priorities have changed. At a time like this, we are glad to be doing something for society. This is such a noble cause,” said a head constable, requesting anonymity, part of the team tasked to feed the needy.On Monday, an orphanage located on Mathura road at the Nizamuddin-Jangpura crossing near Nizamuddin’s Markaz, called the police control room informing them that they were running short of ration and essential items for the 37 children who live in the home. The caller told the police that for the past few days, delivery persons have also stopped coming to the area after reports of rise in Sars-Cov-2 cases in the adjoining Nizamuddin area. The Nizamuddin Basti has emerged as the biggest hot spot for such cases in the national Capital.Special commissioner of police Robin Hibu, the chief of the Armed Police, said that upon receiving the call, a team of officials from his unit rushed to the orphanage. “Our officials did not hesitate to go to an area where so many cases have been reported within mere 50-100 metres. No delivery persons have been coming to the orphanage. I am proud of my boys. They even packed sanitary napkins for the young girls in the orphanage. We have also assured the caretakers that the police will continue to help and reach out to those in need during this time.” Since the lockdown began, government agencies have been working to feed the underprivileged on priority and officers at police stations across the city are also engaged in the same.Officials say the unprecedented decrease in incidents of crime in the national Capital has enabled the city police to focus on helping the underprivileged deal with the lockdown. According to them, there has been a marked reduction in all types of crimes including murder, robbery, snatching, theft and kidnapping ever since the lockdown began.But how does the Delhi Armed Police manage to gather resources every day? Hibu says Good Samaritans who want to help the poor are plenty.“Till now we have distributed ration to 4,762 families in the city. The two NGOs -- Helping Hands and North East Chamber of Commerce -- informed us of those in need of supplies. We verify the information they give and hand over the items. Each packet of ration is sufficient to last a few days. The government is helping us get in touch with NGOs. There are enough good people in the city who want to help. Some of them are anonymous donors. They want to join this fight against coronavirus. It is with their help that we have been managing to reach out to the underprivileged all these days,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/coronavirus-lockdown-delhi-police-s-commandos-deliver-rations-to-those-in-need/story-iLNp4Bq169pWAPhoLu8VOL.html
13-04-2020||City||Bridegroom, 6 others arrested while trying to sneak into Meerut for wedding||Ghaziabad: A 25-year-old groom and his six friends were arrested by the Ghaziabad police early Monday morning while they were trying to sneak into Meerut for wedding, in violation of the national lockdown enforced to stave off the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The Muradnagar police arrested the seven and booked them under various IPC sections.All of them are residents of Muradnagar and were to Meerut in two cars when they were nabbed by the Muradnagar police around 1.30am on Monday.“On Sunday evening, we received a communication from Meerut police about two marriages in a family based at Lisadi Gate, Meerut. One baraat was to come from Meerut and another from Muradnagar, Ghaziabad. So we contacted the bridegroom at Muradnagar and asked his family not to leave for Meerut without permission/passes since the lockdown is in place,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural).“Despite warning, the seven -- the bridegroom and his six friends -- tried to go to Meerut in two cars but were nabbed during checking by the police. The groom was dressed up in full wedding attire. The seven were taken to the police station and an FIR was lodged against them. The cars were also seized,” Jadaun added.The police have booked the seven men under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life).“Now the wedding has been postponed and it will take place only after the lockdown is lifted. We were hoping to reach Meerut during night and perform wedding on Monday. We had planned to return late night. But the police stopped the groom and his friends and arrested them,” said a relative of the groom.Officials said the seven men were later released on bail and sent back home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bridegroom-6-others-arrested-while-trying-to-sneak-into-meerut-for-wedding/story-hdXyRkfDaSsFlvYID0g52O.html

13-04-2020||Noida||Despite appeal, medical waste not being segregated in Noida societies||Despite the Noida authority’s appeal last week to segregate medical waste from regular garbage, the process has proved itself difficult for the inhabitants of high-rises in the city.The notice issued by the authority had said that all medical waste has to be treated through a scientific process.“Almost everyone is using masks and gloves, and according to government guidelines, medical waste has to be disposed of scientifically. So, it is a request to all residents to ensure that all such used products (gloves and masks) should be handed over to the door-to-door collection agency separately. The medical waste collected will be handed over to another agency for proper disposal,” the appeal from the authority said.Office bearers of residential bodies believe that the segregation has to start at the individual house level.“If each house hands it over separately, it becomes easier for segregation. Vendors can then separate it before handing it over to the authority. And that way it can be treated properly. However, this isn’t happening,” Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association, said.Despite the appeal, residents are not separating medical waste.“Most people are not segregating it at an individual house-level. It becomes difficult for staff to do it thoroughly afterwards which defeats the purpose. Despite handing over the segregation to the door-to-door collection agents, it is still not being implemented,” Amit Gupta, president, Prateek Wisteria, Sector 77, said.The appeal has been circulated among residents in at least 70 societies in Noida. “We are urging people to do this and hope to see better results in the coming days. Even the maintenance staff and guards are being educated on this and we are pursuing this thoroughly in all societies now. The collection vendor was not doing it, which seems to be a communication gap on the authority’s end and let’s hope that the situation gets resolved soon,” Singh said.The Uttar Pradesh government, like several other state governments, had mandated the use of masks in all public places last week, which implies that going forward there will be more generation of medical waste in the city.“To avoid this whole situation we have been requesting our residents to use cloth masks, which can be washed and re-used. That way there will be less generation of waste. We even distributed 150 cotton masks to our society staff,” Gupta said.The problem is more pronounced in high-rises as compared to individual houses.“The segregation is taking place and apart from the earlier two categories of recyclable and non-recyclable waste, we now have a third category of medical waste, which is being segregated at the first level itself and is being collected separately,” KK Jain, secretary-general, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association, said.Noida authority officials clarified that though it is not very extensive for now, segregation is taking place in some areas.“All door-to-door collection agents have been given a third separate dustbin to collect medical waste, which is being treated separately. In the next few days, the efficiency of the process will improve further,” Vijay Rawal, project manager, health department, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/despite-appeal-medical-waste-not-being-segregated-in-noida-societies/story-5ddyIHUevPx3Y1wSVFXYlJ.html
13-04-2020||Noida||Injured civet rescued from Noida, under treatment||Highly distressed and in pain, an injured palm civet – an extremely shy nocturnal mammal --was rescued on Monday from a residential area in Sector 41, Noida.The animal was found hiding under a car bonnet on Monday afternoon. It had a fractured hind leg. According to rescuers from the animal organisation People for Animals (PFA), the civet had cuts on its chest that seemed to have healed under medical care, suggesting that the civet had been rescued earlier as well.“We received a call from residents of Sector 41 that an animal was trying to crawl across the road and seemed in distress as it was crying. We searched late Sunday night but only found it hiding under the bonnet of a car the next day. It’s undergoing treatment, we got an x-ray done at a hospital in Sector 120,” said Kaveri Rana, president, PFA, Gautam Budh Nagar.She added that they looked forward to its recovery and would then rehabilitate it in the Surajpur forest, which is one of the few protected forests in the district.“We are in talks with the chief veterinary officer also, and he has assured us help in case it is required. We will also speak to the forest department for its safe rehabilitation,” Rana added.The district forest department said that the city has several urban forest patches, which are suited for civets, while protected habitats like the Surajur wetlands are most apt.“We have a good habitat to support a breeding population of civets in Gautam Budh Nagar, though their sighting is very low because of their nocturnal behaviour,” Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.According to the forest officer census, there were a total of 13 civets spotted in the district in 2019, while in the previous census held in 2011 their number was 12.Protected under schedule-2 of part-1 of Wildlife Protection Act-1972, that makes it a punishable offence to hunt the species, civets are vulnerable species.“The civets are arboreal species which means that they like the trees and often live inside holes. They are an excellent indicator species, which means that their presence shows that the habitat is healthy with enough prey. They often eat fruits but also live off eggs and insects, and occasionally also scavenge. There are myths and misconceptions associated with them, such as they dig graves,” said Kartick Satyanarayanan, co-founder of wildlife welfare organisation Wildlife SOS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/injured-civet-rescued-from-noida-under-treatment/story-3Mjvxqn0u18oYfybH3wQeN.html
13-04-2020||Noida||Postpone power bill payment till June, demand Noida residents||City residents wrote a letter to the Uttar Pradesh government on Monday, demanding the postponement of electricity bill payment till June-end, 2020, due to the nationwide lockdown in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis. They said there are at least 60% consumers who cannot pay online or are unable to make the payment.“The electricity bill based on March’s consumption is due and has been sent to respective customers. Soon, the bill for the month of April will be sent to consumers. Only a few customers have been able to pay the bill online. At least 60% of customers, who are not paying online, are unable to process their bills. If the nationwide lockdown extends then payment of bills will not be possible. Therefore, we have requested the government to postpone the payment of electricity bills till June 30, 2020 for the ease of such customers,” said retired Brigadier Ashok Hak, convenor of the Noida chapter of confederation of Delhi-NCR residents’ welfare associations (CONRWA), a residents’ group.CONRWA said that the payment of electricity bill is not only an issue with residents but also with daily wage labourers, who are living on rent, small shopkeepers and other small traders, whose businesses are shut.“Due to the nationwide lockdown all kinds of economic activities are shut. As a result there is a liquidity crisis that is troubling every section. It will be useful if the state government extend the payment of electricity bills till June 30, 2020 to provide ease to customers in Noida,” said PS Jain president of CONRWA.There are 3.5 lakh total customers in Noida who get electricity supply from Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL). And the payment of bills has been affected due to lockdown said officials of PVVNL.“Our 65% customers pay online bills generally and after the lockdown started we are encouraging all our customers to pay the bills online to avoid any hassle.

13-04-2020||City||Pune collector directs private doctors to treat Covid-19 patients||Pune: The Pune district administration on Monday issued an order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, taking over the services of private doctors for treating Covid-19 patients. The order, issued under Section 25 of Disaster Management Act, allows the administration to constitute a tribunal which has transferred services of enlisted private doctors.According to a press release issued by the district collector’s office, private doctors would now have to help the administration design a treatment protocol for the treatment of Covod-19 patients, especially those with comorbid conditions. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) believes that it will be a tough challenge given that the pandemic has already hit the city.Dr Aarti Nimkar, chief, IMA Pune chapter said, “IMA Pune has already started helping the district administration from Monday with their OPDs and clinics. In a recent meeting of private doctors and major hospitals with the district administration it was discussed that each medical college and major hospitals would have to prepare a Covid-19 isolation centre and provide their senior doctors to help the administration.”She said at this juncture it would be difficult to design a protocol since the city has already seen many positive cases. “There is no single drug or protocol which works for all patients and many of them have multiple health conditions. Hence, to design a treatment protocol is a challenge,” Nimkar said.With increase in the number of positive and suspected cases in the city, the district administration is scrambling to find isolation centres for suspected and their close contacts. According to the district administration, each major hospital in the city would have a nodal officer who would be in touch with Sassoon General Hospital to coordinate between the doctors. The doctors concerned would also be paid an honorarium. The collaboration between private and government doctors would help bring in the expertise required to treat comorbid patients who are most affected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 (coronavirus).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-collector-directs-private-doctors-to-treat-covid-19-patients/story-F73JsjGyQ4QptafkT3EajL.html

13-04-2020||Mumbai||Congress slams Modi govt for bias against Maha over not allowing CSR funds under CM relief, BJP refutes allegations||The state Congress has slammed the Centre for bias against Maharashtra in its time of need by not granting a go ahead to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to accept funds under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) even though the same has been permitted for the recently formed Prime Minister Cares Fund. PM Cares Fund was formed recently to tackle coronavirus. Congress spokesperson and general secretary Sachin Sawant said that despite several Chief Ministers including Uddhav Thackeray raising this issue in the recent meeting with the Prime Minister, no clarification or assurance has so far been given to the states. BJP has refuted this as a false narrative and pointed out that the law amending Companies Act to allow for CSR only in PM relief fund was enacted in 2013 during former UPA II regime.``Considering the gravity of the Covid-19 problem in Maharashtra, non receipt of rightful funds from the Union government and also their insufficient aid for tackling coronavirus, Maharashtra needs CM relief fund like never before. While CM relief Fund has been in existence for several years the Union government has not considered it to be eligible for CSR funding,’’ said Sawant, who has also written a letter stating the same to revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat along with Chief Minister Thackeray and deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.Sawant added that while several industrialists and business houses wanted to donate to CM Relief fund, this clause would deter them from doing the same and channel the funds to the centre.Former Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis however said, ``It was in 2013 that the law was enacted which stated that CSR funds can be given only to PM Relief Fund and not to CM Relief Fund at the state level. This is not a decision taken by the Modi government. At the same time the Centre allows CSR funding being given to the state disaster management fund. Why is this government not using this route ?’’Sawant accepted that the Centre via its general circular dated April 10 had clarified that contribution by corporates to the State Disaster Response Fund can qualify as CSR expenditure but pointed out that there was ambiguity about accepting such funds from corporates in the Act.Since the Act was enacted, he said corporate funds or individual contributions haven’t been accepted in this Fund because there are no provisions for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-slams-modi-govt-for-bias-against-maha-over-not-allowing-csr-funds-under-cm-relief-bjp-refutes-allegations/story-3Gyk13M4fYZLRWGEV08u6O.html
13-04-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana residents send medicines to loved ones via post||The lockdown has led to the non-availability of some medicines in certain places, as such many people are now using the services of the postal department to ensure that their loved ones get the medicine they need.The shortage is more acute in big cities where the demand is more. People getting treated in a different city are stranded and dependant on relatives for medicines. Rajguru Nagar branch sub-post office master Sarita Madaan said the branch had booked 85 parcels of medicine since the lockdown. “Before the lockdown, we rarely received bookings for medicines as people mainly relied on private courier companies but now we deliver medicines on a regular basis. People have medicines delivered within the state and to neighbouring states.”She said the branch is receiving parcel bookings for Hoshiarpur, Banga, Chandigarh, Kharar, Sangrur, Patiala, Ferozepur Cantonment and Moga.“Today, a woman whose son works in Chandigarh, requested that her package containing medicines be delivered urgently. She said her son was being treated by a doctor in Ludhiana and was unable to get the prescribed medicines in the UT,” she said. Ludhiana senior superintendent of post office Amanpreet Singh said in a day, the Ludhiana post circle, which covers 45 post offices in urban areas and 11 branch offices (BO) that in turn cater to 85 villages, on an average receive 120 medicine parcels for delivery.“We are priortising the delivery of medicines that are separately packaged and sorted at the National Sorting Hub office based at the Ludhiana railway station. The hub receives mail from 11 districts,” said Amanpreet.Amid the lockdown, all branches under the Head Post Office, Ludhiana, are only accepting booking to cities and towns in Punjab, neighbouring states of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and the five metros of Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru. With trains and buses shut, the postal department is primarily relying on its own Mail Motor Services (MMS) for carrying out delivery services within the state and in adjacent states while airlines are being used to deliver parcels in the metros. “The postal department tries to ensure that medicine orders within the state are delivered the very next day. For Himachal Pradesh and Haryana, it takes two to three days while for the metro cities, the parcels are delivered within the week,” he said. The official added that the department was contacting city-based pharma companies to get consignment through India Posts since all other courier services were shut. How to prepare a package for medicines BOX Take a box. Line it with cotton or a newspaper. Syrup should not be in glass bottles. Cover the box with the clean white paper and clearly mention the particulars of the receiver and giver. Add mobile numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-residents-send-medicines-to-loved-ones-via-post/story-WJli9ZEt3b2Fjyf1JXesRL.html

Later, he takes up housework such as cooking and cleaning. He also takes out time to enhance his knowledge about sports through the internet. He spends his evening guiding his students telephonically.“My wife was in Canada with our younger son when the lockdown was imposed. I am at home with my 86-old-year mother and elder son. My mother is teaching me to cook these days,” he says with a laugh.He adds that keeping active was helping him stay physically and mentally fit.“However, I have observed that many residents are killing time watching TV or browsing the social media. They are not involved in any physical activity, which is leading to negative thoughts and has an adverse impact on the health,” he says.Pannu says that to avoid boredom and to replace negative thoughts with positive ones, people should keep themselves busy with creative activities. He says in order to tackle this unprecedented situation, we must keep ourselves mentally and physically fit. He suggests that one should spend 15-20 minutes exercising or doing yoga. “People should also walk or jog on the terrace or veranda.“One should make the best of the situation and learn something new. Today, we can find everything on the internet. So, one can chose to learn gardening, dancing, cooking or some other skill, rather than just sitting or lying in one place,” Pannu says, signing off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/life-in-times-of-lockdown-indulge-in-creative-activities-forgo-negativity/story-QIErUCtSEhc2Qa53HEfvjN.html

13-04-2020||Delhi||Man held for beating up vegetable vendor in Badarpur||Delhi Police on Monday arrested a man for allegedly attacking a vegetable vendor with a stick and demanding to see his Aadhaar card in order to ascertain his religion and name. A video of the incident later surfaced on microblogging site Twitter, prompting Delhi Police to swing into action.Police identified the attacker as Praveen Babbar, who runs a tour and travels agency. He had allegedly attacked the vegetable vendor on Tajpur Road on April 10 and was arrested from Badarpur Extension, where he lives with his family.A case was registered at Badarpur police station. “Babbar has been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code,” said deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said.In the 44-second video, the vendor is seen with a vegetable pushcart.

Salim said that his brother was originally selling vegetable on the cart, but had gone to eat lunch. So he was filling in.“Around 1.30 pm. I was standing near the cart when four men came and one of them asked me my name and demanded my Aadhaar Card. I told him my Aadhaar card was at home. The man started hurling abuses at me as soon as he heard my name. He then grabbed a stick and began assaulting me. He told me not to sell vegetables or come into the neighbourhood,” said Salim.The vegetable seller said that he did not inform the police or file a complaint, thinking that those men were police personnel. “I was scared and decided not to file a police complaint,” added Salim.

At this Babbar started to beat him up,” the DCP added, quoting Babbar’s statement. Last week, a similar video of racism pertaining to Covid-19 had surfaced on social media. In the video, a man was seen bleeding from his leg and pleading to his attackers that he was not spreading the virus. The police later found that the incident took place in outer Delhi’s Bawana.

13-04-2020||Mumbai||State education department rolls out e-learning content for Class 1-9||The state education department started rolling out digital learning content to students in government and aided schools across Maharashtra on Monday (April 13). Under the initiative, students from Class 1 to 9 can watch videos, listen to recorded lessons and solve exercises on their phones. The content is hosted on the Diksha app which is a ministry of human resource department (MHRD) platform for e-learning. Every day, students would be sent a set of links on the phones of their parents or guardians, and they can access this content as per their convenience to continue learning. Dinkar Patil, director, Maharashtra State Council for Educational Research and Training, that is overlooking the initiative, said, “The Diksha app already has nearly 9,000 different uploads for learning content. But to ensure that students follow the right sequence, we will share links from the app which would make it easy for them to access the content.” The links will be shared with the students through their class teachers. The department is also working on the use of television and radio to air educational content for students who do not have access to smartphones. “MHRD’s Swayam channel will host this content for two hours in the morning and evening every day. We are working on the content and it should begin in a couple of days,” added Patil. With the education department’s announcement of promoting students from Class 1 to 9 based on their previous scores, several teachers had raised concerns about learning coming to a standstill. The department has thus ensured that through online education, students stay in sync with studies even as they are at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-education-department-rolls-out-e-learning-content-for-class-1-9/story-Ls6xhDUWZHajakeIITKOjI.html

But, after a communication with Peta, we have stopped using rabbits for testing which were earlier being used to train undergraduate medical students at the institute.”He said the institution was not using any animal for experiments, even for demonstration, in the undergraduate courses. According to a press release of Peta, in its letter to the college, it pointed out that the use of rabbits, who were denied food for several days at a time and were being held in crowded cages, appeared to violate not only the Medical Council of India’s 2014 notification and the Indian government’s 2012 directive to replace animal dissection with modern, non-animal teaching methods at the undergraduate level, but also the regulations established by the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals on the use of animals in experiments. In the release, Peta India research associate Dr Ankita Pandey said, “We are urging all medical colleges to take note of this incident and keep animal experiments and dissection out of the classroom and instead use superior non-animal teaching methods.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hisar-medical-college-ends-animal-testing/story-2HM8ylxU6OmbbS1m07QZIP.html
13-04-2020||City||As Canada airlifts citizens, permanent residents stranded in India allege discrimination||Canadian permanent residents (PRs) stranded in India due to the countrywide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 have alleged discrimination by their government, saying it is only airlifting its citizens by special chartered flights.PRs given permanent resident status by immigrating to Canada are not Canadian citizens. Thousands of such people are stranded in India, especially Punjab, feel the Canadian authorities have left them in the lunch.“My wife and two sons are Canadian citizens and in Vancouver right now. We are not being allowed to go there by special charter flights arranged by the Canadian government for people stranded here,” says Gurpal Singh from Kabir Park. He and his parents hold Canadian PRs.“People are ready to pay. Also, why are PRs from Pakistan and Nepal being allowed to go back but not us?” he asked. As many as 200 such Canadian PRs have written to the consul general of Canada in Chandigarh to raise the issue. “Having no option to return, Canadian PRs are forced to wait for the Indian airspace to open, which honestly, does not appear to be happening anytime soon”, it reads.“We understand that there are a large number of Canadian citizens currently stuck in India, and that the government of Canada must prioritise repatriating citizens first. We appreciate all the efforts being put in by your office, which has been working nonstop to organise a way home for Canadian citizens in India. Having said that, we consider ourselves an integral part of the Canadian society. We have our family, jobs, houses, and friends in various parts of Canada. And we are desperate to go home as well, just like the citizens, which is not possible without your urgent intervention,” the letter reads.In their plea to the counsul general, the PRs say, “All of us were well established in our respective lives when we left from India and we have ever since been contributing towards the growth of Canada in every sector, be it education,medicine, research, engineering, social work, paying our share of taxes, creating employment opportunities for fellow Canadians, and generally keeping the economy running. Our share is no less than that of citizens in building a great country like Canada. Therefore, is it too much to demand our share of fair treatment as well, particularlywhen we need it the most? The Canadian border is open for Canadian citizens as well as the PRs. In other countries, you have included PRs (without any clause affixed) in your repatriation missions. Thus, why should PRs from India be left behind?”Listing the names of 200 PRs wanting to fly back to Canada, the letter reads, “Though this list is not exhaustive by any means but it still gives you an idea as to the number of PRs that are desperate, yet not getting the desired support from the government to return to Canada. It is, therefore, our kind and earnest request, to please include the permanent residents of Canada (that are not accompanied by citizens) as well in your forthcoming flights from India.”Abhinav Rana, a PR from Chandigarh, said they had also sent emails and tweeted to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Foreign Affairs Minister Philippe Champagne appealing for help and the PM’s office had responded in a revert email saying their case would be considered.The PRs have also started a twitter campaign, #CanadianPRinDistressInIndia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-canada-airlifts-citizens-permanent-residents-stranded-in-india-allege-discrimination/story-uD214LNBJybQ2LpP3nRyKP.html
13-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab milk producers grapple with price drop, erratic payments amid lockdown||As the lockdown continues, milk producers in Punjab are struggling with low demand, price reduction and irregular payments by mass procurers.As consumption by small-scale milk processers, dairies and halwais these days is nearly negligible, the milk producers are dependent on state milk cooperative Milkfed and big private players like Amul and Nestle for procurement.Prior to the lockdown, 3.15 crore litres of milk were produced in the state daily, but the current figures are not known to us yet, said Milkfed managing director Kamaldeep Singh Sangha. “Around 60 lakh litres are procured by private milk processing brands. Of this, Milkfed is processes 27 lakh litres every day, while the other brands are collectively processing 30-35 lakh litres of milk,” said Sangha. Milkfed sells products under the Verka brand.Sukhwinder Singh a milk producer who also manages a collection centre for milk processors in his village Bhattian, Samrala, told HT that Milkfed and other brands have not paid dairy farmers for the last 20 days. After price revision, the procurement price of buffalo milk has been reduced to ₹47.25/litre and that of cow milk to ₹30-32/litre.Former Verka milk plant head Parminder Singh Chalaki seconded that due to lockdown the entire procurement burden was on the state cooperative and the big private firms. He asked the state government to support milk producers on the pattern of Haryana government which is giving ₹5/litre support over and above the prevailing prices.Reportedly, milk supplies from Punjab to Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Delhi are almost nil, which used to be ₹5 lakh litres daily earlier. “We’re in the process of increasing the production of ultra-heat treatment (UHT) milk packs with shelf-life of six months. Nowadays, UHT is majorly bought by the army,” said Sangha.According to him, Milkfed is currently selling 11 lakh litres of milk daily, while 16 lakh litres go into production of milk powder and white butter. “Every day, the state cooperative procures milk worth ₹10 crore and to keep its operations going in the wake of dwindling sales, it has taken a credit of ₹100 crore and is seeking additional ₹150 crore,” said Sangha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-milk-producers-grapple-with-price-drop-erratic-payments-amid-lockdown/story-u1zT6hn5lx31BFXQmN8bIM.html

13-04-2020||Noida||GB Nagar home guards feed unemployed migrants without masks, salaries||Feeding hundreds of unemployed workers and their families in Noida’s Sector 8 is a bitter-sweet experience for Satish Kumar, a home guard. The sight of families eating makes him think of his own eight-year-old daughter and wife. They live in Bulandshahr and have no ration or money. Kumar, too, has no money to send them; he hasn’t been paid yet. “They have no ration, no money. My daughter told me yesterday she has not had any milk in 15 days. I am helpless as I haven’t received my salary for March,” he said.Kumar is one among the nearly 600 home guards—deployed at collectorate, police stations, other government offices and on emergency duties such as distribution centres for essential commodities, including sealed hot spots—who are yet to receive their salaries for the month of March.The ground reality shows the orders issued by the Central and state governments are not being followed. After the announcement of lockdown, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced that the wages or salaries of any government employee will not be cut and had directed government authorities to “ensure timely payment of salaries”.“Forget salaries, we don’t even have masks,” said another home guard Sujeet Chowdhary, who added that to top it all they were being ill-treated by their seniors. Pointing at dozens of his colleagues working near Sector 22, a hot spot, he said, “See, we are working in the most dangerous areas. But, has anyone noticed that we have not been given masks. Either we use our old masks or we use our towels to save ourselves.”Chowdhary’s colleague Dinesh Singh was rebuked by his platoon commander when he asked for masks two days ago. “He said that nobody has invited us to work as home guards. He has made it clear that that they will not provide us any protective gear. When I asked him about March’s salary, he said that it will be given once this crisis is over,” he said.When contacted, GB Nagar district commandant (home guards) Vedpal Singh Chaprana said that salaries could not be processed in the district treasury due to the Covid-19 outbreak. “Everyone is on duty these days. It is a time-taking exercise. We have not collected the muster rolls from guards’ respective places of posting. It will be verified first. Then, we will send the compiled report to the treasury, from where it will be processed to banks for payment,” he said.When asked about his salary, Chaprana replied: “Our case is different. We are not the part-time employees.”Asked when the home guards were likely to get face masks, Chaprana’s response was a light-veined, “The arrangement will be made.”Since the outbreak in December last year, Covid-19 pandemic has claimed over 1 lakh lives globally and 326 in India, where an increasing number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, have made it mandatory to wear face masks before going out to get essential supplies amid a nationwide lockdown. Governments have said citizens who are caught without a face mask could even face jail. Many countries that have reopened post lockdowns have reported a second wave of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-home-guards-feed-unemployed-migrants-without-masks-salaries/story-aUbq8yaouA9VjwJqjvHkNP.html
13-04-2020||City||Noida apartment owners make Roti Bank for needy amid Covid 19 pandemic||NOIDA: To ensure that the homeless and persons from impoverished backgrounds do not go hungry amid the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19, apartment owners on Sunday started a ‘roti bank’ by collecting two chapatis from each flat in apartment complexes located in sectors 78 and 79 of Noida.After collection, the home-made chapatis are taken to a community kitchen run by the Noida authority, located in nearby Sorkha village, and then delivered to migrant daily workers and others living in the city.The initiative was started by apartment owners of three housing complexes of Sector 78 -- Antriksh Golf View 1, Golf View 2, Assotech Windsor Court -- and Sportswood in Sector 79, who came together to start this group.“We have requested other residents and apartment owners via Whatsapp groups and other social networking channels to make two extra chapatis at home daily to help those in need. Each apartment owner will hand over the items to security guards in a packet, after which the authority’s representative will collect these packets daily in the evening,” said Brijesh Singh, an apartment owner.Volunteers said they hope all families come forward to donate. “We hope we will are successful in helping as many people as we can and hope other society residents also join us in this cause,” said a volunteer, requesting anonymity.The initiative was started to help the Noida authority feed those in need as arranging food for so many people on a daily basis is not an easy task for any one entity alone, said volunteers.Officials said the authority has approved this plan of these socially active apartment owners, who want to help the impoverished sections of the society.“Social groups are coming forward in large numbers to help the needy get regular food, across the city. We will continue serving food as per government orders,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the authority.Volunteers say they contacted people from different societies. However, they have decided not to give credit to any one person for the same as it is a group effort, they add.They say that as of now, this campaign is being run for two weeks, but they can extend it if more people come forward. The authority is running five community kitchens in the city – at Shani temple Sector 14A, Harola in Sector 5, Bhangel, Sorkha and Mamura – to feed those in need. So far, it has distributed a total of 6,91,943 food packets, Many social groups are also contributing to this job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-apartment-owners-make-roti-bank-for-needy-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-M8jJcO3zk4F2FtwYeyi9xK.html
13-04-2020||Noida||For local leaders video conferencing, social media are the way to go||Even as the nation continues to maintain a semblance of normalcy during the ongoing lockdown, local public representatives have resorted to speaking with their constituents via video conferencing and social media.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced a three-week nationwide lockdown on March 24 and with the imposition of Section 144 in the district, any gathering of people was out of the question. So to raise their concerns, people started interacting with local leaders via social media.“I did a Facebook live session today for an hour during which people raised their issues. In any place where the public said that they are not getting essential services, we took measures to help them out. The whole social media thing started when we first started interacting with the state ministers and is now a means to speak with the public as well,” said Dhirendra Singh, MLA, Jewar.He said that he is constantly speaking with residents of his constituency. “We are interacting via video calls with representatives of both sectors and high-rises. Yesterday I also spoke with a few NRIs. In fact, instructions to the public kitchen staff in Jewar are also being given through video calls. This way problems are noticed and we work on resolving them,” said Singh.In Noida city as well, office bearers of various residential bodies are interacting with elected leaders in this manner.“Representatives of at least 15 high-rises interacted with the Noida MLA on Friday. The main issues were the dos and don’ts for the apartments, garbage collection, regulation of retail prices, payment of water bills, etc. and some passes for residential volunteers for local movement,” said Rajesh Sahay, secretary general, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association.In addition, office bearers from individual sectors and the Federation of Noida Residents’ Welfare Associations have also conducted online meetings with Noida MLA Pankaj Singh.Singh said that it is not just interaction with residents; meetings with party workers are also taking place via video conferencing. “I have spoken to residents today as well and will continue to do so in the next few days. I am planning an interaction with industrial bodies also soon. We are speaking with party workers also in a similar manner. No one had ever thought that this is what it would come to but we are making the best of it. Public concerns are being looked into and this is a great platform to discuss common issues,” said Pankaj.Residents are also heavily relying on social media platforms for their routine work.“We are using the society’s WhatSapp group to exchange books among various students from different classes,” said Dharmendra Sharma, president, RWA, Sector 34.Residents are offering their children’s old school books to others as the academic session has now begun in most educational institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/for-local-leaders-video-conferencing-social-media-are-the-way-to-go/story-m2hoNm0lp7dtzyO4NeIO1L.html
13-04-2020||Noida||Corona warriors deliver essential services in Noida||When vendors couldn’t turn up on time to deliver essential services such as groceries, milk or vegetables in some areas amid the lockdown, particularly in sectors that are sealed for being coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hot spots, many junior engineers, horticulture inspectors and other government officials helped to deliver goods at odd hours.At times vendors are late or left with no supply, and residents, particularly elders, call the Noida authority that is supplying essential services for help.“If anyone in any sector be it normal or part of sealed hot spots needs vegetables, fruits, milk, groceries or even medicine, then we try to address the issue immediately no matter what time it is. Our motive is that people get immediate help in this time of crisis. Our juniors engineers, inspectors or other team members are delivering essential goods personally at homes, either with a vendor or by themselves,” said Rajeev Tyagi, general manager of the Noida authority.There are 25 hot spots in Gautam Budh Nagar district. On Saturday morning, Sumitra V Goenka sought help from the Noida authority as she needed vegetables and other essential goods in Sector 44, which is one of the hot spots. The authority delivered vegetables to her.“She was facing issues in locating the vendor and was stressed out. Our junior engineer Dinesh Lawania immediately provided help. Similarly, our staff delivered all essential goods to people in all hot spots and other areas immediately. We are trying to resolve all issues, wherever people are facing them,” said Tyagi.In Wazidpur, another hot spot, a family had issues in locating the vendor assigned to the area and called the authority’s engineer at night.“At our request, the junior engineer himself came with our order in the night. We are thankful to the Noida authority, that their junior staff is working day and night, and personally visiting people in need of essential services,” said Dipika Singh, a resident of Wazidpur. Similarly in Sector 22, which is also a hot spot and sealed, the authority immediately sent their staff when the assigned vendor did not turn up for some reason.“Senior Noida authority officials immediately called me and rushed junior staff to the sector. They immediately arranged another vendor, who provided all essential goods. We must appreciate and encourage these corona warriors, who are coming out daily for their services because their lives are also at risk,” said Sudharshan Awasthi a resident of Sector 22. Even Sector 51 residents were irate on Saturday as they did not receive the supply of essential goods.“I called up the Noida authority and informed them that people are angry. In half an hour, the junior engineer and other staff along with vendors reached our sector with vegetables, fruits, medicines and milk. We appreciated their effort,” said Sanjiv Kumar, general secretary of the Sector 51 residents’ welfare association.The Noida authority’s team also promptly helped residents after Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh’s intervention.“Some people sought help from me. We informed the Noida authority and they immediately helped the persons in need. Helping the needy in a crisis is our duty and we are trying to do our best,” said Singh.Residents started facing problems after the entry of vendors was prohibited inside the housing complexes once the UP government identified hot spots. But on Sunday, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY strictly ordered that goods must be delivered at doorsteps.“The administration and the police have allowed for the provision of door delivery of essential goods inside the hot spots. Some residents’ welfare associations are forcing residents to go to the gate compulsorily. Request them to follow rules. Violations shall be strictly dealt with,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/corona-warriors-deliver-essential-services-in-noida/story-OM9mKs49d92dJZ7QOcNebO.html
13-04-2020||City||Entry of general public banned in Sahibabad market after videos of crowds gathering emerge||After videos of people flouting of norms of social distancing went viral, officials banned the entry of general public in Ghaziabad’s biggest government vegetable market — Sahibabad Mandi. The officials said that from now on only the wholesalers and retailers will be allowed to enter the market and operations will take place between 10pm to 7am.The decision was taken by officials when, two days ago, some videos went viral in which huge crowd of local residents and traders were seen buying and selling vegetables within the Sahibabad market premises. The market is a favourite destination of residents of Indirapuram, Vasundhara, Vaishali and Sahibabad to buy fresh produce. “The entry of general public in the market has been banned as social distancing was not being followed. From now on, only the wholesalers and retailers will be allowed inside the market. We already have 600 registered wholesalers and passes will be issued to retailers who are attached to the wholesalers. Others who are not attached to the wholesalers will be issued passes only if they are able to produce bills of previous purchases,” said Vishvendra Kumar, secretary of Mandi Samiti.The Sahibabad vegetable market sees the entry of about 800-1000 retailers each day while the wholesalers have shops inside the market.“The produce, in the form of fruits and vegetables, is transported via 50 trucks and other vehicles from different states, including Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, western Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat, among others. Exit is also given to about 800 vehicles which are brought in by retailers. Since the entry of public is now banned, residents need not come to the market. They can make purchases from the retailers in their areas,” Singh added.Sahibabad police, on Saturday, also registered an FIR against 18 persons under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).“The 18 persons who were booked were all retailers. They were let off after they furnished personal bonds. We conducted a raid early on Saturday morning and found that people were crowding and not observing social distancing, while the retailers had set up temporary shops where they were selling vegetables to the public,” said Rakesh Mishra, circle officer (Sahibabad).“Despite the lockdown, people were running to the vegetable market to get their daily supplies. This also jeopardised social distancing,” he added.As per new the norms, only farmers, wholesalers, etc. will be allowed entry to the market from 10pm to 1am while the retailers who come for purchase of fruits and vegetables will be allowed entry from 1am to 7am every day.The district is presently under lockdown and one of the 14 hot-spot areas from where positive cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have emerged. It has been under complete sealing from April 9. The administration has assigned different vendors for the supply of milk, fruits, vegetables, medicines and grocery items to each of the 14 hotspots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/entry-of-general-public-banned-in-sahibabad-market-after-videos-of-crowds-gathering-emerge/story-C2WOPPORsnr4n9FeSpcxwI.html
13-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad: 61 sent to quarantine after 25-yr-old man’s death at Delhi’s RML hospital||Ghaziabad: At least 11 primary contacts and 50 secondary contacts of a 25-year-old man were sent to quarantine by the district health department late Saturday after the man, who was from Loni, died at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital in Delhi on April 8. According to the sub divisional magistrate (SDM), this was done after he received reports that the man had tested positive for Covid-19.The district health officials, however, said they have written to RML Hospital authorities seeking detailed health reports of the man and have termed the information of the man dying from coronavirus “unconfirmed”.“The man was admitted to RML Hospital on April 8 after he developed complications and died the same day. His samples were taken by the hospital. The last rites of the man were performed in Delhi. On April 11, we received reports that his samples indicated that he was positive for Sars-Cov-2. As a precautionary measure, we immediately picked up 11 of his family members and relatives and sent them to quarantine facilities,” Loni SDM Khalid Anjum said Sunday.“We have also traced 50 of his secondary contacts. The man was suffering from kidney ailments since the past couple of months and his condition deteriorated, after which he succumbed. We have now asked the Ghaziabad health department to give us the reports of the 11 contacts of the man. In case anyone of them tests positive, we will have to seal the entire locality where the man lived, which has about 2,000 families,” he added.Contrary to the claims of the SDM, Ghaziabad chief medical officer (CMO) Dr NK Gupta said this was “unconfirmed.”“We have written to the RML Hospital authorities to send us the detailed medical reports and also the cause of death of the patient. He was suffering from kidney ailments and was on dialysis for the past couple of months. Prima facie, we suspect he died of kidney ailments but unconfirmed reports indicate that he could be carrying Coronavirus. The exact cause of death of the patient will be known only after all his medical reports are received,” Dr Gupta said.“We have also spoken to our authorities in Lucknow and they have asked us to get the detailed reports. In the meantime, we have sent to quarantine his 11 primary contacts and 50 other contacts. Their sampling is being done and the entire area near his place of residence in Loni has been sanitised,” he added.According to the health department’s records, the Ghaziabad district till Sunday evening had a tally of 27 Covid-19 positive patients, while three have been discharged while reports of 206 are still awaited.The tally of 27 has remained unchanged since Saturday and 14 hotspot areas are being monitored round the clock.Across Uttar Pradesh, however, the number of Coronavirus positive cases has reached 480, affecting 41 districts in the state. This number includes 45 persons who have been discharged from hospitals.“From Monday, we will be opening registration links on the health department website inviting retired doctors who can help us in tele-consultation services. In another 2-3 days, we will be opening up the tele-consultation facility through our toll free helpline number -- 1800180145. People can call up this number to avail consultation. The same number has also been opened for free counselling and citizens can connect to our counsellors,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).The state officials also said that the number of hotspots in 15 districts have gone up to 133, having 1,57,665 houses and a population of 10.61 lakh.“These hotspots have a total of 342 Covid-19 positive cases. The district magistrates are also working on other 59 hotspot areas which have a total of 75 Covid-19 positive cases, with a population of about 9 lakh living in 1.43 lakh houses. The chief minister has given directions that door-to-door survey, sanitisation and cleaning, etc., should be taken up on priority in such areas in order to control Coronavirus outbreak,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-61-sent-to-quarantine-after-25-yr-old-man-s-death-at-delhi-s-rml-hospital/story-Q3uOX6ETUtm3TE4AUMUA9O.html
13-04-2020||Pune||Monday Musings: Stories of distress from the bottom of the pyramid||Are we listening to stories of distress from the bottom of the pyramid? Stories of those who live a hand-to-mouth existence; of those who are self-employed, and who don’t have enough savings and reserves to fall back on? “We poor have been hit hardest by this rich man’s disease,” says 34-year-old Azad Sheikh over the telephone. He is smart, but poorly educated and yet understands that the Covid-19 disease came through air travel- it is not a disease that was brought into the country by the poor. Azad runs a small, but successful business of wallpapers, and vinyl flooring. He has a one-year-old daughter who requires regular medical treatment and care for a serious, congenital kidney malfunction. But like everyone else around him, his biggest worry is the massive hit that his business has taken; the continuing overheads such as the rental for his shop, and the uncertain future. “The wealthy have left for their farmhouses, the poor are worried about their next meal,” he says. One day before the lockdown, four of his seven workers from Uttar Pradesh caught the train back to their village. “There is a lot of distress there,” he says. These seven workers lived in a shared accommodation in Pune for which they paid a rent of about Rs 7,000 per month. Skilled in their work of plastering wallpapers and laying vinyl floors, these men spent about Rs.5,000 a month on their living expenses in Pune and sent home two to two-and-half times that amount to run their families in their villages.Back in their villages, they are now worried about their future employment and salaries. “Let me think, what to do. If you need some money urgently, let me know, I will send by money transfer,” is what Azad has assured them. Like most others, he, himself doesn’t know the way out as of now. He is more or less certain that his landlord won’t relent on the shop rental and is hopeful that the government will offer a helping hand with a series of concessions and waivers. The picture gets bleaker and bleaker as we go further down the pyramid. We need to know what is happening there, and we, as a society, need to do what needs to be done. Because, after all, it is the poorest who have been hit the hardest by Covid-19, for no fault of theirs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monday-musings-stories-of-distress-from-the-bottom-of-the-pyramid/story-C2JA4nELTAiGTYQ1TQhsUJ.html

Khattar in his address to the citizens at 5pm held a conversation with 40-year-old Manu Vaisya, a resident of Nirvana Country and 45-year-old Kapil Chopra, a resident of Sector 28 who had undergone treatment for Covid-19. In a telephonic interaction, which was shown live, Khattar asked about their experiences, the way the incident has changed their lives and the advice they want to give to others. Vaisya and Chopra told CM how after their foreign visit, they had started showing flu-like symptoms and were admitted to the hospital. Vaisya, who was the second Covid-19 case in the state, was discharged on March 31 and finished his home quarantine period after recovery on Sunday. Vaisya said he was surprised that his society has been declared a containment zone after he had been completely treated. On this Khattar said, “In tough situations like these, people will have to face some difficulty. The declaration of the containment zone would help in preventing the disease to spread any further.” Vaisya said during his stay in the hospital, he used to read about the disease. On being asked how the incident changed his life, he said, “Situation like this makes you realise about your responsibilities.” Chopra, who was discharged from the hospital on Sunday, said he was confirmed Covid-19 positive on April 2 after having some fever. He started showing symptoms on March 22-23, took some medicines and later got admitted to the hospital for the treatment of fever. “It was at that time, that I tested Covid-19 positive,” he said. When Khattar asked Chopra what advice he wants to give to others, he said, “One should be patient and take all precautions to avoid getting affected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-cm-interacts-with-two-covid-19-patients-who-recovered/story-UAHlFkfB1CKwNzHDMFbr9M.html

To ensure that residents do not flout lockdown rules, the Residents’ Welfare Association makes regular announcements through loudspeakers, highlighting the Do’s and Dont’s of the lockdown. These announcements, in addition to the advisories shared by the RWA.“Most people stay inside their homes and avoid stepping out. The RWA has also started making announcements via loudspeakers, though which we are reminded to stay inside and not flout any rules of the lockdown. These announcements reinforce the message of the lockdown and remind people about the necessity of curbs that are in place,” said Sonal Kaushik, a resident.Kaushik added that the RWA had asked residents to keep a tab on each other and discourage anyone from venturing out. “The RWA has sought our cooperation and asked us to inform them if people don’t abide by the rules. If any such information is shared with them, they ensure that people flouting rules are briefed about the consequences,” said Kaushik.The colony went into a self-imposed lockdown in the third week of March, much before the national lockdown was announced, and has completely restricted entry of outsiders and part-time staff, except in cases of emergency. The entry of part-time domestic helps, drivers, car cleaners, dog-walkers, among others, has been barred. A strict screening mechanism has been initiated with entry allowed only for those people who provide essential services. Everyone entering the building is required to use hand sanitiser and get their temperatures checked. “We have banned any unnecessary movement inside the colony and follow a strict sanitisation process. The entry of part-time domestic help has been stopped and people providing groceries and milk are only admitted after a thorough check,” said Vipin Bhatia, RWA general secretary.Bhatia said that the colony had allowed the entry of a milkman, who was delivering daily. For other essentials, residents mostly depend on grocery shops located within the complex. “The shops are stocked with ration and the RWA has been in touch with the administration for supply. We ensure that the shops remain stocked,” said Bhatia. He added that the shop owners had been asked to make sure that social distancing was practiced by people while they stood in queue. Other common areas like lifts, corridors, and stairs are also regularly being sanitized with disinfectants, he said.In view of the lockdown, the colony has cut down the strength of its non-essential staff and has provided the remaining staff members with boarding and lodging facilities within the condominium to reduce their chances of exposure . “We have provided accommodation to the security and housekeeping within the society . This will reduce any movement in and out and reduce risk of exposure. We provide them with all necessities,” said Bhatia.The RWA is relaying all Covid-related affairs through its Whatsapp group and residents have been encouraged to post their queries or requests for help on the same forum. “Residents can reach out to us for any requirement. As far as senior citizens are concerned, we have their details and stay in touch with them regularly. In case, there are senior citizens who need help with chores, we ensure that the housekeeping staff meet their needs. For medical emergencies or any other requirement, we provided the services of a driver if needed,” said Bhatia.Besides the RWA which is overseeing all the operations, residents also volunteer to help out anyone in need. “Senior citizens here are mostly living with their families. Apart from the RWA, many residents have also stepped forward to help and volunteer. We simply need to inform people about our availability via the society group and confirm our willingness to volunteer,” said Sonal Kaushik, recalling how a senior citizen had recently reached out to her after she faced difficulty in downloading a mobile application. “ We helped her out. All residents have been quite helpful to each other during this lockdown period,” said Kaushik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/orchid-island-residents-say-best-way-to-beat-virus-is-by-staying-indoors/story-GV1BfYdCKAUa4nyTgfw9cK.html
13-04-2020||Gurugram||Education dept allows fee collection by pvt schools; no clarity on annual hike||In a departure from its previous stance, the school education department on Sunday said that private schools in the state could collect monthly fee.In a letter shared with district education officers across the state on Sunday, the education department stated that it had earlier issued orders stopping schools from charging any fee until the resumption of normal classes. The department had, however, learnt that some schools were collecting the fee for the first three months of the new academic session in April, and students unable to pay the same were being struck off the rolls. “Students who are unable to pay the three-month fee right now are being deprived of online classes and their names are being struck off the rolls of the school. In light of the updates, students should not be bound to pay the fee for three months. Instead, schools should only collect monthly fee from parents and ensure that students are not deprived of online education,” stated the letter.Since March, the department has issued three directives stating that schools shouldn’t pressurise parents to pay any fee until normal classes resume. The last such order was issued on Saturday and stated that the department had received complaints from parents about schools that were pressuring them to pay the fee immediately. The letter had mentioned that action would be taken against erring schools. The new order issued on Sunday didn’t mention what led the department to reconsider its stance.It further stated that no school could charge transportation fee during the lockdown. The department also said that parents facing financial distress due to the lockdown should not be forced to pay the monthly fee and could seek relaxation from schools. “Business and livelihood of many parents have been affected due to the lockdown that has been implemented to contain Coronavirus. In such conditions, it won’t be possible for them to pay the fee and they should not be pressurised to deposit fee. If such parents approach the school, administration/ principals should consider postponing the fee payment for such parents in light of the lockdown,” the department said. It stated that schools could collect the fee in instalments in the coming months by adjusting the arrears. The department also wrote that parents in a stable financial situation could pay the monthly fee.The department said that parents could share their grievances as per Rule 158-A of Haryana School Education Rules, 2003, if schools were found not complying with the directive.While schools said that the new directive brought much-needed relief, parents were not happy and said that the order mentioned nothing on the annual fee hike.Colonel (retired) KR Pratap Singh, the president of the Haryana Progressive School Conference, a consortium of private schools, said that the new order would allow schools to pay teachers. “There were some schools that couldn’t pay complete salary to employees due to shortage of funds. Hopefully, parents will pay now. Earlier, the government had said that nobody needed to pay. If there are parents who are in financial distress, the government should compensate them,” said Singh.Rashmi Malik, principal, Salwan Public School, Sector 15, said, “We welcome the order. At least the salary of the teachers will keep moving and they’ll get paid for all the efforts that they are putting in.”Kailash Sharma, general secretary of Haryana Abhibhavak Ekta Manch, a parents’ body, said that parents were disappointed with the directive. “The government has ruled in favour of private schools. We oppose the order and will respond to it after holding consultations with members. We have asked parents to oppose this move and not pay under any situation,” said Sharma.Tripti Singh, a parent, said that they had the provision of paying monthly fee even earlier and the new order mentioned nothing about a fee hike or additional heads. “Many parents are paying a monthly fee. They can opt between monthly or quarterly payments. This is not new. The crucial thing to note is that nothing has been said about additional heads such as annual fee, meal feel, whose invoice has been sent by schools. It also says nothing about the annual fee hike, which is an additional burden on parents,” said Singh.The district education officer, Indu Boken, said that the department had taken into account the financial condition of parents, and such parents could seek relaxation from the school. “Schools can collect monthly fee from parents, but if the financial condition doesn’t allow them, they can seek a relaxation,” said Boken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/education-dept-allows-fee-collection-by-pvt-schools-no-clarity-on-annual-hike/story-KNiiZDVqXosfXJQgT4q4BM.html

13-04-2020||Gurugram||Jaipur-Delhi side of Hero Honda Chowk flyover to become operational by April 15||After having remained shut for more than five months, the Jaipur-Delhi carriageway of the Hero Honda Chowk flyover will be made operational by April 15, even if the lockdown is extended, officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said.Officials said that the required testing of the flyover, which was undergoing repairs, was complete, but the NHAI is still waiting for the test reports to be handed over to the authority.Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI (Gurugram), said, “The Hero Honda Chowk flyover is going to be opened for traffic by April 15. The contractor has been directed accordingly.”NHAI officials said that if the contractor is not able to start the flyover by April 15, then the highways authority will make the flyover operational on its own. The officials said that the traffic police has been briefed about the opening of the flyover.NHAI contractor said not having the test report was not a major issue and there was no danger in opening the flyover without assessing the test reports. Rakesh Mathur, deputy manager of Valecha Engineering Limited, contractor for the project, said, “The test report had been generated, but they had to be submitted to the NHAI headquarters around the time the national lockdown came into force. If those who were preparing the report had two days more before the lockdown, they would have given their report.”The NHAI contractor said they have received a mail from NHAI to start the flyover by April 15, were short of enough workers to remove the jersey barriers placed in front of the flyover. The contractor, however, said they will figure some way out before April 15.The NHAI had said in early March that it had plans to open the Jaipur-Delhi carriageway of the Hero Honda Chowk flyover by March 31. The authority had missed four deadlines before March 31 already. The highways authority had previously planned to open the carriageway by December 1, 2019, January-end, March 1, and March 15. Officials had said that the repair work was completed in February, necessary tests had been carried out and the flyover would be operational by the end of March. “All repairing is over, the asphalt pavement was also laid down on the part that had to be repaired well before the lockdown,” Mathur said.In May 2019, a large chunk of concrete fell off the surface of the flyover, leaving a large hole on the road at the same spot where a hole had first appeared in April 2018. Around 15 metres of the Jaipur-Delhi carriageway was to be rebuilt by the NHAI. The flyover was closed for traffic on October 31, 2019 for the repair works.The repair works on the flyover started in mid-December as construction work was halted in between due to construction ban. “From our side, the flyover is completely ready. We have checked everything,” Mathur added.The eight-lane, 1.4-kilometre-long flyover was constructed as part of a three-layer crossing — flyover, underpass and surface roads — at Hero Honda Chowk. The construction of the ₹197.84-crore project began in November 2014 and it was opened to the public in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/jaipur-delhi-side-of-hero-honda-chowk-flyover-to-become-operational-by-april-15/story-g844fJQV7KefkqzjTXJtUJ.html
13-04-2020||Gurugram||Haryana to be divided in zones to restart industrial activities in a phased manner||To restart industrial activities amid the ongoing nationwide lockdown, which is likely to be extended till April 30, the state government has divided the districts into three colour-coded zones — red, orange and green. This colour coding is based on the number of Covid-19 positive reported from the districts. While Gurugram, Palwal, Nuh and Faridabad have been placed in the red zone for having the highest number of Covid-19 positive cases, the remaining 18 districts will be placed in orange and green zones. Economic activities in each of these zones will start in a phased manner with a longer period of restriction for the red zone. On Gurugram being declared as the red zone, Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner said, “We will continue with the district containment plan. There is no relaxation in vehicular or public movement across the city. The epicentre of containment zones will remain sealed while we are ensuring the supply of groceries and essential services to these zones. We are also coordinating with the industries, which can help in accelerating the supply of essential services.” On Saturday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar held a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi via video conference, after which he hinted at the extension of the lockdown for next two weeks, i.e till April 30. He said the formal announcement will be made by the PM in a day or two. Khattar added that there has been a steady increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases, while economic activities have come to a standstill due to the lockdown. “It would be difficult to continue like this for long as it is not in favour of the state or the country. As such, economic activities will start in a phased manner ensuring that social distancing is followed. For this, the state will be divided into three parts – red, orange and green zones. Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal and Nuh will be in the red zone, while the orange zone will cover those districts where people have been put under quarantine with a fewer number of cases. The green zone will only consist of those districts which do not have any Covid-19 positive patients,” said Khattar. Currently, most of the districts in Haryana have two to five Covid-19 positive patients undergoing treatment. It includes Bhiwani, Charki Dadri, Fatehabad, Hisar, Sonepat, Kaithal among others. Gurugram, however, has reported 32 cases till now, of which 14 have been discharged while remaining are undergoing treatment. Likewise, Nuh has reached a tally of 45 active cases, Palwal 28 and Faridabad 26.Senior state officials said the detailed report on each of these zones will be prepared by Monday. The state government will also form a screening committee to authorise industries or companies for operations based on social distancing plans submitted by them. “In the situation of a lockdown, organisations and companies will have to prepare plans for the social distancing of their workers, their sanitization and accommodation facilities. Based on their social distancing preparedness, they will get approval for running the operations,” said the CM, while addressing the citizens. Khattar said that builders can also submit their plans along with an affidavit on maintaining social distancing among workers. “Even after getting the pass, wearing masks will be mandatory. There are presently more than 15,000 labourers in Haryana from other states. They are at relief camps. Details are being collected from them so that they can work in the nearby villages while public movement will be restricted to prevent the disease from spreading,” he said.According to Khattar, Haryana is still in stage-2 (local transmission) of the spread of the disease and steps are being taken to prevent stage-3 or community transmission of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-to-be-divided-in-zones-to-restart-industrial-activities-in-a-phased-manner/story-UmCtjGd56kGz0W7W9C1zxJ.html
13-04-2020||Gurugram||Industry, realtors say they are ready for phased resumption of economic activities||Even as the Haryana government on Saturday put Gurugram in the red zone, real estate companies and industrial groups based in the city are hopeful that the state government will allow manufacturing units and construction project to resume operations, at least in at least a phased manner, without which they would incur huge losses.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday evening had announced a phased plan to end the lockdown under which some industries would be allowed to start operations while adhering to social distancing norms. The CM, however, said that Gurugram, Faridabad, Nuh and Palwal would be put in the red zone and minimum amount of economic activities would be allowed in these four regions from where the highest number of coronavirus cases have been reported in the state.Industrialists and realtors bases in based in Manesar and Gurugram said that they were hoping the state government to give approval for some economic activities to restart in the region without which they would be hit by recession. The Manesar Industries Welfare Association (MIWA), which has around 2,000 small and large industrial units as its members, said they are already working on a plan to ensure that once work resumes the workers will maintain social distance while working in manufacturing units. “A standard operating procedure (SOP) has been devised, and is being shared among the members to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. All measures for sanitation, maintaining distance and providing food will be taken care of. The industry requests the government to allow resumption of manufacturing in a guided manner to save the economy,” Manmohan Gaind, vice president, MIWA, said.According to the SOP devised by the association, all units will have to install adequate number of wash basins at the factory gates. All the workers would be asked to wear masks inside the units, and CCTV cameras would monitor them. The SOP further directs that thermal scanners would be deployed to check temperature of the workers and six-feet distance would be maintained while working and during breaks in canteens, the association said.HR Vaish, who owns an LED lights manufacturing unit in Udyog Vihar, said the government needs to work out a comprehensive manufacturing policy and find a solution to end the woes of micro and small industries. “The epidemic has given us an opportunity to strategically rethink on manufacturing. Right now focus should be on producing essential commodities,” he said.Realtors based in Gurugram also said they hope state government allows them to resume construction work. They said workers are already living on the project sites, and the developers are providing them food and essential goods. “Work can be started keeping the safety guidelines in mind. Most arrangements to work safely are already in place,” said Praveen Jain, vice chairman, NAREDCO. The National Real Estate Development Council(NAREDCO) is autonomous self-regulatory estate body that works under the aegis of ministry of housing and urban affairs.Jain said around 20,000 workers are living at 85 project sites in Gurugram, who can restart work within two or three days. “We can provide residential facilities to workers coming from outside to the sites and foods can be made available as well,” he added.Both realtors and industrialists said that in case economic activities are not resumed soon, there is a strong possibility the migrant workers, who are currently staying in the city might return to their villages whenever they get an option. “Remobilising workers in case of reverse migration would be a more difficult task,” said Gaind.While the state government is yet announce the details of how industrial activities can be resumed in the state and what industries will be allowed to restart operations in red zones, industrialists based in Udyog Vihar, said that the government should take measures to ensure that at least units manufacturing essential commodities are able to operate with ease. “For factories manufacturing essential goods, it is already difficult to get curfew passes for its workers and officials. Moreover, their workers find it difficult to move. Keeping this in mind, how will other industries get raw materials and send off thier finished goods,”said Ashok Kohli, president, Chamber of Industries of Udyog Vihar, which has over 400 members.Even as the Haryana government on Saturday put Gurugram in the red zone, real estate companies and industrial groups based in the city are hopeful that the state government will allow manufacturing units and construction project to resume operations, at least in at least a phased manner, without which they would incur huge losses.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday evening had announced a phased plan to end the lockdown under which some industries would be allowed to start operations while adhering to social distancing norms.

13-04-2020||City||Corona crisis: Haryana govt to use state roadways buses for mobile clinics||Gurugram: Amid the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19, the Haryana government has decided to convert state roadways buses into mobile clinics to ensure sufficient availability of basic medical facilities across the state. The state chief secretary, Keshni Anand Arora, on Saturday held a meeting of the Crisis Coordination Committee featuring deputy commissioners of 22 districts and instructed them to start mobile clinic services, officials said. The Haryana Roadways has been instructed to make vehicles available for the purpose, and to refurbish buses if need be, after seeking specifications from the district administrations and health departments. “We have received these instructions by the principal secretary (transport). Our buses are on standby. We are awaiting words from the deputy commissioner or chief medical officer, if the buses need to be refurbished,” said Anu Sheokhand, Haryana Roadways’ general manager in Gurugram.It is presently unclear how many buses will be converted into mobile clinics in Haryana. In a text message to HT on Sunday, Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said, “Yes, we will be starting the mobile clinic service soon using Gurugaman buses. We will also engage Haryana Roadways buses as per need.” However, Khatri did not provide any further details. JS Punia, chief medical officer, did not respond to multiple calls and messages seeking comment for this story. In addition to planning for mobile clinics, the Gurugram district administration has ordered six buses (four of the Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited (GMCBL) and two of Haryana Roadways) to be reserved exclusively for ferrying health teams from Civil Hospital to containment zones and back. Vanita Akhaury, spokesperson, GMCBL, said, “We have sent four buses on Sunday at the CMO’s request. These buses will be used only for carrying health teams from hospitals to containment zones, where door-to-door surveys and thermal scanning of residents are underway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/corona-crisis-haryana-govt-to-use-state-roadways-buses-for-mobile-clinics/story-sWSAJQFfLgv72FFSkzgb8I.html

13-04-2020||City||5,800 thermal scanners recovered in IMT Manesar||Gurugram: The district food and drugs control department, along with the police, raided a firm in IMT Manesar on Saturday and recovered 5,800 thermal scanners imported from China. The firm’s owner was allegedly black-marketing the scanners at a higher price, said the police.Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the food and drugs control department has launched an operation to check hoarding of thermal scanners, hand sanitisers and masks, which are being black marketed across the district, officials said.Amandeep Chauhan, drug control officer, said that he formed a team of officials from the department and the police after receiving information on Saturday evening. “We raided the godown and found several cartons of thermal scanners. When we asked the owner to produce the bills, he showed the import documents and other records,” he said.The owner informed the team that he was selling a thermal scanner for Rs 700 plus goods and services tax (GST). However, his claim of selling the device for Rs 700 each is a matter of investigation, the officials said. Chauhan said the owner told them that the product is being sold at very high prices in the market. “It was sold in the market between Rs 7,500 and Rs 10,000. It was black marketed and sold to distributors from Manesar area,” he said.The officials said even the state is facing a shortage of thermal scanners and buying them at a higher cost due to the unavailability with the distributors.“The recovered thermal scanners have been sent to the state government, which will distribute them to the medical facilities, the police, and others deployed in the duty of Covid-19,” said Chauhan.The team after the raid informed Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri about the incident. Khatri said, “We are regularly conducting raids at godowns across the district and issuing regular warnings to people who are black marketing essential products like masks, sanitisers, and thermal scanners. We have already issued 46 challans against shopkeepers and will take strict action against those taking advantage of this lockdown situation. We want to prevent hoarding and black marketing of the protective gear.” Muhammad Akil, commissioner of police, said that a team from Sector 40 police station raided the godown on Saturday evening. “The owner agreed to sell all the pieces to the state government as per the directions of the officials. Now, the thermals will be available in the market for merely Rs 862, including all the taxes and transport charges,” he said.On March 11, the drugs control department had raided a hand sanitizer manufacturing unit in Manesar which was running without a licence. The team had recovered 5,000 bottles of 500 ml and 350 ml with the label mentioning alcohol hand rub.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/5-800-thermal-scanners-recovered-in-imt-manesar/story-gIgJL5hUuYLaddmwApz7EM.html

Officials have said that the Aligarh laboratory report can be a result of some technical glitch.The discharged patients who have been called back are the daughter of a Ceasefire employee from Sector 137 and a 53-year-old man from Sector 128, Noida.“The reports from NCDC have shown them negative, but the Aligarh results are showing them positive which looks like a technical glitch but we aren’t aware of it. We have got the patients back as a precautionary measure. Our laboratory is ready so we are conducting their tests in Noida once again. We are expecting the reports will be negative and they will be sent back again by the end of the day,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS.The district health department has been facing trouble for the last one week following the delay in the sample reports of Covid-19 suspects. The district magistrate has allotted Rs 46.22 lakh to the GIMS in Greater Noida and Rs 65 lakh to the Super Speciality Children Hospital in Sector 39 to develop Covid-19 laboratories so that the delay in reports can be avoided.Most of the samples for Covid-19 tests were going to the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) or the Meerut laboratories, but since the number of sampling has increased in the state, these labs have been overloaded with work. According to the officials, the tests of the discharged patients are conducted to keep a check if the virus infection doesn’t reoccur. The discharged patients are always asked to go under home quarantine for 14 days after getting discharge to ensure that nobody else gets infected if the infection reoccurs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/2-discharged-patients-test-positive-in-greater-noida-doctors-say-looks-like-glitch/story-SRYR5PTf9MbgR3GLYDa6gJ.html

13-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab cop’s hand, chopped off by Nihangs, reattached after 7-hour surgery||A policeman’s hand was chopped off with a sword and six of his colleagues were injured in an attack by a group of Nihangs at a vegetable market in Punjab’s Patiala, the state police said on Sunday.Assistant sub-inspector Harjit Singh’s hand was later reattached after a plastic surgery lasting seven and a half hours at Chandigarh’s PGI hospital and 11 people were arrested from a village dera over their role in the incident. Police said Rs 39 lakh in cash, two petrol bombs, spears, swords and other weapons, as well as five bags of poppy husk were recovered from them.Parts of the early-morning incident captured on video by bystanders showed a group of men carrying sharp-edged weapons in an SUV driving through a police barricade and clashing with policemen armed with lathis. “Police Party on Naka duty was attacked today in which one ASI’s hand was cut off & 6 were injured. Police cornered the culprits & have taken them into custody. Have given instructions to the @PunjabPoliceInd to deal with anyone breaking the law in strictest possible manner,” Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said in a tweet.The Nihangs are a Sikh sect whose members live on the fringes of society and dress up as medieval warriors owing allegiance to Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Guru, specialising in the traditional martial art of gatka (similar to the modern sport of fencing). Deras are shrines devoted to individuals deemed holy by their followers and do not enjoy the sanction of mainstream Sikh clergy.The incident drew widespread condemnation across the political spectrum. Apart from CM Amarinder Singh, several senior Congress leaders said the strictest action should be taken against the culprits.Opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) patriarch Parkash Singh Badal condemned the incident too, while the Shiromani Panth Akali Budha Dal, the leading Nihang jathebandi (organisational assortment) said the men were not Nihangs and were, in fact, anti-social elements locally involved in extortion -- a fact borne out by the recovery of Rs 39 lakh from them in cash -- something the ascetic members of the sect would not do.“Seven fugitives, donning the robes of Nihangs, have been arrested from the Gurdwara in village Balbera. One of these was injured in the police firing and has been rushed to hospital... The police party observed full Maryada while entering the Gurdwara premises. There were also women and children inside, who were unharmed, and have been left secure within the Gurdwara as before,” Punjab’s special chief secretary KBS Sidhu said on Twitter.Gobind Singh Longowal, president of the Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the body that manages Sikh places of worship, urged people to remain disciplined during the curfew.BJP leader and Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri said, “The inhuman attack on policemen in Patiala needs to be condemned in the strongest of terms. Such criminals and anarchists should be brought to justice at the earliest.”Police said the men were asked to show their curfew passes at the vegetable market, which they refused to do and instead forced their way through the barricade. When the policemen chased them and told them to step out of their vehicle, five men came out and launched an attack with swords. As six policemen received injuries and ASI Harjit Singh fell down after his hand was cut off, the men drove away to a dera building part of the Gurdwara Kichdi Sahib complex in Balbera village nearby.A commando operation was launched to get the men, who refused to surrender and hurled petrol bombs at the raiding party. They set up eight LPG cylinders on the periphery, threatening to blow them up. One of the Nihangs was injured by a gunshot fired by the commandos and hospitalised later.Intense negotiations spearheaded by Patiala IG Jatinder Singh Aulukh and SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu, aided by the village sarpanch and others, could not lead the men to surrender. They were finally arrested after a fierce scuffle with the commandos.The accused were booked for attempt to murder, grievous hurt, rioting, attack on a public servant under the Indian Penal Code as well as under provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. They were also booked under the stringent anti-narcotics law, NDPS, for possessing a commercial quantity of poppy husk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nihang-men-chop-off-cop-s-hand-after-defying-restrictions/story-kDIigxn7FPQTP0zwK2cQVL.html
13-04-2020||Delhi||Mild earthquake jolts Capital amid lockdown silence||Delhi recorded an earthquake measuring 3.5 magnitude on Richter scale on Sunday evening with epicentre at Sonia Vihar in the national capital, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) under the ministry of earth sciences. It’s not unusual for the epicentre to create relatively small tremors in Delhi and neighbouring Haryana, seismologists said. But this time the experience was much more intense for people in the national capital because of less noise associated with traffic movement, they said.The seismologists at NCS also said that they had a “very good” recording of the event on their seismometer. “The recording is very clear because of no noise. People may have experienced the earthquake differently because most people are at home and not in a vehicle or not in movement. You can feel it the most during static conditions. I cannot comment on whether the sound heard (many people have reported to NCS that they heard a rumbling sound during the earthquake) is pertaining to the earthquake,” said AP Pandey, a seismologist at NCS.According to a statement by NCS, Delhi experienced last perceptible earthquake of magnitude 3.5 on April 24 in 2018 and prior to that earthquake of magnitude 3.8 occurred on September 7, 2011 near the Delhi-Haryana border. Delhi had also recorded low magnitude earthquake with epicentre within Delhi in 2007. Another similar earthquake was recorded in Delhi on April 28, 2001 of 3.4 magnitude, according to officials.“These are called tremors and very small earthquakes have been recoded in the past in the Jhajjar and Rohtak area. We are checking when was the last time the epicentre was within Delhi. We are in seismic zone 4 (severe earthquake intensity zone). We are close to the Himalayas where even magnitude 8 earthquakes can be recorded. The local soil quality also plays a role. Thick sediment soil in Delhi also amplifies the impact. The area where the epicentre is has newer alluvium soil which can record more tremors. It is close to the Yamuna belt,” said Pandey.According to experts, the reason people felt strong tremors here is also because the depth of the earthquake is moderate (not very deep), the epicentre is in Delhi and there is very little ambient noise or vibrations induced by traffic movement. “We had an excellent recording of the event better than all our earlier recordings here. The signal strength was very high. The signal to noise ratio is perfect,” said G Suresh, another seismologist at NCS.“Some people also heard a rumbling sound. That may be because of the energy released which interacted with atmosphere. Obviously, people have a clearer experience of the tremors when there is less noise and movement. We haven’t heard of any damage so far,” explained Suresh, adding “the earth quake was not very deep. This had a depth of less than 10 km.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mild-earthquake-jolts-capital-amid-lockdown-silence/story-wrpSmomvoTIwS70Vk2WSPJ.html
13-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra inches closer to 2,000 mark; 1,982 coronavirus cases and 149 deaths so far||Maharashtra recorded 221 coronavirus cases and 22 deaths on Sunday, taking the state closer to the 2,000-case mark at 1,982. The death toll has reached 149, state figures revealed.The state had crossed 1,000 cases just last Tuesday, but the past nine days reported more than 100 per day, including three days that saw more than 200 cases. Mumbai has 1,298 cases and 92 deaths. The state has tested 41,109 people and has kept 5,064 suspected patients in government quarantine facilities, while 61,247 are quarantined at home, said health officials.Senior officials have indicated that the rate of the virus’s spread will be arrested, but it could take a couple of days. “The rise is on and for two days, the number of new cases had even crossed the 200 mark, but on Saturday, it came down to 187. We have taken adequate measures to curb the spread and are hoping that the decline in new cases will start in the next couple of days,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.The rising numbers had forced chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday to extend the lockdown till April 30, so as to prevent the state from slipping in to phase three — community spread — of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, said the official. He has also said they may have to extend it further if people did not co-operate. However, the state is also mulling relaxing restrictions in areas where there are no cases. “There is a meeting with the chief minister on Monday where the issue is likely to be discussed. We have suggested areas completely unaffected should be given some relaxations,” said another senior official, on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, the state medical education department on Sunday directed all government and private medical colleges to send their proposals to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for starting Covid-19 tests. “There are eight government and 33 private medical colleges, where the facility is yet to be started. We have asked all of them to send their proposals to ICMR so that the facility can be started there as well,” said Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER).The testing facility for Covid-19 is currently available at 17 government and 15 private medical colleges across the state.Meanwhile, the state government decided to cancel this year’s geography paper of Class 10. It has further decided to cancel the second semester examinations of Classes 9 and 11. The results will be declared based on performance of the students for the entire year, said school education minister Varsha Gaikwad.Geography paper of Class 10 was supposed to be held on March 23, but was postponed following the outbreak. The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) will come out with a fair marking formula for Class 10 students, said the education minister.To curb practice of overpricing and black-marketing in the lockdown period, state food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal also directed the legal metrology department to form squads with the help of police, revenue officials and inspect godowns, shops of retail and wholesale traders and take action accordingly. “They can be booked for violating Commodities Act and can face imprisonment up to seven years, said an official from food and civil supplies department.Meanwhile, the district administration of Wardha in Vidarbha has decided to disinfect the vehicles entering the district for supplying essential commodities. Wardha collector Vivek Bhimanwar issued orders on Sunday.

Now, the centre has received an order from the Western Command for 1,000 masks.Of the 30 inmates, who live with their families at the PRC, 11 are quadriplegic and 23 are paraplegic. After they were declared mandatory by the administration, even their families are lending a hand in making the masks. Director of the centre, Col Gurkirat Singh Nagra (retd) said, “We are using green cloth to make them; these are also called surgical masks. In three days, the PRC has made 3,500 masks and distributed them to policemen and people in neigbouring areas, free of cost. Now, we have got an order from the Western Command for 1,000 masks and will be delivering them in couple of days,” he said.Former soldier Mohammad Latif, 35, an inmate from Kashmir said they wanted to contribute their bit for the nation in its time of crisis. “It is a service to the nation. The wives of inmates are also helping,” he said .The PRC in Mohali was set up in 1978 on 10 acres gifted by the Punjab government with a mission to ensure best aftercare and rehabilitation of personnel of the armed forces (army, navy and air force), who are medically boarded out, i.e. retired from service, due to spinal cord injury while serving the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/paraplegics-make-donate-thousands-of-masks-in-mohali/story-k2CRyioTWgyJtqeZ5A6i8H.html
13-04-2020||Chandigarh||Anxiety, depression running riot amid lockdown, say mental health experts||The coronavirus pandemic is taking a toll on people’s mental health, say city-based experts. Those with a history of mental illness are finding it especially hard to deal with the stress and anxiety brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.Experts say many patients are overwhelmed with sadness, anger, helplessness and distress. For some their anxiety has taken physical manifestations in form of an upset stomach, insomnia, panic attacks or loss in appetite. Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) consultant psychiatrist Dr Pallavi Abhilasha says, “At least 11 of my patients with anxiety disorders, who had been managing their condition without medication for several months, have relapsed since India went into lockdown.” “There has also been a spurt in cases of depression. While there has been a 25%-30% increase in anxiety disorders, depression cases have increased by 15%-20% this month,” she said.Abhilasha says constant exposure to alarming news on different platforms, isolation, boredom and uncertainty was causing mental health problems among people.“Most patients are wondering when the situation will normalise and they will get to meet their loved ones? They are also worried about what will happen in case they get infected? All of this is causing heightened anxiety and leaving them restless all the time,” says Abhilasha .‘MEN AT GREATER RISK’Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) department of psychiatry professor and former president of Punjab and Chandigarh branch of Indian Psychiatrists Society Dr Rupesh Chaudhary said men, especially the bread winners, are experiencing stress, anxiety and depression as the lockdown has put financial strain on many. “The male to female ratio of patients we attend to these days is 2:1,” he said, adding, “In order to help those experiencing anxiety and depression, the Indian Association of Private Psychiatry and Indian Psychiatric Society, in a joint initiative have launched an emotional helpline in Punjab and Chandigarh, which remains active from 8am and 8pm.”Under the initiative, experts from across the state provide free consultation for an hour and also prescribe medicines. The experts are addressing anxiety and trepidation regarding Covid, obsessions and compulsions, irrelevant thoughts, drug and substances abuse, acute suspiciousness, hopelessness and sadness. “We receive 15 to 20 calls every day and take care to prescribe medication that is available at their nearest chemist. Due to lockdown, many medicines are unavailable and we suggest alternatives.”‘People with OCD fixated on coronavirus’Ludhiana Civil Hospital psychologist Dr Davinder Sharma says he has been telephonically counseling people for free.“The situation has triggered obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) among people already suffering from mental illnesses. Many are compulsively cleaning. Even those who stay home all day have been extensively sanitising their mobile phones, vehicles, gates, clothes and hands.” “We warn such people against watching news on the television all day since it worsens their compulsions and ask them to continue with medication.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anxiety-depression-running-riot-amid-lockdown-say-mental-health-experts/story-0ANmecgbWwWWpvnUdURxxI.html
13-04-2020||Chandigarh||₹25 lakh collected in traffic challans amid curfew in Chandigarh||At a time when driving on the roads is banned and traffic has fallen considerably after a curfew was announced in the city on March 24, the traffic police have collected ₹25,23,500 in challans.As per data available with the challaning branch of the traffic police, 3,935 challans were issued during this period out of which 1,642 or 41% have been paid to date. Out of total 9,564 violations, 44% violations were driving license related offences, 23% violations were for driving with expired or without insurance, and 21% violations were for driving without vehicle registration.On an average, the challan collection amount is between ₹40 to 50 lakh a month. The police were expecting a much lower average owing to the curfew, but the traffic police say the amount collected is still on the higher side and the collection is expected to easily cross ₹30 lakh by month-end.ROUTINE CHECKS ON HOLDSpeaking about this, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic administration) Kewal Krishan said, “We are not putting up nakas for checking routine violations like jumping of lights. Our focus is on impounding the vehicles of people who break curfew. Many of these people are found to be driving without a license or other documents for which they are being challaned. Anyone driving without a valid driving license, registration or insurance has to pay ₹12,000. This doesn’t include towing charges and fine for breaking curfew which is another ₹2,500.”The DSP added that challans are being collected only for offences related to the impounding of vehicles. “Since their vehicles have been impounded, the violators have to come forward to pay the challans. Those who have other infractions have been advised to pay the challan only after the curfew is lifted.”The local police are also impounding vehicles for breaking curfew, but the challans are being issued by the traffic police alone. Though e-challan services are still active, the number has greatly reduced because of the curfew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/25-lakh-collected-in-traffic-challans-amid-curfew-in-chandigarh/story-gTzZ1A4K25ROrnUxd7JFTM.html
13-04-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus in Delhi: Sale tokens, shifting bazars to aid mandi crowd control in markets||To control crowding in wholesale vegetable markets amid the lockdown to contain Covid-19 spread, the administration has come up with a slew of measures, such as relocating markets, staggering sale timings and issuing tokens for customers. The Delhi government has drafted a policy in this regard.Over the last 48 hours, several such rearrangements were done at the Azadpur, Keshopur, Najafgarh and Mehrauli markets. While the first two have been subjected to staggered timings, the others have been relocated to more spacious zones, to ensure better social distancing.“The Najafgarh mandi was located in a cramped space, which often witnessed a crowd even during the lockdown. It has been shifted to a spacious area in the vicinity to ensure better social distancing norms,” said Rahul Singh, district magistrate (South-West).The Delhi government on Saturday directed the relocation of the Mehrauli vegetable mandi to Mehrauli bus terminal. The wholesale market was shifted to its new location by Sunday morning, where the local police had designated areas for vendors, ensuring a safe distance from one another. Markings were also made for the general public, to ensure six-foot gaps among them.District magistrate (South), BM Mishra, said, “Meticulous planning was done to temporarily relocate the Mehrauli mandi near the DTC bus terminal. The subdivisional magistrate and her team worked round the clock to make it happen.”Delhi Police officials said that personnel have been deployed around the market to ensure that the norms are followed. Besides manual inspections, the police are also keeping a check on the mandis using drones.Other vegetable and fruit markets in the city are also following strict precautionary measures to ensure social distancing during this pandemic.In Delhi’s Azadpur mandi, Asia’s largest wholesale vegetable and fruit market, the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) has decided to allow sales in shifts. From Monday, the market will allow the sale of vegetables between 6am and 11am, while fruits will be sold from 2pm to 6pm.Deepak Shinde, district magistrate (North), directed Delhi Police and the APMC in Azadpur to ensure the introduction of a token system for customers.“Tokens will be distributed for all customers coming to the market. Joint enforcement teams of police and mandi officials will monitor all activities, and a public address system will be installed in all sheds to ensure proper communication,” an order issued by Shinde on Saturday read.Anil Malhotra, a member of APMC, “Different orders are issued every day. We were asked to operate from alternative sheds to ensure distance is maintained between vendors. However, while the government is coming up with all these orders, no one is listening to the actual woes of wholesalers. The market area is yet to be cleaned or sanitised. We are being asked to open shops compulsorily every day and our safety is at stake.”The Azadpur mandi gets a daily supply of 15,000 tonnes of vegetables, but over the last two weeks, the supply has dropped to 9,000-10,000 tonnes every day, because of the lockdown restrictions.In the Keshopuram mandi too, the police have issued orders for staggered timings. For the internal dealings, including supple of stock to the market, 5am to noon is the designated timing, while traders will be allowed to cater to customers only between noon and 7pm, and no commercial vehicle will be allowed to park in the market area beyond a “validated period”.“The mandi will be completely sanitised and we will conduct a verification of vendors and buyers before entry. The local authorities have also been asked to remove stray animals from the mandi area,” a notice issued by the local police unit read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-sale-tokens-shifting-bazars-to-aid-mandi-crowd-control-in-markets/story-g8GvDrS9OuM0AAf2MufOvI.html
13-04-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus update: Delhi govt to scale up disinfection drive in containment zones||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that sanitisation and disinfection drives will be scaled up from Monday in the containment zones created across the city to prevent the spread of coronavirus and “high-risk” areas ascertained by the health department, for which his government has availed machines that can disinfect up to 20,000 square metre area per hour.“We are starting a massive sanitation programme tomorrow (Monday). PI Industries (an agriculture sciences company) have provided us with 20 Japanese hi-tech machines that are capable of disinfecting 20,000 square metres area in an hour. The machines were provided for free. Other than that, the Delhi Jal Board has 50 smaller machines which will be deployed in the disinfection drive,” said the chief minister in a video press conference.“Delhi currently has 33-35 containment zones. Our teams have identified more areas and more containment zones will be notified in the next couple of days. All these areas will be subjected to Operation SHIELD. People living in these areas may face some difficulties but we will ensure that they receive essentials at their doorstep. It is for their safety,” said Kejriwal, citing the example of Dilshad Garden, in east Delhi. By Sunday evening the Delhi government announced 10 new containment zones, taking the total number of such areas to 43 in the city. The new zones included three in upscale East of Kailash residential neighbourhood in southeast Delhi. The South East Delhi district now has the highest number of containment zones (12), outnumbering East Delhi district, which had the highest number of containment zones (9) in the national capital. Dilshad Garden is an identified coronavirus hot spot in the city where the strategy was deployed and no fresh cases were recorded in the area since April 1. Few lanes in the neighbourhood are still notified containment zones.“No new case of COVID-19 has been reported in Dilshad Garden in the last 10 days due to Operation SHIELD,” he said.Sealing, home quarantine, isolation and tracking, essential supply, local sanitisation and door-to-door checking are the key aspects of ‘SHIELD’ in any containment area.“Operation SHIELD will be implemented in all areas which have been declared as containment zones... I know people would be facing difficulties in these areas, but it is necessary for saving their lives,” Kejriwal said.RED & ORANGE ZONESFor the new sanitation and disinfection drive, Kejriwal said, all containment zones will be referred to as “Red Zones”. He further said, “The government is in the process of ascertaining high-risk zones and experts have been roped in. Those will be referred to as Orange Zones. Both Red Zones and Orange Zones would witness heightened sanitation and disinfection drive.”When asked about the list of orange zones, a senior official in the Secretariat said, “Currently, all buffer zones are being treated as orange zones. With time, the list will be updated.”Buffer zones are geographical areas immediately surrounding containment zones, as described by the Union health ministry in a document — Containment Plan for Large Outbreaks — released last week.In the next couple of days, the senior officer said, areas such as agriculture market, those with high population density and those which have residents of SARS-CoV-2 patients but have not been marked as containment zones are likely to be added in the list of orange zones.“The spike in the number of cases in Delhi is a concern. But I am sure, it can be controlled,” he said. On Saturday, Delhi crossed 1,000 active cases of coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-scale-up-disinfection-drive-in-containment-zones/story-YskBVEqFkYbkOVajfw1aLI.html
13-04-2020||Delhi||Others suffer as Delhi hospitals free up resources to combat coronavirus||A month after the surgery to remove an oral cancer malignant growth, Mohd Kareem, 40, started his radiation therapy at Delhi State Cancer Institute (DSCI) mid-February. He still had five cycles of radiation therapy remaining when the hospital shut down after doctors and nurses there started testing positive for Covid-19.“What should we do now? I do not want his cancer to come back. We have three young daughters and he has already struggled a lot. We even went to a private hospital, but they said that the treatment should continue at the same hospital. Should we keep waiting for the hospital to re-open?” asked Saheem Bano, Kareem’s wife.DSCI was completely shut down after 22 of its staff and three patients tested positive for the infection.Not just DSCI, hospitals across the city – both government and private – have curtailed or shut its routine services in order to decongest and keep beds reserved for Covid-19 patients. This, coupled with the 21-day lockdown, has severely limited people’s ability to access health services in Delhi.Reaching hospitals“It is important to focus on the pandemic, but not at the cost of other healthcare services. Mortality from non-communicable diseases will shoot up in parts of the country that do not have strong public healthcare systems,” said Dr Abhishek Shankar, assistant professor of radiation oncology at Lady Hardinge Medical College. He used to work in the department of preventive oncology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) before joining Lady Hardinge..“When it comes to cancer, every step is emergent. There shouldn’t be interruption in treatment. Now, private sector hospitals – which treat a majority of indoor patients across the country -- are not bound to stay open and risk their staff getting the infection. People will depend on government facilities. In the absence of experienced doctors at district hospitals, who will treat cancer patients who are now unable to reach AIIMS?” he said.The non-Covid-19 hospitals should continue running all routine services, he suggested, after taking proper precautions.“Chronic conditions — like anaemia and hypertension — get diagnosed when patients come to our clinics. These might get missed and the patients might land up in the hospitals only when they get severe symptoms,” said Dr Roopali Diwan, head of the department of gynaecology at Safdarjung hospital.Services like delivery of babies have also gone down at the busiest labour room in the city. From about a 100 deliveries a day, the hospital has been getting only about 60 expecting mothers.“The numbers have gone down mainly because people from far off places, who would earlier come to the hospital for their deliveries, can’t do so now because of the lockdown,” she said.Longer waiting periodsTransplantation surgeries — not just in Delhi, but across the country — have been hit, with the government suggesting that non-emergency surgeries be put on hold for now.“No transplant surgeries have taken place in the entire country in the last eight to ten days. What we need to understand is that some transplant surgeries are absolutely life-saving — like heart or liver transplants. Patients in need of kidney transplant may wait a little longer. But, Covid-19 is here to stay and we cannot deny people these procedures forever,” said Dr Sandeep Guleria, renal transplant surgeon from Indraprastha Apollo hospital.He is the former head of the kidney transplant unit at AIIMS, who led the team that performed the first cadaver kidney transplant in the country. Around 150 kidney transplants usually happen across the country in a week.“We need to frame guidelines that will reduce the risk of performing transplantations, like thoroughly screening the donor and recipient for Covid-19 or even testing them before performing the procedure. The thing is we are still not sure whether it can be passed from donor to recipient through the organ. That said, South Korea never stopped transplantations. Also, not utilizing cadaver organ is a shame, especially when there are so few organs,” said Dr Guleria.With surgeries getting postponed, the long waiting lists for surgeries at government hospitals in the city are likely to get longer.“We are not conducting any routine surgeries, like cataract or gall stone removals. Even when planned surgeries start, the most emergent ones are likely to be taken up first. There would inevitably be a long waiting period for routine surgeries,” said Dr Rajeev Kapoor, medical superintendent of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel hospital in East Patel Nagar.At hospitals like AIIMS, the wait period for surgeries in some departments can be up to a year.Routine consultationsRoutine out-patient services in big hospitals — like All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Lok Nayak — in the city have been completely shut after they started accepting Covid-19 patients. Some others run a curtailed out-patient department.“We receive less than half the number of patients in our clinics even though all services – except for planned surgeries – are open. We have started giving patients with chronic conditions, like diabetes, medicine for longer periods to reduce their number of visits,” said Dr Rajeev Kapoor, medical superintendent of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel hospital in East Patel Nagar, one of at least 25 Delhi government run hospitals that are still providing routine healthcare services.After the two mohalla clinic doctors from northeast Delhi contracted the virus from a patient, at least 100 of these government-run clinics have also been shut. Besides that, half of the private practitioners across the city have also closed their practice.“The doctors are scared after instances of people getting the infection from their patients was reported. Even as bigger hospitals are focusing on Covid-19 patients, at least half the small clinics in the city have shut shop. And, with personal protective equipment hard to get by, even small nursing homes are closing up,” said Dr Grish Tyagi, president elect of the Delhi Medical Association. There are around 700 nursing homes in the city, most are small with just one to 20 beds.Although some hospitals have started telemedicine consultations after the government of India released guidelines, the uptake is not great.“There is a 12-hour teleconsultation number we have launched. But the uptake is not great and we are getting just about three or four calls a day. On another number, on which we can give prescriptions, only about 40 patients are calling in a day,” said Dr Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences. The hospital OPD, which was shut, used to receive about 1,200 patients a day earlier.ImmunisationAlthough, the government has ensured that vaccines are available at all its dispensaries and non-Covid-19 hospitals, universal immunization programme has also taken a hit in the city.“With all the ASHA and ANMs involved in the government’s surveillance efforts, the outreach activity for immunization has been stopped. All vaccines are available at the fixed delivery points like dispensaries and hospitals. And hospitals, that have shut routine services, have been requested to send patients to the nearest dispensaries,” said an official from the Delhi government’s health department.“With 90% of the immunization services being provided by government facilities, it should not be impacted too much. But there will definitely be some impact. How much, we will come to know only after a couple of months when the data comes in. We might have to carry out intensive drives to catch up,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others-suffer-as-delhi-hospitals-free-up-resources-to-combat-coronavirus/story-uZXgEyywcBRNCXzniIxdJP.html
13-04-2020||Mumbai||Last SSC paper cancelled; Maharashtra education department won’t hold Class 9, 11 exams too||In a major relief to around 17 lakh students in the the state, the education department on Sunday has decided to cancel the last paper [Geography] of the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exam after the Maharashtra government decided to extend the lockdown till April 30. The exams for the vocational subjects, which are offered to students with special needs, and are conducted two-three days after the main exams, have also been cancelled.State education minister Varsha Gaikwad also announced the cancellation of exams for Class 9 and Class 11 which are conducted by the schools and junior colleges respectively. Students will be promoted on the basis of the previous exams. The Mumbai Junior College Teachers’ Association had called for the cancellation of Class 11 exams earlier and had suggested that students be promoted directly to Class 12.The Class 10 Geography paper, which was to take place on March 23, was rescheduled in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The department had decided to announce the new date on April 14, after the lockdown ended. However, on Saturday it was extended till April 30. “The department had earlier decided to come up with a revised date for the exam after April 14 when the lockdown was supposed to get over. However, with the extension of the lockdown and owing to the current situation, it has been decided to cancel these exams,” Gaikwad said. Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education officials said a marking formula for students in this situation will be devised soon. “This is an unprecedented situation and the board doesn’t have a rule in place for a situation in which a paper has been cancelled altogether, as it has never happened in the past. Officials at the board would think of all the possible solutions and a come up with a fair marking scheme in the coming days so that no student is at loss,” said Shakuntala Kale, chairperson of the board. Vasant Kalpande, former chairperson of the board, said, “It’s good that the department has made the decision, as it would bring relief to lakhs of students and parents. The board can work on the specifics now and parents need not worry as a marking criteria would be arrived at soon.” Many teachers had earlier urged the state to mark Class 10 students on the basis of the five papers that have been held, as the board already practices the best-of-five formula to add up the final scores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/last-ssc-paper-cancelled-maharashtra-education-department-won-t-hold-class-9-11-exams-too/story-IEAJQfzl6j2eZPvdLhDz5N.html
13-04-2020||Pune||Collector attributes rise in positive cases in Pune to aggressive screening||From 105 Covid-19 (coronavirus) positive cases reported last Sunday (April 6), Pune city’s tally crossed 255 on Sunday evening, which the authorities say is because of increased door-to-door screening. “The cases have doubled in less than seven days as we have started aggressive screening of people wherein health workers are visiting every house to see if there are people with symptoms. After preliminary screening, those with symptoms are tested for Covid-19,” said Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram.On March 9, city witnessed first two cases of Covid-19 positives when a couple who returned from Dubai, tested positive for the Sar-Cov-2 virus. While the couple and 24 others have recovered, the city’s graph is gradually going north. The city, according to Pune Municipal Corporation, has been witnessing Covid-19 cases in double digit since last week of March. To cater to increasing number of cases, the Pune civic body along with district administration has prepared 14 hospitals including 12 private and two government hospitals.Sahil Deo, co-founder of CPC Analytics, said that the spike in cases is gradual. “There was one day when the cases grew by almost 40 and another day when there was a significant increase. But other than that, the increase has been fairly gradual, which is a relief,” said Deo. Deo and his team has been mining Covid-19 related data in India on a day-to-day basis.According to statistics, the biggest spike in a day was witnessed on April 8, when city saw 39 cases and 10 deaths. Among those succumbed to Covid-19 related complications, most have died in government-run Sassoon General Hospital in the city. The death toll has increased from five to 31 between April 6 and April 12, according to data provided by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department. Till Saturday evening, total tests conducted in the city from day one stood at 2,078, which indicates around 10 per cent of those who tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/collector-attributes-rise-in-positive-cases-in-pune-to-aggressive-screening/story-GAsr5bkDRE4WY0PJBFQqaN.html
13-04-2020||Pune||Medicine stock to last till July, don’t panic buy, says Pune District Chemists Association||Pune residents are queuing up outside retail medical shops to buy essential medicines, however, some of them have to come back empty handed as the medicines they need are unavailable. There is no shortage in medicine stock, according to the Pune District Chemists Association president Rohit Karpe. “There is no problem with the stock of medicines and we have enough supply to last until July. All the five wholesale zones of Pune city, PCMC, Shirur, Junnar Ambegaon Khed (JAK) , and Baramati, have enough for smooth transactions for the next three months,” assured Karpe, who supplies to almost 4,000 medical retailers in the city.However, there are many customers who are finding it difficult to get medicines, like Ramesh Iyer, a resident from Kothrud. “I go the medical every alternate day to buy injections and medicines for my mother, however, for the past few days they are not available. Due to the area containment of Sadashiv peth, that houses wholesale medicine stockists, it is delaying the process of getting medicines.”“Following the curfew and containment of the peth areas, the stockists in ‘Dawa Bazaar’ area in Sadashiv peth are closing their shops early. Before the containment, all the stockists would keep their shops open from 10am to 7:30pm, now, the medical store owners inform us that now the stockists shut shop early,” said Iyer.Karpe adds, “It was the decision of the association to curtail the time of the shops to 2pm. Before, there would be a lot of crowd to buy medicines and social distancing was not followed, hence, we decided to keep the shops open only till 2pm, whereupon we also made a rule that on the first day, we will collect all the lists of the retailers and then they have to come the next day to collect or get it delivered to ease off the crowd.”Ajit Dole, owner of a medical store on East Street, said, “The stockists have decided to shut the shops by 2pm, but that gives us less time to get the necessary supply of medicines. Earlier, stockists would come to check the stock, now we have to go, and due paucity of time, all medicines are not available , which is creating panic among senior citizens who are maximum of our customers.”Pratibha More, a resident of Sinhgad road, said, “My child is just a year old and we need medicines for him and I, but whenever my husband goes to the medical shop, they say they have to place an order. Before it was available easily and I didn’t have to wait for two days to get them. Now, we have ordered supply to last us two weeks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/residents-queue-up-outside-retail-medical-shops-as-suppliers-in-containment-zone-shut-shop-early/story-a0d5xHkJlIqhU1fkCUQcvL.html

13-04-2020||Pune||Vasant Vyakhyanmala, spring lecture series, cancelled in Pune due to Covid-19||Vasant Vyakhanmala, the spring lecture series organised by Vaktrutvottejak Sabha, has been cancelled due to Covid-19 (coronavirus). The lecture series was supposed to be held from April 21 to May 20 at Tilak Smarak Mandir in the city.Deepak Tilak, president of Vaktrutvottejak Sabha that has been hosting the Vasant Vyakhanmala since 1875, said, “We have to cancel this year’s Vasant Vykhanmala due to the ongoing lockdown to stop the spread of Covid-19.”“This will be the second time in the years since it began that the lecture series had to be cancelled. It was cancelled once during the 1897 plague,” said Tilak.“We had confirmed speakers for the event and dignitaries were going to speak on various facets of Lokmanya Tilak since it is the death centenary year of Tilak,” he said.“We plan to keep some lectures spread over the year post the crisis is over,” Tilak added.Mandar Bedekar, chief secretary, Vasant Vyakhyanmala, Pune, said, “The tradition of the Vasant Vyakhyanmala was started by Justice MG Ranade in 1875. The idea was to present a variety of lectures, across various topics to the people.”Started by Vaktruttvottejak Sabha, which was founded by Mahadeo Govind (Justice) Ranade in 1875, the lecture series has been offering lectures on a broader range of subjects with experts speaking on a variety of topics like culture, arts, economics, science, health, governance, history, among others. The lecture series has been attended by various politicians including former prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Earlier, the Vasant Vyankhyanmala was held at Hirabag and Belbag, and now it is held at Tilak Smarak Mandir, since the past many decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vasant-vyakhyanmala-spring-lecture-series-cancelled-due-to-covid-19/story-IDbEaRkFlwAH1tw1Ty31mN.html
13-04-2020||Pune||On the Frontline: Focus on making maximum use of available resources to deal with current situation, says PMC health chief||Ramchandra Hankare, head, PMC, health department, spoke about the challenges he faces while fulfilling his duty in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. What is your role in this pandemic?I handle the health deportment team that comes under the PMC jurisdiction. I have to coordinate with all the private and government hospitals in the city and make sure all the necessary arrangements are in place to help Covid-19 patients. I have to coordinate with divisional and municipal commissioners, additional municipal commissioner and district collector and follow the instructions on how to go about in this current situation.How does your day begin and roll out?Currently, there is no fixed timing for anything as I have to be on my toes to fulfil my responsibilities. My day starts at 6am and ends at 1am or 2am in the night or even late. I have to coordinate the ongoing house-to-house survey undertaken by the civic body staffers to detect Covid-19 related symptoms like fever, dry cough, cold and respiratory illnesses in certain areas of the city. I also have to keep a check on the number of patients testing positive for the virus and coordinate with private and government hospitals authorities about the ongoing measures taken to treat patients.What precautions are you taking?I follow social distancing while dealing with patients or their family members and during visits to the hospitals. I also wear a mask and other necessary equipment while on duty. I carry my food with me and avoid eating out.When I return home from duty, I take bath and sanitise my phone, spectacles, watch and other items, if I am carrying them to work. My wife and daughter are both in the medical field so they are busy as well and my son is pursuing a degree in medicine. So, we all make sure we take necessary precautions at home to keep away from Sars-cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection.What is your view of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune? How do you see it unfolding?The situation is under control right now. People should coordinate with the authorities and together we can fight and overcome this situation. If people follow all the precautions and avoid stepping out of their houses unless it is urgent we can control the spread of Covid-19. Those who have symptoms should come forward and get tested and quarantined, so that the spread of virus stops.What gaps do you see in health and relief work?We are preparing for the worst. We are making maximum arrangement for Covid-19 patients and keeping various private hospitals ready to accommodate more patients. We are arranging medical and non-medical staff to deal with the patients, if the numbers increase. The civic body is doing its best with the available resources and many non-government organisations and individual volunteers are coming forward to offer help us. Instead of looking at gaps and shortcomings, we are focusing on how we can make maximum use of the resources available and what arrangements can be made if the number of patients increases in the coming days. We keep communicating with the medical and paramedical staff about how to take necessary precautions and deal with patients and they should follow all the precautions themselves to stay safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-focus-on-making-maximum-use-of-available-resources-to-deal-with-current-situation-says-pmc-health-chief/story-m6HQsME0qMQL4Mzo3UTcQP.html

13-04-2020||Pune||Eyes on the goal, Pune’s Sanika Deshpande plans to improve leg strength, stamina during the lockdown||Playing for Pune’s local club Deccan XI FC, who were the runners-up in last season’s Pune District Football Association’s (PDFA) women’s league, Sanika Deshpande has been dribbling with the ball since she was 8 years old. The teenager, who stays on Sinhgad road, has been a regular in the squad for five years, playing in several invitational tournaments in and around the city. She also played in the Indian Women’s League qualifiers at the Cooperage Stadium in Mumbai in November last year.After getting selected to represent Pune in the Inter-District Football Championships, Deshpande played in the sub-junior as well as the open category of the tournament. In May 2019, the midfielder helped the Pune team win the championship in the open category in Jalgaon. The Pune team went on to win the championship’s sub-junior category in January this year as well in Palghar. She is currently being coached by her father, Anil Deshpande, who is the head coach of the girls’ team of Deccan XI Football Club.Usual routine:With an aim to pursue a career in football or fitness, I have a meticulous routine. Before the lockdown was imposed, I woke up early at 6am and went to the gym for an hour or 90 minutes every day. After an intense workout, I cool off and grab a bite. Shortly after that, I go to college, KHS College, which goes on till late afternoon. I wrap my academic work and return home, catch a breather, and then go for my daily football practice in the evening from 6pm to 8pm at the Sevadasan ground on Karve road. The daily two-hour training sessions on the pitch include a combination of tactical training sessions and several exercises that help us improve our stamina, retain fitness and reduce our chances of contracting an injury on and off the pitch.Lockdown routine:It is challenging to maintain fitness levels when everything is shut. Working out at home is the only option, but it is still not as rigorous as the normal training regime, I follow. During the lockdown period, I dedicate 2 hours every day to a basic workout indoors which includes bodyweight exercises such as push-ups, pull-ups, and handstands. Since I am used to an intense workout regime, I also opt for HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) workout, interval training, and other exercises that help in strengthening my core.I use whatever I have at home to my advantage like I build my stamina and leg strength by going up and down the staircase. In the afternoon, I focus on academics and am in the process of completing all my pending college assignments before watching TV or playing some fun games with my brother in the evening. My father, who is the head coach of our team, has asked every player to keep working out during the lockdown and has given us all special indoor workouts.Gyms shutAs the gyms are shut, I am trying to learn some calisthenics to improve my overall strength. Currently, I am making sure that my leg strength is improving in this lockdown period and for that, I am doing a lot of leg strengthening exercises as well as some football drills like juggling, ball touch, to improve my overall football skills.HobbyI dedicate some time to art and make it a point that I draw something every day. Sometimes it helps me take my mind off a lot of things. I love the game of football, so my other hobby is football. I spend a lot of time with my football and keep on practicing drills like juggling and ball control. I hope to somehow improve my overall football skills even if I have to stay at home. Overall, I am making sure that I remain fit and healthy while pursuing my hobbies in this extremely tough and frustrating lockdown period. I follow the mantra - stay fit, stay healthy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/eyes-on-the-goal-pune-s-sanika-deshpande-plans-to-improve-leg-strength-stamina-during-the-lockdown/story-2P4SbSmezWWWDXExu5ssyM.html
