25-04-2020||News||To remain viable, museums must reinvent themselves||A relatively unnoticed impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and the restrictions which have followed it, is on museums across the world. The Metropolitan Museum, New York, expects a budget shortfall of $100 million over the next 12 months, which will lead to job losses and cuts in its programme schedule. There are about 400 State-supported museums in Italy, which now have no activity. China has a large number of State-supported museums and has been setting up between 200 and 400 publicly-funded new museums every year. The Indian government had recently announced a large funding increase for the ministry of culture to build five new museums and retrofit five existing museums. All these could be under threat since most governments expect a large revenue shortfall and a much lower GDP growth than predicted, which could make them rethink their budget allocations.The Covid-19 pandemic should be a huge wake-up call for the museum sector. It is a sector that has not been nimble, especially to incorporate audience expectations and technology, including digital. Many of them still have an old static idea of what a museum should be and have not rethought their mission for over several decades. There is a strong likelihood that the funding available for museums will decrease. Most governments are currently reworking their expenditure plans, cutting costs, and reallocating budgets. For government-supported museums, this may not lead to many job losses, but vacant positions are unlikely to be filled, cut in programmes and other core activities are likely, and there will be a reduction in capital works. A majority of museums worldwide, however, are not supported by public budgets and have to depend on their own earnings through revenue from ticketing and events, and sale of merchandise and other corporate lifelines.With a few months of lockdown with no revenues, and a major component within most museum budgets being taken up by staffing and maintenance, the impact will be immense. We can expect a number of them to remain closed for a substantial period of time, and a few to close permanently. Even if they open, their capacity to deliver on programmes will be limited. To follow social distancing measures, museums will have to regulate the number of visitors they allow at any given time, and hence the number of physical visitors will be much lower too.Since museums have an important role in both tourism as well as being custodians of cultural wealth, it is more important than ever that governments, as part of the stimulus, consider support for museums as a priority.This crisis will also provide an opportunity for museums to rethink their relevance and outreach role. During the extended lockdown, there have been few online attractions provided by museums for the public to visit. The crisis offers them an opportunity to provide more services digitally. It allows them to develop newer online revenue models to make up for any financial losses through reduced physical visits.Hopefully, in a new avatar, museums will now keep audiences as a priority, manage its operations like a business, penetrate deeply into every home, and provide competition to cinemas and amusement parks physically, and to Netflix and cable channels virtually.Vinod Daniel is chair, AusHeritage and board member, International Council of MuseumsThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/to-remain-viable-museums-must-reinvent-themselves/story-4bDDQkV12L1h1Tfx3wVmEL.html
25-04-2020||Chandigarh||MHA order on opening shops brings no respite to Chandigarh||The latest order of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on opening of non-essential shops and commercial establishments in the neighbourhood will not bring any respite to Chandigarh, a city declared as a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) containment zone. UT adviser Manoj Parida said the order does not allow such establishments to open in a containment zone, and hence, the exemptions available in other states could not be given to local residents here.The UT administration had declared the entire city a containment zone on April 19 on the ground that Covid positive cases and their contacts were scattered across the city, leaving no scope for area-wise containment.Parida said factories, plants or any e-commerce delivery of non-essential items along with sale and supply of liquor will continue to be banned till further orders. “The central government will review the situation on May 3 , the last day of the second phase of lockdown. The appropriate decisions regarding relaxations will be taken then,” he said.UT administrator VP Singh Badnore will also attend a video conference chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, which, according to the sources, will bring further clarity on phasing out of the lockdown.AMEND CITY’S CONTAINMENT ZONE TAG: TRADERSOn the other hand, unhappy over MHA order, traders have sought that the city’s containment zone tag be amended. “The administration’s decision to declare the entire city a containment zone was wrong,” said chairman of Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, Charanjiv Singh. “The authorities should declare only a particular area, sector or village where multiple cases have come up as containment zone as they have done in the case of Sector 30,” he said. “The administration should talk to the ministry to bring the city out of the red zone as it is performing well in curing and controlling the disease. On Friday, UT had shared that their Covid recovery rate is third best in the country,” said Singh.“The city traders are suffering huge losses and it is important that some kind of commercial activity is revived,” said Singh, who is also a nominated councillor.The city had seven cases when the nationwide lockdown began on March 23. While the number of cases rose to 30 to date, that of active cases is 15.Pankaj Khanna, president of Industries Association of Chandigarh, said, “The administration is doing a great job of controlling the disease. However, we want financial support from the Centre which is getting delayed inordinately. Whatever major intervention is required has to be from the Centre only.” Meanwhile, in the daily review meeting held on Saturday, deputy commissioner (DC) Mandip Singh Brar said the daily supply of cooked food packets touched 1.57lakh. “To date, around 21.5 lakh food packets have been distributed among the needy,” Brar said. A new control and command centre has been opened at the municipal corporation (MC) office to supervise distribution of vegetable, fruits, milk, bread and sanitation work. “As many as 33,115 online home deliveries have been made to residents during the curfew period,” MC commissioner KK Yadav said.NO RELAXATION IN CURFEW: MOHALI DC Meanwhile, in the neighbouring Mohali district in Punjab, deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said there will be no relaxation in curfew as the stage of no new case for 14 days has not been reached. “The revised MHA guidelines do not apply to Mohali district as it has a large containment zone,” he said, adding that relaxation will only result in movement of people that was problematic in the fight against Covid-19.ONLY REGISTERED SHOPS CAN OPEN IN P’KULAIn Haryana’s Panchkula, which too shares border with Chandigarh, deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja has said only those neighbourhood shops registered under the Punjab Shops and Commercial Establishments Act will be allowed to remain open in the district. “Shopkeepers who ensure compliance with the guidelines issued by MHA can apply for permission to open shops at www.saralharyana.in. If eligible, they will be granted permission within 24 hours,” said the DC.These outlets must ensure social distancing is maintained, only 50% staff is employed, and shop workers wear masks and gloves. E-commerce companies are allowed to sell only essential items, and shops located in areas declared as containment zones are not allowed to open, he said. Book shops and outlets selling fans and coolers are being given permission to operate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mha-order-on-opening-shops-brings-no-respite-to-chandigarh/story-Excv12Q6Ca6jH8dSW0MECI.html

25-04-2020||City||Volunteers assist police during lockdown||PUNE At least 170 residents of Aundh and Baner and 14 from Shivajinagar have registered to volunteer as ‘special police officers’ during lockdown which is in place to contain the spread of Sars-cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection, according to police.The initiative was put into practice from April 15.This initiative has been undertaken to help assist the police in keeping a check on people who are on the streets without any valid reason. The idea was suggested by advocate Satya Muley, a resident of Balewadi and first implemented in the jurisdiction of Chatuhshrungi police station. This concept was created in accordance with the police commissioner and with the police inspectors under the Shivajinagar police station.“The idea of appointing ‘special police officers’ for a limited period (till the lockdown is implemented) was implemented to seek cooperation from residents and help the police fulfil their objective of maintaining a total lockdown,” said Muley.Some of the duties of the officers involve creating public awareness, accumulating information of suspects in the specific area, help in contact tracing among others.One of the special duty officers at Aundh, Rupesh Junwane, said, “The group in Aundh has been enforcing social distancing and increase public awareness for the same at public places of commerce of essential items, example shops and vegetable outlets.”“We also coordinate for assisting in making provisions of essential items and services to the general public in case of scarcity/difficulty,” said Junwane.Police inspector Anil Shewale, Chatuhshrungi police station, said, “We have circulated a letter stating that we are seeking volunteers from the societies in Aundh, Balewadi, Baner and Pashan areas. In Balewadi itself there are more than 300 societies and we can’t visit every society to check if all the directives laid down by the government are followed hence we request the chairperson/secretary of cooperative housing societies to nominate people or themselves for the role during this time of the pandemic.”“The persons should be above the age of 18 years and below 50 years. He should be willing to assist in supporting and implementing various directives of police and state,” said Shewale.“The volunteer appointed in the region should strictly enforce all directives related to lockdown, issued by all authorities including the police department, PMC among others. The volunteers are informed about the directives in advance,” said Shewale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/volunteers-assist-police-during-lockdown/story-JnGCrqmbbEYiCWmawWOo5N.html

The NMRC said it has taken various safety measures as per good practices to ensure trains are ready to run once the lockdown is lifted. The corporation runs the Aqua Line metro which connects Noida to Greater Noida. Metro services are currently suspended till May 3, in view of the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. However, regular cleanliness and minimum maintenance is being done to ensure the train system remains in shape. Officials said the upkeep of the trains, stations and other systems associated with the smooth functioning of the metro are performed on a regular basis.Ritu Maheshwari, managing director, NMRC said, “Limited number of staff members have been deployed to take care of the upkeep, running requirement and cleaning operations.” She added that the trains make three round trips every day to ensure the network is healthy and is ready to ferry commuters once the lockdown is lifted.The corporation has also engaged its feeder buses for the distribution of food items to those in need of assistance from the community kitchens being run by the Noida Authority during the lockdown.The NMRC owns 19 sets of trains out of which 13 are used to ferry passengers, while six are kept on standby at the depot station on any given day during normal operations. The corporation said that one set of trains makes round trips during the morning, afternoon and evening. “Different sets of trains are picked up to ensure upkeep and health of all trains. The overhead transmission line is live 24×7 to prevent cable theft or tampering,” said an NMRC official, requesting not to be named. Each set of train has four coaches and while on the run, they may or may not stop at each station. If there is a need for taking security personnel and other staff from one place to another, the Aqua Line trains are used. In normal days, the metro service is available from 6am to 10.45pm with a frequency of 7 minutes, 30 seconds during peak hours and 10 minutes during non-peak hours. The corporation is also taking other precautionary measures for safety. All vehicles reaching the stations and the depot are disinfected and sanitised. “The security guards at the spot check the temperature of the visitors/employees before allowing their entry. No person without a mask is allowed inside the premises,” it said in a statement. It added that the metro stations are cleaned, especially the manned and frequently touched areas, on a daily basis. The metro employees live in the staff colony in Greater Noida and the NMRC regularly conducts sanitization exercises of the entire colony for safety. It also holds video conferencing with the employees at regular intervals.The NMRC has 650 permanent and contractual staff and a section of them are called on duty depending on the roster during the lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-nmrc-runs-round-trips-on-aqua-line-daily-to-keep-system-functional/story-ywOEOLGv8pX9Z5AeK5ILfK.html
25-04-2020||Noida||With people staying put at home, rickshaw pullers in Noida struggle to make ends meet||With most people staying home in light of the lockdown imposed to halt the spread of the coronavirus disease, rickshaw pullers in the city are struggling to earn a living and make ends meet. “Earlier people used to get down from metro stations and take rickshaws to reach their home and offices. As the Metro is shut, there are no commuters and there is no work for us,” said Rajinder Kumar, a rickshaw puller. Kumar is from Katihar, Bihar, and lives in a rented accommodation in Sector 17. He said his wife and four children are back at home and it is becoming increasingly difficult to send money to them. “I came to Noida ten years ago in search of work and started pulling the rickshaw. Before the lockdown, I used to earn Rs 200-300 per day and it was sufficient for my family. Now, it is difficult to even earn Rs 50 per day,” said Kumar.Kumar was one among the four rickshaw pullers taking a nap on their rickshaws after an endless wait for passengers near Botanical Garden Metro station on Saturday afternoon. Naresh (single name), another rickshaw puller, said the lockdown has left many like him completely jobless. “Noida has been a happening city, and a number of people commute for work and other purposes. I used to earn Rs 500 per day in normal days. But the outbreak of Covid-19 has forced people inside their home, and we have been rendered jobless,” said Naresh who had come to Noida from Munger in Bihar five years ago.Even though rickshaws are banned for plying amid the lockdown, rickshaw pullers said that they have no other option than to take the rickshaw out on the road and ferry whatever few commuters they might get in order to survive. Lakhan Singh, a rickshaw puller, said that he usually stays out near Botanical Garden Metro station search of commuters. “Sometimes shuttle buses come to drop medical staff outside the station. The nurses hire rickshaws to reach home. A few commuters also ask us to take them to hospital,” he said. Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Noida said, “All modes of public transport are not allowed to ply on the roads during the lockdown and this rule applies on rickshaws too. However, we are letting rickshaws ferry people engaged in essential services or those in an emergency.”Many rickshaw pullers are concerned about their savings drying up amid the lockdown, and are worried about being left absolutely penniless if the lockdown is extended again. “ The administration is running some community kitchens, but usually is a long queue at these kitchens and it becomes difficult to have a meal there. We have some savings and we are using them for food for now. If the lockdown continues, it will be difficult for us to survive,” said Singh.Most rickshaw pullers are from states such as Bihar and Jharkhand and are anxious about getting home. Singh said the lockdown was announced suddenly, and he did not get time to return to return to his village. “I do not know when things will be normal, and I just want to go home. I am ready to even pull the rickshaw all they way from Noida to Bihar. But the police have put barricades and blocked all movement,” he said. “ If we manage to get some work back home, we will not return to Noida,” added Singh. “The police teams ask commuters to produce valid passes and if they do not have one they are asked to go back. The lockdown guideline is strictly enforced in the district,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-people-staying-put-at-home-rickshaw-pullers-in-noida-struggle-to-make-ends-meet/story-0DPw0WrvJCJpmAoDHl1qbK.html

After realising the error, a medical team brought the two individuals back to the quarantine centre, on Friday.These Covid-19 patients were discharged from a quarantine centre in Moradabad on Thursday due to a mix up in names. However, they were brought back later to the quarantine centre.“On Thursday evening, as soon as the test reports arrived, doctors discharged the two men after confusion due to similar names. They were later brought back to the quarantine centre,” said Moradabad chief medical officer, MC Garg. An investigation into the incident is underway.District magistrate RK Singh, however, said that no action was initiated against the doctors as it was a ‘human error’.“Covid warriors are braving the odds tirelessly. Soon after the coronavirus patients were discharged by mistake, a team reached their houses and brought them back to the quarantine centre, the error was timely rectified,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/confusion-over-names-led-to-discharge-of-two-corona-positive-patients/story-CkOG1sW6XOrEmOGNUAWY8M.html
25-04-2020||Noida||Discom gives relaxation in power bill payments due to lockdown||Taking note of the problems faced by consumers owing to the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) has decided to change the parameters of ‘fixed charges’ in electricity bills.Aravind Mallappa Bangari, PVVNL managing director, said for consumers falling under LMV-1 (domestic light, fan and power for residential/domestic purpose, janata service connections, kutir jyoti connections, jhuggi/hutments, different places of worship) and LMV-5 (small power for private tube wells/pumping sets for irrigation purposes having a contracted load up to 25 BHP and for additional agricultural processes confined to chaff-cutter, thresher, cane crusher and rice huller) categories, it has been decided to calculate fixed charges on the basis of their average consumption over the last three months. “While for the consumers of ‘unmetered’ category, the fixed charges will be calculated on the stipulated tariff, for the remaining domestic consumers it will be charged as per their actual consumption,” he said. He further said even before the lockdown, the discom had started a process to concerns of inappropriate billing, raised by LMV-1 (domestic) consumers. “The process is called ‘trust’ billing and consumers can get their bills generated as per the records of meters taken by them. But during the lockdown, we are unable to do that. So, we are going with the method of average billing going by the bills of the last three months,” he said. The PVVNL MD also said in keeping with the Centre’s guidelines, the discom will resume hand-held billing system for commercial and industrial consumers from April 20. “Power bills of domestic consumers will be issued on basis of consumption over last three months. The last date of submission of electricity bills has been extended to April 30, 2020. There will be no surcharge levied on bills till the last date,” he said. Bangari also said for the LMV-2, HV-1 and HV-2 consumers, who are falling under commercial and industrial categories, during the lockdown, only two-thirds of their fixed charges will be collected. “It is a temporary arrangement to provide them relief in depositing bills amounts for March and April as waiving the fixed charges is not at the discretion of power distribution companies.

25-04-2020||Noida||High-rise residents warned against derogatory social media posts||Five residents of a high-rise in Sector 78 were issued a warning notice by the city magistrate on the police’s recommendation after they were found to have shared derogatory messages on social media during the lockdown.The incident was reported from Hyde Park society, where Noida’s second Covid-19 case was reported from. Accordingly, the society was sealed on March 17 and reopened, following regular lockdown guidelines, after 28 days.However, according to residents, a few people had issues with how the society was functioning.“The situation was under control. We were only following the protocols laid down by the administration and police—whether it was social distancing or providing essential services. All these people could do was find fault with everything. They started circulating false messages on social media and even tweeted about it. They wanted car cleaners to come which was not allowed. If any security guard stopped them at the main gate, they argued unnecessarily and would threaten them,” said a member of the Apartment Owners Association on account of anonymity.Residents also said that the suspects clashed with cops and administration officials alike. “When the society was sealed these people issued their own virus bulletin for which they were pulled up by the administration. When cops came for announcements at night, they tweeted that police was not letting them sleep. They even went on to say that to roam in the society they would need a weapon,” said the resident.Another AOA member said that their messages and tweets were monitored by the cyber cell as there are firm guidelines in place to avoid online conflicts to not create panic in the ongoing crisis among public.The notice was given based on the local police’s recommendation.“They have made derogatory comments which created tension among the society residents. They have tried to disrupt the peace. Hence, action is being taken against them under relevant sections of the CrPC. They have to maintain discipline for the next six months and have to sign a bond for Rs 30,000 and would have to appear in court on May 4,” said the notice from the city magistrate office.Police officials said that in case of further violations, they would have to pay a fine equivalent to the bond value to the government.“They were warned earlier as well. They wanted vehicles to enter the society which was not allowed and had arguments with the guard and would create unnecessary ruckus after which the action was taken following proper investigation,” said Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, station house officer, sector 49 police station.The suspects have however, denied all accusations.“The society has not followed administration orders. Our newspaper vendor was asked not to deliver newspapers even though that is not what regulations say. We have only spoken against the malpractices and this is an attempt to silence the voice of dissent. They have implemented a citizen curfew in which residents can go out only between 8-11 am. After that guards misbehave unnecessarily. There was no investigation in the case and we were just sent the notices,” said one of the five residents who was booked.The incident is one of several resident-RWA conflicts happening in the district. In another case, residents of a highrise in sector 77 alleged that the AOA was not opening society gates. However, the AOA clarified that only one gate was closed while rest were open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/high-rise-residents-warned-against-derogatory-social-media-posts/story-cLFURthfyRz17a62RZH10N.html

Police officers said they suspect it to be a case of suicide, although no note was found at the spot.The incident came to light just after 4am when security guards of the society called up the police helpline after which a team was rushed to the spot.“The woman lives with her husband and two children in another building of the same society and is a teacher in Delhi. According to the family, the children were on a visit to their maternal grandmother’s house while the woman had gone to her brother’s place in a different sector in Noida. She then spoke to her husband at night about coming back. However, as it was late he asked her to stay there and come back the next day. The family had been up till 2am and they said everything seemed fine till that time,” said Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, station house officer, Sector 49 police station.Around 3am, the woman allegedly left her brother’s place without informing anyone, said the police.“She was seen coming inside the gate in her car at 3.15am, after which she parked her vehicle near a different building. She went up and allegedly jumped from the 17th floor. Hearing the thud, security guards rushed to the spot and informed us. She was later identified as a resident of a different building after which her husband was informed,” said the SHO.Police said according to her brother and husband, she was depressed for a while but an exact cause would be established only after investigation in the case is over.The woman’s body was sent for post mortem. Meanwhile, no complaint has been filed in the matter.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-school-teacher-falls-to-death-from-17th-floor-of-high-rise/story-Y97yLoyYoudi7XelE3EeGM.html

25-04-2020||Noida||Noida launches ‘doctor on call’ service amid lockdown||As the out patient department (OPD) services at hospitals across the city are disrupted due to Covid-19 pandemic, the Noida authority on Saturday started ‘doctor on call’ service to provide expert medical advice over phone.Anyone in need can call at 0120-2422317 to seek advice from medical experts, including physician, paediatrician, ENT specialist, and ophthalmologist, among others. A total of eight doctors will be available for free between 10am and 6pm from April 25 onwards. “The operator available at this telephone number will connect the patient with the right doctor for a medical advice on phone. Residents staying at home can seek medical advice for free. And soon the authority will launch an app through which patients can video chat with a doctor and get advice,” said Shobha Kushwaha, manager with Noida authority.The service, which has been started with the help of Indian Medical Association, will continue until government and private hospitals resume their normal OPD services, officials said.The officials said that hospitals will take longer time in resuming OPD services even after the Covid-19 lockdown ends on May 3. According to the officials, the mobile application -- ‘telemedicine’ -- would be launched in a week’s time wherein anyone can directly connect with a doctor in need, video chat with him and take advice without visiting a clinic or hospital during this time of crisis. As the authority started the service, eight more doctors have come forward to provide help via telephone to residents for free during the lockdown period.“We hope that more doctors will join in and help the needy in this distressing time,” said another Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.Residents have welcome the authority’s new move. “We cannot visit a hospital as there is a fear of getting infected. Recently, my son needed a medical advice when he was having stomach pain. But we did not visit a nearby hospital due to Covid-19 fear. Now, we can seek help via telephone,” said Arun Singh, a Sector 34 resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-launches-doctor-on-call-service-amid-lockdown/story-VZAIluoDbidNI6AVTea3vL.html

25-04-2020||City||Residents question partial and full sealing of high-rises in Ghaziabad||Residents of some of the high-rises sealed by the Ghaziabad district officials have raised questions regarding the manner in which partial and full-sealing of buildings have been carried out during the ongoing lockdown to control the spread of coronavirus disease(Covid-19). Officials, on the other hand, have said that although the sealing orders were given for entire high-rises or buildings, ground-level decisions were made “judiciously”, in order to cause “minimum inconvenience” to the residents.According to the officials, the Ghaziabad district at present has 16 hotspots, which also include various high-rises that have been either fully or partially sealed. The sealing has been carried out in areas from where one or more Covid-19 positive cases have been reported. “There was only a single case of a Covid-19 positive patient in our high-rise. He was discharged from the hospital after testing negative. However, the entire building was sealed, although we have 13 different towers. Even now that the patient has turned negative, our high-rise is still sealed. There are about 1,300 occupied flats in our high-rise, and the residents facing are inconvenience ever since the sealing put in place,” said Mukesh Kumar, a resident of Oxy Home near Sahibabad. The high-rise had just one case pertaining to a 33-year-old man, working at a hospital in Delhi, who tested positive for Covid-19 on April 5.“We want that since the patient has returned and there is no further case or any suspected cases, the rest of the towers, barring his own, should be de-sealed. But no one is listening to us,” he added.Similar cases have surfaced in other parts of the district as well. Girnar Apartments was sealed in Kaushambi. The high-rise was later removed from the list of hotspots after no positive cases were reported even after 28 days since the first one surfaced on March 22.“We have come to know that the written orders for the sealing of some high-rises mention the seizure of entire building. But at the ground-level only particular towers have been sealed. The officials must explain the criteria of sealing to residents. There cannot be any arbitrary or selective decisions, where in some cases, the entire building is sealed , while in others, selective towers are sealed,” said VK Mittal, president of the residents’ welfare association (RWA) of Kaushambi Apartments Recently, HT accessed the orders for sealing of two high-rises, namely Exotica Elegance and ATS Advantage, in Indirapuram, where entire buildings were mentioned to be seized. However, only selective towers/blocks in the two high-rises were actually sealed. A single positive case in each of the high-rises was reported. In another recent case, the officials sealed the entire Supertech Residency in Vaishali, Sector 5.HT approached Aditya Prajapati, the incident commander and the sub divisional magistrate, for his comments over the issue at least twice but he declined to comment. After HT approached district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, he referred the matter to district malaria officer GK Mishra and authorised him to comment on the matter.“The decision to seal single tower or the entire high-rise is taken after judicious consideration, keeping in mind that there is minimum inconvenience to the residents. The incident commander is authorised to seal but our consent (the consent of health department) is taken to reach the final decision. The geography of the buildings is also taken in consideration before sealing. If there is strict adherence to guidelines, majority areas in Ghaziabad would go under sealing as Covid-19 positive cases are high and spreading throughout the district,” Mishra said.The officer said that decision to seal the entire high-rise of Savior Park, Mohan Nagar, was taken after a couple tested positive, who also had 93 possible contacts in different residential towers of the high-rise.He added that high-rises like Oxy Homes, Savior Park in Mohan Nagar, a part of residential area of Vasundhara Sector-2B, Skardi Green near NH-9 and SCC Sapphire, Raj Nagar Extension have no additional Covid-19 positive cases.“These high-rises will soon be put under the orange zone category as no further cases have been reported from them even after 14 days since the first positive case was reported. We will declare them under the orange zone soon and some relaxations will be allowed. But we have to checkt the guidelines to find out what relaxations can be given,” he added.The red zones as defined by the Union health ministry, are the ones having “highest caseloads”. They are also referred to as hotspots, while the orange zones are areas where no Covid-19 case has been reported in the past 14 days.The officials said that there should be no positive Covid-19 case in a hotspot for 28 days, after the last patient was tested positive for it to move out of the list of hotspots. Till Saturday night, a total of five high-rises or residential areas moved to Green zone from the list of 27 hotspots. “These include KDP Grand Savanna (Raj Nagar Extension), Girnar Apartment (Kaushambi), Shalimar Garden Extension 2, Vaishali Sector 6 and Savior Park, Mohan Nagar. No new case has been found in these areas in the last 28 days,” said CMO Dr NK Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-question-partial-and-full-sealing-of-high-rises-in-ghaziabad/story-EZqgVrdRbwuuHgFBlgNPAL.html

A senior Mumbai Police officer has confirmed the development to HT.After the incident came to light, HT contacted Dr Daksha Shah, deputy heath officer, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), on the issue. She said, “His condition is stable. KEM Hospital dean will speak to his family to know more about the matter.”Meanwhile, a 35-year-old constable, also attached with the Kurla traffic division, has been infected with the virus, and has been admitted to Kaushalya Hospital in Thane. It is suspected that the 35-year-old contracted coronavirus from the head constable. The families of both the personnel have been quarantined, even as the authorities are tracing their close contacts.On April 20, the head constable, who lives in Kurla’s Kamani area, had developed fever. After consulting a physician, his son rushed him to Rajawadi Hospital the next day around 2pm.“My father had developed fever, cough and difficulty in breathing. The doctors at Rajawadi Hospital checked his temperature and conducted preliminary analysis, after which they recommended to keep him in isolation at home. But when I asked the authorities to admit him to the hospital’s isolation centre, they claimed there was no bed available and asked us to take him to Kasturba Hospital,” the head constable’s 25-year-old son told HT.He then rushed his father on his motorcycle to Kasturba Hospital. “Doctors there checked his temperature and gave him some oxygen. They said they do not have enough beds available and asked me to take him to Nair Hospital. They did not even bother to take my father’s swab for testing,” the 25-year-old alleged.At Nair Hospital, too, the authorities denied the constable admission stating that they had no beds available and that they do not test patients. “On the recommendation of Nair Hospital, I then took my father to KEM Hospital, where doctors initially refused to admit him. Then I contacted the police, following which some officers requested civic officials to admit him. My father was finally admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU) at 11pm,” the constable’s son said.“My father has given 28 years to the police service. If anything goes wrong, the doctors are responsible,” the youth said.Another traffic cop tested positiveA traffic constable attached with the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) traffic division has been admitted to Podar Hospital in Worli, after he was tested positive for Covid-19. The constable is suspected to have contracted the virus during the bandobast duty at the BKC ground where a vegetable market has been opened for locals, as all the other markets in the area are closed.

25-04-2020||Lucknow||‘Operation Chaturbhuj’ helping stranded villagers earn livelihood||After taking up cudgels for doctors, police, army and SSB who were fighting against dreaded Covid-19 pandemic by providing them quality personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, chief development officer (CDO) Arvind Singh has now launched ‘Operation Chaturbhuj’ to help unemployed rural folks find employment. He said ‘Op Chaturbhuj’ is a road construction project and aimed at fulfilling four objectives. “The project under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) is aimed at providing livelihood to thousands of job-seekers, mitigate disputes after demarcations of roads, provide road connectivity after ‘chakbandi’ and boost environment through plantation on either side of roads,” Singh said. Singh said under this project, earthen-road construction (chak roads) work had been initiated in all those villages where ‘chakbandi’ or consolidation of landholding was completed within last decade but roads were not built.“Work started at Parsa village in Nakha block,” Singh said. “But soon after the lockdown, people from other districts and even states started coming to Kheri,’ he added.“After completing their quarantine these people are now in search of livelihood. Several of them possessed job cards too, though they were inactive,” he said. “We chalked out a plan to extend the road construction works in all the blocks of the district on the pattern of Parsa village and now 48,079 rural people are earning their livelihood under the project and over Rs one crore had been paid to them as remuneration,” he added. Singh said to generate more jobs under the project, ponds within 400 meters of canals were also being dug up. These ponds would be provided water through the canals, Singh said.Singh had earlier started ‘Operation Kavach’ under national rural livelihood mission (NRLM) to provide PPE-kits to frontline fighters against COVID-19. He had earned accolades from the centre and the state government for his effort.

She told the police that she was at her aunt’s house with her 7-year-old cousin brother when her aunt’s neighbour barged in and raped her.The Kosli police have arrested the accused under the relevant sections of the POCSO Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-minor-girls-raped-in-jind-rewari/story-RZTJRyqFBIxkAXrTTljNfJ.html
25-04-2020||Gurugram||Two-year-old boy tests positive for Covid-19, youngest case in Gurugram||The youngest person to be infected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Gurugram is a two-year-old boy who is believed to have contracted it from his 28-year-old mother, health department officials said on Saturday. The mother and the child were confirmed to be positive on Thursday and are currently being treated at a private medical college.The mother, a resident of Sector 39, was in contact with an infected person in the same locality. “Both the mother and child are doing well,” Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, said.The two-year-old and his mother contracted the virus through a 38-year-old woman, also a resident of Sector 39, and the employee of a bank in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan. Dr Ram Prakash, an epidemiologist and a member of the rapid response team, said, “The 38-year-old bank employee contracted the virus from a male colleague. The man tested Covid-19 positivein the first week of April, after which all the employees of the branch were asked to remain in quarantine.”The woman started showing symptoms during the quarantine period and got tested earlier this week. “She was confirmed positive. We tracked down others who have had contact with the woman. Through this process of contact tracing, we collected the sample of the 28-year-old mother and her two-year-old son,” said Prakash. The bank employee is also being treated at a private hospital in the city. “The two-year-old boy is the youngest in the city to have tested positive,” Prakash said.During contact tracing, the district health team interviews people who have contracted the disease. Explaining the contact tracing process, Prakash said, “The 38-year-old bank employee contracted the virus from a colleague who was asymptomatic. The woman, however, showed symptoms though she contracted the virus from an asymptomatic man.”He said that people diagnosed with a contagious disease can be asymptomatic but can transfer the virus to others. “A virus transferred from an asymptomatic person can manifest symptoms in others,” Prakash said. “While we do contact tracing, we generally tell people about possible signs and symptoms and ask them to self-isolate for the safety of others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-year-old-boy-tests-positive-for-covid-19-youngest-case-in-gurugram/story-2gjFxefoeEK3Kv5j0LVBTP.html
25-04-2020||Gurugram||Municipal Corporation of Gurugram issues tenders for cleaning storm water drains in city||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has started the tendering process for cleaning arterial storm water drains across the city, said officials on Saturday.According to MCG chief engineer Raman Sharma, all executive engineers, sub-divisional officers have been directed to start issuing e-tenders for the purpose in their respective jurisdictions. The development comes just two weeks after MCG officials and councillors on April 14 had decided that the e-tendering process should be restarted to ensure quick resumption of civic work whenever the nationwide lockdown is lifted.Sharma said MCG’s initial priority would be to clean and unclog points that are prone to waterlogging. He further said around a meeting with all contractors and officials concerned would be held around May 1 to take stock of the progress made with the tenders, and subsequently, allotment of work would be initiated. “We have initiated the tendering process, and are expecting to start on-ground work for cleaning stormwater drains within the next 10 days. We have a report on areas that are prone to waterlogging and hence will concentrate our resources on desilting them at the earliest,” said Sharma.According to MCG officials, arterial drains near Hero Honda Chowk, Subhash Chowk, Vatika Chowk, Atul Kataria Chowk, and Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road are some of the waterlogging-prone areas which the MCG would most likely desilt on a priority basis.Last year, due to the enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct for the 2019 general elections, MCG officials said that they had encountered a two-month delay in floating tenders for the desilting work which resulted in 109 kilometre, out of the total 350 kilometre, of stormwater drains not getting desilted when the monsoon arrived. With limited time left and a lot of cleaning work left to be done, the MCG had joined hands with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) to clean the remaining stormwater drains.All arterial drains flowing within residential sectors are looked after by the MCG while master drains— drains which run parallel to main roads and often carry stormwater of two or more sectors— are managed by the GMDA in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/municipal-corporation-of-gurugram-issues-tenders-for-cleaning-storm-water-drains-in-city/story-0xusYAi4kf8BEZYn6ziyPO.html
25-04-2020||Lucknow||UP gears up for ‘longer fight’ against Covid-19||The Uttar Pradesh government is gearing up for a ‘longer fight’ against Covid-19 and has asked district officials not to allow any public gathering anywhere till June 30 even as it has launched an operation to bring back migrants from other states.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath gave directions in this regard to all the DMs and district police chiefs at a video conference with them on late Friday evening.“Yes, district magistrates and district police chiefs have been asked not to allow any public gathering anywhere till June 30. The world’s experience shows that the fight against Covid-19 will be a long one. So we need to get prepared for a longer fight,” chief secretary RK Tiwari said to Hindustan Times.The state government has already transported the first batch of 2,224 migrant workers from neighbouring Haryana on 82 buses to 16 districts in west UP.There is the possibility of about 5 to 10 lakh workers of UP returning to the state in the next two months and a plan has been prepared to make arrangements to quarantine them in various districts.The chief minister has asked district magistrates to ensure that no gathering is held anywhere during Ramzan. He has said religious leaders have requested the Muslim brethren to offer ‘namaz’ at home and not venture out or hold any gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-gears-up-for-longer-fight-against-covid-19/story-n0Hpk17wka6LVSIjKFazqK.html
25-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Use of rapid test kits put on hold till further notice||The use of rapid testing kits (RTKs) has been further put on hold until the Indian Council of Medical Research issues its final advisory, the state health department said on Saturday. Officials said that the country’s apex health research body is still checking the efficacy of RTKs manufactured by international and domestic companies.Haryana, which has placed an order of 100,000 RTKs with a South Korean firm, has put it on hold after the government procured 25,000 kits from the company earlier this week, the officials said. On April 21, the ICMR had asked states to stop using the RTKs for next two days so that it could examine their accuracy in the backdrop of several complaints that they are faulty.“We are waiting for the advisory to be issued by the ICMR on the use of rapid testing kits. We have procured 25,000 antibody test kits from a South Korean firm with its plant in Manesar. The stock is enough even if we are asked to conduct antibody tests from next week,” Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, told HT.The Haryana government, earlier this week, received 10,000 kits from China, which were distributed in the hot spot districts – Gurugram, Nuh and Hathin in Palwal to check suspected Covid-19 patients. In Gurugram, at least 66 people, including 30 journalists and six from the Sohna containment zone, were tested for coronavirus with the help of RTKs after they showed symptoms of cough and fever. All the samples tested negative. On Wednesday, state health minister Anil Vij said that the Chinese kits were overpriced. “A kit from China costs Rs 780, while the RTK manufactured by the South Korean firm in Manesar costs Rs 380, almost half the price,” Vij had said. Indian ambassador to South Korea Sripriya Ranganathan had visited the manufacturing facility of SD Biosensor in that country on April 21. The Indian embassy in its tweet wrote: SD Biosensor has just started production from its Manesar facility with a capacity of 500,000 rapid test kits per week. This will be further enhanced in the coming weeks to meet the growing demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-use-of-rapid-test-kits-put-on-hold-till-further-notice/story-iUEmvLEiUd7a6Otj0WsdoO.html
25-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Four health workers test positive; admin says they weren’t handling Covid-19 cases||Four health workers of a private hospital tested positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease on Saturday, taking the district tally to 51. Health officials said the patients are residents of sectors 31 and 39.“The patients are in their 20s and are employed as health staff at a private hospital -- three junior nurses and a man who transports patients. They all are asymptomatic,” said a senior health official of the district’s rapid response team. Officials familiar with the matter said these health workers were not involved in the treatment of Sars-Cov-2 patients.“We have been directed to increase surveillance and testing in Sector 39 and villages around the hospital as cases are being reported from the sector and the adjoining Jharsa village more frequently. A van given to the health department by an online pharmacy company will be stationed at Jharsa from Sunday to increase sampling in the area,” said the official, wishing not to be named.In the past week, at least seven cases have been reported from Sector 39 and Jharsa. A large number of health workers stay in the high population density area. At least cases were reported from Jharsa village this week. On April 10, Sector 39 was declared a containment zone after three positive cases surfaced. More than 10,000 people live in Jharsa while about 50,000 live in Sector 39.Of the 51 Covid-19 cases reported in the city, 35 have recovered while 16 are undergoing treatment. More than 10,000 people have been put on surveillance to date, of which more than 7,400 have finished their quarantine period of 14 days while 226 have been quarantined at government health facilities. The health team on Saturday collected 273 samples from the civil hospital and different containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-four-health-workers-test-positive-admin-says-they-weren-t-handling-covid-19-cases/story-0bRBHqTV3EkGOE0JdylwlM.html
25-04-2020||Mumbai||Housing societies cannot object to reopening of private clinics in premises||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in a circular released on Saturday, said that housing societies cannot object to reopening of private clinics inside the premises. Societies objecting to reopening of clinics are to be booked under provisions of the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, issued by the Centre. In addition, the civic body has also asked private practitioners to give medical advice through telephone if possible.Earlier this week, BMC had announced that private clinics should remain open to treat non Covid-19 patients. However, few private practitioners had alleged they were not unable to do the same as the housing societies where their clinics are located have been objecting. In view of this, the civic body issued the circular said objecting health workers from discharging their duties is punishable under the Epidemic Disease (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 wherein one can be punished for a minimum of five months and maximum of five years along with a fine ranging between ₹50,000 and ₹2 lakh.BMC officials said in case societies object, the doctors can approach the Mumbai Police.In addition, the civic body issued guidelines for private clinic owners for treating non-Covid-19 patients. The five-point guideline reads, “Patients can be screened with non-contact thermometer, if having temperature above 98.6F, should be referred to BMC. Any suspected cases should also be referred to BMC. Wherever required, give advice through telephone.”The guideline further reads, “While attending patients, social-distancing norms, usage of masks, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquettes and other precautionary measures should be followed.”A BMC official said, “If private clinics are shut, citizens will resort to self-medication for treating symptoms of Covid-19. However, if private clinics remain open, doctors can advise people to get tested.”He added, “We have started drive-through testing facilities at 17 parking lots across the city, however, the response has been poor. We have asked private labs to test only those carrying prescription from medical professionals. And in the absence of private clinics, testing gets delayed. Due to this, tests for symptomatic patients may get delayed which risks possible spread of the virus.”Hence private clinic owners are expected to open their clinics immediately, the civic body said in the circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/housing-societies-cannot-object-to-reopening-of-private-clinics-in-premises/story-oV1HbfTQr3tpI8BosUUGHN.html
25-04-2020||Gurugram||Robot ‘nurses’ to serve food, medicines to Covid-19 patients in Gurugram soon||Some hospitals in the city have started using robots to disinfect their premises without human intervention. Soon, the robots will also be used to serve food and other essential items like medicines to Covid-19 patients. The move is aimed at reducing the risk of infection for medical and sanitation staff at the hospitals. On Friday, the Civil Hospital in Sector 10 deployed a robot to disinfect the floor in and around the isolation ward and sample collection lab. Called Novus Care, the robot has been created by a Gurugram-based company and provided to the hospital jointly by the district administration and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG).“We have tested how the robot cleans floors in the isolation ward and the sample collection lab, disinfecting the entire area. It is also designed in a way to give food and other essential items like medicines to Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, who was present at the Civil Hospital on Friday to check the robot’s functioning. Initially, the robot will be used for disinfection purposes, and then for serving food and medicines to patients, Punia said.Novus Care has been developed by The High-Tech Robotics Systemz Ltd (THRSL). Anil Saharan, product owner of THRSL, said that the robot has been designed to help doctors, nurses and staff to reduce contact with suspected/confirmed Covid-19 patients. “The whole purpose of these robots is to disinfect the hospital premises and ensure that they give food and other essential items like medicines to Covid-19 patients. It will lower any chance of contracting infection by the patient, and medical and support staff at sensitive areas within the hospital.”The four-foot tall robot can clean a 10x10 room in 25 minutes. It is equipped with six sensors which help in navigation and mapping, and detect any obstacle during the movement.“The robot can be remotely accessed. It moves with a maximum speed of 1 metre/second and can be controlled through a laptop or a tablet. The robot has an internal wi-fi mechanism through which it can be directly connected with the laptop or the tablet,” said Saharan.It took Saharan and his team four days to modify the basic robots for Covid purposes during the lockdown. “We had to modify the basic robots as per the Covid-19 requirements, like adding trolley, spraying and fogging mechanism. The challenge was to get raw material during the lockdown. We approached Munish Sharma, additional labour commissioner, for permission to visit our unit and start the modification work. We were allowed to approach vendors, who provided us the material and we finalised the robot in four days.”Fortis hospital in the city has also started using a robot for disinfection purposes. On Friday, Milagrow Robots provided ‘Indoor Disinfection Robot’ to the hospital. Dr Ritu Garg, zonal director, Fortis hospital, said, “The robot will help minimize the exposure to patients and health care workers’ contact with possible spores. This is a big step in our commitment to ensure the safety for all our patients and staff.” The hospital authorities, however, said that they are currently not using the robot for the Corona ward.Rajeev Karwal, founder chairman, Milagrow Robots, said that building a modified robot especially in the Covid-19 situation was challenging. “The district administration allowed us three curfew passes to work on our robots. We worked 72 hours non-stop at our unit to add features that could cater to hospital requirements at the time of the pandemic,” said Karwal.The Gurugram-based company built the 11-cm robot with 25 different types of sensors which is fully independent in terms of navigation, but can be controlled through a mobile application.Karwal’s team also modified the water tank in the robot that sprays 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, which allows the killed bacteria and viruses to settle on the ground and to be easily cleaned by mopping.“The robot can disinfect and sanitise the floor of the hospital without any human intervention. The robot moves around autonomously without falling, avoiding obstruction while planning its own path. It is guided by LIDAR and advanced SLAM technology,” said Karwal.He has patented the technology used in building the robot. “It is ‘Real Time Terrain Recognition’ technology (RT2RT) that scans at 360 degrees, six times per second to make a floor map in real time,” said Karwal.Karwal’s team has also developed a robot -- Humanoid ELF -- that enables doctors to monitor and interact with patients remotely with no person-to-person contact, thereby significantly reducing the transmission risk. According to him, patients in isolation wards can also interact with their relatives through this robot. The Humanoid ELF can navigate around the ward independently and record the activities in high definition video and audio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/robot-nurses-to-serve-food-medicines-to-covid-19-patients-in-gurugram-soon/story-iGNhle5xrWwTtTU9HabkOM.html
25-04-2020||Lucknow||UP: Dedicated teams to check infection in hospitals||The UP government on Saturday decided to constitute dedicated teams in all districts to check infection in government and private hospitals. The decision was taken in view of chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s directive in this regard, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi and principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said at a press conference on Saturday.Prasad said the teams will monitor whether the hospital authorities were implementing the infection prevention protocol. In several districts, infection spread from hospitals, he said. District level teams will be headed by an officer of additional chief medical officer (ACMO) rank. Office bearers of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), field staff of World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF and district level officials of the state pollution control board will be team members. The pollution control board played an important role in management of biological waste, he said.All government and private hospitals will also constitute teams to ensure the infection prevention protocol was implemented, Prasad said.As the state government has ordered government and private hospitals to start emergency services, the health department has started training doctors, nurses and paramedical staff posted in hospitals. After training government hospital staff, the health department decided to hold classroom training for private hospital staff as well, he said. The health department will also carry out a audit in all hospitals to ensure that the infection prevention protocol was followed, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-dedicated-teams-to-check-infection-in-hospitals/story-VFao42beZPqrwAqqmMAWJM.html
25-04-2020||Mumbai||Pre-monsoon prep on hold, fear of dengue, leptospirosis outbreak lurks in Mumbai||With the pre-monsoon preparation to curb the outbreak of dengue, malaria and leptospirosis taking a back seat amid the fight against Covid-19, cases of water-borne diseases are likely to rise during the rains, warn experts.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the onset of southwest monsoon in Mumbai is likely on June 10. But unlike every year, the insecticide department hasn’t started door-to-door inspections, fogging, spraying disinfectants, identifying breeding grounds and killing rodents, among others. All 600 employees of the insecticide department of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) have been assigned fumigation work to contain the spread of the coronavirus. In June 2019, the city saw eight cases of dengue, 15 cases of malaria and five of leptospirosis. For the first time in a decade, Mumbai didn’t record a malaria death last year.“Every year, the pre-monsoon preparations begin by March. This year we are so busy with Covid that we haven’t gotten the time for it,” said an officer from the insecticide department. “As we have the fumigation machines, we have been assigned duties in societies and hospitals for Covid care. The BMC is planning to frame a policy and we hope that the solid waste management, which is currently functioning on 50% strength, will come forward to help us.”Medical experts are, however, concerned. “Recently, it started to rain in Bangalore. If it happens in Mumbai, it will be a big problem for the health team to deal with. Although the priority for now is Covid, focus should also be paid to seasonal diseases as the monsoon is not very far,” said Dr Vikrant Shah, infection specialist from Zen Hospital, Chembur.A patients’ rights activist has filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission, Delhi seeking intervention from the health department to bring the pandemic under control before the monsoon. “Already, the slums in Dharavi, Govandi and Worli have turned into Covid hotspots. In the monsoon, it will be tougher to maintain social distance and keep a tab on slum dwellers,” said Dr Yogesh Dube, president of Bhartiya Vikas Sansthan. Due to the pandemic, blood donation, too, has dropped by 70%, with most blood banks running out of blood and platelets. “A healthy person has a platelet count between 150,000 and 250,000 per microlitres of blood. In dengue patients, the count deteriorates to 20,000, making platelet transfusion essential. With no blood donation, we won’t have enough platelets to save them,” said a blood officer from a civic-run hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pre-monsoon-prep-on-hold-fear-of-dengue-leptospirosis-outbreak-lurks-in-mumbai/story-EZCVqgcmjtzXwrgMRyTgJO.html
25-04-2020||Mumbai||This Ramzan, hear Quranic sermons online||After the chief qazi of the city instructed members of the Muslim community to conduct prayers from home during the holy month of Ramzan, a community group has started online Quranic sermons.The sermons are being organised and uploaded by Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH), Maharashtra, and Students Islamic Organisation of India (SIO). Sessions for women started three days ago and the first Hindi sermon was uploaded on Friday. Rizwan-ur-Rahman Khan, president of JIH, said on Friday night, the sermon had more than 15,000 views from all over the world. “We are reaching out to people through social media and informing them of these sermons. People are watching these sermons on various online platforms,” said Khan.The online sermons are by three religious, Islamic scholars. In addition to Hindi, Marathi sermons will start from May 1. They will be uploaded on social media daily. The organisers arranged special talks for women, which began three days ago and will continue throughout Ramzan.“Ramzan draws its importance from the Quran, as the divine book was revealed to prophet Muhammad in this very month. A special prayer called taraweeh is held every night throughout the month, where one of the 30 parts Quran is recited. While the recitation is in Arabic, usually these verses are explained in local languages in many mosques,” said Islamic scholar Naushad Usman, who will deliver the Marathi sermons. Due to the lockdown, community members have been discouraged from visiting mosques.Some members of the community have argued that putting sermons online is against religious practices.Last week, chief qazi of Mumbai Mufti Mehmood Akhtar Qadri had requested community members to observe the restrictions imposed by the lockdown during Ramzan. “Because of lockdown, a lot of people have expressed concerns about how can they have taraweeh namaz at home and that everyone needs to gather in a mosque, but even if a limited number of people offer namaz from mosque, it is acceptable. Others can pray from home,” Qadri had said, adding an appeal to help poor families by providing them food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/this-ramzan-hear-quranic-sermons-online/story-VhkSU5JhYozpKOLeQcKUgN.html

25-04-2020||Chandigarh||Give bonus on wheat MSP: SAD to states, Centre||The core committee of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday urged the Centre to give bonus on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of wheat, besides sending a team to inquire into the misappropriation and embezzlement of food material dispatched to the state.In its meeting held here through video conferencing that party president Sukhbir Singh Badal chaired, the core committee also asked the government to remove the glut in ‘mandis’ by lifting wheat and helping those in crisis through direct cash transfers and waiver of electricity bills. Party patron and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal also attended. The core committee expressed its concern that the inclement weather, coupled with restrictions on sale of wheat, had resulted in hardship to farmers. It said a bonus was needed to offset the losses being suffered by farmers even as it asked the Centre to give directions to FCI to relax moisture norms and procure shrivelled and discoloured wheat. The committee also asked the Punjab government to take immediate steps to work out a bonus on wheat.“Most Mandis have become clogged due to lack of lifting which could translate into a health hazard soon if not cleared,” said Sukhbir.The committee asked the government to revise its strategy to counter covid-19, as the death rate was among the highest in Punjab. The members also resolved to demand from the state a judicial inquiry into the death and the subsequent controversy over the cremation of Padma Shri Bhai Nirmal Singh. The committee also paid condolences to Bhai Nirmal Singh, ACP Anil Kohli and all other victims of covid-19 in the state. Advise Capt to release DA of state employees: Majithia to RahulIn a separate statement, SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia also asked Congress MP Rahul Gandhi to advise chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to release Dearness Allowance (DA) and arrears of Rs 5,000 crore to Punjab government employees, due since 2018 if he was really concerned about employee welfare. “The Centre has taken the unprecedented step to freeze the hike in DA, but the Punjab government has not been giving arrears to its employees for three years. Isn’t this really inhuman and cruel? Should you not practise what you preach and get what you are advising the Union government implemented in Punjab first?” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/give-bonus-on-wheat-msp-sad-to-states-centre/story-wn03BZf8lMdgkdXjjb0suO.html

25-04-2020||City||Delhi govt launches online mathematics learning for class 9 students||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Saturday announced an online mathematics learning programme for nearly 3 lakh class 9 students, one of the several digital initiatives that the AAP dispensation has launched to help students continue their studies during the ongoing national lockdown to stop the spread of Covid-19.Delhi education Minister Manish Sisodia announced the initiative during his weekly session of “parenting in the time of Corona”. “The lockdown has no doubt affected us all. It has hampered the studies of our students and so, our education department has been trying to introduce new ways (like online classes) to reduce this impact on the studies of the students and help them cope with the loss in academic activities,” he said. Schools across the city are have been shut for more than a month.To be run in collaboration with a non-profit organisation, Khan Academy, students would be sent links to mathematics lessons designed by Khan Academy though SMS from Monday. The links will have videos of lessons as well as activities for the students based on the topics mentioned in the lessons.The government is already running online classes for class 12 students and activities and e-lessons for those enrolled in classes nursery to 8 in its schools to ensure continued learning during the lockdown.Explaining the reason behind launching a mathematics programme for class 9 students, Shailendra Sharma, senior advisor to education minister, said mathematics has always been a major challenge for government school students. “Last year, when we examined the class 10 board exam results we found that while the overall pass percentage was 97%, only 71% students had passed in mathematics. Similarly, the pass percentage was 57% in mathematics in class 9. Keeping that in mind we decided to collaborate with Khan Academy that will produce online study material for our students.”Sandeep Bapna, managing director of Khan Academy India, said it will be a 10-week-long programme. “Starting Monday, the parents will receive an SMS with a link to that day’s micro lesson. It will have two or three videos and a couple of exercises. These lessons will be sent to parents/students for 10 weeks . The purpose of the programme is to revise the syllabus of the last year and to prepare the students for the new academic year,” he said.Khan Academy will also train 1,000 Delhi government teachers for the programme through five webinars in the coming weeks, he added. “The videos produced by Khan academy will not require high speed internet so that everyone can access it,” Bapna said.Sisodia also took feedback of ongoing online classes from teachers, parents and students. “ I am glad to see that 1,33,193 students of Class 12 (the students of class 11 who are awaiting their results) have been registered for the online classes. Around 6 lakh students currently studying in classes nursery to 8, are also connected with us through SMS and IVR. They receive a daily exercise/assignment on their parents’ mobile phones everyday, We have also garnered a great response for the Happiness Class that is being streamed online for entire family everyday at 4 pm.” he said. Sharing her experience of online classes, Harita Arora, a history teacher said, “We were initially apprehensive about going from real classrooms to virtual ones but the transition has been smooth. Students are fearlessly asking questions in chat boxes during online class, more than they would do in real classrooms.”Sisodia also spoke to some parents of younger kids over phone to take feedback about the daily activities. Harvinder Kaur, a mother of a Class 5 Delhi government student said, “The daily activities are making my child aware of a lot of general issues like water conservation. Today we got an exercise asking if we had 15 litres of water then how would we manage our household. So, I taught my child to use minimum and made him aware about how to conserve water,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-launches-online-mathematics-learning-for-class-9-students/story-uK2JuPVG8VHZkWB5iAN3DK.html

25-04-2020||Delhi||Woman murdered inside Madipur containment zone, police arrest husband||A 35-year-old man was arrested by Delhi Police on Saturday morning from outside a containment zone in west Delhi’s Madipur, near Punjabi Bagh, for allegedly murdering his wife.The murder, the first such incident reported from inside a Covid-19 containment zone in the city, was reported around 3.56am when the suspect called up the police control room and confessed to the killing. The city has around 90 containment zones, such as Nizamuddin, Chandni Mahal, Nabi Karim, which have come up to limit the spread of Covid-19. Police officers privy to the investigation said that because this was the first case of murder within a containment zone , they had to look at standard operating procedures for such cases and act accordingly. “There were many firsts in this case. Usually our officers immediately visit the crime scene, but in this case, we called the suspect (husband) and asked him to come outside the containment zone. We waited for him to step out. He was then arrested and sent into isolation,” a police officer said. Police said that it took them about eight hours to clear the crime scene — the road that lead to the house was first sanitised and investigating officers then waited for delivery of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits before carrying out a detailed inspection of the room. A forensics team was called to the spot. Senior officers said even though the woman hadn’t died of Covid-19, her body was wrapped in multiple body layers. The hearse van used to take the body from the house was also sanitised twice.The police said that the suspect — identified as Rahisul Azam — called the control room around 3.56 am and reported that he had attacked his wife following a heated argument at their house. The woman had supposedly died on the spot. “A police team from Punjabi Bagh police station rushed to the address given by the man, arrived at the scene =, but found that the house was inside a containment zone. In order to adhere to guidelines, the sub divisional magistrate, district magistrate and civic agencies concerned were also informed of the case. The Delhi Jal Board was roped in to sanitise the area,” said a senior police officer.The policemen then called up Azam and asked him to walk out of the containment zone and surrender. Before he was arrested, his body temperature was checked and the suspect was asked if he had symptoms of the disease. “Azam has so far told us that he sells footwear in Jahangirpuri and had got married three years ago. It was the second marriage for both Azam and his wife. While Azam had three children from his first marriage, the woman had six. He said they often fought over the future of their children and during one such argument on Saturday, things turned ugly. He hit the woman with a stuck on her head and she fell unconscious. He said when he checked on her, she was already dead,” the police officer said. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said the disaster management teams and Covid helplines were also alerted. “Azam has been arrested as per guidelines issued in view of Covid-19. All preventive and precautionary steps are being taken while investigating the above case so as to adhere to the containment zone guidelines and at the same time to conduct an efficient investigation,” Purohit said.Until late Saturday evening, the investigating officers said they were checking with health and district authorities about proceedings related to the autopsy and the disposal of the body. Police said they are checking if the body could be handed back to the family, because the woman was not Covid-19 positive but was a resident of a containment zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-murdered-inside-madipur-containment-zone-police-arrest-husband/story-qI0QQ2XI78E7svz9o7drRK.html
25-04-2020||Delhi||Grateful for new clothes, migrants help clean shelter||At a school-turned-shelter home for migrant workers in Delhi’s Rohini Sector 3, a group of teachers and school employees collected money to buy new clothes for the workers staying on the school premises during the lockdown. Grateful to the school authorities, the migrant workers have started cleaning the school premises. Tens of thousands of migrant workers who were leaving the national Capital last month in the first week of the nationwide lockdown were stopped at the city borders and taken to different shelter homes across the city. Several government schools in the city have also been turned into temporary shelter homes to house the migrant workers and their families. They are being fed and looked after by the government and the police. At many shelter homes across the city, the government is organising yoga classes for adults and activities for their children to help cope with the lockdown. When 28-year-old Arvind Kumar, a migrant labourer from Bihar, was brought to a shelter home set up at a Delhi government school in Rohini Sector 3 last month, he had no money, food or clothes. For the next few weeks, he wore the same pair of jeans and a shirt. But as the days turned hotter, and the mercury reached close to the 40 degree Celsius mark, it became difficult for him to survive without another set of clothing. There were several people at the shelter home facing the same problem as Kumar. To bring relief to Kumar and other inmates at the shelter home, the school staff pooled in money and bought new clothes for all the 141 migrant labourers residing there. “It’s such a relief for us all. I could not have imagined buying clothes in this situation. All my stuff is locked in a factory I used to work at in Rohini. Now it’s become easier to survive the summer,” he said.School principal Arun Bhatia said that many of those who were shifted to his school earlier this month had tried to run away from other shelter homes. “We wanted to make them feel at home here. Although the government is providing food, medication and even organising yoga classes for them, we found that a majority of them were finding it difficult to survive since they did not have clothes. The school staff decided to collect money and get clothes for them,” he said.To show their appreciation, the migrant workers at the shelter have started helping out around the premises.OP Meena, a teacher at the school sai, that the inmates now help them clean the garden area, water trees and plants and also help distribute of food and tea every day. “They trim the grass in the garden and also water plants. Some of them helping in the door-to-door distribution of food and tea while maintaining the rules of social distancing. Those who used to work at construction sites also helped us shift unnecessary furniture from rooms and make space to store food,” he said. Getting new clothes was not an easy task for the school staff amid the lockdown. “We spoke to a businessman in Patel Nagar who deals in readymade garments. They had a stock of kurta pyjamas in their godown and they were ready to sell them to us. Then we discussed the matter with the police and requested them for a pass to go and collect the stock. The inmates were really happy when we distributed the new pair of clothes among them,” Bhatia said.A 20-year-old migrant worker from Bihar, who worked as a waiter until the lockdown, said, “I got a new pair of clothes for the first time in years. I’m used to wearing hand-me-down shirts and pants belonging to my hotel owner’s son.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/grateful-for-new-clothes-migrants-help-clean-shelter/story-G0nslcvEIg93UdpPXASDDP.html

The development followed PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram’s complaint to Badnore that patients from outside the city were sent to the institute without prior screening for the virus.Badnore “expressed the apprehension that if the major hospitals of Chandigarh become a hub for infection, then the entire health management system will get crippled.” He appealed to all the citizens of Chandigarh to cooperate with the medical teams going for door-to-door survey and not to hide any information from them regarding their illness or travel etc, the official statement of the administration mentioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/screen-patients-before-referring-them-to-pgimer-in-chandigarh-badnore-to-neighbouring-states/story-rmrdBicC57FnCeaWsZ2UhP.html
25-04-2020||City||Mohali admn wants its 400 locals working in PGIMER to stay in Chandigarh||The district administration has written to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) to retain around 400 of its employees, who are all residents of Mohali, in Chandigarh for at least the next 15 days.A letter was shot off by deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan to the director of PGIMER, Dr Jagat Ram, suggesting the step “in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in Nayagaon”— a potential hotspot and presently a containment zone of Mohali, besides Jawaharpur village.To date, eight positive cases have been reported in Nayagaon, of which seven are either employees of PGIMER or their primary contacts. The district authorities have pinpointed in the letter that the “exposure” of the PGI employees to the virus was evident in the Nayagaon cases.Mohali has reported 63 positive cases so far, of which 47 are active and 14 have been cured, besides two deaths. The district has the second highest count of positive cases in the state, and highest in the tricity area. MOVE TO PREVENT SPREAD IN DENSE NAYAGAON“It would be advisable that the employees of PGIMER who are residing in Nayagaon stayed in the institute or at an alternate accommodation in Chandigarh at least for the next 15 days, so that others in the dense habitation are not exposed,” the letter said.The district health authorities in a door-to-door survey had identified around 400 employees of PGIMER staying in Nayagaon, who are now in the process of being tested to rule out any possibility of infection. “To keep the employees in PGI itself shall be in the best interest of the employees and their families, who are at the greatest risk of exposure. It is critical to ensure timely and adequate safeguards are taken in this area to contain the spread of Covid-19,” said Dayalan in the letter.Already a 30-year-old hospital attendant working with the PGIMER, his 26-year-old wife, a two-month-old baby, 20-year-old brother-in-law and 60-year-old mother, along with a 30-year-old colleague and a 25-year-old who stays in the same building in Adarsh Nagar of Nayagaon have tested positive. Earlier, a 65-year-old man of Nayagaon’s Dashmesh Nagar had died of the disease on March 31, and his son suspects that he had caught the infection at the hospital.Nayagaon is a thickly populated area with largely working class, low income groups residing there.

President of the society Surjit Singh alleged, “Councillors of wards 43, 44 and 45 have failed to provide ration to the needy 1984 riots-hit families and others.”Surjit said, “Councillors Reet Kaur and Barjinder Kaur of wards 43 and 45, respectively, have failed to provide ration to even a single family. Ward 44 councillor Harkarandeep Vaid distributed around 100 kits, but many families in his area are struggling to get ration. The councillors are adopting pick-and-choose policy while distributing ration and there are around 2,500 families who have no food. We are arranging meals for these families with the help of gurdwaras and NGOs.”He added, “If the administration and the Congress leadership fail to streamline the distribution of ration in 72 hours, members of the society will sit on a hunger strike.”Councillor Barjinder Kaur, however, refuted the allegations, stating that ration was being distributed among the needy families regularly and without any discrimination. She added, “Surjit, who does not even reside in her ward, is levelling baseless allegations just to defame me.”On her part, councillor Reet Kaur said, “No pick-and-choose policy has been adopted in the distribution of ration. The councillors are receiving around 200 kits of ration in a day and we have to distribute these among residents living in different areas of the ward. Limited kits are being distributed in every area as per need, but no one will be left out. Kits will reach every needy person in the coming days.” Despite several attempts, councillor Harkarandeep Vaid could not be contacted for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/biased-ration-distribution-in-ludhiana-sikh-body-threatens-to-launch-hunger-strike/story-57addPWNUoxYGwOWdyyqQL.html

The administration ignored his clinical condition and kept seeking documents like residence proof, vehicle and recommendation of the hospital authorities. It was quite unfortunate that he couldn’t see his family before dying,” said Vishal Bharti, a senior journalist, who toiled hard to help the man.The administrative inertia has come under sharp criticism of the scribes here.“The government officers need to be a little more sensitive and listen to the reasons rather than burying their wisdom under the niceties of the law. Laws should be enabling instruments, not obstructions,” said another senior journalist Zafar Choudhary.However, the administration did intervene after the poor man died.As per a GMCH official, the administration arranged an ambulance to shift the body to his village on Saturday. “Two attendants with some cash, ration and eatables accompanied the deceased to his native village on Saturday,” he said.It may be recalled that a prominent hotelier along with a very influential person had made a total mockery of the lockdown on April 12 when they escaped from a red zone in Jammu and travelled 270 km in an official car to reach Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cancer-patient-succumbs-to-illness-at-jammu-hospital-before-seeing-his-family-in-up/story-1vhPJcvN6fglassYZ8xlWN.html

The page also shared several numbers for placing an order. Following a complaint, investigating officials began to track their sources. Since March 23, the administration and Centre have banned the sale and purchase of liquor across India in the wake of the epidemic. This gave swindlers an opportunity to dupe people on pretext of delivering liqour at their doorsteps. “As people are not getting liquor because of the ban, con men are exploiting public sentiment and duping them. We are trying to ascertain the identity of those behind the fraud,” said Rashmi Sharma Yadav, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) cyber crime. She said some numbers have been traced to Assam and Tamil Nadu. “In one instance, the caller identified himself as a manager of a liquor vend in Sector 22. He claimed he would deliver liquor within 40 minutes of the order being placed,” said a police official privy to the matter, requesting anonymity. According to police, these swindlers want 50 percent of the payment to be made online and the rest after delivery. However, customers are left in the lurch, as there is no delivery even after payment. Cyber experts say that amid the endemic, people are being hoodwinked by several fake online messages, and that people should refrain from clicking on these links.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-cyber-crime-cell-blocks-8-fake-fb-pages-promising-home-delivery-of-liquor/story-RdnEqeAbO3ODqodIixKlbK.html

He said 550 labourers are now left, and they too will be sent home soon.Panipat DC Hema Sharma said, “Some labourers have already been sent and we are making arrangements to others too as per the government’s directions.”The officials said that special care was taken to ensure social distancing and only 30 migrants were taken on the 52-seater buses. Further, all of them were medically examined fore departure and they will also be quarantined for 14 days after they reach home.As per information, there are around 15,200 migrant labourers in shelter homes across the state and most of them hail from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. They were stopped by the state police when they were trying to cross the border and sent to these shelter homes. The government had arranged food and shelter for them and even asked the administrations to allow them to work as labourers if they want to, but most of them refused and urged the government to send them home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-month-s-wait-migrants-in-haryana-finally-on-way-home/story-9bTUKp88i8lBg3omlpS5VK.html

They also raised slogans against the state government for making “inadequate” arrangements for hassle-free procurement. The protest began at around 11 am after a dozen farmers were stopped by the police from entering the grain market without passes. Some farmers tried to enter the market forcefully by breaking the barricade, but police didn’t allow them to do so. Some farmer leaders also reached the spot later and staged a protest outside the grain market.“The system of issuing passes to the farmers through the commission agents has failed. During the past 10 days, only half of the total 133 commission agents of the market were issued five passes each. Due to the tardy process, farmers are being harassed,” said Satnam Singh Pannu, president of Kisan Sangarsh Committee (KSC), Punjab.Additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Surinderpal Singh later assured the farmers that they will be allowed to enter the grain market as per the space and requirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-protest-non-issuance-of-passes-in-tarn-taran-grain-market/story-2aKLOFi21PZNd9sCSmeMyJ.html
25-04-2020||City||A stitch in time: Girl students of Punjab’s ITIs making masks for Covid warriors||Doing their bit to arrest the spread of coronavirus, over 2,000 girl students of various Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) in Punjab are stitching free masks for the frontline warriors battling the pandemic.In the past two weeks, the students have made 2.23 lakh four-layer, washable masks from home. The Punjab State Board of Technical Education and Industrial Training is arranging for the raw material either through the administration or through contributions by the ITI staff, residents and NGOs.The stitched masks are further provided to the district administrations, healthcare institutes, police and panchayats for their use. In Ludhiana, masks have been given to health workers, staff at grain market, police officials and residents of various villages, including Malakpur Bet, Kila Raipur, Gujjarwal and Jassowal.Each student is stitching about 25 masks daily under the guidance of principals of 77 ITIs in Punjab. Made of cloth, the masks are washable for reuse. Amandeep Kaur, 22, who is pursuing a dress-making course at Government ITI (Women), Rajpura, Patiala, said, “I have a sewing machine at home, so I make masks for four hours daily and spend an equal amount of time studying online.” She added that she was provided raw material by the sarpanch of Faridpur Jatta village, so she prepared masks for the villagers as well.Sandeep Kaur, a student of Government ITI (Women), Ludhiana, said, “I make sure to use sanitiser, wear a mask and maintain social distancing. I stitch 12 masks in two hours and about 30 masks daily. Our principal provides us the fabric.”“ITI staff from Ludhiana visited our village a week ago and gave us about 1,000 masks for free. We have distributed these masks in the slum areas. As masks are unavailable in the market, the ITI initiative helped us a great deal,” said Charanjit Kaur, member of Malakpur Bet panchayat, Ludhiana.The fabric supply was not an issue as individuals and NGOs had been providing the material, said Baljinder Singh, principal of Government ITI, Gill Road, adding that 217 students in the district had prepared 22,988 masks. “They will prepare another 10,900 masks in the coming week,” he said.“This will hone the skills of students and also enable them to contribute towards a social cause. The district administration, Amritsar, requires 1 lakh masks and students of nine ITIs in Amritsar are stitching these masks. Besides, the Mohali district administration requires 20,000 masks; that of Rajpura requires 10,000 masks, and the Samrala administration needs 1,000 masks,” said Anurag Verma, principal secretary, technical education and industrial training, Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/a-stitch-in-time-girl-students-of-punjab-s-itis-making-masks-for-covid-warriors/story-sFmNyVkc6fhEJCnNJMMA3I.html
25-04-2020||City||Witerati: Munch ado about flattening the curve||There’s a one million-dollar question in the time of death and dying that’s troubling the globe as much as gluttons, the latter being the species that has less to do with dying and more to do with being die-hard, practitioners of Lockdown’s leisurely art of gluttony, that is.“Will the curve flatten?” ... “Is the curve flattening? ... “Can the curve flatten by May 16?” regurgitate the gabs of Pashas of Primetime Arnab, Rajdeep & Co, choking with a “Nation Wants To Know” kind of emergency and inadvertently poking India Reclining (in postures peculiar to Quarantined Couch Potatoes) with a ‘burning’ kind of urgency. For, “flattening of the curve” – the hottest new rhetoricism injected into the Covid19 narrative – is not only about pontificating on burning issues, but could also broadly translate into ‘burning’ of calories, from the Bloated Bellies of #BigtimeQuarantine. Of middles anatomies & middle classThis season of “Flattening the Curve” is flaunting its fallout Left, Right and Centre – payslips look squashed like migrants’ faces ‘n’ fortunes as if Baahubali just squatted on the pay packets, GDP is shrinking faster than Rajnikanth or Rohit Shetty’s hairline, Sensex looks to be legging a Zumba with the Bears, and what to talk of Bollywood babes, even oil prices are boasting a Size Zero. Practically everything is shrinking, except the quarantined middle anatomies of Middle Class India. Lockdown’s ‘Flatten the Curve’ hyperbolism, having fruitfully flirted with the elitism of the Famous and Fashionables’ “flattened” midriff narratives, seems to be doing a detour away from the piling potbellies of Middle Class India, just as a chit of a chihuahua contemplates skirting a meaty pile too tough to tackle.From Quarantined Couch Potatoes who are showing partiality to only one form of exercise – exercising zero restraint when it comes to chomping on calorie-packed packaged crispies whilst feasting on a visual diet of “Khichdi”, “Ramayan” & Co reruns – to many of the #wfh multitudes sporting zero-exercise lifestyles, much of Middle Class India is not gambolling towards treadmills, but instead treading towards another thing that’s getting fatter and fatter (from Lockdown’s stockpiling), the reluctant refrigerator.Just as well, that in lockdown poor Swiggy & Co weren’t on the go, else they would have got much of the blame for Middle Class India’s middle anatomies not “flattening their curve! For, in the time of the #OldNormal, Swiggy, Zomato & Co have been to much of Middle Class India what a Ramu or Shamu were to days of yore – faithfuls ferrying from nukkad shops samosas, pakoras or pizzas galore. Just as well this may be a blessing in disguise that a pizza delivery boy tested Corona positive, else Quarantine’s Couch Potatoes chumbling on home-delivered pizzas would have done for their “flattening of the curve” what Tablighi Jamaat did for Corona’s curve.The curious case of “Honey, I Didn’t Shrink the Cals!”Of falling flat, not flatteningEven as there are slim chances of flattening the curve mapping the middle regions of Middle Class India, there are other things bearing the brunt of flattening.True to misgivings voiced before, too many cooks seem to be spoiling the quarantine broth. This fallout is felt when bearers of the Bloated Bellies of #BigtimeQuarantine start treading, not on the treadmill, but on the toes of the women of the house manning Lockdown’s kitchens.In trying to be counted among the “too many cooks”, some treading toes send pots ‘n’ pans flying hither thither, like the fabled Flying Saucers. One of the things bearing the brunt of flattening thus is precious bone china – in a shattering rendition of the “bull/s in a china shop” script.Or, as in a certain case, when a neighborhood scurried to the balconies upon hearing a blast – nah, not the blast of a musical performance like the bards on the balconies of Europe –the sound and fury emanated from the flattening of a pressure cooker.This ubiquitous utensil, wielded by “too many cooks” of Quarantine, echoed the “flatten curve” narrative when its voluminous curves breathed their last flattened into a warm embrace with the kitchen ceiling.The curious case of “Honey, I Shrunk the Cooker!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/witerati-munch-ado-about-flattening-the-curve/story-juhTSDCdKroKkK5w7Ew3rN.html
25-04-2020||City||Roundabout: Just do it while you can!||When school starts, students are likely to get the following assignments, it is being said. English language teacher: Write an essay on coronavirus. Math: If Covid is equal to 1 then find the 9. Moral Instructions: How many of you participated in beating the pans and lighting the lamps? Art teacher: Draw coronavirus. The list is endless and funny even though no one knows when schools reopen.Never mind, till schools reopen for real or ‘virtually’ given how technology dominates our lives, parents are doing all these exercises and more to hold onto laughter if nothing else in the most uncertain of times where everyone is held hostage indoors by this ugly little virus doing the scary act.If fact, it has not stopped even when our homegrown temptress Rakhi Sawant, in a horror show get-up has warned the virus that she’s more explosive than it is, abusing it in no uncertain terms, crying out ‘go corona go’, heaving heavily all the while.In fact, hyperactivity has become a universal phenomenon in this ‘viral’ age, with artists fervently painting messages, writers literally in a hurry to tell the sad tale of their times as uniquely perceived by them and poets giving the message of hope against hope if not for these times at least for the times to come when the person at the helm of affairs of the superpower will not call for sanitisers to be injected into patients. If the virus can be eliminated by sanitising hands then why not make it run through the veins and then sing “Que sera sera, whatever will be will be?” Art of staying at homeLoss of life and complete uncertainty about who will get infected next have taken their toll on the human mind, but practically it is the lockdown that is the greatest challenge because most of us had forgotten the art of staying at home.Long hours at work and some for socialising left little time for home and even children were kept busy going from school to extra-curricular activity to tuitions to playground and then home to supper and bed. Breaking this routine for over a month was a challenge and people did it and in this context US-based poet Kitty O’Meara’s poem that went viral ‘And the people stayed at home’, first wrongly attributed to an Irish poet in the nineteenth century, touched the very nerve of the housebound. The poem speaks of people spending their time at home meditating, exercising, writing, painting and dancing as a way of healing, which in turn heals the world.Closer home, the hugely popular poet, none other than Gulzar, from whom people expect words of wisdom about things that bother them, has just come out with a poem for the times we are living in. It calls out to everyone to exercise restraint. The message is: Don’t swarm about like ants/Stand apart, away from each other/And let the sunshine in!Of course, the joke here in Punjab is that they have never heard of this ‘Social Distance Singh’ or for that matter ‘Kaurantine’! Young sculptor Gurjit Singh, who uses cloth as his medium and the technique of soft toys, has come out with several descriptions of the personification of coronavirus. However, what is most soothing is the heartwarming sculpture of an old man and woman sitting amidst nature surrounded by gentle love.What does the virus say?In the middle of all of this, what does Covid-19 have to say in its defence? Fiction writer Kamla Dutt sends a letter home from Atlanta, Gerogia, titled ‘Corona tells its tale.’ And thus we listen to the other side of the story in first person in defense of nature: “I am Coronavirus, a very small creature, probably living quietly in bats in caves. You snatched my caves, my jungles, my waterfalls. You think you will keep destroying me and I will silent, voiceless. No I will not…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/roundabout-just-do-it-while-you-can/story-viQ1zwtRAUwYJkfOC7TLLK.html

The body of the man, identified as Hasin Chiggu, was recovered with multiple stab wounds from near a drain below the Barapullah elevated road on Saturday morning. Police said Chiggu was murdered late on Friday night. All three suspects had been apprehended by Saturday afternoon and the knife used to kill Chiggu recovered from them,deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said. DCP Meena said the incident came to light at around 9am on Saturday, when Chiggu’s wife, Kajal, informed the police that her husband was missing. “Chiggu was a history sheeter and was involved in as many as 17 cases,” Meena said, adding that a murder case has been registered at the Hazrat Nizamuddin police station and investigations taken up. During the probe, the DCP said, police learnt that Chiggu was last seen with three-four boys of his neighbourhood on Friday night. He is said to have had a heated argument with the mother of one of the boys two days ago about placing a vegetable pushcart. “We located the suspects and confronted them. They confessed to killing Chiggu to take revenge for his behaviour with the mother of one of them,” an investigator said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-stabbed-to-death-near-hazrat-nizamuddin-three-including-two-minors-nabbed/story-sv53BnIJE3ZGIlkRJIlUkM.html
25-04-2020||Mumbai||Industrial effluents pollute Waldhuni river despite lockdown, CPCB takes cognisance||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has asked Maharashtra to conduct an investigation on industrial effluents polluting the Waldhuni river in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) during the lockdown.Vanshakti, an environment group had appealed the Supreme Court (SC) about pollution in the Waldhuni and Ulhas rivers. The group informed the CPCB that despite the lockdown being enforced, industrial discharge from units in Ambernath is polluting the river. “Industries have always abused the pollution abatement laws, and despite lockdown orders, they continue to discharge chemical effluents into Waldhuni. Even though the matter is being heard by the SC, these industries are getting a free run,” said Stalin D, director, Vanshakti.A CPCB official in-charge of water quality, requesting anonymity, said, “We have received photographic and video evidence by the SC petitioner of increasing air and water pollution at Waldhuni river due to various industries at Ambernath Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) zone. We have asked the state to investigate and submit a compliance report to us at the earliest.” The official shared a letter with HT, which was issued to the member secretary, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) with the said directions.MPCB’s regional officer SL Waghmare confirmed that violations were underway. “We are aware of rising water pollution in this zone. However, MPCB is not listed under ‘essential services’, and thus we have not been able to investigate the matter. Following CPCB directions, a team of officials will inspect which industries were functioning during the nationwide lockdown, and necessary action will be taken against them,” he said.MIDC superintendent engineer for MMR Kalidas Bandekar said, “All industries as directed under essential services such as sanitiser production etc. were functioning through the lockdown and a few other pharmaceutical industries as well. Some of them may have discharged effluents post activities but only MPCB can tell whether there was any violation.”Local residents said chemical effluent discharge at northern portions of the river had turned black. “We have taken several videos between March 23 and April 20 of trucks moving from these industries and dumping chemical waste into the river. We will provide any assistance needed to MPCB for their investigation,” said Satyajit Burman, a social activist from Ambernath. In April 2019, the bench had pulled up the Maharashtra government for its lackadaisical attitude on the condition of the rivers and directed the state’s principal secretary (environment) to oversee an improvement in water quality. During the last hearing in February, the SC bench had noted that the Ambernath civic body had completed 97% of river restoration work in the form of sewage treatment from domestic households. “The industries, however, have taken the advantage of the lockdown and polluted the river again,” said Stalin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/industrial-effluents-pollute-waldhuni-river-despite-lockdown-cpcb-takes-cognisance/story-YhRFsrGa64zrsDJNFcurxJ.html

This is a government project and there can be serious ramifications if we choose to ignore such instances,” an official of the School Education Department said.The distribution is going on smoothly in other parts of the state, he said.Education minister Partha Chatterjee had earlier said any violation of government order -- ranging from not taking safety precautions to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus to altering menu -- will invite serious action.Chatterjee, however, was not available for comment on the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/west-bengal-school-show-caused-for-giving-additional-food-items-under-midday-meal-scheme/story-Pgn38ubVr2mL8ZFnfocQFK.html

These cabs pick up those facing emergency during the lockdown and drop them home as well. The free cab service is only being provided for senior citizens, specially-abled individuals, expecting mothers etc, who are unable to secure transport for essential services. One can book this service by calling police control room on 022-28840566, 022-26457900 and 9867097665.Currently, the service is restricted to the area between Bandra and Dahisar, and police are looking for options to increase the free cab service to remaining parts of the city.A senior citizen from Kandivali was given a cab to go to a hospital in Bandra for a medical check-up that could not have been avoided. In another case, the cab service took a man from Malad (West) to Kandivali (West) to get medicines for his 94-year-old mother because the medicine was available exclusively at one chemist shop. The cab service also helped six other cancer patients to reach hospitals. Pranaya Ashok, deputy commissioner of police (operations) and Mumbai Police spokesperson said, “We will take a review. We are also looking for more options to increase the free service. If need be we may also extend it to rest parts of the city.” The service is also being extended to doctors, nurses and others involved in providing essential services.Vibhu Manya, head of enterprise mobility, Mahindra Logistics Ltd (MLL), said, “We have been receiving 250-300 calls per day on our helpline numbers. More than 100 people have availed the services in 10 days since the launch of the services in the city on April 14.” The helpline, however, does not deal with medical emergencies where an ambulance is needed. In such cases, the police intervene and try to get an ambulance. Manya confirmed that they are getting calls from other parts of Mumbai. “We are awaiting permissions from the authorities to operate in these regions. However, in serious cases like cancer or dialysis or pregnancy checkups, we work with Mumbai police to make exceptions also,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/free-cab-service-benefits-100-people-between-bandra-dahisar/story-yqdHdgUOZFENOon0afI9jN.html
25-04-2020||City||Wildbuzz: Why leopards sniff cities and change their spots||Leopard incursions into cities and villages tempt people and media to entertain erroneous notions. They believe the big cats have either got “lost and strayed” or harbour evil intentions as wolfish child lifters. But a scientific assessment of the 16 leopards rescued since 2010 in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh by the Chhatbir Zoo team led by senior veterinary officer, Dr MP Singh, throws up a pattern. Of the 16 leopards, only two were females, and that, too, sub-adults. The rest were sub-adult males, barring one large, adult specimen rescued from a cable pipe running under an Indian Air Force runway outside Chandigarh in 2012. “Sub-adults are those that have either not reached breeding age or are verging on sexual maturity. Their canines are sharp-tipped whereas adults tend to exhibit blunted canines due to extensive grappling with prey meat and bones. Sub-adults tend to move out of established domains of bigger leopards and find new territory for prey and females. It may be said that a kind of youthful ‘josh’ leads sub-adults to wander into risky zones such as human settlements for the twin purposes,” Dr Singh told this writer.I also sought a perspective from Vidya Athreya, India’s leading authority on leopard-human conflict, official consultant to state/Central governments and an exemplary field biologist. “For biological reasons, such as to avoid inbreeding, sub-adult male leopards travel very far to establish new domains. Just as within a village, marriages are prohibited to avoid inbreeding, sub-adult leopard males, too, leave their birth places and venture out as it averts breeding with their parents etc. That way, by moving outwards from the jungle’s heart towards the peripheries, they also avoid conflict with dominant leopard males and even tigers,” Athreya told this writer. A POETESS OF COVID IRONYPhotographs and videos of animals roaming the curfewed streets of Covid-19 have gone viral on social media and spurred the besieged human imagination. It has also led the more articulate to express, in art and verses, their euphoria at Nature getting a reprieve from their fellow humanity’s onslaught, however, fleeting that honeymoon may be. Young Aishwarya Sridhar (23) from Navi Mumbai is a winner of national and international awards for her documentaries, photographs and work to promote wildlife conservation and environmental awareness. Mum and Dad, Rani and Sridhar Ranganathan, are nature lovers and the family only ventures to jungles for holidays! Aishwarya is a compulsive storyteller and a wandering bard who has penned 200 poems fragrant with Nature’s wonder.Her latest poem to commemorate Earth Day (April 22) is seeped in empathy and a delicious sense of irony: “Thick Iron bars once caged me, But luckily I managed to get free, How awesome it feels to breathe fresh air, I am finally free from all despair. I cautiously placed my paws on the ground, But surprisingly the humans were not around, Till yesterday they were outside my cage, Peering...jeering...and mocking my rage. Suddenly now not even one was there, The streets were empty and totally bare, Finally I spotted them peering at me, Behind high grills like the sad monkey...Whatever the reason that traps them in, It’s a reward for their crimes and their sin, Hope at least now they will realise, That they must never torture other lives.” vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wildbuzz-why-leopards-sniff-cities-and-change-their-spots/story-jqlwdkDpW5PUnVJcV8D8PK.html

What could be safer than that?” asked Jaswinder Thukral, president of the Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association (JNSSMA).Thukral said, “The government is permitting industrialists to ferry labourers in dedicated vehicles, but even then there are chances that the virus might spread. However, it is totally safe if small industrialists run the unit situated in their own house.”He said, “Around 70% of the units registered with the JNSSMA only modified the products supplied to them by large industrial units and are paid for the job. The large industry can transport the material in and out through dedicated vehicles.”“Allowing these units to operate will help revive the small-scale industry, which is reeling under losses due to the lockdown,” said Thukral.Association seneral secretary Shavinder Singh Hunjan and senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Kalsi said, “The government should also allow small industries to function without prior permission, as obtaining it will be a tedious process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/allow-business-in-mixed-land-use-areas-ludhiana-industrialists-urge-punjab-govt/story-IXywLC1FC1HiSlH7udF92J.html

25-04-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news amid coronavirus lockdown||DOES MESSAGE ON THE ROAD DRIVE HOME THE POINT?The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation’s latest move to paint the city roads with corona messages has left Chandigarhians divided. After mayor Raj Bala Malik shared one such photo on Twitter, a user, Sandeep Kumar, applauded the initiative and added that similar marking should be done on inner roads of sectors. Another user, Balvinder Singh, termed it “a useless publicity stunt” and waste of public money, particularly when there was no one on the roads during the lockdown. The MC’s aim was to appeal to people to stay safe indoors. IN CORONA TIMES, MOHALI COUNCILLORS BID ADIEU ONLINE There were no hugs and camaraderie when the term of the Mohali municipal corporation ended. Councillors complained that Covid-19 had even robbed them of the chance to bid a proper adieu as the meet was held via video-conference on Saturday. City mayor Kulwant Singh admitted, “We never imagined our five-year term will get over like this. Anyway, we hope to win again and return to the House.” WHEN SOCIAL DISTANCING WENT FOR A TOSS AT PARIDA’S MEETUT adviser Manoj Parida was invited to inaugurate the residents’ initiative to seal Sector 40 the other day, but social distancing went for a toss as soon as he arrived. The residents were keen to interact with the adviser and the police had a tough time trying to control the situation. Media personnel also milled around, clicking pictures. Safety anyone?COPS, MEDIA FORGET TO KEEP THE DISTANCEOld habits die hard. Social distancing is forgotten every time the media and police come together for a press conference, even in these challenging times. Chandigarh director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Baniwal and SSP Nilambari Jagadale were at Jama Masjid in Sector 20 on Friday to distribute small carpets (mausala) and dates on the eve of the holy month of Ramzan. The senior police officers and journalists were seen interacting with each other without keeping the preventive measures in mind. ‘APNA TIME AAEGA’: MESSAGE ON THE MASKWe are dealing with a health emergency that has shaken the world. Countries are under lockdown and everyone is grappling to control the spread of coronavirus. Masks, which help control the spread of the virus, have become a part of our attire. While different kinds of face masks have flooded the market, home-made ones are preferred. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore have advised people to wear home-made masks. Some people are going a step ahead by decorating their newest accessory by painting it and affixing colourful laces. A youngster at a local dispensary the other day, stole the thunder with his mask that read: “Apna time aaega (Our time will come)”. WHEN PGIMER ADMINISTRATION HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEFThe authorities at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, heaved a sigh of relief after 54 healthcare workers, including 18 doctors, tested negative for Covid-19. The medics were posted at the intensive care unit of the institute’s advanced paediatric centre where a pre-operative test on six-month-old girl for Covid-19 turned out positive. The institute had earlier drawn flak from the employees’ union for ‘negligence’ after two healthcare workers in the suspected patients ward tested positive. UT adviser Manoj Parida also tweeted in support of the PGIMER administration, stating that the institute’s top brass is hurt by the criticism. However, in a reply to a tweet asking him to take charge of the autonomous institute under the Disaster Management Act, he replied that he will do so if things do not improve.

The residents’ response followed soon after the district police wrote a Facebook post, inviting people to share how they spend their time at home during the lockdown. In the post, the residents have been asked to send the videos and pictures of their activities to cpludhianacovid@gmail.com and the same are being shared by the district police in their comments section. “Would you like us to share your videos, photos or articles that could motivate other people to relieve stress during corona times. They may be regarding lifestyle tips during corona, immunity building tips, happiness in lockdown, usefulness of home medicines and anything to spread happiness,” the post read.Not only this, the cops are even responding to the comments written by the residents.

Later, after the move was criticised by residents under lockdown for a month, services of plumbers, electricians and airconditioner repair/servicemen were allowed.The UT’s containment order states that curfew imposed from March 24 will continue and industries as well as the IT sector will remain closed up to May 3 even though they are facing heavy losses with layoffs as the curfew extends into the second month.UT authorities say sealing of select spots as done by other states, including Haryana, is not feasible as cases are scattered around the city.Construction of roads, irrigation, building and industrial projects including those of MSMEs in rural areas; restarting work in construction projects within municipal corporation limits could have been allowed if the entire city had not been declared a containment zone.Selected sealing of certain areas could have been one way out as the city’s economy is expected to suffer the consequences more severely now should businesses remain closed up to May 3 or even further.Another major impact will be that people needing medical care from neighbouring areas too will not be able to enter the city during medical emergencies.Technically, a containment zone is spread around three kilometers with a buffer zone of five and seven kilometers for urban and rural areas, respectively. “But, in case of Chandigarh it was not possible as the cases of outbreak of Covid-19 are scattered, non-contiguous and sporadic,” Manoj Kumar Parida, UT adviser, has said.Is this a wise move?

25-04-2020||Mumbai||Elghar Parishad case: Dr Anand Teltumbde denied interim bail, sent to judicial custody||The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Saturday remanded activist Dr Anand Teltumbde to judicial custody till May 8 and rejected his plea for interim bail.Teltumbde was arrested by NIA on April 14 after he surrendered before the agency in Mumbai and was in NIA custody since then. On Saturday he was produced before the special court, where he was remanded to judicial custody.Soon after he was remanded in judicial custody, Teltumbde’s lawyers moved an application for interim bail on the grounds that there is a risk of him getting infected with Covid-19. The lawyers submitted that Teltumbde was suffering from respiratory problems and there was a risk of him contracting the coronavirus in jail. The plea was objected by the NIA.The NIA has contended that the activist of Kabir Kala Manch gave “provocative presentation” and speeches on December 31, 2017, during an event at Shaniwarwada, Pune, which led to violence resulting in the loss of life and statewide agitation.Further, the agency has claimed that Teltumbde was the convener of the program, and his call data records established that he was in touch with the other arrested accused who were present at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elghar-parishad-case-dr-anand-teltumbde-denied-interim-bail-sent-to-judicial-custody/story-P49ehctnjv6kccQT0OL3vK.html

25-04-2020||City||Amid curfew duty, police continue hitting drug smugglers hard in Tarn Taran||Besides ensuring strict enforcement of the curfew amid the coronavirus outbreak, the Tarn Taran police are also doing its best to “break the backbone” of the drug smugglers in the district, which is among the worst drug-hit districts of Punjab.The border district’s police have freezed the assets of 16 drug smugglers, worth ₹8.6 crore, in the last one month. Besides, the police have prepared eight new cases for freezing property worth ₹16 crore belonging to various drug smugglers, including those from Havelian village, which is situated at a stone’s throw distance from India Pakistan border.The property of the smugglers is being seized on the order of the competent authority (CA) — A statutory authority under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976 — and under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.On Tuesday, the police seized the property of two “major drug smugglers”—Narinder Singh of Chinna Bidhi Chand village and Jagtar Singh of Dall village (both border villages). Jagtar was arrested in 2012 with 21-kg heroin while Narinder was arrested in 2015 with 5-kg heroin. Their agricultural land measuring around 5-acre each, residential houses, a tractor were among the assets seized by the police.“Though we have been engaged in enforcing curfew and ensuring the delivery of daily meal and ration to the poor people, but we are also considering the drug menace in the district as another big challenge. We don’t want to give any chance to the drug paddlers and breaking their back bone is our prime motive,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruv Dahiya.He said, “In total, till now, we have seized the property of 51 drug smugglers, worth ₹54.46 crore. Our teams are working hard to identify many more cases of the drug smugglers. We are thinking that this is the best way to break the supply chain not only in the border area but also in Punjab.”Sources said among the new prepared cases, one is of a notorious smuggler belonging to Havelian village. “We have identified the property of the Havelian village’s smuggler in Jalandhar and Mohali, which is worth over ₹4 crore. His name will be disclosed once we get the order to freeze his property from New Delhi,” said another senior police official.Superintendent of police (SP-headquarters), Jagjit Singh Walia, said, “We are ensuring the seizure of those all drug peddlers who are caught with commercial quantity of heroin.”Earlier in March, the police had seized around six marriage palaces after finding their owners involvement in drug peddling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-curfew-duty-police-continue-hitting-drug-smugglers-hard-in-tarn-taran/story-Zb4a0wsmEyf3ZIvH0nFpLI.html
25-04-2020||City||Random Forays: The battle between cynics and realists||It is not only at this point in history, when we have been accosted by a pandemic which hitherto existed only in the darkest of nightmares, that cynicism has reared its loathsome head. Cynics have always gone to town bandying about the gravest of information and the most sinister of portents. They heed no whiff of optimism or glad tidings. They shrug off, as foolhardy day dreaming, any attempt to convince them that the wheel of mankind’s fortune will turn once more.At times like these, when everyone is ultra-panicky and on tenterhooks anyway, cynics would do well to consider drawing upon whatever reserves of humaneness they have left within them. But they continue to occupy themselves solely with forecasts of gloom and doom; forever fanning the fire of pessimism and predicting disaster. A WhatsApp forward which portrays the worst case scenario finds their favour easily and they shoot it off like trigger happy snipers. Any social media message which is more balanced and better analysed might not find their favour at all.Cynics keep veering towards bad news perhaps because their own insecurities are too hot for them to handle. The goodness of mankind is rarely evident in society, but new heroes do come forth to serve others passionately when the going gets tough. Cynics do not recognise even them, alas! Belittling others comes easily to them. As Oscar Wilde said, “A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing”.The damage that such people cause to society in times of global or national crisis, is unimaginable. Already, hordes of people have succumbed to paranoia and depression, during the present situation. When they read, hear or watch news which further enhances their gloominess, they sink even lower into their negative mind pools. And a cynic at home or one who is only a call away will shatter whatever will power and resolve they have left within them.A recent study of social media posts, supported by the University of South Carolina, indicates clearly that severe depression and proclivity towards substance abuse are increasing during the present pandemic. Only counselling and conversations with psychologists, and with well meaning volunteers, will enable such people to buck the trend.Realists, on the other hand, speak with conviction based on information which is authentic. They will not eschew stark facts but will buttress their analyses with statistics which provide counter balancing arguments. Every scenario has two sides to it. There is never a night so dark that the morning sun cannot dispel. Shades of grey exist in every human situation. The realist will fear the worst too, at times, but will always bank upon possible breakthroughs to give him and his ilk the strength that is needed.Mindless bravado and forced optimism will not do either, when a practical approach is required. The current situation and many others in life require in-depth awareness to decide on a course of action. Governments, for instance, cannot afford to put a foot wrong at all, and must proceed with caution above everything else. However, a true administrator will spot dangers as well as silver linings while preparing himself or herself and strategise the way forward accordingly.Tackling a human problem at a mass scale requires leadership of vision and fortitude, pragmatism and foresight. Even when the enemy is unseen and treacherous, leaders have to surge forward with whatever resources they have at their command. They must appear to be calm even at the worst of times and even if they themselves have a sinking feeling within. Heads of families cannot, similarly, let their guard down and cause their kinsfolk to slump into sadness. They have to be largely cheerful and at least appear to be unshakable in their conviction that all will be well. Only then will their flock endeavour to see the glimmer of light that inevitably will shine one day.The battle between the cynics and the realists will continue beyond pandemics and pandemonium. It does take all kinds to make the world, after all. Humanity will survive, and flourish once more. And the sun will continue to shine brightly, even upon the cynics.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/random-forays-the-battle-between-cynics-and-realists/story-17hoHmMXS6aZTDk0njDBdO.html
25-04-2020||Chandigarh||Congress demands to bring back stranded Himachalis||Congress has demanded that the state government should bring back all its residents stuck in cities like Delhi and Chandigarh.In a statement issued here, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary and former urban development minister Sudhir Sharma said that hundreds of Himachal residents were stuck in Delhi, Chandigarh and other cities due to the lockdown imposed in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.Most of these are either students, Sharma said adding that these people come from humble backgrounds and were facing difficulties due to lack of resources.“It was quite strange that instead of evacuating these people, the state government gave priority to students stranded in Kota of Rajasthan,” said Sharma.“Congress is not against bringing back students from Kota but the government should also have taken initiative to evacuate other stranded residents,” he added.The former minister said that the government was lacking in communicating with the public. He also slammed education minister Suresh Bhardwaj for being indecisive.He said that amid lockdown, private schools are charging fees from students which shows that state government has no control over private schools. He said that education minister earlier had stated that private schools will not charge any fee but later he stated that private schools will take a decision at their own level on this issue as the government cannot force them.He said that the minister’s changing statements have caused problems for the parents. The Congress leader said that while some schools have voluntarily waived off fees for at least three months, others have been demanding a fee in the name of online education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/congress-demands-to-bring-back-stranded-himachalis/story-lJIC3prP0SGkEkwVNdjJ6J.html
25-04-2020||Lucknow||UP govt defers six allowances, freezes DA||The Uttar Pradesh government has put on hold for one year as many as six allowances payable to different categories of officers and employees in the current financial year, an official said. It also decided to follow the Centre’s decision to freeze the dearness allowance (DA) up to June 30, 2021. These steps were prompted by a decline in the state government’s revenue following the Covid-19 lockdown and the need for funds to fight the pandemic. The measures will lead to a saving of about Rs 12,000 crore till June-end next year, officials said.The six categories of allowances that have been deferred from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 include city compensatory allowance, secretariat allowance, special allowance given to CB-CID, anti-corruption organisation, economic offences wing, vigilance establishment, security and special investigation wing, the special allowance paid to junior engineers, research allowance, orderly allowance and design allowance paid in the public works department, along with investigation and planning and orderly allowance paid to officers and employees working with the irrigation department. None of these allowances are paid to central government employees.“A sum of about Rs 1500 crore will be saved in 2020-2021 by the decision to defer payment of six categories of allowances. A sum of about Rs 7500 crore is likely to be saved in 2020-2021 on payment of DA (if calculated on the basis of 4% increase). If the same rate of DA increase is calculated for the remaining months of 2021-2022 (up to June 30, 2021), the total saving is likely to cross the Rs 12,000 crore mark following the decision to freeze DA,” said a senior officer.In an order dated April 24, 2020, additional chief secretary, finance, Sanjiv Mittal, said: “The Uttar Pradesh government’s revenue has come down following the Covid-19 lockdown. At the same time in view of the decision to make funds available to carry out works to check spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, I have been directed to say the governor is pleased to defer the following allowances approved by any previous government order for employees of the state government, teaching and non-teaching employees of the basic education board and aided educational institutions and those working with autonomous bodies.” In another order with regard to payment of DA to state government employees and dearness relief to pensioners, Mittal said no additional instalment of DA and dearness relief will be paid from January 1, 2020, July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021. No arrear of DA or dearness relief will be paid from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021, he said, referring to the declining revenue of the state government following lockdown due to Covid-19. Meanwhile, UP State Employees’ Joint Council has opposed the state government’s move. Employees’ council chairman JN Tiwari said the decision would affect about 20 lakh state government employees. He urged the chief minister to cut a day’s salary every month for UP Covid Care Fund, instead of deferring the payment of allowances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-defers-six-allowances-freezes-da/story-Pum9tOQy1dVwqwbDkVUX7J.html

He sleeps in the police post and reaches out to his family only through phone calls.Like them, life is not easy for around 4,000 police personnel working day and night to fight the Covid-19 pandemic in the city. From ensuring implementation of the curfew, apprehending curfew violators, ensuring social distancing at the vegetable and grain markets and maintaining the daily law and order, they do it all without a frown.Kumar is deployed at the check point near BRS Nagar crossing on Ferozepur Road. Works starts at 6am and continues till 6pm. “When I enter the house, I put my uniform in a separate bucket. I wash my hands and face and then go straight to my room, where I have been isolating myself since the Covid-19 outbreak. These are hard steps but bring some degree of peace of mind,” he says.We do take all precautions at work, he says, but we interact with several people daily and also check their documents. “So, the risk of infection always looms large,” he adds.ASI Indraj, who is at work for 15 hours daily from 5am to 8pm on Barewal Road, says he hails from Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan. “I live here alone. My wife is in Sri Ganganagar and son in Delhi. So, I contact them through phone. I eat the two meals in the day at the check post and dinner at the police post where I also sleep,” he says, adding that he gets one day off every week, which is not enough to travel back home.My son encourages me, keeps a tab on whether I am taking precautions and keeps me updated about latest news, he says.Additional station house officer (SHO) Simranjeet Kaur of Shimlapuri police station says her father takes pride in her work. “He comes out with the disinfectant spray and sanitises my vehicle every time I reach home from work. I wash my uniform daily and also sanitise my shoes, belt and badges,” she says.Head constable Sohan Dass, 50, who works in the PCR team, sometimes works for 24 hours at a stretch before he can rest for the next 24 hours. “Back home in Dakha village, my neighbours appreciate my work. I create awareness among them about coronavirus and urge them to take all precautions,” he says. To ensure his wife and daughters are safe, he eats alone, he says, adding there’s nothing to feel bad about, as it was better to take precautions now than feel regretful later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/policing-gets-tougher-during-the-pandemic/story-fEhTtBlwHLVhRacAj1lMqK.html

There was no pediatric surgeon available in the civil hospitals of Pathankot as well,” said defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand.“Surgical specialist of the military hospital Major Adil Abdul Kalam performed the intricate and challenging operation of opening up the abdomen of the newborn baby who was on a ventilator. This is for the first time in the Armed Forces Medical Services wherein such an intricate operation on a newborn was performed at a zonal hospital with no pediatric surgeon, pediatric anesthesiologist or neonatologist,” said Col Anand.The operation was performed in an emergency which even if delayed by a few minutes could have resulted in exacerbation of multi-organ failure, leading to death.The doctor said that it was an extremely challenging and stressful task to manage the case successfully despite the absence of super-specialty facilities.“Performing the intricate surgery in the intestines of the newborn with associated generalised septic infection was technically arduous and grueling but the team of doctors and nurses had effectively carried out the surgery last week and now the baby is out of ventilator, tolerating breastfeeds and is on the way to a healthy recovery,” the spokesperson quoted Dr Kalam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/doctors-at-pathankot-military-hospital-perform-rare-surgery-on-newborn/story-dxcrMnePg1cVst4JPXYZNI.html

25-04-2020||Chandigarh||Essentials dispatched to snow-covered Gurez Valley in Kashmir||Days after the residents of the snow-covered Gurez valley in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district complained of shortage of essential commodities, the district administration on Saturday ordered that essential items be supplied to the area.Bandipora deputy commissioner (DC) Shahbaz Ahmad Mirza, in an order issued on Saturday, constituted a two-member committee to oversee the process and coordinate the movement of vehicles carrying essential goods to Gurez.“Bandipora handloom assistant director Shariq Iqbal and district floriculture officer Tariq Habib will coordinate and make arrangements,” read the order. Gurez sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Mudasir Ahmad said the supply of essential commodities began from Saturday. “We sent two vehicles with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and four vehicles with diesel,” he said.“We will be supplying vegetables, fruits, ration and other essential items among the residents on Sunday,” he said, adding that 20 vehicles will be dispatched for the same.The order also specifies that the officers should ensure that no Covid-19 carrier enters the valley as no Covid-19 case has been reported from the valley. “Our teams have been screening drivers bearing essential commodities for the residents,” the SDM said. The SDM said the tehsil has been facing an acute shortage of essential commodities due to closure of the road between Gurez and Bandipora. “The administration is making all efforts to mitigate their suffering,” he said.The DC has also asked deputed officers to make arrangements for evacuating locals stranded outside Gurez valley. The 86-km Bandipora-Gurez Road reopened to traffic on April 17 after remaining closed for four months due to accumulation of snow at Razdan Pass, at an altitude of 11,672 ft. The pass recorded snow accumulation up to 35 feet.

Although it does have its own shortcomings, like the recipient could have a reaction to the donor’s plasma, or plasma fusion could not be effective as a treatment.“ Right now only critical patients will receive this treatment and only at Sasson Hospital in Pune. We are trying to expand this to other hospitals too, the approval is awaited,” he said.A senior doctor from Sassoon, requesting anonymity, said, “The blood is checked for serum protein which has to be more than a particular anti-body, the rapid anti-bodies and neutralizing anti-body tighters have to be detected. We usually go for healthy and young patients who do not have any other health ailments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-s-sassoon-hospital-to-soon-start-clinical-trials-for-plasma-therapy/story-wvwf52NwZSqCbmRq8GtYtL.html
25-04-2020||Pune||More positive cases emerge as testing is stepped up in Pune district, say officials||From 200 tests in the first week of April to 889 tests as of Thursday, the Pune district administration has attributed the high rise in the number of positive cases to more testing of suspected people in high risk areas.Currently Pune’s testing rate stands at 979 tests per million for the district. The city saw 104 positive cases on Thursday, the highest in one day.According to the district health office, 189 tests were done in 24 hours as of April 9. The testing rate in the city went up as the number of positive cases went up with more contact tracing. As of April 24, 889 tests were done in 24 hours. As of Thursday, a total of 9,204 tests were done in the district since the outbreak of the virus.About the 104 positive cases detected on a single day, District collector Naval Kishore Ram said that more cases only means that more testing is going on and there is no need to panic. He said there was a rise in the number of women being infected of Covid-19 which is why people must take more care.“Do not venture out of the house repeatedly even for essential items, stock them. Social distancing should be followed and any symptoms of flu--be it mild or negligible-- should be reported immediately to the flu clinics set by the civic body,” he said. With pool testing approved for the state, the test rate in the state is expected to go higher. State health minister Rajesh Tope tweeted on Friday that the central health ministry has approved pool testing for the state.The Indian council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) advisory on feasibility of using pooled samples for molecular testing of Covid-19 states that ‘a pooled testing algorithm involves the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) screening of a specimen pool comprising multiple individual patient specimens, followed by individual testing (pool deconvolution) only if a pool screens positive. As all individual samples in a negative pool are regarded as negative, it results in substantial cost savings when a large proportion of pools tests negative.’The advisory suggests that pooling of more than five samples is not recommended to avoid the effect of dilution leading to false negatives, especially in areas or population with positivity rates of more than 5% for Covid-19, considering higher possibility of missing positive samples with low viral load, except in research mode.Currently testing labs in PuneGovernment labs testing samples in Pune· National Institute of Virology, Pune· Armed Forces Medical College, Pune· BJ Medical College, PuneNational AIDS Research Institute, Pune National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune Private labs approved by ICMR· A.G.

The experienced stumper’s parents, who live in their Ward No.31 Shaktigarh area house in Siliguri, are at present staying with their son in Kolkata.“We live next to them. In the wee hours of Friday, my son heard a noise and alerted me. It was around 2-2:30 a.m. in the night. We immediately rushed out and turned on the light. They fled hearing us. They had a car, we could not see the car clearly,” Saha’s uncle, Malay, told IANS on Saturday.“We informed the police and they were quick to the spot. They even came yesterday (Friday afternoon) to check on us. A similar incident had happened few days back also. We did not pay heed then,” he added.They are yet to lodge an FIR. “We will lodge the FIR on Sunday. The police commissioner said he will be at the NJP police station so we will do it then,” Malay said.Saha’s parents had come to visit him and wife Romi before the lockdown was announced last month, and could not go back to Siliguri due to the situation.The seasoned wicketkeeper, rated as one of the finest in the world, was back in the Indian Test team after nursing a finger injury which he picked up during the pink-ball Test against Bangladesh last November. Saha, who has played 37 Tests for India, was not part of the first XI for the two Tests in New Zealand with Rishabh Pant getting the nod ahead of him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/miscreants-attempt-to-rob-stumper-saha-s-siliguri-home-says-relative/story-tRusZSKZV1FBBTmYrEWIlO.html

25-04-2020||Mumbai||Sena takes dig at Raj Thackeray over his demand to reopen wine shops||The Shiv Sena on Saturday took a dig at MNS president Raj Thackeray over his demand to restart wine shops in Maharashtra to boost revenues, and sought to know whether he was really concerned about the state’s treasury.It said that Raj Thackeray should know that due to the lockdown not just the wine shops, but even the liquor factories are shut.“You don’t get revenue just by starting the shops. The government gets revenue in the form of excise andsales tax when a distributor purchases the product from the factories.In order to start these units, workers are required. Besides, if the shops re-open, no social distancing will be followed,” the party said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.Raj Thackeray, in a letter to the Chief Minister’s Officer (CMO) on Thursday, had said that allowing wine shops to remain open does not mean trying to cater to the needs of alcohol consumers, but to ensure revenue inflow during difficult times.He had also called for allowing hotels and kitchens providing affordable foods to run saying that as a big chunk of Maharashtras population is dependent on them.The Uddhav Thackeray-led party, however, mocked the MNS chief for demanding reopening of liquor shops and eateries together.“Through his demand, he has pointed it out to the government that like food, alcohol is an essential commodity.He has given invaluable information that as a rice plate is important for people,they are also dependent on ‘quarter’ and ‘peg’,” it said.It sought to know whether he has made the demand out of the concern for the state’s revenues or on behalf of the tipplers.“The opposition leaders should advise the government on how to improve the economic situation in times of crisis, but the leader of opposition hasn’t been able to do so,” the ruling party said without naming Devendra Fadnavis.“Raj Thackeray has put forward the plight of the poor and the less privileged people and a section of the society will bless him for that. But the government will have to take a decision considering the overall situation,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sena-takes-dig-at-raj-thackeray-over-his-demand-to-reopen-wine-shops/story-LogXxFunLPPNvYrZMMVEOI.html

He said, “All schools and book distributors are instructed to wait till the district administration issue an advisory and chalks out plan for sale and distribution of books.”Meanwhile, Private Schools and Children Welfare Association (PSCWA) wrote a letter to chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday seeking permission to open schools for distribution of books.National president of PSCWA Shamael Ahmad, said, “Schools have drastically shifted to online teaching but children are not habituated to study online. E-study material cannot subdue the importance of textbooks and prolong use of mobile and computer is impacting the health of children. Reopening of educational institutes is still uncertain. In the given condition, availability of textbooks would help the students learn better and utilise their time efficiently at home. ‘‘“We request the state government to give relaxation to schools for reopening for a short period for books distribution purpose. Schools will strictly follow sanitisation and social distancing norm”, added Ahmad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/students-facing-problem-in-online-learning-without-textbooks/story-kJWIsyam31p6Sr6NJs0VJL.html

The state had breached the 2,000- mark on Friday.The border state has so far reported 32 deaths due to Covid-19. Capital city Jaipur, with 18 fatalities, accounts for the maximum virus deaths.“As many as 25 fresh cases have been reported in six districts of the state. However, the growth rate curve of coronavirus cases in state has flattened,” Additional Chief Secretary (Health) Rohit Kumar Singh said on Saturday, reports news agency PTI.Of the 25 fresh cases, eight were reported from Ajmer, five each from Jodhpur and Jhalawar, four from Kota, two in Dholpur, and one in Dungarpur, said Singh.Rajasthan’s Covid-19 related mortality rate is 1.43 which ranks the state at 15th spot at the national level, according to state health minister Raghu Sharma.The minister said that the state is introducing aggressive testing. “We’re purchasing Cobos 8800 machines, which will increase the daily testing capacity of both Jaipur and Jodhpur to 3,000,” he said.Till date, 691 patients have recovered from coronavirus infection in the state, of whom 198 have been discharged from hospitals.Meanwhile, the state is gearing up to introduce convalescent plasma therapy to critical Covid-19 patients at Jaipur’s SMS hospital and has sought permission from the ICMR to begin trials.The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those infected. The therapy can also be used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contracts.“In absence of any vaccine or antiviral agents to treat coronavirus, plasma therapy could prove beneficial in critical patients and reduce the mortality, said Dr Sunita Bundas, blood bank incharge at the SMS hospital in Jaipur.She said doctors at the hospital who have recovered from the infection can become donors for COVID-19 patients.“The process has not yet begun. We are hopeful of getting ICMR approval. Then when we have a needy, critical patient, we will start the therapy.”Delhi, Karnataka and Kerala have already started plasma therapy trials while Maharashtra is awaiting ICMR’s nod to initiate the process.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-s-covid-19-cases-rise-to-2-059-state-gears-up-for-plasma-therapy-trials/story-qk8mRtgoehjAPejJzl45GL.html

In the video, the constables can be heard telling the caretaker and a local resident that “Azaan ke liye bhi mana kar diya hai LG saab ne (The Lieutenant Governor has banned Azaan as well)”.Delhi L-G Anil Baijal, in a tweet on Friday, said Ramzan should be observed while following the lockdown norms, and made a reference to Delhi Police instructions for the same.About an hour before Baijal’s statement, the Delhi Police had tweeted: “Azaan may be carried out in accordance with NGT [National Green Tribunal] guidelines,” along with other rules. By the evening, though, the L-G tweeted that disciplinary action had been initiated against the erring police personnel. “Disciplinary action is being taken against the erring police officials. Appeal to observe the holy month of Ramzan as per the advisory given below to stay safe and follow lockdown in your, and public interest. Stay home, stay safe,” he added.Sisodia tweeted, “There is no restriction on Azaan. In a lockdown, there is a complete ban on the gathering of people for prayers in mosques or for worship etc. at any religious place.”According to deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pramod Kumar Mishra, the constables in the video were confused between the meaning of “Azaan” and “Namaaz”. “We have removed the two policemen from the beat. There is no ban on Azaan. However, the gathering of people in any religious establishment for prayers is banned to maintain social distancing,” Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-ban-on-azaan-but-must-adhere-to-lockdown-norms-say-baijal-sisodia/story-c1K6YprQdTzTa81y0kJTfJ.html

Plasma therapy has been administered to four Covid-19 patients admitted in a city hospital whose condition seems to be improving, Kejriwal said.“The initial results are very promising and I would request those who have recovered from corona infection to come and donate their plasma,” Kejriwal told reporters via video conference. He added: “Many of you must have donated blood for dengue; for that too we do not take the blood, only the platelets are taken out and the rest of the blood goes back to your body. This is the same thing, we will just take out the plasma. You can save the life of a patient. We will call you for donation, we will arrange transport, and we will ensure that you are not harmed in any way.” Convalescent plasma therapy uses a blood component called plasma -- which contains the virus-fighting antibodies – from people who have recovered from the infection to treat those who are severely ill with Covid-19.Lok Nayak Hospital is the first Delhi government hospital to administer the therapy. Plasma therapy trials are also being conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in Delhi. Max Hospital in Saket also administered the therapy to a Covid-19 patient on ventilator on compassionate grounds, who was later weaned off ventilator support and is improving. Among other centres, the trials are under way at the Department of Biotechnology’s Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology in Kerala, which was the first to start them, and King George Medical University, Lucknow, where they started on Friday.So far, 2,376 people have been infected and 50 have died of the coronavirus infection in Delhi.Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi’s biggest Covid-19 facility, in collaboration with the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences received permission to conduct a randomised control trial from the Indian Council of Medical Research and the drug regulatory body Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) last week.“This therapy is not new, it has been used for several other diseases before. We are conducting a trial for the effectiveness of this treatment in Covid-19 cases. The trial will include ten patients who receive the therapy and should be completed within the next 10 or 15 days,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, which chooses the donors and conducts the plasmapheresis process to derive the blood plasma for treatment.The processThe first patient to receive the therapy was a 60-year-old man admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital. He was not on ventilator, but had low oxygen saturation of 85%, a condition that indicates his organs were not receiving an adequate amount of oxygen. The normal oxygen saturation for healthy individuals is between 95% and 100%.His respiratory rate was also high at 30 per minute – meaning he was breathing rapidly. The normal respiratory rate is 12 to 20 breaths per minute in adults. He was administered plasma therapy on Tuesday.“His respiratory rate has come down to 20 per minute and the oxygen saturation has improved to 98%. The patient is likely to be moved out of the ICU today. And, there have been similar improvements in the condition of the other patients who received the therapy as well. This is promising,” said Kejriwal.The doctors are performing a randomised control trial of 20 patients, where half of them will get the plasma and the other half will get a placebo (devoid of any therapeutic value).“We do not know who among these four patients received the plasma and who received the placebo. Only after the trial is complete we will be able to analyse the results. The first two patients have been taken off oxygen support and are now able to ingest food. They will likely be shifted out of the ICU tomorrow. We are observing the other two patients who received the therapy yesterday,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, principal investigator and head of the plasma therapy project at Lok Nayak hospital.The patients are given two plasma transfusions of about 250 ml each over two days. Another patient who was to receive plasma therapy on Tuesday died before it could be administered. Two other recipients have been identified by the hospital. So far, seven plasma donations have been done and eight to 10 other donors being screened.The CM said Delhi would apply for wider use of the therapy in all severe patients admitted in Delhi hospitals. “For now, we have the permission from the central government to perform a limited trial only on serious patients in Lok Nayak hospital. They had asked us for the results of the limited trial to grant permission for the use of the therapy in others. Next week, we will apply for plasma therapy for all serious patients in Delhi,” said Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/initial-plasma-therapy-results-promising-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal/story-u49Xrec7lxLeGzpnstWnoI.html

MC commissioner said the information generated through different applications downloaded by people during quarantine and information on vendor movement generated through GPS application given to them will be collated and analysed. “Similarly, all calls made to 112 and MC helpline numbers will be processed and mapped as per area and problems. This will allow us to prepare better strategy in dealing with people’s problems,” he said, adding that the live feed from CCTV cameras installed across the city will be also be monitored at the centre.Yadav further said the formats for information submission had been shared with the health and police departments. “Information related to the Covid-19 management provided by these departments will be also be geographically mapped and analysed at the centre,” he added.TIMINGS FOR HOME DELIVERYFor opening of shops strictly for home delivery of essential commodities by the shopkeepers and other online delivery agencies such as Zomato and Swiggy, the timings for grocery/kiryana, meat and fish, fruit and vegetable will be from 9am to 9pm. For shops providing milk and eggs, the timings will be 5am to 9pm. These timings are only for shopkeepers and other online agencies and not for general public. For general public, the timing are from 10am to 2pm.SPECIAL DRIVE FOR MODEL JAILThe administration started a special drive for examining prisoners for coronavirus disease at Model Jail, Burail, on Friday.In the daily review meeting, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said, “A special drive is being conducted for examining the inmates at Burail Jail to contain the spread of Covid-19 on the jail premises.”There are 1,007 inmates against the sanctioned strength of 1,120 in the prison. Visitors were banned entry in the jail in March in view of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-sets-up-new-centre-for-covid-19-management/story-EfL2z31FANt21WmAR5dtTN.html

25-04-2020||Chandigarh||Authorised Covid-19 volunteers to assist police in Chandigarh||The UT administration will be using the services of “authorised Covid-19 volunteers” (ACV) to enforce compliance with regards to the curfew restrictions and social distancing norms in Chandigarh.A standard operating procedure to appoint the ACVs for selection and placement was laid down on Friday, which stipulates mandatory screening by the health department and registration.In the daily review meeting on Thursday, Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore directed the administration to involve representatives and volunteers to enforce social distancing and to maintain the sealing of various colonies and areas in the city.“Individual volunteers, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), resident welfare associations (RWAs), or any other association willing to work as an ACV to motivate the citizens to comply with the guidelines issued by the administration shall get themselves registered with the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) concerned by means of an application and send it to the email IDs of SDM central, south and east,” read the standard operating procedure (SOP).“These ACVs will only assist the police and administration. They will not be allowed to perform any official duty. None of these registered ACVs will be allowed to seal the main road (entry or exit points) by barricades at their own level. These ACVs will work only under the supervision of the local police and the administration and strictly as per the approved plan and duty chart,” the SOP stated.“In case, the conduct of any ACV is found improper, he or she shall be removed immediately. The work done by these ACVs will be treated as only voluntary for all means and purposes,” it stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/authorised-covid-19-volunteers-to-assist-police-in-chandigarh/story-JtbLXaXq6EJCPhQJzGlxNO.html

25-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration prepares list of works to be completed on priority post lockdown||After losing the first month of the new financial year 2020-2021 to the curfew, the UT administration is now prioritising works it must focus on once the restrictions imposed for containing the spread of coronavirus are lifted.Implementation of the smart grid project and road recarpeting will be on the administration’s priority list after the curfew ends. Projects that were approved last year, and for which the tendering process had already started, will be given priority post lockdown.At present, a skeleton staff is attending office, while most are working from home. Many new projects slated to begin this financial year had to be put on hold.UT finance secretary Ajoy Kumar Sinha said, “Implementation of the smart grid system, city-wide installation of smart meters, and the completion of road recarpeting work will be taken up immediately after restrictions are relaxed or removed.”The ₹200-crore smart grid project envisages a power supply management that utilises information technology-based methods to reduce transmission and distribution losses. The new grid will also allow consumers to track their power consumption online. The administration has set up a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) centre in Sector 18. The UT electricity department will also install smart meters in around 30,000 houses in the city.ROAD RE-CARPETING ALSO PRIORITYThe UT engineering department had come under severe criticism for the bad conditions of roads under its jurisdiction. Even though it started the recarpeting work in late February, it had to suspend because of unseasonal rains and later, due to the pandemic.“Tendering to allot the recarpeting work was completed, but the allotment was postponed because of the lockdown. Departments are working on tender documents for other projects as well, even as most of the staff work from home. These will be floated after the lockdown ends,” said Sinha.Stating that the time lost because of the lockdown could be easily made up for in the coming months, Sinha added, “The administration is working on a plan to ensure that all pending projects can be put back on track.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-prepares-list-of-works-to-be-completed-on-priority-post-lockdown/story-9dACoyUB8YjZBwWw05oVvI.html

25-04-2020||Chandigarh||Spurt and slowdown, Chandigarh tricity area’s coronavirus tally saw it all||In the first month of the lockdown since March 23, the number of Covid-19 cases in the tricity towns of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula grew from 13 to 109, an eightfold increase.The country’s tally, on the other hand, was 500, which has now gone up to 24,434 cases, a whopping spike of 48 times.While the first three weeks saw an exponential increase in the cases across the tricity as well, the cases slowed down in the fourth week, especially in Chandigarh.Mohali now has the maximum number of cases at 63, followed by Chandigarh at 28 and Panchkula at 18.Tricity’s first case was reported in Chandigarh on March 18 when a 23-year-old woman, who had returned from England, tested positive. When Punjab announced the curfew on March 23, Mohali had reported five cases. Chandigarh announced the curfew a day later on March 24 when the number of cases was seven. Panchkula’s lockdown kicked in the same day, with just one case, making the tricity count 13 at that point.Thereon, the first week of the lockdown till March 30 saw the three cities reporting eight more cases. But the increase in patients doubled in the next week till April 6, with 18 more cases, taking the tally to 39. As of April 13, three weeks into the lockdown, the number doubled even further, climbing to 80. This trend of increase in cases in the second and third week was seen nationally as well.However, the spike eased thereafter, with 26 new cases till April 20, and three more cases as of April 24, making the tricity count 109. “As the air traffic has been shut down, new sources of infection have been blocked from entering the tricity, which eventually helped in bringing down new cases. The lockdown has also played a major role in controlling widespread transmission,” said PVM Lakshmi, senior epidemiologist at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.Hospital director Jagat Ram gave credit to extensive contact tracing and testing. “Fewer new cases was possible due to extensive contact tracing and their testing. It appears the rate will slow down further,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/spurt-and-slowdown-chandigarh-tricity-area-s-coronavirus-tally-saw-it-all/story-XgxXPJJKPt7kJ26gD7hb8J.html
25-04-2020||Chandigarh||Wrong number: Women, child helpline in Chandigarh gets requests for curfew passes, ration and pension queries||It’s meant for a select group, but ever since the lockdown following the Covid-19 pandemic, the women and child helpline, 181, has been flooded with queries related to ration, curfew passes, pensions and other requests.More worryingly, three calls related to Protection of Children from Sexual Offences(POCSO) Act and six to domestic violence, slightly more than the average, were among 1,612 calls received during the lockdown.On regular days the helpline receives up to 1,200 calls a month of which 50% are related to children requiring counselling or other help and 40% to women in distress. About 10% calls are made by senior citizens, said Vikram Jeet Godwani, state helpline manager in Chandigarh.SURGE AFTER LOCKDOWN AND APRIL EXTENSIONDuring a month of lockdown, from March 23 to April 23, 1,612 calls were received, of which a majority (749) were made in the first nine days (till March 31) by people asking for ration and cooked meals and enquiring about shelter homes and curfew passes.“People said they hadn’t received ration for four days. The details were shared with the director, social welfare department, who then got a list made and details of 300 such cases were shared with sub-divisional magistrates of the areas concerned,” said Godwani.ABOUT 580 CALLS WERE FROM PUNJABIn April, again, 863 calls were received with a surge reported after the April 14 lockdown extension, when people started making requests for passes. “We got 150 calls related to passes, 100 after April 14,” he added.On Thursday night the police called to say a woman whose husband had died at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) was insisting on returning to her hometown after her husband had passed away. “But by the time we contacted her and arranged for help she had hired an ambulance and left,” Godwani said.DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND POCSO CASESOn the cases related to domestic violence, the helpline manager said they got four to five calls on average, but six calls were made during the lockdown. One complaint was made by an IT company employee who accused her parents of torturing her, “so we informed the Mohali police about it through the district legal services authorities,” he added.The cases were reported from Khuda Ali Sher, Manimajra, Khuda Lahora, PGI Complex, Sector 47, and Mohali’s Phase 11.Three calls related to POCSO were also made and the helpline workers were keeping a close watch on 90 cases of marital dispute registered with it. However, conclusive number can’t be drawn from this figure with regards to domestic violence cases, as they are mainly reported to the police or courts.2019: Marital disputes, child abuseOf the 1,123 calls received by the women’s helpline from October 2015 to December 2019, a majority of complaints (377) were related to marital dispute, 136 to domestic violence and 104 to harassment. About 861 calls related to children were received of which the highest number (151) was related to POCSO.

25-04-2020||Chandigarh||Relieving hunger, warming hearts: Covid volunteers show the way||Thursday was not a good day for a group of volunteers running community kitchens for migrant rickshaw pullers and labourers stranded in the city without any means of income because of the lockdown to prevent transmission of Covid-19. The reason for the gloom was that they were not allowed to use one of their kitchen spaces and so could not serve food to about 500 homeless people.However, much to everyone’s relief, with an alternate space provided the next day, the kitchen was functional again, providing breakfast and afternoon meals to the workers.“After the lockdown we started with 200 to 250 people but the numbers rose to 500 plus as more workers started coming to the distribution areas in Sectors 34 and 44. Then we started feeding construction labourers too who were stranded in different sites in the city and workers who slept in a city petrol pump,” says inspector Ram Dayal of the Chandigarh police, who is working in his personal capacity with civilian friends.“We made it a point to start with a morning meal as very few were doing it and then started distributing soaps to them for washing hands,” he adds.Another anonymous group is also doing its bit to help labourers not just in the tricity but several other towns too. Started by a writer-filmmaker who wishes to remain anonymous, the group was able to raise Rs 10 lakh and disperse it among workers in dire straits.Speaking on the behalf of the group which includes writers, academics, journalists, hoteliers, doctors, academics, shopkeepers and students, Harish Jain, a tricity publisher says: “We were able to provide a 32-kg ration kit worth Rs 1,400 each to 600 workers and cash relief of Rs 2,500 each to 800 others we could not reach due to the lockdown.” Besides dry rations, the kit included washing-bathing soaps and sanitary pads.The group also thoughtfully provided dates to a group of Muslim labourers to break their Ramzan fast.The volunteers are now collecting donations for the month of May.People are doing what they can in their own way. Some of them running tiffin services, including Nirmal Varma in Sector 35 and Aaakriti Sachdev in Panchkula, now provide meals to labourers with their neighbours chipping in with dry rations, biscuits and savouries.Karkirat Singh, a businessman volunteering with the Serve Humanity Serve God NGO, is busy supervising packaging of ration kits in the Sector 15 gurdwara to be distributed to labourers in Mohali and Kharar. “We have been helping disadvantaged families for many years and our volunteers are now reaching out with monthly supplies to some 250 labourers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/love-in-the-times-of-covid-19-relieving-hunger-warming-hearts/story-BzWAGBCBVVG77zMUhJ3OaK.html
25-04-2020||Mumbai||Why Mumbai is recording most number of cases||Mumbai reported 522 Covid-19 cases on Thursday, the highest single-day jump for any Indian city since the first coronavirus patient was detected in Kerala on January 30. Mumbai is also the Indian city worst hit by Covid-19, with 4,447 cases recorded until Friday night. Since April 13 (242 cases in 24 hours), Mumbai has consistently recorded the highest one-day increase among Indian cities, with a single exception: April 17, when it reported 12 cases. Even the exception was because of the exclusion of private lab results and not an actual dip.Here are Mumbai’s numbers for the last 10 days — April 14: 216; April 15: 140; April 16: 177; April 17: 12; April 18: 183; April 19: 456; April 20: 308; April 21: 419; April 22: 232; April 23: 522; and April 24: 242What explains the financial capital’s high Covid-19 numbers?Intensive contact tracing, testing and quarantining of high-risk individuals has contributed to the consistently high numbers, according to the health department officials of Maharashtra and Mumbai. “Between 40% and 45% of our total cases are [the result of] efforts at contact tracing and fever camps in containment zones,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). According to BMC data on April 24, at least 400,000 people have been screened across 813 containment zones in the city (the number of containment zones increased to 930 on April 23, but the screening data for the new containment zones was not updated on April 24), and at the airport since the Covid-19 outbreak. Simultaneously, Maharashtra’s health department has screened 2.726 million people across the affected districts. Nearly 2 million of these are in Mumbai.A senior BMC officer who asked not to be named said: “We have to consider the remaining 55% as well. These are coming from the untraced population, but the good thing is that many of them are coming voluntarily [for testing] and it is only later that our health officers realise that they are contacts of existing positive patients.” According to data analysis of positive patients by the Maharashtra Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD), 81% of the state’s patients are asymptomatic. Mumbai’s numbers are similar (80%). Notably, although the cases are rising, the mortality rate in Maharashtra is dipping. On April 12, the city’s mortality rate was 7.41%. This reduced to 4.42% on April 24. On April 12, of the 1,996 patients detected, 148 had succumbed to the infection. Until Friday night, Maharashtra recorded 6,817 cases with 301 deaths.Mumbai’s mortality rate has fallen too. On April 12, it was 7.09% (92 deaths and 1298 positives). This came down to 4% on April 24 (178 deaths and 4447 positives).“Identification and quarantining of high-risk contacts has been helpful in keeping Mumbai’s numbers realistic. We will see high figures, but there is no reason to panic because these are expected results of the intensive contact tracing and isolation programme in Maharashtra,” a state government health official said. “Besides, we are aggressively testing a large number of high-risk contacts.”As of April 23, Maharashtra had conducted 96,369 tests, of which 55,000 (or 57.07%) were in Mumbai alone, according to Praveen Pardeshi, Mumbai’s municipal commissioner. Maharashtra has recorded 89,561 negative samples. The remainder are repeat tests. On April 24, the number of tests in Maharashtra went up to 102,189, but Mumbai’s numbers were not immediately available.According to data available with states on per million tests till April 22, Andhra Pradesh leads Indian states with 830 tests per million (41,512 total tests till that day), followed by Tamil Nadu (781 per million, 53,045 total tests) and Maharashtra (665 tests per million). Gujarat is on the fourth spot with 604 tests per million (36,829 total tests).As of April 23, 11pm, the number of home-quarantined people in the state touched 114,398, while 8,702 were in institutional quarantine, according to data provided by the state health department. Data released by BMC on April 24 suggests that in Mumbai, a total of 98,000 people are in government-enforced quarantine — 92,000 at home (in containment zones and hot spots) and 6,000 in institutional quarantine facilities (hospital isolation wards, stadiums, sports complexes and hotels).Pardeshi said: “A significant proportion of Mumbai’s cases are of people that have already been quarantined and those that are under observation. The ones that are testing positive, BMC had already anticipated in some measure that they may have the virus.”“On any given day, between 70-80% of the city’s active cases are asymptomatic,” BMC deputy health officer Shah said on Thursday night, soon after the city’s highest one-day jump was announced.Pardeshi added: “It is a good thing that so many positive patients are asymptomatic, because they don’t easily spread the disease. They don’t cough or sneeze, and transmit it to someone else. In fact, these patients are adding to our collective immunity. It is the symptomatic ones we have to pay attention to. Not only because they spread it, but because they need medical attention, we need to treat their symptoms before they aget worse and change into more complex conditions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-mumbai-is-recording-most-number-of-cases/story-yU4Y2zvxyHYZHPxxsdhwSO.html

Around 5.5 lakh migrant labourers have been housed at 944 relief camps across the state.Every district has two to three teams of counsellors, mental health experts, and nurses who go to these relief camps and tell the migrants about Covid-19 safety measures. There are 30 counsellors, 28 mental health experts, and 36 nurses who have been entrusted with the task. Health minister Rajesh Tope, in a statement, said that the counsellors have helped the migrants understand the current situation and that it is showing results.The state government had earlier said that it was getting difficult to manage the migrants as at times they grew aggressive. The authorities feared that it would lead to a law and order situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/counselling-of-migrant-labourers-showing-positive-results-maharashtra-health-minister/story-oJ3yrMHfw9YiYvc9qoIRAL.html

The counselling started on Friday and students are supposed to submit their choice of specialty till April 26. “There are issues in filing choices on the online portal and the process must be reviewed,” the letter says, adding that seats were not categorised separately as Institutional Preference (IP) or management, while filing choices.“Minority seats are not categorised separately, while filing choice on the portal. There is no seat of pulmonary medicine for general category in government medical college at Amritsar, but this is being reflected in the menu for filling the choice,” the letter specifically states. “There is no criteria on allotment of the EWS or SC or BC quota seats to that of IP seats,” the candidates have claimed. They explained this by saying that if a person from these categories was to take a MD (radiology) seat, government medical college through the institutional preference, there are no guidelines on whether the candidate will be allotted a seat in general category or through his/her respective category. They also claimed that there was no information on upgrade or free exit pertaining to the first round of online counselling.BFUHS vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur said, “The first round of online counselling for postgraduate courses is under process as per guidelines issued by the department of medical education. The university will look into valid issues that the candidates are raising. The All- India counselling was conducted following a similar pattern. No issues were raised at the time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pg-counselling-at-bfuhs-aspirants-flag-issues-with-online-counselling/story-4feB6jm3bymTtu7kq2HjmL.html
25-04-2020||Mumbai||Maha coronavirus case tally goes up to 6,817; death toll 301||After 32 days of the lockdown imposed to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Maharashtra’s case count reached 6,817 with the addition of 394 infections on Friday. The state’s toll went up to 301 with 18 deaths registered on FridayThe lockdown was imposed in the state on the midnight of March 23 and was lifted partially after 27 days on Monday (April 20). The relaxation was revoked the next day, owing to multiple violations of norms.Friday was also the 21st consecutive day the state saw a three-digit spike in fresh cases. This is the reason most of the cases — 6,519 — were registered in April alone.Of the new cases, 5,279 are in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). In Mumbai, the tally went up to 4,447 as 242 new cases were registered. After the first case on March 9, Maharashtra took 30 days to cross 1,000 cases on April 7, and crossed the 2,000 mark in six days on April 13. From 2,000 to 4,000 cases, it took six days. But from 4,000 to 6,000 cases, it took only four days.Although the numbers are high, senior officials said the state is yet to reach community transmission stage — when the source of the infection is not known — as there is no exponential growth in Covid-19 cases. “The two 14-day cycles of incubation period of infection are completed on April 20. It had begun from March 22, when international traffic was stopped. We will have to wait for another seven days to see the trend. If the rise continues and if the number of fresh cases are rising by more than 50% (over the previous day) on a daily basis, then it can be called as exponential growth and only then we can say that the stage of community transmission has arrived,” said Dr TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). He clarified that exponential growth is also of two types: one is 50% rise in daily cases and another is doubling of cases —100% rise in daily cases. “If exponential growth continues, then the state government will also have to extend the lockdown period for another three weeks till May 24 to break the incubation cycle,” Dr Lahane said.. Of them, 11 are in Mumbai, five in Pune and two in Malegaon. The total number of casualties in Mumbai increased to 178.Of the 18 deaths, 12 patients had co-morbidity conditions, said health officials.The mortality rate of the state has significantly dropped to 4.40% (283 cases till Thursday) from 7.41% (148 cases) since last Monday (April 13). However, it continued to be higher than the national mortality rate of 3.11% till Thursday, stated the data of the state medical education department.As the cases are rising, the pandemic is also spreading to more areas of the state. One more district — Nanded — was hit by the virus after one case was found on April 22. With this, only three districts — Wardha, Bhandara, Gadchiroli — are reported to have no cases.The state health department has conducted 1,02,189 tests at various public and private facilities. Of them, 94,485 people tested negative. State currently has 512 active containment zones. Around 7,702 survey teams, comprising doctors and assisting staff, have screened more than 28.88 lakh people. Around 957 patients have been discharged from hospitals after their recovery from infection.It has also kept 8,814 suspected patients at government quarantine facilities, while 1,19,161 are home quarantined, stated health officials.The Maharashtra government is also ready to start clinical trials of plasma therapy in the coming days as Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given the much awaited permission. In the beginning, it will be started at Sassoon Hospital in Pune as permissions for other three hospitals in Mumbai, Nagpur and Solapur are still awaited. The state has also got permission for pool testing for Covid-19.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said that Maharashtra has got the nod from the Centre to start pool testing and convalescent plasma therapy. Tope announced it after a meeting with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan. The state would now commence pooled tests, where up to five samples are used in a single test. So far, one sample is being tested at a time.Once clinical trials are successful, the state can start plasma therapy as treatment for Covid-19 patients. “We have received permission from the Centre for conducting clinical trials of plasma therapy in the state. Once cleared by the ethics committee of the state, it is going to be started in the next 3-4 days at Sassoon Hospital, Pune. It will also be started at JJ Hospital in Mumbai, Indira Gandhi Medical College in Nagpur and Solapur Medical College in Solapur once permissions are in place,” said Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER).The plasma therapy uses antibodies from the plasma of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those patients who are affected. The concept behind the therapy is that the plasma of a patient recovered from Covid-19 contains antibodies with the specific ability to fight the coronavirus. These antibodies will then target and fight the virus in the body of the infected person.Maharashtra holds the top spot in the country with the number of coronavirus tests conducted. With pool testing, the state will get a boost in figures. State health department officials said that with the new form of testing, the state’s capacity would increase 10 times. The pool testing could help with the clusters or hotspots faster, officials added. The testing method involves putting multiple swab samples together and testing them in a single real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. If a batch tests positive, then everyone whose samples were a part of that batch would have to be tested separately. Conversely, if a batch tests negative, then all the samples are negative.Tope said that the state has also suggested use of portable pulse oximeter and chest X-ray test to help diagnose coronavirus patients and to subsequently decrease the mortality rate. A statement from the state health department said that it was suggested that the PPE kits should be disinfected and used again; this suggestion was appreciated in the meeting by the Union health minister and health ministers of all the states. The minister also said that the Centre is positive about allowing new testing facilities at six medical colleges in Maharashtra.So far, the state government has also done counselling of over 47,000 migrant workers that wants to go back to their native villages. This is being done with the help of psychiatrists and health staff, said the health minister. More than 6 lakh migrant workers are staying in over 944 shelter homes prepared by the state government.(With inputs from Swapnil Rawal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-coronavirus-case-tally-goes-up-to-6-817-death-toll-301/story-8TFoCr8MfMGvuZzCvAwMlI.html
25-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra fisheries department bans sale of fish at roadside markets||The Maharashtra fisheries department has issued restrictions on the fishing trade, including a ban on retail sale at roadside markets, even as restrictions are being slowly lifted. Earlier this week, the department published a 43-point standard operating procedure (SOP) to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.Among major directions, wholesalers can sell their catch while maintaining social distancing norms but retail fish sale by vendors across markets has been banned until further notice, to avoid crowds.“Safety of citizens is of utmost importance. The decision is mainly focused on fishers who set up stalls at sections of the market, landing sites or main roads, to avoid overcrowding and chances of community transmission,” said Rajendra Jadhav, joint commissioner, state fisheries department. “It comes as a difficult decision as lots of fisherwomen are employed in such activities across the Konkan but we were left with no option following overcrowding incidents being brought to our notice by the police,” he said.Fishermen have opposed the restrictions. “Fisherwomen across 350 such sites in the Mumbai region will be directly affected due to this decision. No such decision has been taken for vendors selling agricultural produce. We demand that the fisheries department withdraws this SOP,” said Damodar Tandel, president of a fishing group in Mumbai.While the department has banned retail fish vendors, it has approved door-to-door supply of fish while maintaining social distancing norms.Other restrictions include medical screening of fishing boat staff and monitoring of boat movements. A committee, chaired by the district collector with fisheries department members, will issue permits based on valid identity proof, health documents, and information of family members, submitted through the Aarogya Setu mobile app. “This is being done across 91 fish landing sites and three major harbors [two in Mumbai and one in Ratnagiri] functioning currently,” said Jadhav. “A proposal for mandatory thermal testing is in its final stage of approval from the state, and will also commence soon.”Other rules include ‘social distancing during fishing at sea’. “Not more than three people as crew will be allowed for smaller boats or vessels. If any crew member has reported sick or developed any flu-like symptoms, fishing activities need to abandoned and the boat will return to the jetty immediately,” said Jadhav, adding that the fish caught should not be consumed or touched. The catch will be disposed of as per bio-medical waste disposal norms after ‘arrival at landing centres’.“If any crew member tests positive, the entire crew will undergo mandatory isolation for a minimum of 14 days,” said Jadhav. “Overall sanitation, disinfection of boats, wearing masks and gloves under all four scenarios is mandatory,” he said.According to the National Purse Seine Fishermen Welfare Association (NPSFWA), Maharashtra fishers have incurred losses over ₹800 crore over a month and had dumped 15,000 tonnes of fresh catch into the sea during the first two weeks of the lockdown. “The present guidelines are confusing and developed haphazardly. The state needs to first support the market by designing a supply-chain of how fish will be sold before drafting guidelines for fishing. By banning retail vendors, a source of income has been destroyed,” said Ganesh Nakhawa, chairman, NPSFWA, who is developing a supply-chain model for door-to-door delivery for vendors.The Centre has also announced that there will be no relaxation for the annual fishing ban along the west coast from June 1 to July 31 – during the breeding season – for the conservation of fisheries resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-fisheries-department-bans-sale-of-fish-at-roadside-markets/story-AbMNsuBhu9KIwM4yK7yyVL.html
25-04-2020||Mumbai||Psychiatrists, NGOs in Mumbai flooded with calls from addicts during coronavirus lockdown||City psychiatrists say they are flooded with calls from people with addictions who are suffering from withdrawal symptoms. With the lockdown cutting off people’s access to a wide variety of products, including addictive substances like alcohol, cigarettes, drugs and chewing tobacco, addicts are reporting a range of symptoms including headache, anxiety, stomach cramps, hallucinations, insomnia and others.According to experts, in severe addicts, withdrawal symptoms manifest after 24 to 72 hours of not being able to consume the addictive substance. Some police stations have reported alcoholics calling them, begging for alcohol. Most of these callers belonged to the 50 years-and-above age group, said a deputy commissioner of police, requesting anonymity. Psychiatrists say that in most cases, they have been contacted by the addicts themselves and many patients have been admitted to civic-run and private facilities.Dr Ajita Nayak, head of the psychiatry department and the de-addiction centre at KEM Hospital, said, “Every day we receive at least two calls from people experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Most calls are from people dependent on alcohol and experiencing sleeplessness, tremors, hallucinations among other symptoms. We administer anti-withdrawal, anti-craving medication, among others medicines to stabilise them.”Dr Nilesh Shah, head of the psychiatry department at Sion Hospital, said, “We have admitted five to six alcoholics who had serious withdrawal symptoms and treated them.”Psychiatrist Yusuf Matcheswala said that over 100 addicts have called him to complain of withdrawal symptoms. “Most were alcohol addicts while the other were related to drugs and tobacco,” said Matcheswala. Psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada said he had received around 20 calls related to addiction. “The problem is that addicts approach doctors with an intention to fix their withdrawal symptoms, and not with an aim to quit addiction,” said Dr Mundada.Varsha Vilas, general secretary of Maharashtra De-addiction Council, said, “From the conversations with individuals who have contacted us, I fear that these people would go a step ahead in terms of consuming more alcohol once the lockdown is lifted.”HelplineThe HITGUJ helpline, 022-24131212, is a 24-hour, telephonic counselling service run by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. The helpline comes under the department of psychiatry at KEM Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/psychiatrists-ngos-in-mumbai-flooded-with-calls-from-addicts-during-coronavirus-lockdown/story-8HpgGvUCrWQqNLqKh5VNiK.html
25-04-2020||City||500 recovered Covid-19 patients to be discharged today in Mumbai||More than 500 Covid-19 patients from different Covid care centres in the city, who tested negative in two consecutive swab tests, will be discharged on Saturday. This is the first time that such a large number of recovered patients will be discharged on the same day. On Friday, 122 cured patients were discharged in Mumbai. So far, 595 recovered patients have been discharged since January 25. All these symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were sent to isolation facilities in Covid care centres, health care and dedicated hospitals. Most of them were asymptomatic and were detected through contact tracing at containment zones. “As they were isolated around the same time with a difference of one or two days, they have completed their incubation period together. As their swab tests have come negative, we have decided to discharge them by Saturday,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).The BMC on April 12 changed its testing policy, focusing mainly on symptomatic patients, instead of asymptomatic ones, which was widely criticised by health experts who demanded more tests on asymptomatic patients who could be spreading the infection. The civic body has observed that more than 70% of the asymptomatic patients are turning negative in their two consecutive swab tests without developing any symptoms during their incubation period. “We have observed that many asymptomatic patients are living normally in isolation wards without developing any symptoms. As they don’t cough or sneeze, the chance of the spread of infection among asymptomatic patients is less,” said Kakani.The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that to date there has been no documented asymptomatic transmission. Indirectly, asymptomatic patients could be leading to development of community immunity or herd immunity, said experts. This happens when the spread of the infection stops naturally due to the development of antibodies among 80% of the population, after getting infected with the virus or by vaccination. “Firstly, asymptomatic patients are safer than symptomatic patients. Secondly, once their immune system develops antibodies, the virus can’t infect them again. So, without even infecting people, they are turning into a shield in the fight against the spread of the virus,” said Dr Om Srivastava, an epidemiologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/500-recovered-covid-19-patients-to-be-discharged-today-in-mumbai/story-I1pTi1AuGd3wBzM70OC0AJ.html

The man had earlier got himself checked at a private hospital in Delhi’s Patparganj area.According to the officials, the man works as a driver at the Patparganj hospital, where he was tested positive for the infection. He had informed the nodal officer at the Sharda Hospital that he was tested after he sneezed in the vehicle while dropping a member of the hospital staff.He was informed that he is COVID-19 positive by the private hospital on Saturday morning. The man then left from the hospital in a car and was entering Noida, when he was stopped by the police. He informed the police that he is a Covid-19 positive patient and showed his report.“The surveillance team had informed about the man but we didn’t have to do anything as he himself stopped and told us that he is Covid-19 positive. We had his vehicle number but he knew that there was police presence. So he came to us willingly. He was stopped at around 4pm on Friday. We don’t know where he was coming from and when he received his reports. He showed us his reports, after which an ambulance was called to take him to Sharda Hospital,” said Arun Singh, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Gautam Buddh Nagar.The hospital has started the treatment of the man. “The patient has told us that he wanted to get himself treated in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

Some of us were also into prostitution. Nowadays, no customer comes to us.”Due to curfew, all marriages and other celebrations have been put on hold, leaving the trans community without any means of earning a livelihood.Kajal Magalmukhi says, “In absence of money, we are unable to buy food. I had some savings and I donated most of them. Whatever was left, I gave to the poor in villages.”The Mangalmukhi Dera has helped over 50 trans people get an allowance of Rs 1,500 each through the National Institute of Social Defence to sustain.“Kajal guru gave us a link to fill in our details, including bank account number and IFSC code. After that, the money was transferred to us. I hope they transfer this money for the next two-three months too so that we can survive,” says a dera memberFour trans-people based in Chandigarh, Rachna, Grace, Bittu and Meera, wrote to the Union ministry of social justice seeking financial assistance and support for their community.Chandigarh has a population of over 2,000 trans-people and many also live in the satellite cities of Mohali and Panchkula.Yashpal Garg, secretary of social welfare department, Chandigarh administration, says, “There are no specific provisions for trans-people. They are being helped whenever they are in need.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/struggling-for-survival-trans-community-dips-into-savings-to-feed-others-too/story-E3JLvwyjz3MFhJAUbIn2hM.html
25-04-2020||Delhi||Three more sanitation workers in Delhi test Covid +ve; total count at six||Three more municipal sanitation workers tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, taking the total number of such infected workers to six. One of them has died. A 55-year-old sanitation worker with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), who lives in DDA flats East of Kailash and cleaned roads and picked up garbage in Bhogal, was admitted at AIIMS in a serious condition.“My uncle is on ventilator support at AIIMS Trauma Centre. He is just five years short of retirement age and has liver-related problems. The corporation, considering his age, should have allowed him to stay at home. He should not have been summoned to work. He has a wife and three children to look after. If something happens to him, will the south municipality bear the financial burden of the family,” asked the nephew of the 55-year-old man.Another sanitation worker with the south civic body, a 45-year-old woman, was admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital after testing positive for the virus. SDMC spokesman, Radha Krishan said, “Her husband, also a sanitation worker with us in the same ward of Tagore garden, tested negative for the virus on Thursday. However, after she tetsed positive, he has been called in for a test again. Their nine co-workers have been asked to go in home-quarantine. The man is a resident of Mangolpuri.”Meanwhile, a sanitation inspector with the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, who is also 55-year-old but doesn’t have any known pre-existing medical condition, has also tested Covid-19 positive. Around 40 people, who worked under him, were sent on home quarantine on Friday.“On April 16 he developed a fever and cough and we immediately advised him to go on leave,” said one of his co-workers over the phone. They all worked in Rohini Sector 16 and 17 areas. Both the municipal bodies said that the patients were not engaged in any disinfection or garbage collection activities in containment zones. “We are still trying to ascertain how he got the virus,” north body commissioner, Varsha Joshi, said.However, leaders of safai karmchari unions said that the corporations are risking their lives. Delhi Safai Karamchari Association president, Sanjay Gahlot, said, “It is shocking that we are still being made to mark our attendance physically with a pen on a register or by thumb impression. Imagine if one person has the virus, he will end up infecting everyone who signs that register.”The north body commissioner, Joshi, said, “It’s a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), we have asked all of them to wash their hands with soap before and after signing the register.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-more-sanitation-workers-test-covid-ve-total-count-six/story-MXfJCvCrx1my15e3Pm2xQO.html

The market had been ordered to shift to allow social distancing, which would not have been possible in the original space.As many as 2,514 have contracted the contagious disease in the national capital. It has claimed 53 lives, while 857 have recovered. As on Friday, Delhi’s south district alone had at least 106 Covid-19 cases and 13 containment zones.“The infected person was a regular vendor at the main Mehrauli market. But he was among 100-odd vendors who did not get space at the bus terminal because we could accommodate just over 50 traders there due to social distancing norms. So, they went to their homes and sold goods only occasionally, by going from block to block,” said Aarti Singh, Mehrauli councillor. The vegetable vendor lives in Mehrauli’s ward number 3. Officials said all the residents of the area are being thermally screened, and those who display symptoms will be tested. However, as of Friday evening, officials said nobody screened needed a test.The area’s sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Sonalika Jiwani, who had issued the order to shift the wholesale vegetable market from the main Mehrauli market, corroborated Singh’s statement.“The patient’s son told us this. He also told us how his father started developing symptoms last week and mostly stayed indoors since then. So, the number of people he came in touch with are limited so far. Now that we think of it, the decision to shift the market was taken just in time. If he had gotten a space at the terminal, then the spread would have been massive. We got lucky,” Jiwani said. Originally, the wholesale vegetable market used to operate from a small, tightly-packed area. Under the temporary arrangement at the bus terminal, vendors have been 10 square-feet stalls, each space two metres apart.“To ensure people in the market are not infected by the virus, and to prevent its spread, each person who enters is thermally scanned and asked to sanitise their hands. We have also made only one entry and one exit point to ensure strict compliance to these norms,” she said. While the vendor is undergoing treatment in a hospital, his wife and children have been quarantined, and their tests results are awaited. District magistrate (south), BM Mishra said the administration is considering this as an “isolation case” as of now because they have been unable to trace the source of his infection.District officials on Friday started intensive door-to-door screening of people living in and around the main Mehrauli market. “Since contact tracing in this particular case is extremely limited, we are conducting thermal screening in every household in the area. As on Friday, areas in the main market and Ward Number 3 of Mehrauli, which was also the place of residence of the infected vendor, were covered. More will be covered over the weekend,” said Mishra. District official and civil defence volunteers were seen patrolling neighbourhoods and making announcements on loudspeakers to alert residents of the situation, and reminding them to remain indoors.“We are urging people to report to us or call the Covid-19 helpline if anyone shows symptoms or feels he/she could have come in contact with the vendor or any other infected person,” Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-infected-mehrauli-vegetable-vendor-didn-t-get-space-in-shifted-market-got-lucky-distt-admin-says/story-aCr8ZRzxgFdKH0hFe5LYMM.html

25-04-2020||Noida||UP-Rera to rank builders, housing projects, invites suggestions from developers on grading system||The Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera) has invited suggestions from developers for a draft of the framework developed by the authority to rank builders and housing projects. UP-Rera said the annual rankings would help homebuyers and investors make an informed choice.The regulatory authority in November 2018 had decided to rank builders and housing projects for the first time. However, until now the authority could not execute the plan as, officials said, it took time to finalise the framework draft and other modalities.Taking things forwards, the authority on April 23 put a copy of the framework’s draft on its portal— www.up-rera.in for interested stakeholders, including homebuyers, to go through the same and make suggestions. The authority said all suggestions can be made on the portal by May 13, 2020. UP-Rera also plans to hold an interaction with the developers on the framework that will most likely be held on Monday via video conferencing.The framework to rank builders and projects was prepared after consultations with the Noida, Greater Noida authorities, Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida), and other authorities in the national capital region. There are at least 600 under-construction realty projects in Noida, Greater Noida, and along the Yamuna Expressway. Officials said ranking housing projects will help the buyers immensely.“The rankings will primarily help buyers to make a rational choice before buying any property. We will be the first in the county to have such a ranking system,” said Balvinder Kumar member, UP-Rera.The regulatory authority will rank developers and housing projects on the basis of organizational structure, certifications, track record, adherence to rules and regulations, and feedback from old customers. The authority will also evaluate the promoter’s track record in executing projects as per schedules and will analyse the organizational, legal, and financial risks associated with housing projects, said officials.The projects registered with UP-Rera will be given grades from 1 to 5. The promoters will have to submit details of their housing projects on the authority’s portal. Subsequently, the regulator will evaluate the projects and publish the grades on the portal for feedback before finalising the grads. All projects would be ranked annually.“By grading projects and promoters, homebuyers will have more a transparent system to access developers. Buyer can take quick decisions while buying properties, and we hope that demand will increase because buyers will have more trust in the system,” said RK Arora president, Uttar Pradesh chapter of National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) , a builders’ group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-rera-to-rank-builders-housing-projects-invites-suggestions-from-developers-on-grading-system/story-7yP40rPbqo0j53gV2kysjK.html
25-04-2020||Gurugram||Blood banks dry up in city as lockdown cuts down on donation camps, donors||Hridesh Khurana, 20, suffers from thalassemia and requires blood transfusion every two weeks. Since the lockdown on March 25, Hridesh has struggled to get blood.“We would usually go to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi,” said his father Mahesh Khurana. The family resides in Subhash Nagar. “The next transfusion in AIIMS was scheduled for March 30, which had to be postponed due to the lockdown. At that time, my son’s haemoglobin level (Hb) level was 8.30 grams/decilitre.”Thalassemia is a genetic disorder that causes low haemoglobin -- a protein that carries oxygen and gives blood its red colour -- level. The minimum required level is 9 grams/decilitre. On top of that, Hridesh also has the rare B+ blood group.“By April 10, this had dropped to 7.5 grams/decilitre. If it dropped to six, he would have gone into critical condition,” said Mahesh. With Gurugram blood banks facing shortage of blood in the absence of donors who could not donate in the wake of the lockdown, he had to struggle to arrange the three units of blood. A unit contains 300 to 350 millilitres of haemoglobin.“Blood banks told us they were running out of units. We visited other hospitals too that cited similar problems. At last, a hospital agreed to give two units in place of a donor giving an equal quantity. A relative donated two units of blood and we got the transfusion done at the Rotary blood bank,” said Khurana. He does not have a plan on what to do on April 25, the next transfusion date.“After the lockdown, more than 25 families who used to take their children to Delhi have approached us. Earlier we were providing free blood units to 45 patients,” said Dr. Mahavir Jain, project director, Rotary Thalassemic Care, Gurugram. “For any family to spend ₹8000-10,000 after every 15 days is not easy. Therefore, as per the government rule, patients who require regular blood transfusion have to be given blood free of cost. Lockdown and coronavirus scare among donors has added to the plight of these families.” Dr. Rahul Bhargava, director, Institute of blood disorder and Bone Marrow transplant, Fortis Medical Research Institute said, “Every month we need at least 100 units of blood for thalassemia patients but since lockdown we could manage to get 30-40 units through voluntary blood donation.” According to him, the reasons for the gap are two-fold: Most hospitals are not operating at full capacity and blood donors area hesitant to break lockdown curbs. “People are not coming for voluntary donation although the administration has allowed curfew passes. Donors are scared of visiting clinics or hospitals due to Covid-19,” he said.Dr. Neha Singh, a consultant paediatrician and hemato-oncologist at the Paras Hospital said that at the present levels, they are giving blood to those who need it the most such as critical patients -- a procedure called blood triaging. “An adult thalassemia patient requires three units of blood every 15-20 days. If it is not given then the patient may die of oxygen starvation followed by multi-organ failure. It is, therefore, crucial to address those patients whose Hb level are on constant decline,” she said.“The ideal hemoglobin level for a thalassemia patient is 9 but we are allowing it to drop till 7. When the level reaches 6, an emergency arises. In the current scenario we can address only those patients who can be prevented from going into critical health condition,” said Bhargava.To address the crisis that is now reported from across the country, Union minister of health and family welfare Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday said that he has written to all states to ensure adequate availability of blood in blood banks and in particular,for those suffering from blood disorders such as thalassemia, sickle sell anemia, and haemophilia, among others.In Gurugram, according to Dr. Jain, patients who need blood transfusion are either dependent upon Delhi-based government hospitals or private hospitals in the city. He said, “In December 2019, Rotary started providing free blood units to thalassemia patients. Since then we have been holding blood camps, providing consultations and free transfusion of thalassemia major or minor patients. We were also providing blood to private hospitals as per their requirement knowing the stipulated life span of blood packs.”They were able to suffice the need by organising blood camps before the lockdown. “Though the government and administration has allowed to hold these camps even today, it is difficult. People are scared, suspecting that they might get Covid-19. Today, we don’t have a single blood unit left,” said Dr Jain.Doctors said they have been facilitating ambulance service to bring donors to the blood bank for donation. Others have asked blood recipients like Khurana to bring donors along with them.Fortis also conducted blood camps in two condominiums to shore up their stock. “We could collect only 25 units of blood,” said Bhargava. “We followed all the parameters like checking the travel history of the donor and other health conditions. Still, didn’t get close to what we needed.” But he is hopeful. “As people adapt to the pandemic situation, we would see more people coming out for donation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/blood-banks-dry-up-in-city-as-lockdown-cuts-down-on-donation-camps-donors/story-ApzfZeA3M2vg0rDtqvTUGJ.html
25-04-2020||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar administration appoints nodal NGO to monitor relief work||The district administration has roped in an NGO to monitor and facilitate all relief work currently underway in Gautam Budh Nagar to help people whose lives have been affected due to the nationwide lockdown, as well as to highlight issues being faced by the public.The administration has appointed FXB India Suraksha as the nodal NGO, which has begun working on managing the child helpline of the district.“We had requested for the appointment on April 16 in light of the Niti Ayog’s call for NGOs to actively participate to help the government in the ongoing crisis,” said Satya Prakash, programme manager.The Niti Ayog had earlier this month advised to designate a district-level nodal officer to coordinate with local NGOs who would maintain a list of all credible organisations. It had also suggested the appointment of a nodal or ‘mother’ NGO.Following this directive, the chief development officer (CDO) of Gautam Budh Nagar, in an order on April 22, appointed FXB Suraksha India as the nodal NGO for the district.“Their responsibility will include preparing an area-wise database of all NGOs, civil society groups, organisations or individuals working to provide help in the district and to identify the Covid-19-related problems of the people. They will also coordinate with the appointed organisations for specific services, bring them to the people and help them with specific issues,” said the order from the CDO office.The CDO also appointed the district probation officer as the additional nodal officer.“The NGO will form a complete database to coordinate all relief work taking place in the district, including that of the administration, the police department and social organisations. They will also come up with a mobile application for the same soon,” said CDO Anil Kumar Singh.The NGO has so far come up with a list of 25 social organisations engaged in relief work but the number will likely go up as more and more organisations are identified, said officials.“We will put up a link on the administration’s website where various organisations, residential bodies, youth groups and individuals alike can register. They can add their contributions there. Once all information is there, we can map it area-wise. That way, people will know whom to contact in a particular locality. The contribution of authorities, the administration and the police will also be monitored and facilitated,” said Prakash.He said that in addition to food or ration necessities, they will also monitor other issues that are highlighted, including landlord-tenant conflicts, domestic violence cases, chronic diseases, etc.“We will keep a holistic stock of the situation and with the help of all organisations engaged in relief work, we will prepare a database of the people who are in need of assistance. So far, we have details of 5,000 families but it’s a work in progress as we want to cover all urban and rural belts. We will also release a household questionnaire for impoverished families so that each and every person is accounted for,” said Prakash.The NGO is working with a third party IT firm to prepare a mobile application which they hope to roll out in the next few days. Officials believe the system will also help prevent duplicity in terms of help being provided.On Friday, another NGO, MAARG, provided 150 face masks, 25 PPE kits, 250 face masks, 100 gloves, eight tea/coffee vending machines, 16 kg coffee and tea premix each, and 3,000 disposable cups to the Noida police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-administration-appoints-nodal-ngo-to-monitor-relief-work/story-cpI4ypk2RuoMzcozy5ahrJ.html
25-04-2020||Mumbai||Hospital didn’t have bed, ambulance refused oxygen facility: Family’s ordeal after doctor succumbs to Covid-19||The family of a 36-year-old general physician from Shivaji Nagar who contracted Covid-19 struggled for 24 hours to get him admitted to a hospital. Many hospitals refused to admit him due to unavailability of beds or lack of treatment facilities for the novel coronavirus. Even ambulances refused to ferry the physician. After the ordeal, the doctor succumbed to his infection on Thursday night after undergoing treatment at Raheja Hospital. This is the second death of a doctor in the city due to Covid-19. This comes at a time when already over 250 medical staffers have contracted the virus through cross-transmission in hospitals. Unlike hundreds of other private practitioners, he didn’t close down his clinic and attended to his patients daily at Shivajinagar. But on April 14, he developed diarrhoea. He didn’t have any coronavirus symptoms like fever, cold or dry cough. He self-medicated but as his condition deteriorated, the family called the civic-run Kasturba Gandhi Hospital which refused to admit him due to lack of beds. They were on their way to Sir JJ hospital when the physician, in a semi-conscious state, asked to give him oxygen immediately. Soon, they diverted the ambulance and shifted him to Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, Sion.“They admitted my brother but the hospital didn’t have any designated bed in the Intensive Care Unit for Covid-19 patients. Then we called Kohinoor Hospital which also didn’t have a Covid facility. Finally KJ Somaiya Hospital agreed to admit him,” said his 30-year-old brother, who is also a general physician. At Somaiya hospital, the physician was immediately admitted to a Covid-specific ICU. But soon, his creatinine level increased to 7 and needed immediate dialysis as his kidneys were getting affected. The hospital, however, didn’t have dialysis facility for coronavirus patients.Dr VA Sabnis, dean of KJ Somaiya hospital confirmed that the hospital doesn’t have dialysis facility for covid patients. He said, “I am not aware of this case.”It was around 11pm on April 15, when they were referred to Raheja Hospital. But even after waiting for six hours, they couldn’t find a cardiac ambulance to ferry the patient. “I called the 108 ambulance service which said that the driver will take 85 minutes to reach Sion from CST. Then with the help of other doctors, we managed to get a private ambulance for Rs 3,000 but it refused to give CPAP (an oxygen supplying procedure with air pressure),” said the brother. Ultimately, they had to take the patient in a general ambulance on normal oxygen support. Dr Dnyaneshwar Shelke, the chief operating officer of ‘MEMS- Dial 108’, said that he will inquire into the matter. “We have 30 ambulances for Covid-19 patients. I will have to inquire into the matter and see who was on duty on that night,” he said. They reached Raheja Hospital around 5.30 am on April 16. The hospital started his dialysis but he developed Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and succumbed. “He didn’t have any comorbid issues and wore safety kits sincerely while treating patients. I had asked him to close down the clinic but for the well being of his patients, he didn’t,” said his brother. “Despite coming from a doctor’s family, we had to struggle so much to get him admitted. I wonder about the condition of other patients,” he added.Dr Ramesh Bharmal, director of major hospitals (KEM, Sion, Nair and Cooper), said, “We are already working on formulating rules to avoid such harassment of patients. I am unaware of this incident and won’t be able to comment.” Sion hospital took two days to give his swab report to the family. It was only the second day of admission at Raheja Hospital, they received his report which confirmed he was Covid-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hospital-didn-t-have-bed-ambulance-refused-oxygen-facility-ordeal-of-a-doctor-s-family-who-succumbed-to-covid-19/story-kDp3I3cyMp5qX034CAySGP.html
25-04-2020||City||Govt colleges in rural areas low on several parameters, says NAAC report||Gurugram: According to a National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) report that analysed government colleges in rural areas across state and central universities, colleges scored poorly on parameters such as physical infrastructure, e-learning, and alumni engagement. In addition, a majority of the government colleges in rural areas assessed did not maintain adequate physical infrastructure or academic support facilities, the report says.The report is based on NAAC data from 27 state universities, five central universities, 142 post-graduate colleges, 135 undergraduate colleges and 30 autonomous colleges. It identifies the number of rural government colleges with a score of less than 2.0 in the cumulative grade point average (CGPA) and suggests an action plan that could be used to improve the performance of these colleges.Going by the report, around 8% of the undergraduate colleges and 15% of postgraduate colleges scored less than 2.0 CGPA in the physical infrastructure category. Out of the colleges assessed, more than 98% of the undergraduate colleges and 84 % of postgraduate colleges scored less than 2.0 CGPA in terms of having a library as a learning resource. More than 47% of the undergraduate colleges and 50% of postgraduate colleges scored less than 2 CGPA in IT Infrastructure, while more than 24% of the undergraduate colleges and 26% of postgraduate colleges scored less than 2 CGPA in the maintenance of campus infrastructure.The report was prepared in February this year. After the lockdown is over, it will be shared with the internal quality assurance cells of colleges through state governments for review of performance, following which the varsities are expected to take steps for improvement, said SC Sharma, director of NAAC.The NAAC assesses and accredits higher education institutions (HEIs) in the country. In 2017, the NAAC had introduced the Revised Accreditation Framework that combines qualitative metrics (70%) and quantitative metrics (30%) as grading criteria.Sharma said that there had been a shift from qualitative peer judgment to data-based quantitative indicator evaluation with increased objectivity and transparency in the past two-three years. He added that the report outlines the NAAC’s findings of the loopholes that plague government colleges in rural areas.“The NAAC report is a diagnostic tool. For the first time, we have come up with recommendations for governmental colleges in rural areas. Multiple factors are associated with rural colleges not getting A+ or A++ ratings. It is possible that colleges are not well-trained in sharing the data they have with NAAC. We are conducting awareness programs through webinars and training them in information and communication technology (ICT),” said Sharma.According to the report’s recommendation, the number of teachers using ICT for effective teaching needs to be increased. Other recommendations mentioned in the report seek the introduction of certificate and diploma programme in colleges, along with courses in gender, environment and sustainability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-colleges-in-rural-areas-in-haryana-low-on-several-parameters-says-naac-report/story-ETZKoHVZsN0cGmVvKlHEjI.html

25-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi Zoo’s oldest tiger dies of renal failure, tests negative for Covid-19||A 14-year-old Royal Bengal tigress died in the Delhi zoo on Wednesday due to kidney failure and not due to the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19, zoo officials said on Friday. Activists and experts, however, alleged lapses in testing and disposing of the carcass. Delhi Zoo officials said that Kalpana, who was the oldest tigress there, fell ill on Tuesday and had stopped eating. She was shifted to an isolation cage for examination, but she died on Wednesday at 6.30 pm. The autopsy report confirmed renal failure, said its director Suneesh Buxy.On April 5, a Malayan tiger had tested positive for the virus in New York’s Bronx Zoo. On April 22, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) that runs the zoo reported that four more tigers and three lions had also tested positive. In that case, the animals are believed to have caught the disease from a zoo employee. One tiger was also asymptomatic, it had reported.India is home to 2,967 tigers, the most in the world. While zoos have been shut since the lockdown began, the New York incident prompted them to be on high alert.“The carcass was cremated on Thursday following directions to minimise human-animal interface,” a Delhi zoo official confirmed on Friday. “Initial findings revealed high creatinine, which indicates that the filtration rate of her kidneys was inadequate.” Officials said her samples were sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly to rule out any possibility of the coronavirus infection. “The central zoo authority (CZA) has taken a proactive step to check if there was a Covid-19 connection,” said Soumitro Dasgupta, inspector general of forests.By Friday evening, the results came back negative. “As such there were no symptoms or external conditions to suspect that her death is due to Covid-19. However, as per CZA advisory issued in this regard, samples had been collected after ensuring all bio-security measures and were sent to IVRI. Later, IVRI has confirmed that tigress Kalpana was negative for Covid-19,” read a government press release.Experts, however, suspect lapses. CZA data shows that the mortality rate of animals in the Delhi Zoo in the year 2018-19 was 15.21%, highest among all zoos in India.Dr. D N Singh, former member secretary of CZA and former director of the zoo, said that protocol was not followed after the death of the animal. He alleged that the carcass of the animal was disposed of without the supervision of a senior official, which is a violation of the Recognition of Zoo Rules, 2009. “Perhaps officers were scared of Covid-19 in view of infection reports in seven animals in the Bronx Zoo (in New York). That is why they did not go near the tigress when she was reported sick or even when the carcass was disposed of on April 23,” Singh said. Animal rights activist Sangeeta Dogra alleged that only blood samples of the animal were sent for testing. WCS said they had tested the faecal samples of the animals.“The body was disposed of in a hurry. The CZA has not sent Kalpana’s nasopharyngeal (connected to the nasal cavity) or oreopharyngeal (mouth and pharynx) swab samples that are required to test for Covid-19. They have eliminated the carcass to suppress facts of her death,” Dogra said. IVRI did not clarify details of the samples sent to them. Responding to the allegations, Delhi Zoo director Buxy said that all procedures were followed. “Senior vets were consulted over video conferencing and three vets were attending to her 24x7. The IVRI report clearly mentioned that the death was caused due to old age and renal failure. She was the oldest cat of the zoo,” Buxy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-zoo-s-oldest-tiger-dies-of-renal-failure-tests-negative-for-covid-19/story-Qb0J3oOwKQSmmHXdZPWJRJ.html
25-04-2020||Delhi||233 from the containment zones test positive, Delhi govt data shows||Of 5,360 samples, collected from people with flu-like symptoms in Delhi’s 92 containment zones, 233 have tested positive, according to the data shared by the Delhi government. To understand the spread of the infection, the government had decided to conduct 20,000 RT-PCR tests in the community.“This is clearly community transmission. These people were not the contacts of positive cases but those with symptoms living in the area. Now, the government needs to determine the number of positive cases in the community — by randomly picking a representative sample including those without any symptoms. Containing the infection by quarantining those suspected to have it will not be enough and such a test will help in determining further actions,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.On Friday, Delhi reported 138 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), taking the tally to 2,514. Of these, 857 people have recovered from the infection. Three more deaths were reported in the Capital, taking the total to 53.Four people with severe Covid-19 infection were administered plasma therapy as part of a trial in the Delhi government’s Lok Nayak Hospital. Two of them have shown recovery and are likely to be shifted out of the intensive care units.Of the 481 people still admitted to the hospitals, 29 are in ICUs, while nine continue to be on the ventilators. Another 880 persons with mild symptoms are admitted to the Covid Care Centres and 75 with moderate symptoms have been admitted to the two Covid-19 health centres.Three doctors of the Safdarjung Hospital also tested positive for the virus on Thursday, according to officials..One healthcare worker from Lok Nayak Hospital tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, two days after a dietician from the hospital had tested positive, leading to the kitchens being closed. A nurse from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences tested positive for the infection, following which around 40 doctors, nurses and other staff of the gastroenterology department were asked to go into quarantine.At least 14 healthcare workers from Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital have tested positive for the infection so far.Another doctor from Lady Hardinge Medical College tested positive, after 11 of the paediatric ICU of the hospital had tested positive for the infection. Two babies — a 45-day old and a 10-month-old — in the ICU had also tested positive. The ICU was shut for sanitisation.A doctor from Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital also tested positive after accidentally coming in contact with a positive patient. The resident doctors from the hospital asked the administration to put in place a protocol to ensure that accidental exposures do not take place.The government on Friday directed all hospitals to refer their Covid-19 positive patients in need of dialysis to Lok Nayak Hospital. A committee constituted by the government to look into the security protocol to protect doctors from violence also held a meeting for the first time. The government also ordered that medical facilities be provided at the shelter homes for screening of Covid-19. Guru Teg Bahadur hospital and Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospitals were directed to mobilise teams for Covid-19 Care Centres.Media persons negativeAll 160 media personnel whose samples were collected have tested negative for Covid-19. This was the first batch of media persons who were tested on April 22, after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal made the announcement of testing journalists. The next batch of media persons is likely to be tested on Sunday or Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/233-from-the-containment-zones-test-positive-delhi-govt-data-shows/story-Idtgloa9dhUsmjiWBTzh4J.html
25-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi comes to terms with lockdown as police, govt rush to residents’ aid||Since a national lockdown was imposed from March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19), residents of Delhi have turned to the police, making over 28,000 calls to its helpline, for issues ranging from procuring essentials to traffic restrictions.As per the data, most of the calls — 18,299 of the 28,472 over the last 30 days — were to inquire about curfew passes and movement restrictions. Distress calls, reporting of hunger, non-availability of vegetables, and calls by elderly citizens, who said they were alone and helpless, constituted a majority of the rest.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThere were some unusual calls too, such as one from west Delhi, wherein the caller claimed to have found a cure for Covid-19. The caller, a man, said the disease could be cured by consuming pulp from a tree outside his house. In another call, a resident from north-east Delhi had reported that a nilgai (blue-bull) had entered a field behind his house in Uttar Pradesh and he needed a curfew pass to chase it away.The helpline — 011-23469526 — is run round-the-clock by a team of police personnel from the third floor of the Delhi Police headquarters. While the police received over 150 calls pertaining to hunger and non-availability of food items during the initial days of the lockdown, the number of such distress calls has reduced to around 10-15 over the last few days. On Thursday, police received only two hunger-related distress calls.Also read| Covid-19 lockdown: Finance panel calls for extra support to small businessesAfter the voluntary people’s curfew ended at 9pm on March 22, the Delhi Police imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC, banning movement of more than five persons in the city. The borders were subsequently sealed and vehicular movement was suspended, barring those used in essential services.Delhi has been in lockdown since March 24, as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had made an announcement for the capital a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a nationwide lockdown from March 25.“Most calls to the helpline were related to passes and movement of vehicles. We get more than 500 such calls every day. The volume of such calls touched a high of 778 on April 14, which was the end of the 21-day lockdown. People called from across the city wanting to know if they would be allowed to drive after April 14. The calls again increased on April 20 (749), when other states called relaxed norms,” a police officer said.Also read| CMs’ wishlist: Interstate transport options, fundsBesides the police helpline, the Delhi government’s dedicated Covid-19 helplines — 22391014, 2301028, 22302441, 22307133, 22304568, 22307745, 22307135, 22307145, 22300012, 22300036 — also received similar calls, senior government officials said.“The 10 lines are receiving 900 calls on an average, every day. Some call to report cases, others do so to get themselves tested. We also get a large number of queries with regard​ to ration, shelters and cooked meals. In that case, we connect their calls to the lines concerned,” a senior government official said, on the condition of anonymity.While many states have relaxed norms by allowing industries, highway hotels and self-employed plumbers, electricians, and mechanics to resume work, the Delhi government has not given any relaxation because of the increase in the number of Covid-19 hot spots. Until Friday evening, Delhi had 90 containment zones, 2,514 positive cases, and 53 deaths.In the first week of the lockdown, the helpline received over 150 calls related to hunger or non-availability of food. The volume of such calls peaked on March 29 (188 calls), when migrant workers from across the city started walking to their homes in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Bihar. The workers were leaving the city after their factories shut. On the afternoon of March 29, the police stopped the migrant workers from leaving and took them to shelter homes across the city where food was provided by the Delhi government and the city police.Asif Mohd Ali, a deputy commissioner of police, who is managing the helpline, said, “Across the city, we have tied up with NGOs and Good Samaritans to feed the needy. The number of hunger calls is gradually decreasing. We will ensure that no one sleeps hungry in Delhi. The moment we get a distress call, we immediately assign it to the police station and the NGO concerned. So far, Delhi has delivered around six million food packets to the needy. We will continue this.”So far, the Delhi government has set up at 2,083 hunger relief centres across the city to provide free cooked lunch and dinner. Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, in an address through a video call, had said his government is providing free cooked meals to at least one million people per day.The government is also giving five kilograms of free dry ration to about four million residents, who do not have ration cards, besides the 7.5kg ration being given to 7.1 million cardholders, for free.The helpline received 60 calls from elderly citizens, who lived alone and wanted help from the police to get essential items or requiring medical assistance. In one such call, a 78-year-old man, who lived alone in Rohini, called the helpline informing that he was a diabetic patient and was in pain, because his stock of medicines was over. A police constable duly delivered the medicines to him.In March-end, the helpline was also flooded with calls from citizens who wanted to be united with their families living in other parts of the city. After recording around 100 such calls in the first few days, the volume of such calls has decreased. “We advised such callers to stay at home, as it is a safer option. They understood it,” Ali said.Sanjay Kumar, a professor and the director of the Centre for Study of Developing Studies, said that Delhi residents have responded well to the lockdown and followed the government directives. “If 500 people have called the helpline for passes, I have no reason to doubt their genuineness. Delhi is a large city. People are bound to have their compulsions to step out of their homes. I can say that people took the lockdown in good spirit also because of the fear. People realised how developed countries failed in their response. The fear factor was high among the middle class.”However, Kumar says that a decrease in the number of hunger-related calls may not reveal the entire story. “I saw reports of police cutting cake for elderly residents in lockdown and other similar reports or feeding the needy. This may be just 10% of the actual cases. Police are also not to blame because they have other primary stuff, such as law and order and managing containment zones, to handle. On the government’s role, the response is better than other places. But it may also be because Delhi is smaller than other states.

25-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: Social distancing will help curb this crisis, says Kiran Desai, Tourist bus operator||Kiran Desai (43) a prominent tour operator in the city performed the task of transporting busloads of Germans and South Koreans from Pune to the international airport in Mumbai for their flights back home. This was done at the request of the embassies of the respective nations and special permits were issued for his staff and buses to undertake this responsibility. He spoke of this experience.What exactly is your role in this pandemic?I had the responsibility of transporting all the South Korean and German nationals from Pune to Mumbai international airport as they were asked to leave India by their employers. The embassies had made the necessary flight arrangements to take them back to their countries. My buses and staff were given special passes and permits to pick up the foreigners from different parts of Pune. So far we have helped in the transportation of around 500 expats from Pune to Mumbai airport.How does your day begin and roll out?My day begins with some basic exercises and physio. As the situation demands, I plan for the trips to Mumbai international airport and when at home, I follow all the rules of isolation and lockdown.What precautions are you taking?Keeping social distance is the most important precaution which I am currently taking, especially as I am supposed to go out for my critical duties. Whenever I return home, I ensure that I am completely sanitised. I also use the mask for as a basic precaution.What is your view of the situation in Pune?In the early part of the lockdown people just didn’t seem to understand the idea of staying at home. I wish everyone followed this rule as it would help the Pune Municipal Corporation in a big way to do their work. In fact, people can use this time to do the things they want to do and stay healthy at home. Social distancing is what is going to help curb this crisis.What gaps do you see in health and relief work?The biggest gap that I saw in the early weeks of the lockdown was the non-adherence to social distancing. We are very proud that Pune is a centre of education so it is assumed that all educated people are staying back at home following the orders issued by local government. However, this was violated, at least in the initial weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/social-distancing-is-what-is-going-to-help-curb-this-crisis/story-Ahj4eEhivJ3SLvaDPjwjBP.html

25-04-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER chalking out plan to test all incoming patients for Covid||The management of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), the region’s biggest public-funded tertiary healthcare centre, is chalking out a detailed strategy to start testing all incoming patients for coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Dr Ashok Kumar, official spokesperson, said the decision for screening and testing patients had been taken, but the institute was doing its homework before taking the huge step. “The process is being finalised and operational modalities are being developed. The process will be completed by Monday,” he said.The decision comes in the wake of the death of a six-month-old girl who was tested positive for Covid-19 in a routine pre-operative test for a cardiac ailment, following which 54 healthcare workers were tested. They were later found negative. The faculty association of the institute, which represents nearly 600 doctors in 45 departments, had also requested the management to take the decision for the protection of healthcare workers.CHALLENGE AWAITS OPDsThe premier health institute provides super-specialty healthcare services, mostly for the cardiac, paediatrics and ophthalmology departments which are normally visited by around 10,000 patients daily. Several patients are from far-off places like Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh as well as from neighbouring Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.Therefore, the institute faces a real challenge after the out-patient department (OPD) services, shut after the Covid outbreak in the city since March 19, are restored.The institute also has 1,948 beds where the average occupancy remains 107%. Dr JS Thakur, president of the faculty association, said, “Social distancing is not possible in the cramped space of the OPD building. So, there is a need for restoring the referral status of the institute where only patients who actually need advanced care are registered. Such system needs to be developed otherwise social distancing will go for a toss.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-chalks-out-plan-to-test-all-patients-for-covid/story-I7gBiUWXGGcZyqvVrqHckJ.html

25-04-2020||Pune||Shooter Rahi Sarnobat has set her target on more Olympics after Tokyo 2021||The coronavirus lockdown restrictions have left shooter Rahi Sarnobat to follow dry fire practice and focus on physical and mental training at her home in Kolhapur.The Tokyo Olympics qualifier, now scheduled in 2021, is confident of delivering her best in the international event.“I have a different way to look at the current scenario. It is a good time to rest and get back to shooting in the latter half of the year. Most of the shooters were practising continuously since 2018 so this break will help us to get recharged and deliver a strong performance,” said Sarnobat, who won gold at the Shooting World Cup in Munich, Germany, in the 25 metre pistol event in May 2019 to secure her Olympics berth.“Why should I get nervous of the Olympics postponement? The event will not be my last one as I aim to represent India in at least 5-6 more Olympics. Shooting has an advantage over other sports because age is not a factor here,” said the 29-year-old shooter who trains at Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex range in Balewadi. She left for her Kolhapur home on March 20 after the Shooting World Cup in Delhi was postponed to May and later cancelled.“All the international tournaments have been cancelled for the year and we don’t have any domestic tournaments till September. The situation is uncertain and we cannot do anything about it,” said Sarnobat.“I can set up a 25 metre range at home, but it is not allowed in my residential area. It is better to focus on other aspects of the game like improving body balance, physical techniques and overcome the challenges that I used to face while competing in the past,” she said.Since 2017, Sarnobat was training under the German-Mongolian coach Munkhbayar Dorjsuren and her contract was to end in 2020 after the Olympics, but with the event postponed by a year, she is yet to decide on whether to extend the contract or not.“I always wanted a coach for a specific period of time to work on a few aspects of my game which has now improved. So, let’s see how everything works out,” said Sarnobat, who is spending so much time at home for the first time after 2006.“Parents are happy. We have a joint family of nine members and three of them are of my age so I am having a good time playing board games or cricket inside home. A lot of fun activities await when I am done with my training session every day,” Sarnobat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sarnobat-has-set-her-target-on-more-olympics-after-tokyo-2021/story-ewH775uEk2XpFP9repMQPM.html

In Nakodar, around 300 patients registered themselves with the community health centre this month against 10 patients in March.Similarly, the Shahkot OOAT centre registered 50 patients this month against 17 last month and Phillaur registered 150 patients against 40 last month.Due to increasing footfall of drug addicts, the staff is concerned about their safety in the absence of security staff and PPE kits.“Staff members have not been provided PPE kits though Jalandhar is one of the hotspots. It is a risky job as we have to collect new patients samples to check them for HIV,” said a worker, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-shortage-of-narcotics-1-500-patients-join-de-addiction-centres-in-jalandhar-in-one-month/story-o5lxlk1SlwCMTD4w5j8HgP.html

25-04-2020||World||Singapore reports 618 new coronavirus cases; total infections at 12,693||Singapore on Saturday reported 618 new cases of the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of infections to 12,693 with 12 deaths in the country. A majority of the new cases -- 597 -- are among the work permit holders residing in dormitories for foreign workers, including Indian nationals, who work in the labour-intensive construction sector. Another 12 are work permit holders living outside of dormitories, said the Health Ministry. Seven of the cases are Singaporeans (citizens) or permanent residents (foreigners) with two on work passes or long-term visit passes (foreigners). The Northpoint City shopping mall has been declared a virus cluster, taking the total count to seven. A cluster is considered a place which spreads the killer disease. Thousands of people across the island-nation on Saturday sang and cheered essential service providers and migrant workers, reported The Straits Times. Singing residents waved torchlights at their windows and balconies, largely from the public housing estates mostly built by foreign workers as it has been widely acknowledged here. The cheering and applause was broadcast on SPH Radio, Mediacorp TV channels and social media platforms in the evening. The performance was led by local composer Dick Lee, singers Rahimah Rahim, Shabir and Taufik Batisah, a 900-strong choir from non-profit arts group Voices of Singapore, as well as other artists. Meanwhile, Manpower Minister Josphine Teo explained Singapore’s difficult decision to suspend all construction work. Singapore is currently in a “circuit breaker” period to stem the spread of Covid-19. The period was at first scheduled to end on May 4 but will now last until June 1. All non-essential work places have been ordered to stay closed and residents are barred from leaving the house except to buy food and groceries or to exercise alone in the neighbourhood, Channel News Asia reported. In a Facebook post, Teo said, “If we act fast, we’re aware there’s little time for employers to adjust. If we act too slowly, there is risk of wider transmission. “This is the difficult trade-off,” The Straits Times had the minister saying in the post. Her explanation comes in the wake of social media posts and text messages that had circulated over the last two days highlighting the frustrations of some employers. The tighter measures, which kicked in on April 22, mean that migrant workers will not be allowed to step out of all dormitories for any purpose including going to work. The measures will apply to all companies, even those that had earlier obtained licences to operate. Stay-home notices have been given to all 1,80,000 construction work permit and S Pass holders and their dependants. “But without it, they could still be out and about. Should we have avoided this move? Should more time have been given? We will never really know, but time is not on our side. “Given how quickly and widely the virus spreads, can we afford to wait? If there’s anything we have learnt about the virus, taking action sooner is probably better than later,” Teo was quoted as saying. A total of 25 dormitories, housing foreign workers, have been gazetted as isolation areas. The coronavirus has so far infected more than 2.8 million people and killed nearly 2,00,000 globally. The US is the worst hit with over 51,000 deaths and more than 905,000 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.In Singapore, the total number of cases are 12,693 with 12 deaths due to the deadly infection, The Straits Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-reports-618-new-coronavirus-cases-total-infections-at-12-693/story-pplB9GrPvIYHJ0PRnls8qJ.html

One Atlanta hair salon tested everyone’s temperature as they entered, while a nail boutique northwest of the city required clients to sign waivers before receiving manicures.Kemp’s reopening plan has met with criticism from some business owners and residents in the Peach State who voiced fears it is too soon.Several businesses with permission to open, including some fitness centers and hair salons, remained shuttered in Atlanta Friday.“Believe in Science, Not Kemp,” said a sign displayed by a person who honked repeatedly while driving past the governor’s mansion. “Stay Home, Stay Safe,” read another.Eden Lio, a restaurant hostess and bookbinder who lost both her jobs in the crisis, was nonetheless participating in the rolling protest.“We’re going to get more sick if we open today,” the 20-year-old said through her cloth mask. “We’re not ready at all.”Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms echoed that sentiment and urged residents of the capital city to stay home.With the state’s infection numbers and deaths rising, she said it was “irresponsible” to allow businesses to open now.“There is nothing essential about going to a bowling alley or giving a manicure in the middle of a pandemic,” she told ABC News in a denunciation of Kemp’s order.Some in Atlanta, however, cherished the opportunity to re-engage with society.“I actually had a great time, a beaming Tili Banks, 41, said as she and a friend emerged from one of the few bowling allies that opened Friday.“I was just so happy to be out that I didn’t even realize I had these people’s bowling shoes on when I walked outside,” she said.The United States is the country hardest-hit by the virus, with more than 890,000 confirmed cases and 51,017 deaths as of late Friday, according to a toll by Johns Hopkins University.- 22,000 Georgia cases -Georgia’s bid to jumpstart thousands of teetering businesses is the most aggressive return-to-normalcy effort in the nation.Restaurants, theatres and private social clubs can open from Monday, provided social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines are in place.But there is concern that easing shelter-in-place orders too early could trigger new outbreaks.Georgia’s coronavirus figures are far lower than those in New York, the US epicenter, but they are substantial.The state has more than 22,400 confirmed cases with 899 deaths, its health department said Friday.With the Trump administration pressing for a return to some form of economic stability, several states have taken steps to ease lockdowns.“We’re opening our country. It’s very exciting to see,” Trump said.In Michigan, Governor Gretchen Whitmer extended her stay-at-home order until May 15, but she eased some restrictions by allowing landscapers and bike mechanics to return to work, and ended prohibitions against golfing and motorboating.Whitmer, a Democrat, had been criticized for imposing limitations seen by many Michiganders as too restrictive.The northern state has recorded more than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-coronavirus-death-toll-tops-50-000-as-some-georgia-businesses-reopen/story-oTwcxVoi2hMQyXSLl2b3pN.html

The deal had been due to be finalized no later than Friday.But Boeing said Saturday it was exercising its right to pull out of a preliminary deal reached in July 2018. It said in a statement, “Embraer did not satisfy the necessary conditions.”“Boeing has worked diligently over more than two years to finalize its transaction with Embraer,” said Marc Allen, the Boeing executive who led the joint venture plan.He said that over the past several months the companies held extensive talks on what he terms unsatisfied conditions in the initial accord. “We all aimed to resolve those by the initial termination date, but it didn’t happen,” Allen said, without explaining what the unresolved issues were.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-scraps-4-2-billion-deal-to-buy-embraer-commercial-division/story-VHPO8d73sxwN46DPwnQ73L.html

Millions of Italians will be allowed to return to workplaces starting on May 4, when lockdown restrictions will be considerably eased.Italy, with some 26,000 reported deaths, most of them of elderly persons, has Europe’s highest toll from COVID-19. In Lombardy, Italy’s most stricken region, prosecutors are investigating about two dozen homes, including one in Milan where some 200 residents died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-to-ease-covid-19-lockdown-on-may-4-give-free-masks/story-Z9tKNJW7ULhkpFIXPiCAVJ.html
25-04-2020||World||UK Covid-19 toll crosses 20,000 as robots, drones deployed||The UK-wide death toll crossed the grim milestone of 20,000 deaths on Saturday, as practices and plans for greater use of robots and drones to deliver essential supplies were fast-tracked, particularly for the benefit of health professionals dealing with the pandemic.Figures released on Saturday show 20,319 deaths and 148,377 cases, bringing into sharp focus the March 17 claim of the chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance that deaths below 20,000 would be “horrible”, but a “good outcome”. There were little signs of the toll limiting around that figure.Drones and robots have been pressed into service in some areas of England. Robots have been used in the town of Milton Keynes for nearly two years to deliver groceries, but more have been deployed to deliver supplies to health professionals who have less time to shop.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageTransport secretary Grant Shapps announced trial from Monday to deliver essential medical supplies by drone from the mainland to the Isle of Wight on the south coast of England. It involves a drone with a payload of up to 100 kg and distance capability of more than 1,000 km.The drone with space similar to that in a car boot will takeoff from Southampton or Portsmouth and deliver supplies to the St Mary’s Hospital near Newport on the Isle of Wight. The project is likely to rolled out in other remote places.In Milton Keynes, Starship, the company that produces delivery robots, has seen a surge in demand for robots carrying items within a 6km radius. Parcels, groceries and food are directly delivered from stores, at the time that the customer requests via a mobile app. Once ordered the robots’ entire journey and location is monitored on a smartphone.Henry Harris-Burland of Starship told the media: “Right now we are offering free delivery to all NHS workers within the community. We want to make life a little bit easier for these people in these very, very stressful times”.“Lots of them are doing ... 80-hour weeks and they don’t have time to go to the local grocery store, so they use our robots for their shopping. We’re honoured that we can be part of that solution.”Noting the challenge of ferrying supplies to the Isle of Wight, Maggie Oldham of the local NHS Trust said: “This work (drone trial) has the potential to significantly improve services for our local community by reducing waiting times for test results and speeding up the transfer of important, possibly life-saving medication.”Various types of unmanned aircraft are to be trialled to see how they could improve the movement of medical supplies between the three hospitals in Hampshire – Southampton General Hospital, Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth and St Mary’s Hospital on the Isle of Wight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robots-drones-deployed-as-uk-covid-19-death-toll-set-to-cross-20-000/story-5JveUOxiyuk8Uyivr9kIQN.html
25-04-2020||World||Boris Johnson aide attended key science meetings on coronavirus, sparks row||Britain’s government on Saturday defended the independence of the scientists advising it on coronavirus after it emerged that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s controversial chief aide had attended meetings of the group.Criticism of Johnson’s Conservative government is mounting as the U.K.’s Covid-19 death toll rises and a nationwide lockdown imposed a month ago drags on. The confirmed number of coronavirus-related hospital deaths is likely to reach 20,000 this weekend.After a report in The Guardian, the government confirmed that Johnson adviser Dominic Cummings had attended several meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, or SAGE, and listened to discussions. But it denied the Guardian’s claim that Cummings — who is not a scientist — was a member of the group.Cummings is a contentious figure, a self-styled political disruptor who was appointed to a key role by Johnson after masterminding the victorious “leave” campaign during Britain’s 2016 referendum on European Union membership.The government said “SAGE provides independent scientific advice to the government. Political advisers have no role in this.”SAGE is a usually little-known group headed by Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty. The government has declined to publish its full membership, saying that could leave the scientists open to lobbying or other pressure.David King, a former government chief scientific adviser, told The Guardian he was “shocked” to learn political advisers were involved in SAGE meetings. But other scientists who have advised the government said it was usual for political aides to attend, though only as observers.The main opposition Labour Party said Cummings’ attendance raised questions about the credibility of government decision-making.“The best way to clear all of this up is for the government to be completely transparent with us and publish the minutes of the SAGE committee,” said Labour health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth.The government says its response to the pandemic has been guided by scientific advice. That advice is under increasing scrutiny by critics who accuse the government of being slow to respond to the outbreak. Britain imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 23, later than in many other European countries. The measures have been extended until at least May 7.As of Friday, 19,506 people with the coronavirus had died in British hospitals. The figure does not include deaths in nursing homes, which are likely to number in the thousands.Scientists say the U.K. has reached the peak of the pandemic but is not yet out of danger. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 is declining, and the number of daily deaths peaked on April 8.As fears recede that the health system will be overwhelmed, opponents are stepping up their attacks on Johnson’s Conservative government over shortages of protective equipment for medical workers and a lack of testing for the virus.Meanwhile, health authorities urged Britons not to ignore symptoms of conditions other than the coronavirus, amid fears that cancer and other illnesses are going untreated.Public Health England said visits to hospital emergency departments have fallen by almost 50% in April from the same month last year. The charity Cancer Research UK estimated that 2,250 new cases of the disease could be going undetected each week, partly because people are reluctant to go to hospitals for fear of catching the virus or overburdening the system.The National Health Service encouraged people to seek urgent help if needed and to continue to attend services such as cancer screening and maternity appointments.NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said “ignoring problems can have serious consequences — now or in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-aide-attended-key-science-meetings-on-coronavirus-sparks-row/story-BrOmCjHEBKpuiNfmaRr0pO.html
25-04-2020||World||Saudi Arabia abolishes flogging||Saudi Arabia has abolished flogging as a punishment, the supreme court announced, hailing the latest in a series of “human rights advances” made by the king and his powerful son.Court-ordered floggings in Saudi Arabia -- sometimes extending to hundreds of lashes -- have long drawn condemnation from human rights groups.But they say the headline legal reforms overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have brought no let-up in the conservative Islamic kingdom’s crushing of dissent, including through the use of the death penalty.The Saudi supreme court said the latest reform was intended to “bring the kingdom into line with international human rights norms against corporal punishment”.Previously the courts could order the flogging of convicts found guilty of offences ranging from extramarital sex and breach of the peace to murder.In future, judges will have to choose between fines and/or jail sentences, or non-custodial alternatives like community service, the court said in a statement seen by AFP on Saturday.The most high-profile instance of flogging in recent years was the case of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi who was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes in 2014 for “insulting” Islam.He was awarded the European parliament’s Sakharov human rights prize the following year.The abolition of corporal punishment in Saudi Arabia comes just days after the kingdom’s human rights record was again in the spotlight following news of the death from a stroke in custody of leading activist Abullah al-Hamid, 69.Hamid was a founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) and was sentenced to 11 years in jail in March 2013, campaigners said.He was convicted on multiple charges, including “breaking allegiance” to the Saudi ruler, “inciting disorder” and seeking to disrupt state security, Amnesty International said.Criticism of Saudi Arabia’s human rights record has grown since King Salman named his son Prince Mohammed crown prince and heir to the throne in June 2017.The October 2018 murder of vocal critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and the increased repression of dissidents at home have overshadowed the prince’s pledge to modernise the economy and society.

That makes her the oldest survivor of the pandemic outbreaks in Spain, along with one of the oldest worldwide, behind the likes of 107-year-old Dutch survivor, Cornelia Ras.Her daughter-in-law, Paqui Sanchez was further quoted by Malaga Hoy, another local media source, that her family was very grateful for everything the hospital staff had done. But, she said that authorities were taking it slow and being cautious with her mother-in-law’s health, due to her old age.“Her doctors tell us that she has very good results, but you have to be very careful,” she told the Malaga-based news paper.“She eats alone, some days more and other days less”“She also goes on short walks with her walker,” she said further.According to other media reports, two other 101-year-old women have also recovered from disease in Spain.There have been a total of 22,524 official Covid-19-related fatalities since the pandemic hit Spain, while 92,355 patients have recovered from the illness and have been discharged from hospital.However, the health ministry reported on Friday that the tally of daily Covid-19- related deaths was registered at 367, which is the lowest number since March 21, when there were 324 fatalities.As per the data cited by US-based Johns Hopkins University, more than 195,000 people have died due to the pandemic, with 2.7 million infected globally, out of whom almost some 781,000 have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/she-survived-spanish-flu-in-1918-now-107-year-old-beat-covid-19/story-Z3KGjde5bY8cDgCOZpTzIK.html

People issued such a certificate could ignore public-health guidance, increasing the risk of the disease spreading further.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWhile many countries are currently testing for antibodies, these studies aren’t designed to determine whether people recovered from the disease acquire immunity, the WHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-you-may-catch-coronavirus-more-than-once/story-MH5AzOomCBgUPme3s9mrgK.html

Sign this petition and please share with your friends,” she added. “Sign our petition to stop the Chinese Communist government’s deception and manipulation. We need Congress to act NOW to prevent China’s growing influence,” the petition said. Among other things, the petition urges members of Congress to probe whether China covered up the coronavirus outbreak, end the United States’ reliance on China for critical medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, make China pay its fair share to the United Nations, back Taiwan against China’s bullying, and mandate all US colleges to disclose Chinese funding. Early this week, she called for an emergency Security Council meeting on China’s involvement and knowledge of the virus. Haley has been a fierce critic of China. “As soon as the UN opens again, the US should call for an emergency Security Council meeting on China’s involvement and knowledge of the virus. When did they know & decisions made. If ever the was a time to have a world discussion, it would be following this pandemic,” Haley said in a tweet. Responding to her tweet, the Chinese Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun asserted that his country has nothing to hide. “All the facts are on the table. Epidemics may occur anywhere. The most important thing is to defeat the virus and save lives. China has done its job and is now working hard in helping others. Attempts of scapegoating or stigma go nowhere,” Zhang said. If that is the case, Haley argued than China would have no problem in a Security Council meeting on the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m assuming you would have no problem expressing that in a Security Council meeting. Other countries including the US have some questions we would like answered,” Haley said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-nikki-haley-launches-stop-communist-china-campaign/story-wP25pdxMpqpMKEc8CbiVMN.html
25-04-2020||World||Trump’s temporary Green Card ban aims to ‘turn off the faucet’ of new immigrant labour: Report||President Donald Trump’s executive order to temporarily halt issuance of green cards aims to “turn off the faucet” of new immigrant labour and is the beginning of a broader strategy to reduce the flow of foreigners into the US, architect of Trump’s immigration agenda Stephen Miller has said.President Trump signed the executive order on Wednesday to suspend certain types of immigration into the US for 60 days to protect the jobs of Americans laid off due to the Covid-19 pandemic that has ravaged the country’s economy.According to a report in The Washington Post, Miller spoke to a group of Trump surrogates on Thursday in an off-the-record call about the new executive order and told them that the president’s new executive order curbing immigration will usher in the broader long-term changes to immigration into America.Miller told the group that subsequent measures were under consideration that would restrict guest worker programmes, but the executive order turns the faucet off of new immigrant labour coming into the country.“The first and most important thing is to turn off the faucet of new immigrant labour — mission accomplished — with signing that executive order,” he said, according to a recording obtained by the leading American daily.The report said that Miller indicated that the strategy was part of a long-term vision and not seen only as a stopgap.“As a numerical proposition, when you suspend the entry of a new immigrant from abroad, you’re also reducing immigration further because the chains of follow-on migration that are disrupted,” said Miller, one of the executive order’s main authors.“So the benefit to American workers compounds with time,” he said.The report also said that the Trump administration had been trying for years to scrap the family-based US immigration model, which Miller has called “chain migration” that enables US citizens and the Green Card holders to bring in parents, adult children and siblings into the US. Last year, the State Department issued about 460,000 immigrant visas, and more than half were in the categories the order halts. Instead, the White House favours a more restrictive system based on job skills and US labour market demands.“Miller has been the leading proponent of the argument that immigrants compete for jobs with US workers and depress their wages. The argument is anathema to many economists and pro-business Republicans who argue that immigration fuels long-term US growth and keeps US industries competitive,” the report said. Immigration was one of the main promises Trump made to his supporters while running for the US President. Ken Cuccinelli, who serves as acting deputy homeland security secretary and joined Miller on the call, said Trump had been considering an immigration freeze long before his tweet Monday night announcing his plans to “temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” “This is something the president has been looking at himself since the economic effects of the Covid-19 virus began. We’ve had numerous conversations with him. And so what you saw yesterday was a continuation of his own thinking,” said Cuccinelli, who spoke less than Miller during the 23-minute call.The report added that Miller was involved in crafting and selling the executive order, working quietly without many others in the administration knowing. Senior White House officials said the memo had not been vetted by lawyers or top officials before the president tweeted that he would be signing it.“All around the country, Americans of every political stripe will rally behind an initiative to make sure that they, their children, their parents, their husbands, wives, sons, uncles, nephews, cousins can be the first to get a job when it opens up, to get her old job back when they rehire or to keep their job if they already have one.“Those individuals have a right and an expectation to get their jobs back and not to be replaced by foreign workers. That’s the action the president took, it is historic. It is vital, it is necessary, it is patriotic and it deserves the full-throated support of everybody on this call,” ,” Miller said during the call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-temporary-green-card-ban-aims-to-turn-off-the-faucet-of-new-immigrant-labour-report/story-UJ0cETwYO69JEu1nDusR8K.html
25-04-2020||World||US states begin easing Covid-19 lockdowns||The US states of Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska began loosening lockdown orders on their pandemic-wounded businesses, even as the confirmed US death toll from the coronavirus soared past 50,000 and despite warnings from health experts that such steps may be coming too early.The news came as the outbreak appeared to continue to subside in much of Asia. In China, where the virus was first detected late last year, authorities on Saturday reported no new deaths for the 10th straight day, along with just 12 new cases, 11 of them brought from overseas and one local transmission in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang bordering Russia, according to the National Health Commission.Just 838 people remain hospitalized in China with Covid-19 while another 1,000 are undergoing isolation and monitoring for being either suspected cases or having tested positive for the virus while showing no symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,632 deaths among 82,816 cases.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSouth Korea reported 10 fresh cases, the eighth day in a row its daily jump came below 20. There were no new deaths for the second straight day.India announced the easing of a stringent lockdown for 1.3 billion people with the reopening of neighborhood and standalone shops. India has reported more than 24,500 cases and 775 deaths. Last week, it allowed resumption of manufacturing and farming activities in rural areas as millions of daily wage earners were left without work.In France, the government is leaving families to decide whether to keep children at home or send them back to class when the nationwide lockdown, in place since March 17, starts to be lifted on May 11.As in many countries, the tourism industry in France has been ravaged by the pandemic and a French hotel executive predicted his business will remain “catastrophic” for the rest of this year.“Zero percent (occupancy) in April, probably in May and probably in June,” Serge Cachan, president of the Astotel chain of Paris hotels, told The Associated Press. With estimated losses this year of 60-70%, Cachan said he is counting on government help to survive.Click here for Covid-19 updatesBelgium announced that after May 3, hospitals will progressively open to some non-essential tasks and textile shops also will be allowed to reopen as the country begins relaxing safeguards. Denmark has reopened schools for the youngest grads, while in Spain, parents face the decision of whether to let kids get their first fresh air in weeks when the country on Sunday starts to ease the total ban on letting them outside.Britain was still holding off on changes to its lockdown as the coronavirus-related death toll in hospitals fast approaches 20,000. It’s the fourth highest in Europe, behind Italy, Spain and France, each of which has reported more than 20,000 deaths.In the U.S., Republican governors in Georgia and Oklahoma allowed salons, spas and barbershops to reopen, while Alaska opened the way for restaurants to resume dine-in service and retail shops and other businesses to open their doors, all with limitations. Some Alaska municipalities chose to maintain stricter rules.Though limited in scope, and subject to social-distancing restrictions, the reopenings marked a symbolic milestone in the debate raging in the United States and beyond as to how quickly political leaders should lift economically devestating lockdown orders.During a White House press briefing Friday, President Donald Trump spoke optimistically of the economy but also asked people to continue social distancing and using face coverings. The same day, Trump signed a $484 billion bill to aid employers and hospitals under stress from the pandemic. Over the past five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid, or about 1 in 6 US workers.Trump also said his widely criticized comments suggesting people can ingest or inject disinfectant to fight Covid-19 was an attempt at sarcasm.The coronavirus has killed more than 190,000 people worldwide, including — as of Friday — more than 50,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from government figures. The actual death toll is believed to be far higher.Amy Pembrook and her husband, Mike, reopened their hair salon in the northwest Oklahoma town of Fairview after it had been shuttered for about a month.“We’re super excited about going back, but we have caught a little flak from people who say it’s too early,” Amy Pembrook said. “We just said we can live in fear for a long time or we can trust that everything is going to be OK.”Without a tried-and-tested action plan for how to pull countries out of coronavirus lockdown, the world is seeing a patchwork of approaches. Schools reopen in one country, stay closed in others; face masks are mandatory in some places, a recommendation elsewhere.Meanwhile, testing continues to lag across the United States. To date, according to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project, just under 4.7 million people have been tested in the country of 330 million. Researchers at Harvard University have estimated a minimum of 500,000 daily tests are needed, and possibly much more, in order to safely reopen the economy.In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis said his administration plans to let pharmacists administer virus tests to reach a broader range of people, including those with no symptoms who believe they may have been exposed.In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer lengthened her stay-at-home order through May 15, while lifting restrictions so some businesses can reopen and the public can participate in outdoor activities such as golf and motorized boating. Michigan has nearly 3,000 deaths related to Covid-19, behind only New York and New Jersey.New York reported its lowest number of daily Covid-19 deaths in weeks on Friday.

But avalanches and more snowfall since have made it too dangerous to launch a proper hunt. Police returned to the area on Friday after thawing snow revealed a bag. “Our team then found the body as the snow melted,” Kaski district police chief Dan Bahadur Karki, told AFP. Karki said that no decision has been taken yet whether to resume a full search for the South Koreans. “The snow is still very deep in the area where we suspect the bodies are. We are still discussing what to do next,” he said.Nepal has also been in a coronavirus lockdown for the past month with all trekking permits suspended.Thousands of trekkers visit Nepal every year for its stunning views of the Himalayas and routes lined with picturesque villages. The Annapurna region is particularly popular, with more than 170,000 visitors in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/body-of-guide-of-missing-koreans-found-in-himalayas/story-38LhBwWXqXeYuzHJ5yjBaN.html

Andrew Cuomo, saying the couple hoped it could be used by a doctor or nurse.Cuomo read the entire letter at his daily briefing as an example of courage and generosity in dark times.“I am a retired farmer hunkered down in NE Kansas with my wife who has but one lung and occasional problems with her remaining lung,” read the hand-written letter from Dennis Ruhnke, also signed by his wife, Sharon. “We are in our 70s now and frankly I am afraid for her.”Nevertheless, Ruhnke wrote, the couple had five masks and wished to give one to help New York’s battle against the virus.I received this letter from a farmer in northeast Kansas. His wife is ill and he is aging. He sent me 1 of 5 N95 masks he has from farming to pass on to a doctor or nurse in New York.This is humanity at its best. I share his letter as inspiration. pic.twitter.com/Fa4h5LH9rL“Enclosed find a solitary N-95 mask left over from my farming days. It has never been used” the letter said. “If you could, could you please give this mask to a nurse or a doctor in your city.”Cuomo’s eyes misted as he brandished the mask at his daily briefing.“You want to talk about a snapshot of humanity,” Cuomo said. “You have five masks, what do you do? Do you keep all five? Do you hide the five masks, do you keep them for yourself or others? No, you send one mask. You send one mask to New York for a doctor or nurse. How beautiful is that? How selfless is that? How giving is that?”“It’s that love, that courage, that generosity of spirit that makes this country so beautiful,” Cuomo said. “And it’s that generosity for me makes up for all the ugliness that you see. Take one mask, I’ll keep four.”Reached by telephone, Dennis Ruhnke said he was surprised at the public attention.“Simply watching the news, and day after day after day the death was rising. And they were pushing the N-95 thing so much. I thought I had some masks somewhere. I went back to the farm, dug around in some masks and lo and behold they were there,” he said, adding that he looked up the governor’s address online to send the letter.Ruhnke said he would like to know who ultimately receives the mask.“I would have felt terrible if I threw it away, but it made me feel pretty good to send it on to somebody who might be able to use it,” he said. “They sounded almost desperate for masks. So I thought, it was just one little gesture. But maybe if you get enough of these little gestures, it will all come out for the better in the end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farmer-s-selfless-act-of-donating-mask-wells-up-new-york-governor-s-eyes/story-hrsHPQM8kP2D0I4ucwbxNJ.html

The coronavirus pandemic that started from Wuhan City in China in November, 2019 has so far killed more than 195,000 people across the world and infected more than 27 lakh. The United States, which has been the worst hit by coronavirus alone accounts the highest number so far; wherein more than 9.2 lakh Americans have tested positive for Covid-19 and the fatalities count on Friday stood at 51,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  In fact, the number of Covid-19 cases in the US is more than the next six countries taken together: Spain (219,764), Italy (192,994), France (159,495), Germany (154,545), United Kingdom (144,635) and Turkey (104,912). Despite accounting for the largest number of fatalities, the death rate, however, in the US is much lower than other countries, according to Johns Hopkins University. So far, 51,000 people have died due to COVID-19 in US, followed by Italy (25,969), Spain (22,524), France (22,245), and United Kingdom (19,506). In the United States, New York accounts for the largest number of fatalities (17,671) with 271,890 confirmed cases.Also read| Daily US Covid-19 death toll down sharply to 1,258, lowest in 3 weeks: Report However, the US seems to be past its peak. “Nationwide the per cent of tests that come back positive has declined very significantly,” President Donald Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on coronavirus. Last week, roughly 38 per cent of the tests in New York were positive; this week that number is down to 28 percent. New cases in New York are down 50 per cent compared to a week ago, and fatalities are down 40 per cent over the same period, he said. In Louisiana, the rate of positive test result declined from 25 per cent down to 15 per cent in the last seven days alone. As many as 18 states now show a decline in a number of positive tests in the last seven days which is a very, very significant progress, Trump said. As a result, half of all Americans live in states that have now taken steps to open their economies, Trump said, a day earlier California, Minnesota, and Tennessee announced additional plans to restart certain sectors. “We ask every American to maintain vigilance and hygiene, social distancing, and voluntary use of face coverings. We are opening our country. It’s very exciting to see,” he said.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today Trump said that he spoke to Tim Cook of Apple and that they have a good sense of the market. “He feels it’s going to be a V. The V is sharply upward later on as we actually get it fully open,” he said. Earlier in the day, Trump signed a Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act providing $320 billion to keep American workers on the payroll. Of this $30 billion of the Paycheck Protection funds will be reserved for small financial institutions, including those that serve minority and distressed communities, extending vital relief to thousands of African American and Hispanic American small-business owners and their employees. More than 80 million Americans have already received their payment $3400 for a typical family of four. The CARES Act requires that the federal government send out a notice of what benefits Americans are receiving; to fulfil the requirement the Treasury Department is mailing a letter to him. “It will include the amount of their economic impact payment, how it will arrive direct deposit, check or prepaid debit card as well as a message to the nation letting each American know that we are getting through this challenge together as one American family and that is what has been happening,” Trump said. Observing that 184 countries have been hit by coronavirus, the president said that they are all watching the US. “They are all watching, and they’re calling, and they respect what we are doing so much. I spoke with the leaders of numerous countries today; they are asking if we can send them ventilators, and I am agreeing to do it,” he said. Federal government has over 10,000 ventilators and is helping Mexico, Honduras, Indonesia, France. “We are sending (ventilators) to France, we are sending to Spain, we’re sending to Italy, and we will probably be spending to Germany should they need them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-with-51-000-fatalities-us-records-over-one-fourth-of-global-covid-19-deaths/story-h99XfXNb22p1JS4blSTFVM.html
25-04-2020||World||China sent team including medical experts to advise on Kim Jong Un: Report||China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, according to three people familiar with the situation.The trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting reports about the health of the North Korean leader. Reuters was unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese team signaled in terms of Kim’s health.A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party’s International Liaison Department left Beijing for North Korea on Thursday, two of the people said. The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea.Also Read: Kim Jong-un’s heart care centre has imported machines, doctors trained abroadThe sources declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.The Liaison Department could not be reached by Reuters for comment late on Friday. China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday.Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier this week that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. It cited one unnamed source in North Korea.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicSouth Korean government officials and a Chinese official with the Liaison Department challenged subsequent reports suggesting that Kim was in grave danger after surgery. South Korean officials said they had detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea.On Thursday, US President Donald Trump also downplayed earlier reports that Kim was gravely ill. “I think the report was incorrect,” Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.Also Read: Trump rejects ‘incorrect’ reports on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s healthOn Friday, a South Korean source told Reuters their intelligence was that Kim was alive and would likely make an appearance soon. The person said he did not have any comment on Kim’s current condition or any Chinese involvement.An official familiar with U.S. intelligence said that Kim was known to have health problems but they had no reason to conclude he was seriously ill or unable eventually to reappear in public.A U.S. State department spokeswoman had no comment. U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when asked about Kim’s health on Fox News after Trump spoke said, “I don’t have anything I can share with you tonight, but the American people should know we’re watching the situation very keenly.”North Korea is one of the world’s most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm any details on Kim’s whereabouts or condition.North Korea’s state media last reported on Kim’s whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11. State media did not report that he was in attendance at an event to mark the birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15, an important anniversary in North Korea.Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.When Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, suffered a stroke in 2008, South Korean media reported at the time that Chinese doctors were involved in his treatment along with French physicians.Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping made the first state visit in 14 years by a Chinese leader to North Korea, an impoverished state that depends on Beijing for economic and diplomatic support.China is North Korea’s chief ally and the economic lifeline for a country hard-hit by U.N. sanctions, and has a keen interest in the stability of the country with which it shares a long, porous border.Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack. He has visited China four times since 2018.Trump held unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bid to persuade him to give up North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sent-team-including-medical-experts-to-advise-on-kim-jung-un-report/story-ZpvisufvkwTehcKZhOAv0O.html

25-04-2020||World||Devotees begin a quiet Ramzan in lockdowns||Muslims worldwide began Ramzan on Friday with dawn-to-dusk fasting, but many will have to forgo the communal prayers and family gatherings that make the holy month special, as authorities maintain lockdowns aimed at slowing the coronavirus pandemic.“This is too sad to be remembered in history,” said Belm Febriansyah, a resident in the capital of Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation.Jakarta is the epicentre of the outbreak in the country, which has reported more than 8,200 infections and 689 deaths. Passenger flights and rail services have been suspended, and private cars are banned from leaving the city.Mosques in Indonesia’s deeply conservative Aceh province were packed, however, after its top clerical body ruled that it is not a “red zone” area and that prayers could continue. The province is governed by Islamic law under an autonomy agreement.Muslim-majority countries began imposing widespread restrictions in mid-March, with many cancelling Friday prayers and shuttering holy sites. Saudi Arabia has largely locked down Mecca and Medina and halted the year-round umrah pilgrimage.Muslim-majority Malaysia extended its own lockdown by two more weeks to May 12, although its daily virus cases have dropped significantly in the past week. The country now has 5,603 cases, including 95 deaths.Malaysia, along with neighbouring Singapore and Brunei, has banned popular Ramzan bazaars, where food, drinks and clothing are sold in congested open-air markets or roadside stalls. The bazaars are a key source of income for many small traders, some of whom have shifted their businesses online.In Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan has bowed to pressure from the country’s powerful clerical establishment and allowed mosques to remain open, even as the number of new cases has recently doubled to between 600 and 700 every day.Some clerics have ordered their followers to pack into mosques, saying their faith will protect them.In Turkey, where cases have recently crossed 100,000, authorities have banned the tradition of setting up tents and outdoor tables to provide free meals to the poor.Countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria have partially eased the lockdown but Morocco has announced a night-time curfew for Ramzan as it steps up emergency measures to combat the virus. The North African nation’s Council of Oulemas, the official religious body, called for confinement to be respected during Ramzan.In Bangladesh, the fundamentalist Hefazat-e-Islam group criticised government moves to restrict access to more than 300,000 nationwide mosques and to ban iftar parties. “Quotas on prayer attendance are against Islam,” Mojibur Rahman Hamidi, a Hefazat official, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/devotees-begin-a-quiet-ramzan-in-lockdowns/story-eOa2hboXGI9hzZVcaJeRHK.html
25-04-2020||World||White House could alter virus briefings to limit Trump role||For the first time, President Donald Trump cut off his daily coronavirus task force briefing on Friday without taking any questions from reporters. It may not be the last time.There have been discussions within the White House about changing the format of the briefings to curtail the president’s role, according to four White House officials and Republicans close to the White House who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The briefings often stretch well beyond an hour and feature combative exchanges between Trump and reporters.Trump was angry after a day of punishing headlines Friday, largely about his comment at the previous evening’s briefing wondering if it would be helpful to inject disinfectant into people to fight the coronavirus. That idea drew loud warnings from health experts who said the idea was dangerous and sharp criticism from Democrats.Trump did answer questions from reporters earlier Friday and claimed that his suggestion about disinfectant had been “sarcastic.” That doesn’t square with a transcript of his remarks.For weeks, advisers have been urging the president to scale back his appearances at the briefings, saying that he should come before the cameras only when there is major news or a positive development to discuss, according to the officials. Otherwise, they suggested, he should leave it to Vice President Mike Pence and health officials to take the lead.Trump has been reluctant to cede the spotlight at the briefings, which are the closest thing he currently has to his beloved political rallies. He has talked up their robust television ratings and his ability to dominate the news cycle and drown out his likely general election opponent, Democrat Joe Biden.But advisers have argued that while the briefings may appeal to his most loyal base of supporters, they could be alienating some viewers, including senior citizens worried about their health. Officials at Trump’s reelection campaign have also noted a slip in Trump’s support in some battleground states and have expressed concerns that the briefings, which often contain inaccurate information, may be playing a role.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president had taken “countless questions” earlier in the day from reporters in the Oval Office. “The accessibility and transparency of this President is unprecedented,” she said.Trump, who is known for changing his mind, has not committed to any permanent change in the briefing format, the officials said.It was unclear if Trump’s decision not to take questions on Friday was connected to a kerfuffle in the briefing room moments before the task force presentation began. A White House official had asked that two reporters switch seats, which would have sent the CNN correspondent farther back in the room. CNN is a frequent target of Trump’s criticism.The reporters declined to move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-could-alter-virus-briefings-to-limit-trump-role/story-V3JHea6RWlHzQemykGhVuK.html

COVID-19 anywhere is a threat to people everywhere.”There were few concrete details divulged during the event on how the wide range of partners would roll out the initiative.Von der Leyen, however, announced that the EU and its partners were preparing to organise a “worldwide pledging marathon” with an event on May 4 aimed at raising 7.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) for initial funding for developing diagnostics, treatments and vaccines against Covid-19.“We need to develop as soon as possible a vaccine, produce it and deploy it to every single corner of the world,” she said, also stressing the need to “ramp up work on prevention, diagnostics and treatment.”“The response to this pandemic can only be global.” ‘Leave no one behind’Macron also called for making any vaccine developed “accessible everywhere, including in the most vulnerable countries,” insisting “that is what will allow us to return to normal life as quickly as possible.”Ramaphosa, who serves as chair of the African Union, meanwhile stressed the precarious situation of that continent, which is home to many poor nations, with weak health systems. “Africa is extremely vulnerable to the ravages of this virus and is in need of every possible support and assistance,” he said.Seth Berkley, head of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, acknowledged that it was likely that “without a vaccine we will never defeat this pandemic.”“What this means is that we will need to devise and deliver a vaccine programme to get billions of doses out at a speed and scale never before contemplated, let alone achieved -- the most rapid vaccine deployment in history,” he said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Peter Sands, head of the Global Fund, meanwhile stressed that developing new tools against Covid-19 like vaccines “is essential but not enough.

25-04-2020||World||US regulator FDA warns of heart risks with Trump-promoted malaria drug hydroxychloroquine||The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday warned doctors against prescribing a malaria drug touted by President Donald Trump for treating the new coronavirus except in hospitals and research studies.In an alert, regulators flagged reports of sometimes fatal heart side effects among coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine or the related drug chloroquine. The decades-old drugs, also prescribed for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, can cause a number of side effects, including heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage.The warning comes as doctors at a New York hospital published a report that heart rhythm abnormalities developed in most of 84 coronavirus patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, a combo Trump has promoted.Both drugs are known to sometimes alter the heartbeat in dangerous ways, and their safety or ability to help people with COVID-19 is unknown. A National Institutes of Health experts panel earlier this week recommended against taking that drug combo except in a formal study because of the side effects potential.Last month, the FDA authorized limited use of the malaria drugs for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who aren’t enrolled in ongoing research. The FDA said the drugs’ risks are manageable when patients are carefully screened and monitored by doctors. A number of studies are testing hydroxychloroquine as a treatment or for prevention of COVID-19.Also Read: ICMR study shows side effects of HCQ in health care staffRegulators said they are now investigating dangerous side effects and deaths reported with the malaria drugs to poison control centers and other health authorities.“It is important that health care providers are aware of the risks of serious and potentially life-threatening heart rhythm problems that can occur with these drugs,” the FDA said in a statement. The agency did not specify the number of reports it has received of side effects or deaths.Calls to U.S. poison control centers about the malaria drugs increased last month to 79, compared to 52 in March 2019, according to Dr. Christopher Hoyte of the Rocky Mountain Poison Center in Denver, Colorado. The problems reported include abnormal heart rhythms, seizures, nausea and vomiting, Hoyte said.Trump has repeatedly touted hydroxychloroquine during his regular coronavirus briefings, suggesting its skeptics would be proven wrong. He has offered patient testimonials that the drug is a lifesaver.But a number of early coronavirus studies have suggested problems or no benefit.In Friday’s report in the journal Nature Medicine, doctors at New York University and NYU Langone Health found a significant prolonging of what’s called the heart’s QT interval two to five days after coronavirus patients were given usual doses of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The drugs can alter the QT interval, or the time it takes the heart to charge between beats. When that time is too long, it can trigger a rhythm problem that can lead to sudden death.Nine of the 84 patients had severe prolongation of this interval. Four patients died from organ failure but there was no evidence heart problems contributed. Severe disease or other health problems may play a role in whether the heartbeat abnormality develops, the researchers speculated.The results show how important it is that these drugs only be used in a study where patients are closely tracked, said one independent expert, Dr. Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine specialist at the Fresno branch of the University of California, San Francisco.“That combination really sets you up for having a problem with the heart,” he said. “My colleagues and I are concerned. People are self-medicating and coming down with very predictable side effects on the heart.”Another recent analysis involving 368 patients in U.S. veterans hospitals found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine — and more deaths. The report was not a rigorous test of the drug and results have not yet been reviewed by other scientists but are the largest so far of its use in COVID-19 patients.Last month, the federal government accepted more than 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine donated to the strategic national stockpile by drugmakers Sandoz and Bayer. Since then, more than 14 million doses have been distributed to state and local health officials, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.Accepting the donation required sign off by both the FDA and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a unit of HHS tasked with procuring treatments to combat bioterrorism and infectious diseases.Earlier this week, former BARDA director, Rick Bright, said he was demoted from his job leading the agency because he resisted political pressure to allow widespread use of hydroxychloroquine. He has called for a federal investigation and reinstatement to his original job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-regulator-fda-warns-of-heart-risks-with-trump-promoted-malaria-drug-hydroxychloroquine/story-4vCusXEAhJJk18offuizNN.html
25-04-2020||World||‘Knocks the virus out in one minute’: Trump’s disinfectant claims baffle citizens||Top White House coronavirus advisor Deborah Birx shrank in horror and around the nation comedians sharpened their pens: President Donald Trump had just asked if virus victims couldn’t be injected with disinfectant.Even as a new poll shows most Americans wish the former real estate magnate would leave science to the experts, Trump on Thursday evening hit a new high in the annals of amateur presidential doctoring.Encouraged by tentative findings that summer weather may dampen the novel coronavirus, Trump used his daily live national press briefing to ask whether light could become a medical treatment.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous -- whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light,” Trump said. “Supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way.”Birx and another government medical expert looked on warily. The president wasn’t finished.“Then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks (the virus) out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs.”Birx winced and turned her eyes from the president to the floor.Trump sought to walk back his comments Friday saying he’d been talking “sarcastically” to the journalists, but in fact he was clearly addressing the government officials and there was no sign of sarcasm in his tone.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakAfter 24 hours of controversy, the president attended a short media briefing Friday evening but left without taking any questions -- a rarity.Seeking silver bulletThe novel coronavirus has already killed more than 50,000 Americans, trashed the economy and thrown Trump’s previously strong march to reelection this November into jeopardy.With some predicting a need for drawn-out social distancing and only a slow return to economic health, Trump appears to be in search of a silver bullet.For weeks he has aggressively pushed for use of the malaria treatments chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against the novel coronavirus, even if evidence for their effectiveness is flimsy at best.Also Read: US regulator FDA warns of heart risks with Trump-promoted malaria drug hydroxychloroquineRick Bright, who until this week was head of the US agency trying to develop a real vaccine, says he was fired because he opposed the “misguided” chloroquine crusade.Now the government’s preliminary findings on the effects of sunlight and the approaching summer season have Trump excited.Where the unorthodox idea for sanitizers comes from is less clear -- although the briefing did touch upon the effects of disinfectant chemicals.Trump’s suggestion was quickly savaged in memes and jokes -- as well as by Joe Biden, his presumptive Democratic challenger in November’s election.“I can’t believe I have to say this, but please don’t drink bleach,” tweeted the former vice president. I can’t believe I have to say this, but please don’t drink bleach.Reckitt Benckiser, the British-based manufacturer of Lysol and Dettol, felt compelled to put out a statement setting the record absolutely straight: “Under no circumstances should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route.”‘Super genius’A poll published Thursday showed that most Americans -- and a crushing majority of Democrats -- don’t believe Trump when it comes to the medical emergency facing the country.Only 28 percent prefer Trump to their state and local governments for information on the virus, the AP-NORC poll found. Only 23 percent said they have quite a bit or more trust in the information he gives on the coronavirus.Sixty percent say he should listen to the experts more.Brett McGurk, a veteran diplomat and outspoken Trump opponent who resigned over disagreements on Syria, said Trump won’t change and his aides will never escape the confusion.“On any issue, the crazy will catch up to you,” he wrote on Twitter. “There’s no policy: You’re always a Tweet away from all going sideways.” Watching this clip of Dr. Birx, five of my own observations after serving in the Trump administration:  1. You can’t stay above crazy: On any issue, the crazy will catch up to you2. There’s no policy: You’re always a Tweet away from all going sideways https://t.co/GmWvO5PkzsNew White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany called the disinfectant headlines nonsense, saying Trump has always told Americans to “consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment.”“Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context.”As for Trump, there’s no questioning his self-belief.“I like this stuff. I really get it,” he said in March, early in the crisis, about preparations to fight the virus.Trump said doctors keep asking him “How do you know so much?”“Maybe I have a natural ability,” he mused, recalling that he had an uncle whom he describes as a “great super genius.”“Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/knocks-the-virus-out-in-one-minute-trump-s-disinfectant-claims-baffle-citizens/story-NxKqtVOX38LTD86iZfa6ZP.html
25-04-2020||World||Brazil becoming Covid-19 hotspot as hospitals, morgues, cemeteries struggle to cope||Cases of the new coronavirus are overwhelming hospitals, morgues and cemeteries across Brazil as Latin America’s largest nation veers closer to becoming one of the world’s pandemic hot spots.Medical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse, or already too overwhelmed to take any more patients.Health experts expect the number of infections in the country of 211 million people will be much higher than what has been reported because of insufficient, delayed testing.Meanwhile, President Jair Bolsonaro has shown no sign of wavering from his insistence that COVID-19 is a relatively minor disease and that broad social-distancing measures are not needed to stop it. He has said only Brazilians at high risk should be isolated.In Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, officials said a cemetery has been forced to dig mass graves because there have been so many deaths. Workers have been burying 100 corpses a day — triple the pre- virus average of burials.Ytalo Rodrigues, a 20-year-old driver for a funerary service provider in Manaus, said he had retrieved one body after another for more than 36 hours, without a break. There were so many deaths, his employer had to add a second hearse, Rodrigues said.So far, the health ministry has confirmed nearly 53,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 3,600 deaths. By official counts, the country had its worst day yet on Thursday, with about 3,700 new cases and more than 400 deaths, and Friday was nearly as grim.Experts warned that paltry testing means the true number of infections is far greater. And because it can take more than weeks for tests to be processed, the current numbers actually reflect deaths that happened one or two weeks ago, said Domingos Alves, adjunct professor of social medicine at the University of Sao Paulo who is involved in the project.“We are looking at a photo of the past,” Alves said in an interview last week. “The number of cases in Brazil is therefore probably even greater than what we are predicting.”Scientists from the University of Sao Paulo, University of Brasilia and other institutions say the true number of people infected with the virus as of this week is probably as much as 587,000 to 1.1 million people.The health ministry said in a report earlier this month that it has the capacity to test 6,700 people per day — a far cry from the roughly 40,000 it will need when the virus peaks.“We should do many more tests than we’re doing, but the laboratory here is working at full steam,” said Keny Colares, an infectious disease specialist at the Hospital Sao Jose in northeastern Ceara state who has been advising state officials on pandemic response.Meanwhile, health care workers can barely handle the cases they have.In Rio state, all but one of seven public hospitals equipped to treat COVID-19 are full and can only accept new patients once others have either recovered or died, according to the press office of the health secretariat. The sole facility with vacancy is located a two-hour drive from the capital’s center.At the mouth of the Amazon, the city of Belem’s intensive-care beds are all occupied, according to online media outlet G1. As the number of cases rises in the capital of Para state, its health secretary said this week that at least 200 medical staff had been infected, and it is actively seeking to hire more doctors, G1 reported.On Saturday, the city of Rio plans to open its first field hospital, with 200 beds, half reserved for intensive care. Another hospital erected beside the historic Maracana football stadium will offer 400 beds starting next month.In Ceara’s capital, Fortaleza, state officials said Friday that intensive care units for COVID-19 patients were 92% full, after reaching capacity a week ago. Health experts and officials are particularly worried about the virus spreading into the poorest neighborhoods, or favelas, where people depend on public health care.Edenir Bessa, a 65-year-old retiree from Rio’s working-class Mangueira favela, sought medical attention on April 20; she was turned away from two full urgent care units before gaining admission to a third located 40 kilometers (25 miles) away.Hours later, she was transferred by ambulance almost all the way back, to the Ronaldo Gazzola hospital, according to her son, Rodrigo Bessa. Still, she died overnight, and he had to enter the hospital to identify her body.“I saw a lot of bodies also suspected of COVID-19 in the hospital’s basement,” said Bessa, a nurse at a hospital in another state.The hospital released Edenir’s body with a diagnosis of suspected COVID-19, meaning that her death — like so many others — doesn’t figure into the government’s official tally. A small group of family members gathered for her burial on Wednesday, wearing face masks.“People need to believe that this is serious, that it kills,” Bessa said.Bolsonaro has continued to dismiss health officials’ dire predictions about the virus’s spread in the country. Last week, the president fired a health minister who had supported tough anti-virus measures and replaced him with an advocate for reopening the economy.Bolsonaro’s stance largely echoes that of his counterpart and ally U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been stressing the need to put people back to work as unemployment figures reach Depression-era levels. Unlike Bolsonaro, however, Trump has moderated his skepticism about the virus.The fight to reopen business “is a risk that I run,” Bolsonaro said at the swearing-in of his newly appointed health minister, Nelson Teich. If the pandemic escalates, Bolsonaro said, “it lands on my lap.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-becoming-covid-19-hotspot-as-hospitals-morgues-cemeteries-struggle-to-cope/story-gt9jrcQmFFMvqLVJpRy8nJ.html
25-04-2020||World||3 states ease lockdowns; US Covid-19 toll passes 50,000||Even as the confirmed US death toll from the coronavirus soared past 50,000, Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska began loosening lockdown orders Friday on their pandemic-wounded businesses, despite warnings from health experts that the gradual steps toward normalcy might be happening too soon.Republican governors in Georgia and Oklahoma allowed salons, spas and barbershops to reopen, while Alaska opened the way for restaurants to resume dine-in service and retail shops and other businesses to open their doors, all with limitations. Some Alaska municipalities chose to maintain stricter rules.Though limited in scope, and subject to social-distancing restrictions, the reopenings marked a symbolic milestone in the debate raging in the United States — and the world — as to how quickly political leaders should lift economically damaging lockdown orders.Similar scenarios have been playing out worldwide and will soon proliferate in the US as other governors wrestle with conflicting priorities. Their economies have been battered by weeks of quarantine-fueled job losses and soaring unemployment claims, yet health officials warn that lifting stay-at-home orders now could spark a resurgence of Covid-19.During a White House press briefing Friday, President Donald Trump spoke optimistically of the economy but also asked people to continue social distancing and using face coverings.“We’re opening our country. It’s very exciting to see,” Trump said.The coronavirus has killed more than 190,000 people worldwide, including — as of Friday — more than 50,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from government figures. The actual death toll is believed to be far higher.New cases are surging in Africa and Latin America as outbreaks subside in some places that were hit earlier.In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt authorized personal-care businesses to open, citing a decline in the number of people being hospitalized for Covid-19. Those businesses were directed to maintain social distancing, require masks and frequently sanitize equipment.Still, some of the state’s largest cities, including Norman, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, were opting to keep their bans in place until at least the end of April.Amy Pembrook and her husband, Mike, reopened their hair salon in the northwest Oklahoma town of Fairview after it had been shuttered for about a month.“We’re super excited about going back, but we have caught a little flak from people who say it’s too early,” Amy Pembrook said. “We just said we can live in fear for a long time or we can trust that everything is going to be OK.”With deaths and infections still rising in Georgia, many business owners planned to stay closed despite Gov. Brian Kemp’s assurance that hospital visits and new cases have leveled off enough for barbers, tattoo artists, massage therapists and personal trainers to return to work with restrictions.Kemp’s timeline to restart the economy proved too ambitious even for Trump, who said he disagrees with the fellow Republican’s plan.On Friday, Trump signed a $484 billion bill to aid employers and hospitals under stress from the pandemic — the latest federal effort to help keep afloat businesses that have had to close or scale down. Over the past five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid, or about 1 in 6 US workers.Without a tried-and-tested action plan for how to pull countries out of coronavirus lockdown, the world is seeing a patchwork of approaches. Schools reopen in one country, stay closed in others; face masks are mandatory in some places, a recommendation elsewhere.Kids still attend soccer practice in Sweden while they are not even allowed outside in Spain. As governments and scientists struggle with so many unknowns, individuals are being left to take potentially life-affecting decisions.In Georgia, David Huynh had 60 clients booked for appointments at his nail salon in Savannah, but a clothing store, jewelry shop and chocolatier that share a street corner with his downtown business, Envy Nail Bar, remained closed.“The phone’s been ... ringing off the hook,” Huynh said. “We’ve probably gotten hundreds of calls in the last hour.”Four women clutching face masks were waiting outside when the salon opened for the first time since March 26.“Yes, I am ready to get my nails fixed,” said Alina Davis, a police officer for the local school system, who kept working throughout the crisis.Meanwhile, Nikki Thomas is overdue for a visit to her hair stylist, but she’s barely ventured outside her house in the six weeks since she’s been working from home. She had no plans to change that now just because of Kemp’s decision.“It’s obviously extremely stupid and I’m simultaneously exhausted and so angry I can barely see straight,” Thomas, 40, said in a phone interview.The gradual reopenings come as coronavirus testing continues to lag across the United States. To date, according to data compiled by the Covid Tracking Project, just under 4.7 million people have been tested in the country of 330 million people.A lack of tests and supplies has hampered the US effort from the beginning. About 193,000 people were tested on Thursday. That’s an increase from the two-week daily average of 163,000, but far less than what public health experts estimate is needed to get a handle on the virus.Researchers at Harvard have estimated a minimum of 500,000 daily tests are needed, and possibly much more, in order to safely reopen the economy.In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer lengthened her stay-at-home order through May 15, while lifting restrictions so some businesses can reopen and the public can participate in outdoor activities such as golf and motorized boating.Michigan has nearly 3,000 deaths related to Covid-19, behind only New York and New Jersey among US states.New York reported its lowest number of daily Covid-19 deaths in weeks on Friday. The state recorded 422 deaths as of the day before — the fewest since March 31, when it recorded 391 deaths. More than 16,000 people have died in the state from the outbreak.In Denver, Mayor Michael Hancock extended the city’s stay-at-home order and nonessential business closures through May 8 just as Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a fellow Democrat, prepared to relax some statewide restrictions next week.Health officials in Colorado ordered the immediate closure of a Walmart in Aurora, a Denver suburb, after three people connected to the store died after being infected with the coronavirus and at least six employees tested positive.In France, the government is leaving families to decide whether to keep children at home or send them back to class when the nationwide lockdown, in place since March 17, starts to be lifted on May 11.In Spain, parents face a similarly knotty decision: whether to let kids get their first fresh air in weeks when the country starts Sunday to ease the total ban on letting them outside.The slowing of Spain’s outbreak, which has killed more than 22,500 people, made the prospect of letting kids out feasible. For the first time Friday, Spanish health authorities counted more people recovering from the disease in a 24-hour span than new infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-states-ease-lockdowns-us-covid-19-toll-passes-50-000/story-LaH2jkGeER3AHRtFYTxzSK.html
25-04-2020||World||Covid-19: After nearly 20,000 coronavirus deaths, UK to trial drones for delivering medicines||As the death toll from coronavirus approached the 20,000-figure across the United Kingdom, the Boris John government on Friday gave the approval for trials to use drones to deliver medicines initially on islands and remote places in the country.The death figure released on Friday was 19,506, with 143.464 cases. The figure refers to deaths in hospitals, not in private homes, care homes and hospices, prompting concerns that the real figure may have crossed 20,000, making the UK one of the worst affected in Europe.Releasing figures and details in the daily Downing Street briefing, transport secretary Grant Shapps announced the trial of drones to deliver medicines, as the UK’s health authorities continue to grapple with the scale of the pandemic amidst reports that several errors were initially made.Shapps said: “I have…given the green light to trials of drones delivering medical supplies. Earlier this year, we awarded £28 million to Southampton and Portsmouth to develop a Future Transport Zone”.“As part of that initiative, £8 million was earmarked for testing drones, and how they might be used for delivering goods in the years and decades ahead. Of course, now we have an urgent need, so we’re making use of that testing programme as part of our response to Covid-19”.“As a result, I have fast-tracked trials to begin next week to carry medical supplies and equipment to St Mary’s Hospital, near Newport on the Isle of Wight”, he added.On demands that the government should announce conditions in which it would consider easing some lockdown restrictions, Shapps reiterated the five tests earlier set out by foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.The five tests are: That the National Health Service can continue to cope; that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently; that the rate of infection is falling; that the operational challenges have been met’ and most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-after-nearly-20-000-coronavirus-deaths-uk-to-trial-drones-for-delivering-medicines/story-WWcR80AvGfCKyKY1oXtrGO.html
25-04-2020||World||US Covid-19 death toll doubles in 10 days to more than 50,000||The US death toll from the novel coronavirus reached 50,000 on Friday, having doubled in 10 days, according to a Reuters tally.More than 875,000 Americans have contracted the highly contagious respiratory illness Covid-19 caused by the virus, and on average about 2,000 have died every day this month, according to a Reuters tally.The true number of cases is thought to be higher, with state public health officials cautioning that shortages of trained workers and materials have limited testing capacity.Deaths are also likely higher, as most states only count hospital and nursing home victims and not those who died at home. About 40% of the deaths have occurred in New York state, the epicenter of the US outbreak, followed by New Jersey, Michigan and Massachusetts. US coronavirus deaths, the highest in the world, now exceed the total number of Americans killed in the 1950-53 Korean War - 36,516. Coronavirus has also killed more people in the United States than the seasonal flu in seven out of nine recent seasons, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Flu deaths range from a low of 12,000 in 2011-2012 to a high of 61,000 lives lost in the 2017-2018 season.Coronavirus deaths in the United States fall far short of the Spanish flu, which began in 1918 and killed 675,000 Americans, according to the CDC. Globally, coronavirus has claimed more than 190,000 lives since the outbreak began in China late last year. The United States, with the world’s third-largest population, has twice as many deaths as the next hardest-hit countries of Italy, Spain and France. Of the top 20 most severely affected countries, the United States ranks ninth based on deaths per capita, according to a Reuters tally. The United States has 1.5 deaths per 10,000 people. Belgium ranks first at over five deaths per 10,000 people, followed by Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom. Unprecedented stay-at-home orders issued to try to curb the spread of the virus have hammered the economy, with the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits over the last five weeks soaring to 26.5 million.While some states have said they plan to begin reopening their economies over the coming weeks, health experts and some governors have warned that a premature easing of restrictions on movement could trigger a surge in new cases. A Reuters/Ipsos survey this month found that a bipartisan majority of Americans want to continue to shelter in place to protect themselves from the coronavirus, despite the impact on the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-death-toll-doubles-in-10-days-to-more-than-50-000-reuters-tally/story-fSEZH8pIIMtOOo0oyNAP4N.html
25-04-2020||World||This Pakistani pilot urges the world to always stay united||Mahipal Ladher, a pilot working at Pakistan International Airlines, has been flying people stranded due to the lockdown, desperate to head home. Mahipal is the first pilot from Tharparkar, a poverty stricken district of Sindh province with a population of 1.6 millon people. The Tharparkar desert lies along the Pakistan-India border.When Mahipal was a little boy, his town didn’t have a single paved road connecting it to any other town. It would take almost 12 hours to reach the nearest town, barely 70 km away. While growing up, Mahipal grazed cattle and at times, walked for a few kilometers to fetch water for his home, like other children of his town. But every time little Mahipal saw an aircraft show up in the sky, his heart would skip a beat. The boy would run after the plane, chasing the contrails, dreaming he would be flying one such aircraft someday.Tharparkar has always been an example of Hindu-Muslims unity where the two communities draw strength from a shared heritage and history, and perhaps that’s the reason why Mahipal holds the values of co-existence so dear to his heart.Studying initially in a government school and later an army-run school, Mahipal came to Karachi for higher education and training. “I have been living in Karachi for the past 17 years and thanks to its diversified culture, the two things I have learned here are invigoration and charity. People here just don’t stop living and giving!,” he says.With COVID19 pandemic being so dangerously contagious, his country is also locked down like other parts of the world. “Like many others, I played my role by raising money for the needy from home. I also had to do my duty. There were people who were stranded and needed to reach home, specifically in the Northern areas of Pakistan where one relies upon the air mode of transport as the roads are covered with snow most of the time. PIA never stopped flying to such areas. I take pride to be a part of the crew that takes such people home and brings a smile on the faces of their loved ones,” he says.Talking of family, he says the COVID-19 pandemic has made us realise that the whole world is connected, like a family. “Sadly, the only time we start acting like one is when we face such a crisis. Having said that, it is still a positive sign that we are all in this together. We have become the best version of ourselves, trying to help each other in every way possible. All I truly want and hope is that this sense of belonging stays even when this pandemic is over,” he says.While there is gloom everywhere and we have lost so many lives to the virus, it’s certainly not the end of the world, unless we bring it upon ourselves deliberately, says Mahipal. “In 1918, when the world wasn’t this advanced, people fought the Spanish Flu pandemic simply by following the rules spelt out by experts. We need to do the same and we will get out of it for a fact. We have to rise above and we will, it’s the aftermath we need to look out for. The recession is going to hit the world pretty bad and we will have to change the way we live. The world needs its rich to help the poor,” he says.Mahipal urges everyone to hold on to optimism. “Mother Nature works in mysterious ways. We’re being pulled back so as to bounce back, finding better versions of ourselves. There may be delay but there’ll definitely be a better future tomorrow”.Among the heartwarming videos and posts showing people helping each other, there’s one that Mahipal particularly likes. “So there’s this poor old woman who was being offered a ration bag and she refused to take it saying that she already has few days’ ration at home and that there might be many more needy people out there. Such a generous, honest and caring gesture! This is all we need in this difficult time,” he says.And it’s not just about just providing for the needy. “Not everyone is blessed enough to donate monetarily. The least we can do is to stay home, not endanger our own lives and others. Like the saying goes in Urdu — Miley toh phir shayed zindah nahin reh saken.. zindaa rahey to phir zaroor milengey.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-pakistani-pilot-urges-the-world-to-always-stay-united/story-accog6PDTcmnATjMM0TNgL.html

25-04-2020||India||Sonia writes to Modi, seeks ₹1L-cr for helping MSMEs||New DelhiCongress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce an immediate Rs 1 lakh crore “wage protection” package for the revival of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), warning that if problems of the sector are not addressed, it could have a devastating effect on the country’s economy.In her letter to the Prime Minister, she also enumerated suggestions for the revival of the MSME sector, which is reeling under the onslaught of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the nationwide lockdown that ensued to contain it.“The last five weeks have brought our nation face to face with several challenges. As we continue our fight against Covid-19, I felt it essential to highlight an economic concern that needs immediate attention and intervention,” Gandhi said.She said MSMEs contributed close to one third of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounted for almost 50% of exports, and employed more than 11 crore people.“At this moment, without appropriate support, more than 6.3 crore (63 million) MSMEs stand on the verge of economic ruin,” Gandhi said.She demanded an immediate Rs 1 lakh crore “MSME Wage Protection” package as also a credit guarantee fund of an equivalent amount, besides a 24X7 helpline for helping them out of this crisis.The Congress chief said MSMEs are suffering losses of around Rs 30,000 crore every day due to the nationwide lockdown and efforts should be made to revive these as they are the backbone of the economy.“Nearly all MSMEs lost sales orders, seen complete cessation of work, and had revenue negatively impacted. If ignored, this issue has the potential of having a devastating and expansive ripple effect on our economy,” the letter read.“Most worrying of all, 11 crore (110 million) employees are at the risk of losing jobs as MSMEs struggle to pay wages and salaries. The government needs to introduce a series of measures to meet this crisis head-on or risk a much large economic crisis down the road,” she said.She said the actions taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) must be reflected in banks’ measures to ensure adequate, easy and timely credit supply to MSMEs.“These measures need to be supported by an expansion and extension of the RBI’s moratorium on payment of loans for the MSMEs beyond the stipulated three months,” added Gandhi.This is Gandhi’s seventh letter to the Prime Minister since March 23. In previous letters she has asked for a focus on migrant workers and people in rural areas, suspending the Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project and transferring all money under the ‘PM Cares’ fund to the ‘Prime Ministers National Relief Fund (PM-NRF)’, to fight the pandemic.Reacting to the letter, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said: “At a time when everyone is fighting a severe crisis, and the people are joining bands with the PM, the Congress party is writing letters. They are busy in negative politics. They don’t work on the ground. The whole world appreciates how India took timely steps to announce the lockdown. But while the whole world appreciates something, the Congress criticises it.”He addded: “This government has taken care of the MSME sector; 14 crore (140 million) people have been given loans without any collateral. But that issue is not raised by the Congress. When PM Modi and Nitin Gadkari began to speak about the efforts being made, the Congress jumped in too. This government has ensured 20 crore (200 million) women are getting Rs 500 per month,80 crore (800 million) people are getting ration and 8 crore (80 million) farmers are getting money, but the Congress is raising only negative issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-writes-to-modi-seeks-1l-cr-for-helping-msmes/story-dpqEaYLWjyZWNZbEkQD8cP.html

25-04-2020||India||State nod not needed for CBI probe: SC||The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that the Central Bureau of Investigation need not take a state government’s consent for investigating offences committed within union territories by state government employees acting in their official capacity, giving federal authorities more power to investigate state officials.The requirement under section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act of 1946 (DSPE Act), which mandates the CBI should obtain consent of the state before exercising its jurisdiction over any area which is not a union territory, will not apply in such a case, the top court held.“The consent of the State under Section 6 cannot come in the way or constrict the jurisdiction of the special police force to investigate specified offences under Section 3 of the 1946 Act committed within the Union Territories”, the bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari ruled.The CBI can investigate such cases even though the accused is residing in a state, is in employment and committed the offence in his or her capacity as a state government employee, the court made it clear.The petitioner in the case, Kanwal Tanuj, was an IAS officer employed in connection with the affairs of the Bihar government as District Magistrate at Aurangabad District in Bihar.He was accused of large scale corruption and siphoning of government funds during the construction of an electric plant by Bhartiya Rail Bijli Company Limited (BRBCL) at Nabinagar in Aurangabad district of Bihar.It was alleged that there was corruption and siphoning of government funds during land acquisition for the plant by BRBCL officials in connivance with local district administration including the petitioner.FIR was registered against him by the CBI for the offences of cheating and forgery under the Indian Penal Code and for offence of criminal misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act.It was petitioner’s case that the offence alleged against him was committed in his capacity as employee of state of Bihar and therefore, would require the consent of Bihar government as per section 6 of the DSPE Act before the CBI can proceed against him.The Supreme Court, however, turned down the argument noting that the registered office of BRBCL is within the jurisdiction of Union Territory of Delhi and the offence was committed at Delhi, and therefore, courts in Delhi will have jurisdiction to try the offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-nod-not-needed-for-cbi-probe-sc/story-h7Idv58JTUBL6zUm2nmMLJ.html
25-04-2020||India||UP doctor celebrates son’s birthday over video||Lucknow: Amita Srivastava, a senior nursing officer at Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University (KGMU), has not met her family for days. She has been under passive quarantine after taking care of Covid-19 patients for seven days at a KGMU isolation ward. Srivastava is now undergoing a mandatory rest at a hotel since April 17 along with 22 members of her team and has missed some important events in between.Srivastava joined her husband for their son Akshat’s 13th birthday celebration via a video call. “Never before have I been away from my family on my birthday [April 14] or that of my son [April 17]. But this year I was required by my patients because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Srivastava, who has been staying at the hotel since April 17.Srivastava’s colleague, Lydia Saha, too, celebrated her 10th wedding anniversary on April 21 via video call. “I am away from my family since April 8 as we started our continuous active quarantine duty in the hospital. This is the longest I have stayed away from my daughter Aaradhya, who turned 8 in March,” said Saha. “All are home except me.”She said they spend time at the hotel watching TV, reading books, making video calls to families and friends as well as chatting with other team members while maintaining distance, and doing yoga.Srivastava said she loves plants and prefers yoga. “So I see the place of my worship and check my plants via video calls every morning when I wake up and that is followed by an online yoga session.”Anoop Kumar, who worked in the ventilator unit of the isolation facility, said he has been going for morning and evening walks while staying with 14 team members at another hotel.“Walks are between 6 am and 7 am and then 6 pm and 7 pm. The remaining time is spent inside the [hotel] room. But it is okay as we are inside the room for a big cause,” said Kumar, who is from Ayodhya.Dr Uttam Kumar of the Balrampur Hospital, too, has to stay in a hotel room till May 3. “TV is the biggest medium for passing the time while other options to go out and engage in some other activity remain closed. Calling someone from home is not justified in this period. So I watch television programmes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-doctor-celebrates-son-s-birthday-over-video/story-lTdCLtVtkPXSm0f3JEX3qN.html
25-04-2020||India||Lockdown period will not count in insolvency proceedings: Govt||The government has issued two orders that exclude the lockdown period because of the Covid-19 outbreak from any corporate insolvency resolution or liquidation processes, the notifications issued on Friday said. The first notification said “the period of lockdown imposed by the Central Government in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak shall not be counted for the purposes of the timeline for any activity that could not be completed due to such lockdown, in relation to a corporate insolvency resolution process”.The second order also excluded the lockdown period “for the purposes of computation of the timeline for any task that could not be completed due to such lockdown, in relation to any liquidation process”. The law provides for completion of the liquidation process in relation to any corporate person in a limited timeframe, unless extended by the adjudicating authority. Similarly, a model timeline is given within which various IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) processes should be completed, Gaurav Gupte, partner at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said.The orders will, however, be applicable retrospectively, one government official with direct knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity. Although the governing board of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) had taken a decision on these matters on March 27, it could not be immediately notified due to the nationwide lockdown from March 25, the official said. While the orders mention March 25 as the date from which the lockdown began, they do not mention an end date. As per the home ministry order, the nationwide lockdown is scheduled to last till May 3.Misha, partner at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, said, “It is relevant to clarify that this does not extend the mandatory timelines within the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, such as total time period of insolvency resolution process to be limited to 180 days extendable up to 270 days and only grants relaxations for timelines under the two regulations.”Experts called it a pragmatic move in line with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement on March 24, but they also expect a 6-12 months moratorium.Day before the lockdown, Sitharaman had made a series of announcements to provide relief to the common man and the industry from various compliance provisions that included matters pertaining to IBC. “Due to the emerging financial distress faced by most companies on account of the large-scale economic distress caused by Covid-19, it has been decided to raise the threshold of default under section 4 of the IBC, 2016, to Rs 1 crore (from the existing threshold of Rs 1 lakh). This will by and large prevent triggering of insolvency proceedings against MSMEs [micro, small and medium enterprises],” she had said in a statement. “If the current situation continues beyond 30th of April 2020, we may consider suspending section 7, 9 and 10 of the IBC, 2016, for a period of 6 months so as to stop companies at large from being forced into insolvency proceedings in such force majeure causes of default,” the statement said. While sections 7 and 9 pertain to initiation of corporate insolvency proceedings by a financial creditor and an operational creditor, respectively, section 10 relates to filing an application for insolvency resolution by a company.PTI on Wednesday reported that the Cabinet had decided to amend the insolvency law through an ordinance to suspend these sections provisions that trigger insolvency proceedings against defaulters from six months to one year and allow banks to restructure loans. The ordinance is awaited.Uday Bhansali, partner at global consultancy firm, Deloitte India, said, “At a time when the focus of the government is to revive economic activity post a future lifting of the lockdown, suspension of IBC for 6 to 12 months removes an element of risk for a company while it is trying to secure necessary financing, renegotiating loans, and attempting to secure other reliefs from banks, especially given the impact of Covid-19.” “Equally, this needs to also be supplemented by proactive measures to provide MSMEs with additional liquidity, moratorium on past borrowing etc so that they may recover from the enormous dislocation in business,” he added.The proposed relief from initiating insolvency proceedings for the next six months is expected to provide relief to not only MSMEs, but also big and small firms that may have defaulted on their obligations in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, and would ordinarily fall within the crosshairs of the insolvency regime, Atul Pandey partner at law firm Khaitan & Co, said.According to Misha, the two notifications issued on Friday have nothing to do with the announcement made by the finance minister on March 24, 2020. “The proposed suspension of Sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Code will have to take effect by passing of an Ordinance by the central government cabinet, followed by Presidential asset in absence of the Parliament being in session,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-period-will-not-count-in-insolvency-proceedings-govt/story-CYGA4OdjyEJSxXFp0zBflO.html
25-04-2020||India||2 terrorists, their aide killed in J&K||SRINAGAR/Jammu: Two terrorists and their associate were killed in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir’s Awantipore on Saturday. The terrorists were reportedly inside an underground hideout in the forest area.Police said security forces launched a joint operation in the Goripora forests in Awantipore early morning after they got an input about the presence of terrorists in the area. The ensuing gunfight led to the killing of two terrorists and their associate; all three of them inside a hideout.Inspector general of police, Kashmir Range, Vijay Kumar confirmed that two unidentified terrorists and an associate of theirs died in the gunfight. “Further searches are still underway,” he added.Late Friday night, two terrorists who were responsible for the abduction of a policeman in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district were shot dead. This week, as many as ten terrorists were killed in south Kashmir in different encounters.“Two unidentified terrorists abducted a policeman from his house at Shirpora, Yaripora ( Kulgam) in a car. Kulgam police shared information with Army and CRPF and formed several joint nakas. The car was intercepted at Herpora Yaripora,’’ a police spokesman said. “Two policemen got injured in the encounter,’’ he added.Elsewhere, in Doda district, security forces on Saturday smashed a terrorist hideout and recovered a huge cache of arms and ammunition in Ghoriyan area.“We recovered two AK rifles, two AK magazines, one Chinese pistol with one magazine and large quantity of ammunition. This is a serious blow to the terrorists operating in the region,” said a defence spokesman.In Udhampur, panic gripped the people earlier as security forces laid a cordon and launched a search operation following inputs of some suspicious movement. Udhampur houses the Indian Army’s Northern Command. District police chief Rajeev Pandey said, “It was just a search operation. No shots were fired and no encounter took place...don’t believe in rumours.”A senior official said an intelligence input about suspicious movement was received around 3.45 pm. “Police, army and the CRPF launched a search operation on specific input s. The operation was launched in “Gaide Da Talab” in the heart of Udhampur city. Drones were also used to locate the suspicious movement,” he said.The operation was called off after a thorough search of the lanes and bylanes in the targeted area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-terrorists-their-aide-killed-in-j-k/story-5ZJ3C3u3QiNmtWW4m3V5AK.html
25-04-2020||India||Govt planning special flights for Indians stranded abroad||New Delhi The Centre has started making preparations to run scores of special flights early next month to bring thousands of Indians stranded abroad due to the cancellation of international flights from March 22.For nearly a week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been holding discussions with senior ministers and officials on the modalities of bringing the stranded Indians back home, people familiar with the developments said.Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba took the first step as part of this exercise on Friday, telling state governments to earmark hospital beds and quarantine zones for the Indian nationals stuck abroad who will be brought back in special flights after the national lockdown ends. Gauba, the country’s senior-most bureaucrat, issued the instruction at his video conference with chief secretaries and police chiefs on Friday.To be sure, there has been no formal decision to lift the lockdown on May 3. But the government’s midnight decision allowing shops to open in residential areas signalled that the government was heading in this direction.Irrespective of the decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- he is interacting with the chief ministers on Monday to ascertain their views -- officials say it is clear that many of the restrictions in place during the lockdown would be eased only gradually.“This is the right time to start firming up the exercise to evacuate Indians abroad... It will be a gigantic exercise,” a top government official said.The external affairs ministry is starting the process to make an assessment of the people who want to return to India. Officials estimate that it won’t just be Indians who have been stranded abroad who want to come back but others too.For example, according to one estimate in the government, Kerala alone expects 100,000 expats to come back, for a visit to meet their family if not for a longer duration, when the flights start operating.The other states that expect a huge inflow of citizens abroad are Delhi, Maharashtra Punjab, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.A separate control room is being set up within the ministry for the same purpose.When the first few cases of the coronavirus disease started getting reported in the country in February, many state governments weren’t prepared and had indicated doubts about their ability to have the infrastructure in place to accommodate their citizens abroad. There was hardly any medical or quarantine facility ready for them.That was one reason why the government had roped in the army and the paramilitary forces to accommodate the 600-plus Indians flown back from China’s Wuhan.At his meeting with the top civil servants of the states, Gauba told them to go into an overdrive to create the facilities necessary for the Indians coming back after May 3. He also indicated the basic ground rules how the mammoth exercise would be carried out.The state governments have been told that the Indian citizens evacuated from abroad will be brought to the international airport nearest to their state so that the requirement for internal travel is minimised. The states have also been told that arriving passengers would be straightaway taken to the quarantine centres where they will have to spend a minimum of 14 days.Since March 22 - when the ban on international commercial flights was imposed - stranded Indians have been mounting pressure on the government to be allowed back into the country. It is for this reason that External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has been constantly in touch with his Gulf and Saudi Arabia counterparts to ask them to take care of the Indians stranded there and reassure them that they would be evacuated as soon as possible. These countries are home to over 9 million Indian diaspora in the region. With the Gulf region more than accommodative to Indian requests, the government had also put medical supplies and assistance on highest priority to these nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-planning-special-flights-for-indians-stranded-abroad/story-xpJeKGxT7b93X97JYVU1dN.html

Kumar briefed the team about the treatment of patients, enforcement of lockdown in containment zones, maintenance of quarantine centres, hospital preparedness, surveillance and testing. He referred to a helpline, procurement of medical equipment, the supply of rice to ration cardholders as well as relief measures for migrant workers.Kumar said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has ordered an extension of lockdown until May 7 to ensure there is no laxity in preventing the spread of the disease and that no relaxations had been given in any part of the state.“The central team appreciated the initiatives taken by the state government to contain the spread of the virus in the state,” the statement said.The central team earlier inspected the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and inquired about the availability of doctors, support staff, testing kits, personal protection equipment and masks.It is expected to meet police chief M Mahender Reddy and police commissioners of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda apart from officials of the health department to understand how Covid-19 spread so rapidly in Hyderabad over the last three weeks.“The number of cases has been alarmingly rising in the densely populated areas of GHMC [Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation] where the chances of virus spread to others is high. However, the numbers have been coming down in the last two days. Only 12 cases have been reported since Thursday,” a GHMC official said on condition of anonymity.Health minister Etala Rajender told reporters that a massive contact tracing exercise has led to the identification of 268 positive cases in the GHMC limits involving 44 families.The Telangana government has declared Hyderabad a red zone and enforced a strict lockdown. The GHMC has been directed to concentrate more on Hyderabad by dividing the city into zones and appointing officers for each of them.Till the third week of April, there were 139 containment clusters in Hyderabad out of the 221 in Telangana. Public movement is totally prohibited in these areas and barricades have been put up there along with deployment of a heavy police force.

He said the contribution to PMCares fund as well as CM Relief Fund of Odisha government was his attempt to help the governments in mounting a fight against the pandemic. “Everyday I see in newspapers and TV channels the surging deaths in India and countries outside due to Covid-19. This is the biggest crisis that humanity is encountering right now. So I decided to do something on my own,” said Mangaraj, who recently completed his B. Tech degree.Mangaraj said some people in Mumbai, where he is now staying with his filmmaker sister, had approached him for selling his coins and offered him several crore for his collection. “The thought of selling the coins never occurred to me. Rather I was collecting and buying coins all these years. But now I want to auction it for helping people,” he said. The auction, to be held offline in Bhubaneswar, is scheduled sometime next month.The numismatist’s collection is indeed a treasure- starting from coins from the period of emperors Ashoka and Chandragupta Maurya, the Gupta dynasty and the Maratha king Shivaji. Among British coins, he has several coins issued during the reigns of King George V, King George VI and Queen Victoria. Some of the coins are not even metals as they are made of baked earth. The youth has collected metal and paper currencies of US, the UK, Hong Kong, Belgium, France, Australia, Italy and Nepal.“I even have some coins that date back to the time when the barter system was used. There are also coins from around 20 different countries and coins made of plastic, gold and other precious metals,” he said.The decision of the numismatist to hold auction to help the government fight the pandemic has come at a time when everyone is coming forward to donate money to the relief funds of Centre and the state.Earlier this month, a 9-year-old boy of Bhubaneswar broke his piggybank and donated the entire amount of Rs 2020 to the PM CARES Fund and Odisha CM’s Relief Fund. A 10-year-old boy in Soro block of Balasore district donated his entire pocket money to Chief Minister’s Relief Fund putting his plans of buying a bicycle on hold....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-coin-collector-to-auction-2-lakh-coins-to-donate-money-for-covid-19-fight/story-N1aN3xdNMnvDHimbqYnCzH.html
25-04-2020||India||Bengal addresses issues raised by Central teams in 11-point instruction to major state hospitals||The West Bengal government on Friday night issued an 11-point instruction to all medical colleges and hospitals dealing with Covid-19 cases, hours after the Inter-ministerial central team (IMCT) visiting the state raised some serious issues involving tests and treatment of patients and sought the state’s explanation.Till Saturday evening, the number of Covid-19 in the state cases rose to 571, which included 38 new cases, while the death toll stood at 18. State chief secretary Rajiva Sinha and health department officials met principals and senior doctors of medical colleges and hospitals on Friday evening and issued a series of instructions that said no patient shall be refused treatment and collection of swab samples and test results should be done in around 12 hours. With more and more samples piling up, the process now takes more than two days.The government also instructed that ambulance must be provided to patients being referred to other hospitals and dead bodies are shifted from wards without delay. The latter was one of the major issues raised by the IMCT which visited Bangur Hospital in Kolkata where a patient had earlier recorded a video of a body lying on a bed. The video went viral on social media. Following this, the government banned the use of mobile phones inside Covid-19 wards in hospitals.The government also instructed medical colleges and hospitals to ensure that doctors working in emergency and outpatient departments wear protective gear and areas where they work and change clothes are sanitized on a regular basis. The government empowered the heads of the hospitals to temporarily deploy human resource managers.The state government did not hold a media conference on Saturday and officials were not ready to comment on the new instructions.Sinha said on Friday that the health department’s audit committee formed on April 3 had reviewed the deaths of 57 persons who tested positive for Covid-19 and concluded that only 18 were caused by the virus while the remaining 39 were “due to severe co-morbidial (sic) conditions” and Covid-19 was not the immediate cause of their death. The 39 deaths, Sinha said quoting the report, were caused by several conditions such as renal failure, kidney disease etc.“We have been asking the audit committee to submit a consolidated report as a lot of questions have been raised from different quarters. The report could have come three days ago.

Packing in some rice and other eatables, the fishermen hopped onto the boat on April 20 and started their journey back to Odisha.On Saturday evening, when the fishermen reached the Patisonapur beach of Ganjam district after covering over 1000 km on sea, they looked dehydrated and famished. Follow coronavirus latest updates here.“We need water. We shared one bottle of drinking water among us in the last 24 hours,” one of the fishermen told the waiting team of policemen and officials of Ganjam district administration who took them to a quarantine facility at a cyclone shelter after initial medical screening. The district administration also collected the Aadhar card details and mobile numbers.Ganjam district collector Vijay Amrit Kulange said the administration had prior information about the journey of the fishermen by sea. “They were under stress due to the rising number of Corona cases and had run out of food. Now that they have reached Odisha coast after a long journey, we will put them in quarantine for next 14 days,” said Kulange.Narrating their experience, the fishermen said they were apprehensive of rising Covid cases in Tamil Nadu. “After fishing operations were stopped on March 15 due to Corona scare, the fishing merchant we worked for said he would not be able to pay us till the lockdown was over. Initially we thought we could ride out the lockdown with whatever money we had. But when Modi(Prime Minister) announced extension of the lockdown till May 3 we were apprehensive of going hungry. We were also scared of rise in coronavirus cases in Chennai. But there was no transport available. So we pooled in around Rs 2 lakh and bought a mechanised boat,” said Nagaraj Shetty, a 24-year-old fisherman of Odisha.Though the boat wasn’t big enough for the group, the fishermen decided that it was their best possible vehicle for escape. “We had packed rice and some dal for cooking on the way. We had brought some biscuits also, but all that was hardly enough as we did not want to overload the boat. We were also scared of being caught by the Coast Guard and the marine police,” said Shetty. The fishermen used the GPS in their mobile phones to keep track of the route and also watched the stars. The fishermen had also Indian tricolour flying from a pole on their boat in case they ran into a Coast Guard ship.Sub-divisional police officer of Berhampur, Jayant Mohapatra said hundreds of fishermen from Ganjam work in the fishing sector of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Goa. “Though we are keeping an eye on the coast, we apprehend some more fishermen from the State may take the sea route to come back to Odisha,” he said.On April 20, a group of 27 fishermen comprising 10 from Odisha had arrived at a beach of Srikulam district in Andhra Pradesh. Though the fishermen initially wanted to anchor at Patisonapur in Ganjam district, they were stopped by police in Andhra Pradesh. The 27 are now housed in a quarantine facility of Srikakulam district where they will stay till May 3.The arrival of the 38 fishermen by sea came a couple of days after the State government started an online portal for over 7.5 lakh migrant workers of the State wishing to return home after lifting of lockdown on May 3. The government said those migrant workers stranded in other State and wishing to return to their homes in Odisha have to provide their Aadhaar number and mobile number while registering on the (https://covid19.odisha.gov.in) portal.The person after arriving in Odisha will be inked with indelible stamp on their hands and sent to 14-day official quarantine being set up in around 7000 gram panchayats and urban local bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cramped-in-small-boat-38-fishermen-reach-odisha-after-escaping-from-chennai/story-5jG1v3ZzFSURyqc0TEU9vI.html

25-04-2020||India||‘Aim to spread political virus’: TMC on Covid-19 team in Bengal||Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress party has accused the two Central teams visiting the state of West Bengal of spreading a “political virus” in the name of assessing the coronavirus containment efforts on the ground. This is the latest in the continuing war of words between the two sides.“Inter-ministerial central teams (IMCTs) visiting Bengal to assess COVID19 situation served no purpose. Their real aim is to spread a political virus. They are doing it shamelessly,” PTI quoted a statement attributed to the TMC.Earlier on Saturday, the central teams had alleged that they were not given access to facilities or officials in the state for the purpose of assessment and accused the state government of not supporting their endeavours despite an obligation to do so. Also Watch: War of words between Mamata govt & Centre over COVID-19 crisis Team leader of Kolkata IMCT, Apurva Chandra, wrote to home secretary and the chief secretary of Bengal listing instances of non-cooperation which he said were proving to be an impediment in Covid containment efforts.Chandra alleged that the state government was not providing them with the schedule of visits to hospitals, quarantine centres and containment zones despite repeated requests. He also said that the Bengal government was yet to provide essential information sought by the team that was important for assessing state’s response to the contagion.“IMCT has been in Kolkata since 10 am on April 20. Four letters have been written by IMCT to the state government till today. No response has been received to any of the letters till date,” Chandra said in his letter on Saturday.The central team has also taken an exception to alleged public statements given by West Bengal chief secretary suggesting cooperation with IMCT amounted to a “waste of time” for the state officials.The central team visiting states is supposed to be provided with logistics support and facilitate field visits, as per a home ministry directive.The central team has also expressed concern over the absence of police escorts while they are on the field.According to an official, who didn’t wish to be named, the “North Bengal IMCT had gone to Kalimpong on Saturday morning on their own after informing the chief secretary by message. They returned without visiting the hospital or meeting the district magistrate or chief medical officer as they refused to meet the team”.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe confrontation between the two sides escalated after the IMCT pointed out several gaps in covid management protocols observed during the visits to a couple of state-run designated hospitals.Five days waiting time for test results for patients in isolation wards; bodies kept lying on hospital beds for hours before they are moved to mortuaries and lack of social distancing at the hospitals were some of the issues raised.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-virus-mamata-s-tmc-s-latest-attack-on-central-teams-visiting-bengal/story-WEH2x39rX7MFX4e9zTTmIK.html
25-04-2020||India||Man, 75, cycles 320 km to reach home. Seeks quarantine after villagers object||A 75-year-old Bengal resident cycled for 320 km over three days to return home. Surya Kanta Chowdhury, who used to sell fish at a market in Bihar’s Supaul, took this drastic step after he ran out of money during the lockdown. However, when he reached Mothabari in Bengal’s Malda district last Wednesday, the septuagenarian did not go home. Instead, he headed straight to the Block Development Office (BDO), informed the authorities that he had come from Bihar and requested them to get him tested for quacoronavirus.During the journey, Chowdhury had no mask but kept his face covered with a gamchcha and was allowed by policemen at the Bihar Bengal border at Kishanganj to pass through. “He underwent thermal screening and showed no symptoms, so was asked to stay in home quarantine for 14 days. However, his neighbours in Alpara village didn’t allow him to enter it. So, Chowdhury returned to the BDO Mothabari and was put in a government quarantine center,” said Sahanara Khatun, Rathbari panchayat pradhan.The journey was anything but easy. Chowdhury started cycling on April 20. By night, he would get tired and look for a place to rest.“But in the hamlets that I passed, no villager would agree to allow an outsider to stay. Ultimately, I found one village where I was allowed to sleep in the courtyard of a house,” Chowdhury said.Chowdhury is a fish seller at a market in Bihar’s Simrahi town. He also delivers his wares to villages on his bicycle. His cycling habit, he says, is what helped him on this long and arduous journey.Chowdhury’s three sons are masons who migrated to other states, but have been at their family home in Bengal during the lockdown.“We were worried about him staying on alone in Simrahi, especially since we heard that he was running out of all his resources. We were even more worried when we heard he was cycling back home. This long journey could have taken a toll even on young men. But at last, we are happy and relieved. He is back and alright,” said Bachin, Surya Kanta’s son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-75-cycles-320-km-to-reach-home-seeks-quarantine-after-villagers-object/story-NxWuYVhuhPcewXpIA8VKeJ.html

He told the central team members that all the departments had been working as a team with a uniform Covid-19 management.He explained in detail the various steps being taken such as treatment being given to the positive patients in Gandhi Hospital, enforcement of lockdown in containment zones, maintenance of quarantine centres, hospital preparedness, surveillance and testing etc,He also told the members about operation of helpline, procurement of medical equipment, supply of rice to white ration card holders, relief measures to migrant workers and running of Annapurna canteens and shelter homes.He said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had ordered extension of lockdown till May 7 so that there was no laxity on the part of the government in preventing the spread of the disease. No relaxations had been given whatsoever in any part of the state, particularly in Hyderabad.“The central team appreciated the initiatives taken by the state government to contain the spread of the virus in the state,” the official note said.In the morning, the central team inspected the 1,500-bed Covid-19 hospital – Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) at Gachibowli. The team members made a thorough enquiry of the availability of doctors, supporting staff, testing kits, PPEs and masks.The team members also inspected Annapurna free meals distribution centre at Gachhibowli circle and interacted with the beneficiaries. They also visited the kitchens of Akshaya Pathra foundation at Kokapet and Narsingi.On Sunday, the team members are expected to meet Director General of Police M Mahender Reddy and other top police officials including commissioners of police of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda, apart from senior officials of the health department to understand how Covid-19 had spread so rapidly in Hyderabad in the last three weeks.According to the official statistics, out of 983 Corona virus positive cases registered in Telangana till Friday night, as many as 485 cases were reported within the limits of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits that encompass three districts – Hyderabad, RangaReddy and Medchal (Malkajgiri).“The number of cases has been alarmingly rising in the densely populated areas of GHMC where the chances of virus spread to others is high. However, the numbers have been coming down in the last two days – only 12 cases have been reported since Thursday,” a GHMC official said on condition of anonymity.Health minister Etala Rajender told reporters that a massive contact tracing exercise by the state government had revealed that as many as 268 positive cases in the GHMC limits were related to only 44 families.“For example, six people from the Talab Katta region in the old city were responsible for the spread of the disease in as many as 61 others,” he pointed out.The Telangana government has declared entire Hyderabad as a Red Zone and enforcing lockdown very strictly. The chief minister directed that the GHMC officials concentrate more on Hyderabad by segregating the city into several zones and to appoint Special Officers to each zone considering each zone as a unit.Till the third week of April, as many as 139 containment clusters had been identified in Hyderabad out of the 221 clusters in Telangana where entry and exit are totally prohibited with high barricades and heavy police deployment. The government machinery has been supplying essential commodities to people inside.On Friday, as many as 45 containment zones in the GHMC were brought into safe zone, as no fresh cases were reported from these areas. “If this trend continues, we will be able to control the spread of the coronavirus,” the health minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-hyderabad-emerges-covid-19-hotspot-central-team-inspects-city-holds-talks-with-telangana-govt/story-e4pOXOg5EyOSC0BCpIr25J.html
25-04-2020||India||Rohtang pass opened for traffic three weeks in advance||The Border Roads Organization (BRO) opened the 13,500-feet high Rohtang pass for traffic on Saturday.A gateway to Lahaul-Spiti district, the pass remains shut for six months every year due to heavy snowfall. Usually cordoned off in mid-November, traffic movement was allowed till December 12 last year.Due to the lockdown, the Himachal government had approached the BRO director general for opening the stretch as around 5,000 farmers, who migrate to lower regions in the winter months, were keen to return home to resume agricultural activities.BRO then procured more snow-cutting and excavation machines from Manali and Koksar to clear the roads.During the 10-day snow clearance operation, BRO faced many challenges. The Army’s elite road construction wing worked relentlessly amid the snow blizzards at Rohnga pass that even triggered avalanches at Rahala Nullah, Beas Nullah and Rani Nullah.“We ensured that all the officials supervising the operations took all the necessary protection against Covid-19,” said a BRO official requesting anonymity.Lahaul-Spiti MLA Ram Lala Markanda led the first batch of farmers across Rohtang pass from Manali on Saturday. “With vehicles carrying the first batch of farmers to Lahual-Spiti, Rohtang pass has been declared officially open for traffic,” he said.The opening of the pass brought cheer among the local population of Lahaul and Spiti.It will facilitate the Centre and state government to bring much needed relief material and medical supplies to the valley’s residents amid the ongoing pandemic. Moreover, the agricultural activities, which are the backbone of the district, can be started now.Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur applauded the efforts of BRO in opening Rohtang pass three weeks in advance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rohtang-pass-opened-for-traffic-three-weeks-in-advance/story-XMpkxBszQ44MaFKGllTUDN.html

Gauba, the country’s senior-most bureaucrat, issued the instruction at his video conference with chief secretaries and police chiefs on Friday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAlso Watch | ‘Surviving on cold food’: Stranded Indian students in US seek govt’s help for evacuation To be sure, there has been no formal decision to lift the lockdown on May 3. But the government’s midnight decision allowing shops to open in residential areas signalled that the government was heading in this direction.Irrespective of the decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - he is interacting with the chief ministers on Monday to ascertain their views - officials say it is clear that many of the restrictions in place during the lockdown would be eased only gradually.“This is the right time to start firming up the exercise to evacuate Indians abroad…. It will be a gigantic exercise,” a top government official said.The External Affairs Ministry is starting the process to make an assessment of the people who want to return to India. Officials estimate that it won’t just be the Indians who have been stranded abroad who want to come back but others too.For example, according to one estimate in the government, Kerala alone expects 1,00,000 expats to come back, for a visit to meet their family if not for a longer duration, when the flights start operating. The other states that expect a huge inflow of citizens abroad are Delhi, Maharashtra Punjab, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.A separate control room is being set up within MEA for the same purpose.When the first few cases of the coronavirus disease started getting reported in the country in February, many state governments weren’t prepared and had indicated doubts about their ability to have the infrastructure in place to accommodate their citizens abroad. There was hardly any medical or quarantine facility ready for them.That was one reason why the government had roped in the army and the paramilitary forces to accommodate the 600-plus Indians flown back from China’s Wuhan.At his meeting with the top civil servants of the states, Gauba told them to go into an overdrive to create the facilities necessary for the Indians coming back after May 3. He also indicated the basic ground rules how the mammoth exercise would be carried out.The state governments have been told that the Indian citizens evacuated from abroad will be brought to the international airport nearest to their state so that the requirement for internal travel is minimised. The states have also been told that arriving passengers would be straightaway taken to the quarantine centres where they will have to spend a minimum of 14 days.Since March 22 - when the ban on international commercial flights was imposed - stranded Indians have been mounting pressure on the government to be allowed back into the country. It is for this reason that External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has been constantly in touch with his Gulf and Saudi Arabia counterparts to ask them to take care of the Indians stranded there and reassure them that they would be evacuated as soon as possible. These countries are home to over 9 million Indian diaspora in the region. With the Gulf region more than accommodative to Indian requests, the government had also put medical supplies and assistance on highest priority to these nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-flights-hospital-beds-centre-preps-to-fly-back-indians-stranded-abroad/story-G4r4rZGNGgT4RyN3GqOA4K.html

The Centre would also bring in necessary changes in the Union Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) directives to bring back bodies of those from Kerala, who died due to Covid-19 in Persian Gulf countries, he added.“The state is ready to take back its people. The evacuees will have to spend at least 14 days in quarantine on their arrival. We’ve made adequate arrangements for their stay and healthcare needs,” the CM said. Around 18 lakh people from Kerala are working in the Gulf nations. But, there are reports that at least two lakh of them, primarily blue-collar migrant workers, pregnant women, senior citizens, and students, are ready to come back home.Remittances from the Gulf nations are Kerala’s mainstay. Many expatriates from the state, who are working in the Gulf countries, are reportedly peeved with the government citing poorer nations such as Pakistan and the Philippines that had evacuated their nationals, but Keralites were left in the lurch amid the pandemic.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageVijayan said that seven new Covid-19 cases were reported on Saturday, taking the total count to 457. So far, 342 have recovered and discharged from hospitals and another 116 are still undergoing treatment. The total number of people under observation has come down to 21,044 from over 2 lakh. Kerala has conducted 22,360 Covid-19 tests to date, the CM added.Vijayan also welcomed the MHA’s latest directives allowing the opening of small and neighbourhood shops. “It’ll ease some pressure. We’ll allow these shops to open only after disinfecting them. Similarly, they’ve to clean their neighbourhoods. We won’t allow any overcrowding at these shops and the police will keep a strict vigil on them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-has-promised-to-bring-back-stranded-expatriates-in-west-asia-kerala-cm/story-xp3HVzjTFTOR1fOHnsbVqO.html

However, all these developments are subject to review,” he maintained.The delegation comprised Pawan Kumar Kohli, Brig (retd) Suchet Singh, Leela Karan Sharma, Sudarshan Khajuria, Dr Goutam Mengi, Karan Singh Charak, Rajesh Gupta, Shakti Dutt Sharma and Abhishek Gupta.On April 22 evening, Murmu had announced cancellation of the annual Amarnath yatra due to Covid-19 pandemic, but moments later recanted his decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarnath-yatra-will-explore-feasibility-of-shrine-s-live-telecast-says-j-k-l-g/story-RBFqCM7hRSHt0TR5eLJCGN.html

The ostracized family says they do not venture out of the home to avoid questioning glaze and said something must be done to prevent social distancing from turning into social discrimination.“Only a coronavirus survivor and his/her family members can understand the kind of social stigma we face these days. It’s painful and depressing,” a cousin of the coronavirus survivor said.The coronavirus survivor had returned from Dubai just before the lockdown was announced. He was screened and stamped at the Lucknow airport before being quarantined at his village home under Angauta Panchayat in Nautan block of Siwan district. After he tested positive, he was taken to Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) and 13 of his family members were sent to a quarantine centre in Patna.It has been 39 days since his test results came. The patient is completely fit now and back home. The family members were also found negative in all the three test reports, the cousin quoted above added.“However, back home, our neighbours failed to maintain common courtesy. People are not ready to even look at us. Their kindness will boost our morale and will help us get over the physical pain and the mental trauma,” he said.People in other areas (Tola) of the village, he said, consider the entire area as a prohibited zone.“There’s a rumour in the village that our family got into trouble because of black magic and some unseen forces,” he said.“It’s the hostile response which has forced my cousin to remain under home quarantine despite being declared fit by the doctors. Even the members of the family avoid going out,” he added.The family was hurt so much that it rarely stepped out of their home even for necessary errands, the cousin said.“I do not go out to buy grocery or vegetables to avoid the questioning gaze of people. Even the store owner does not want me to come there. It’s time some eminent village residents send a message that the disease is not a stigma, but only an infection and that social distancing should not be turned into social discrimination,” he said.Shastri Ram, the husband of the Panchayat mukhiya, said there were reports of social discrimination from the coronavirus survivor’s area. “It’s mainly because of fear and lack of knowledge about the disease among the residents. We are trying to stop it,” he said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesHe said the family was provided food grains and other essential items.Sohila Gupta, zila parshad and a member of the All India Progressive Women’s Association (AIPWA) from Nautan block, Siwan, said there was a need to raise awareness among people, especially in rural areas, about the disease.“They need to be explained the difference between social distancing and discrimination,” she said.Sunil Kumar, DDC, Siwan, said that people often fail to understand that after a patient is declared negative for coronavirus, there is no need to fear or avoid him/her.“To clear this confusion, once a patient recovers, he or she is declared a coronavirus survivor and is given a grand welcome by the Panchayat Mukhia and others,” he added.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-covid-19-survivor-s-family-speak-of-undeclared-unspoken-social-boycott/story-K8KYDkzm8wqmSB9zkRKoIJ.html
25-04-2020||India||‘Strategy must’: Ashok Gehlot to Centre on getting migrant workers home||Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday reiterated and pushed for a “strategy” for smooth movement of migrant workers stranded across the country due to nationwide lockdown. The lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus disease is in place till May 3.“In fight against Covid-19, whole nation stands united. The government of India should show the same unity when it comes to issuing guidelines for the states irrespective of the party the party lineage of ruling parties in the states,” he tweeted ahead of the scheduled video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.“Since day-one, I have been saying a strategy must be devised for smooth movement of migrant workers stranded across the country, but unfortunately there is no clarity on the same,” said Gehlot. The CM pushed for a common policy for all states on the issue.“Planned strategy with unified command structure of communication to the states can be more fruitful instead of un-officially communicating to different states by different officers such as Ministry of Home Affairs and Cabinet secretariat to facilitate movement of students and migrant workers - this is not a comprehensive solution for the migrant problem we are facing,” Gehlot tweeted.The Rajasthan CM said only meticulously planned strategy with proper mode of commuting such as special trains to be run by the Centre will solve the problem.On Friday, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath gave officials 14 days to bring the migrant workers back home. Earlier, the Uttar Pradesh government sent buses to bring back students stuck in the coaching hub of Rajasthan’s Kota.The Maharashtra deputy chief minster Ajit Pawar too wrote to railway minister Piyush Goyal this week, seeking special trains to help migrant workers return home. The Rajasthan chief minister, speaking to Hindustan Times earlier, said the Centre should have given at least five days to the migrant workers and others to go back to their homes like it had allowed the flights before enforcing the restrictions.He said home minister Amit Shah has assured him that the Centre will soon take a call on the issue. The Opposition parties, led by the Congress, had expressed concerns over the plight of migrant workers who were forced to take a long walk back to their villages due to the nationwide lockdown enforced to contain the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strategy-must-ashok-gehlot-to-centre-on-getting-migrants-workers-home/story-hlvoyQ73AqhYV5o0iJWxXP.html

The measures will lead to a saving of about Rs 12,000 crore till June-end next year, officials said.These steps were prompted by a decline in the state government’s revenue following the Covid-19 lockdown and the need for funds to fight the pandemic.The six categories of allowances that have been deferred from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 include city compensatory allowance, secretariat allowance, special allowance given to CB-CID, anti-corruption department, economic offences wing, vigilance establishment, security and special investigation wing, the special allowance paid to junior engineers, research allowance, orderly allowance and design allowance paid in the public works department, along with investigation and planning and orderly allowance paid to officers and employees working with the irrigation department.None of these allowances are paid to central government employees.“A sum of about Rs 1500 crore will be saved in 2020-2021 by the decision to defer payment of six categories of allowances. A sum of about Rs 7500 crore is likely to be saved in 2020-2021 on payment of DA (if calculated on the basis of 4% increase). If the same rate of DA increase is calculated for the remaining months of 2021-2022 (up to June 30, 2021), the total saving is likely to cross the Rs 12,000 crore mark following the decision to freeze DA,” said a senior officer.In an order dated April 24, 2020, additional chief secretary, finance, Sanjiv Mittal, said that the Uttar Pradesh government’s revenue has come down following the Covid-19 lockdown and deferment of allowances was being done to ensure the availability of funds for the containment efforts to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.In another order with regard to payment of DA to state government employees and dearness relief to pensioners, Mittal said no additional installment of DA and dearness relief will be paid from January 1, 2020, July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesHe added that no arrear of DA or dearness relief will be paid from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.Meanwhile, UP State Employees’ Joint Council has opposed the state government’s move. Council chairman JN Tiwari said the decision would affect about 20 lakh state government employees.He urged the chief minister to cut a day’s salary of government staff every month as a contribution to the UP Covid Care Fund, instead of deferring the payment of allowances.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-freezes-da-defers-6-allowances-to-raise-rs-12-000-crore-for-covid-containtment/story-uy2HwCfgHEgyJqg7CzTiHN.html

The members of IMCTs have complained that they were not getting any support from the Bengal government, including access to the hospitals that are treating Covid-19 patients and state authorities’ refusal to even accompany them.Apurva Chandra, who heads the IMCT to Kolkata, wrote to Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha on Saturday, listing the grievances against the state government officials. Chandra has alleged that the state government officials refused to cooperate with the Central team regarding drawing up itineraries to visit the hospitals, quarantine centres and containment centres and only got a 30-minute notice in advance to perform their assigned tasks.Chandra also cited Sinha’s statements in the press that the IMCT teams were free to visit anywhere in the state and that “senior officers of the state government cannot waste their time accompanying them”. This, Chandra pointed out, was a violation of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) order, as the Bengal government is expected to provide logistical support and also facilitate the field visits of IMCTs. Besides seeking escorted visits to Covid-19 hospitals, the Central teams also asked for Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits from the state government, which were reportedly denied.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageBengal is also yet to provide any further details on other critical aspects such as the supply of essential commodities, the condition of relief camps, the enforcement of ongoing nationwide lockdown restriction, which was initially enforced on March 25 for 21 days and then further extended for another 19 days till May 3 to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak, measures.“The IMCT has been in Kolkata since 10 am on April 20. Four letters have been written by the IMCT to the state government till Saturday. No response has been received to any of the letters to date,” Chandra said in his letter to Bhalla.Chandra asked the Bengal government if the state took responsibility for their safety and security in the absence of police escort and if Border Security Force personnel were permitted to take any action to ensure their safety in case of any untoward incident.The other IMCT, which headed to north Bengal, also allegedly faced similar challenges.“The IMCT members visited Kalimpong on Saturday morning on their own after informing the chief secretary. Unfortunately, they returned from Kalimpong without visiting the Covid-19 hospital there. Neither did they meet the Kalimpong district magistrate nor the district chief medical officer, as they were refused permission,” said a Central government official, requesting anonymity.Earlier, during a visit to two hospitals in Kolkata, the IMCT members had found several anomalies such as waiting time of five days or more for test results of suspected Covid-19 patients who were undergoing treatment in isolation wards; bodies of patients lying on beds in a ward for four hours as the death certificates were not yet ready and disregard to social distancing norms.The central team also asked the Bengal government to furnish the details of all those Tablighi Jamaat returnees, who are either in quarantine or underwent tests for Covid-19 so far. The Jamaat members proved to be a Covid-19 superspreader across the country after attending the Islamic sect’s international congregation at Nizamuddin in New Delhi between March 13 and 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wb-govt-not-providing-logistical-support-relevant-info-on-covid-19-central-team/story-5Lu5Q1xDoTzi2bHwdUefzM.html

This would go a long way in shoring up these jobs, boosting morale as well as greatly alleviating the predicted economic spiral.”She also suggested that the government “establish and deploy a credit guarantee fund of Rs 1 lakh crore to provide immediate liquidity to the sector and ensure adequate capital is available to MSMEs at a time when they need it most.”Gandhi also said that “actions taken by RBI must get reflected in actions by commercial banks to ensure adequate, easy and timely credit to MSMEs.” Any monetary action at the RBI’ send must be backed by sound fiscal support from the government, she added.She also suggested extending the RBI’s moratorium on loan payments by MSMEs.“These measures need to be supported by an expansion and extension of the RBI’s moratorium on payment of loans for MSME beyond the stipulated period of three months. The government should also explore a waiver/reduction of taxes for MSMEs and other sector specific measures.”Gandhi also suggested that the government address the issue of high collateral security leading to denial of credit.She claimed that the MSME sector was taking a hit of Rs 30,000 crore per day during the lockdown and 11 crore employees faced the risk of losing their jobs.“Government has acknowledged MSMEs to be the backbone of our economy. It is time it takes measures to ensure the revival and strengthening of that backbone.

The deceased included a retired clerk of the health department in Etah (70), his daughter-in-law (35), her two sons aged 10 and two years and her sister (25).“We are working on the case and bodies have been sent for post mortem. The reason behind the deaths is unknown and we are waiting for the post mortem report and other pieces of evidence before reaching a conclusion,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, the senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Etah.“There was no forced entry into the house and we had to use gas cutters to enter. The doors were closed from inside,” stated the SSP.“Investigations are on to work out the exact reason. We have found a bottle of sulphas, a poisonous substance and a bathroom cleaner. There is a cut mark on the right wrist of the daughter-in-law. A blade was also found near the body of the deceased,” informed Sunil Kumar Singh.“We have taken a sample of milk placed in the kitchen and a forensic team was called to collect other evidence. We have collected CCTV footages from the nearby areas and have also asked for call details to reach some conclusion,” added Singh.The police official added that the son of the retired health official, who works for a Uttarakhand firm, was informed about the incident.“Relatives of the family reside in a lane near the house but they have no information about any enmity of the family which lost five of its members. Forty-year-old son of the retired health official works in Uttarakhand for a pharma company and was informed about the incident. He has reached home but is clueless about the incident,” he said.Locals informed that a milkman first reached the house on Saturday morning.

25-04-2020||India||On first day of Ramzan, 50,000 food kits distributed to poor families in Srinagar||On the first day of Ramzan on Saturday, the administration in Kashmir’s summer capital Srinagar distributed over 50,000 food kits to the needy.The district administration has prepared 53,000 food kits containing rice, wheat, oil and spices to help in the district amid the lockdown imposed to contain coronavirus. Seventy-nine Covid-19 positive cases have been reported from the district so far. Srinagar deputy commissioner Shahid Choudhary said the district administration has identified deserving families from across the district and that distribution of these kits amongst them has already started.Each kit contains 5kg of rice and 2kg of wheat and a packet each of edible oil, tea and spices. “It will mostly be delivered to their doorstep. In some cases people collect from nearby locations,” he said.The list of families was prepared on the appeal of the district call centre as well as local residents. “Our field staff assessed people on the ground,” he said.The initiative has triggered demands among people that it should be started in other districts of the valley as well.“We have deserving people in every district of the valley who have been struggling to feed their families. Kashmir was shut for months since August 5 last year which had already deteriorated the economic conditions of the people here and now this pandemic that has led to a double whammy,” said Mohammad Azfal, a resident of Baramulla in north Kashmir.Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole said, “We have a large number of people associated with handicrafts and handlooms and a number of migrant labourers residing here. So we are especially focusing on Srinagar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-first-day-of-ramzan-50-000-food-kits-distributed-to-poor-families-in-srinagar/story-rOxqfY8Ie3PBVgPM497TgM.html

Home Minister Amit Shah has been briefed and is reported to be upset at how the central effort to help the states has escalated.Also Watch: War of words between Mamata govt & Centre over COVID-19 crisis In the five days that the group of civil servants and health experts have spent in Bengal, Apurva Chandra told the Union home ministry that they had been able to make only two field visits to three hospitals and one quarantine centre. On their way back from their second field visit in Uluberia subdivision of Howrah district, they drove to a containment zone at Salkia.The central team-led by Apurva Chandra is one of the many groups formed to help seven states fight the Covid-19 battle.On the day the Centre had tasked Apurva Chandra’s team to visit Bengal, it had also formed teams to visit Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. On Friday, it formed more teams to travel to Gujarat, Telangana and Tamil Nadu.Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had viewed the decision with suspicion soon after the first announcement came, first demanding to know the law under the teams were sent and later questioning the criteria for selecting the states.Bengal has reported only 571 Covid-19 cases and 18 deaths till Saturday afternoon. But there have been several reports that the state government had been suppressing data about cases by restricting the number of people tested for the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen. Till just about five days ago, the state was testing only 400 people in a day. This figure, according to the central team, has gone up to 900.But this, a central government official said, wasn’t as shocking.Apurva Chandra told the home ministry that they had not been given a firm number of containment zones that had been formed in the state and there were huge gaps in the only one that they were allowed to visit.The main task of the local administration in a containment zone where a hard lockdown has been ordered is to carry out surveys and surveillance activity through multidisciplinary teams in containment zones.“Unless this is carried out simultaneously during the period of containment, no effective purpose would be served,” Chandra wrote in a letter to the state government on Saturday. This is his fourth letter to the Bengal government, the only mode of communication with the state.But in Bengal, Chandra wrote, the IMCT had been informed that health professionals are not part of the surveillance team that is looking for possible Covid-19 patients. Chandra’s team was told that they are likely to join only on Monday.In his previous letters to West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, the team had pointed to anomalies including a waiting period of at least five days for test results of patients in isolation wards; the possibility of dead bodies lying on beds in wards for four hours; and the lack of social distancing at hospitals.The Bengal government had responded at a media conference, insisting that the team was free to travel and health officials would look into the points made by them.Chandra’s latest letter alluded to this response. “The stand of the state government on facilitating the visits of the IMCT and ensuring the safety and security of the team members as also providing information and records may be made clear through a written communication rather than through media so that further steps can be taken by the IMCT,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-team-stuck-in-guest-house-hammers-bengal-on-covid-19-response/story-xBFQ1v0lNrgF5SCKXDcplO.html
25-04-2020||India||In Kerala, temples take a hit as devotees shy away from online donations||The lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus has put a squeeze on the donations for two of Kerala’s most famous temples with devotees yet to warm up to online contributions.After the lockdown prevented people from travelling to the holy places resulting in severely dented coffers, major temples in the state including Guruvayur Sri Krishna temple and hill shrine Sabarimala had taken the e-route to ensure cash flow. But statistics show virtual offerings are yet to catch up with devotees.Electronic offerings began with much fanfare at the Guruvayur temple on April 14 on the day of the Vishu festival. But in ten days e-collection was a paltry Rs 22,840, temple statistics show. An average monthly hundi (donation box) collection in Guruvayur is anywhere between Rs 4 crore and five crore. Besides currency it often gets gold, silver and at times diamonds too. The daily poojas (called sevas) also bring in steady money.“It seems devotees are yet to catch up with the virtual offering. We have to popularize it more. Many feel direct offerings after praying at the temple will do good. In changing times we have to do away with winding queues and crowding. In the given scenario virtual offering is the best alternative and it will pick up,” said a senior official of the temple board. The temple was closed on March 21, three days before the countrywide lockdown began.“We used to visit Guruvayur temple every first day of the Malayalam calendar. In the changed scenario usual darshan is impossible. Since we are old fashioned people, virtual donation or online offering has failed to enthuse us. So we are waiting for these dark clouds to disappear for a real darshan,” said Sulochana Nair, a retired teacher.Though temple officials are in favour of altering traditional offerings, devotees like her aren’t amused and prefer ‘real offering.’ Interestingly, the most sought after offering at Guruvayur ‘Udayasthmana pooja (which literally means worship from sunrise to sunset), has been booked next 30 years, till 2050 and fresh bookings were closed for the time being.In 2008, the temple discontinued the tradition of an elephant being offered to the presiding deity after the number of elephants’ numbers rose -- now the temple has 56 elephants, the largest collection of captive elephants. In the hill temple of Sabarimala also virtual offerings have failed to pick up. The Travancore Devasom Board (TDB), which runs the temple, had tried to encourage online offerings from the first week of this month said skeleton employees will be deployed at the hilltop to perform these rituals. The temple’s collection has remained below Rs one lakh in the last ten days.Sabarimala’s revenue is usually used to fund smaller temples in south Kerala and for salaries of 3,500-odd employees of the TDB. “True, online offerings are yet to pick up. It is just the beginning. We have to popularise it. We are planning a (advertising) campaign towards this,” said TDB president N Vasu. For now though, the TDB has asked its employees to forgo one month’s salary. The TDB had made an announcement on its website and is planning to launch advertisements in four southern states -- Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana from where devotees throng the temple in large numbers. The temple was closed after monthly pooja on March 18.Despite the government warning not to crowd the temple, at least 14,000 devotees trekked to the shrine after thermal screening and other formalities in March first week. This forced the TDB to do away with the ten-day temple festival in March end and Vishu festival on April 14. For now, with thronging crowds only a memory, temples authorities want to encourage devotees to make their offerings online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-kerala-temples-take-a-hit-as-devotees-shy-away-from-online-donations/story-g3IuPsIBT01GMaTKGiUSQL.html
25-04-2020||India||CBI need not take state consent to probe offences within UTs by state employees||The Supreme Court on Friday bolstered the CBI’s powers by holding that the central government’s premier investigating agency need not take a state government’s consent for investigating offences committed within union territories by state government employees acting in their official capacity.The requirement under section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act of 1946 (DSPE Act), which mandates that the CBI should obtain the consent of the state before exercising its jurisdiction over any area which is not a union territory, will not apply in such a case, the top court held.“The consent of the State under Section 6 cannot come in the way or constrict the jurisdiction of the special police force to investigate specified offences under Section 3 of the 1946 Act committed within the Union Territories”, the bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari ruled.The CBI can investigate such cases even if the accused person is residing in a state, is in its employment and committed the offence in his or her capacity as a state government employee, the court made it clear.The petitioner in the case, Kanwal Tanuj was an IAS officer employed in connection with the affairs of the Bihar government as District Magistrate at Aurangabad District in Bihar.He was accused of large scale corruption and siphoning of government funds during the construction of an electric plant by Bhartiya Rail Bijli Company Limited (BRBCL) at Nabinagar in Aurangabad district of Bihar.It was alleged that there was corruption and siphoning of government funds during land acquisition for the plant by the BRBCL officials in criminal connivance with local district administration including the petitioner.FIR was registered against him by the CBI for the offences of cheating and forgery under the Indian Penal Code and for the offence of criminal misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act.It was the petitioner’s case that the offence alleged against him was committed in his capacity as an employee of the state of Bihar and therefore, would require the consent of Bihar government as per section 6 of the DSPE Act before the CBI can proceed against him.The Supreme Court, however, turned down the argument noting that the registered office of BRBCL is within the jurisdiction of Union Territory of Delhi and the offence was committed at Delhi, and therefore, courts in Delhi will have jurisdiction to try the offence. The investigation of the offence, the court said, may incidentally transcend to the territory of Bihar because of the acts of commission and omission of the petitioner who is a resident of that state and employed in connection with the affairs of Bihar. That, however, cannot come in the way of CBI from investigating the offence committed at Delhi, the court made it clear.In this regard, the court upheld the findings of the Delhi high court.The high court had noted that the registered office of BRBCL was in Delhi and the allegation regarding defrauding BRBCL and siphoning of funds had occurred in Delhi. Funds for implementation of the project through BRBCL were provided by the Central Government in the 2005-06 Union Budget.The high court had, therefore, concluded that criminal conspiracy for committing the offence was hatched at Delhi and the CBI was competent to register FIR in Delhi without the consent of the state government.Affirming the high court’s view, the Supreme Court said that consent will not be necessary regarding the investigation by the CBI in respect of specified offences committed within Union Territory and other offences associated with it.“Had it been an offence limited to the manipulation of the official record of the State and involvement of officials of the State of Bihar, it would have been a different matter. If the State police have no jurisdiction to investigate the offence in question, as registered, then, seeking consent of the State in respect of such offence does not arise”, the judgment said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-need-not-take-state-consent-to-probe-offences-within-uts-by-state-employees/story-j0yqmD5lg6uo83XdF76p0O.html

They are returning now without visiting hospital or meeting DM/CMO as they refused to meet the team,” said Chandra.The team alleged that the state government is violating the order of the Centre by not assisting them.“The chief secretary of West Bengal has been widely reported in media of having said in the daily press conference that the IMCT is free to visit anywhere and senior officers of the government cannot waste time accompanying the IMCT. It above stand is in violation of the order of the ministry of home affairs,” said Chandra in his letter.The team reminded the state government that the state government is expected to provide “accommodation, transportation, PPE and extend all cooperation for their visits to local areas, production of records as requested”, according to the MHA order. It also sought to know from the state government if it will take responsibility for safety and security of the IMCT if it ventures out on its own.“Whether the BSF accompanying the IMCT on behalf of the government free to take action to ensure safety and security of the IMCT in absence of police support,” the letter asked.It further alleged that no senior state official accompanies them on visits and their only expectation is that doctors and officers at the venue should meet and provide information to the team.“Whether it is a fact that a DCP of Bengal police informed Bengal officers at BSF guest house on April 21 that the IMCT cannot leave the campus without permission of the state government as lockdown is in force and if it leaves it is only permitted to go to the airport,” the team wanted to know if there is truth to this statement.It also sought to know if a PPP will be provided to the IMCT if it decided to visit a hospital on its own.“The stand of the state in facilitating the visits of the IMCT and ensuring the safety of members as also providing information and records may be made clear through a written communication rather than through media so that further steps can be taken,” said the team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-support-no-security-given-covid-19-team-in-bengal-spotlights-problems/story-60IUwg99qKR1SIqLqZARXN.html

Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope told HT’s business publication Mint that the lockdown will need to be extended if the spread of coronavirus is not contained.  “The main objective of implementing the lockdown was to stop the spread of Covid-19 pandemic and if the spread is not getting contained, we will have to extend the lockdown,” Tope told Mint.“If required, we will extend the lockdown for 15 more days after 3 May only for the containment zones, if not for the entire Mumbai and Pune,” the minister added.Mumbai and Pune are Maharashtra’s two biggest coronavirus hotspots. Covid-19 cases here continue to rise unabated. Of Maharashtra’s total 6,817 coronavirus cases, 4,447 come from Mumbai while 961 cases are from Pune, Maharashtra health department’s Covid-19 dashboard stated. Telangana is the only state which has decided to extend the Covid-19 lockdown till May 7. On Friday, Tope said that the Maharashtra government will push for aggressive testing to detect coronavirus and also increase facilities for institutional quarantine, news agency PTI reported. “The home quarantine facility was not working. So we have to expand institutional quarantine facilities outside containment zones,” he said.The minister said the spread of the virus in dense slum pockets was a challenge and emphasised the significance of early detection of the disease. “The number of cases is more because of early detection. We also want to increase the span in which cases double,” Tope stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-may-get-extended-in-mumbai-pune-maharashtra-health-minister/story-R3gCkHJ3COsfcSuuDviMKI.html

Barman’s allegations have also led to the removal of Dr. Debasish Basu, secretary, state health department, and Aditi Majumdar, director, National Health Mission, Tripura, from their current positions. Two state government secretaries --- Tanushree Debbarma and Kiran Gitte --- have been entrusted with the responsibility to conduct the investigation into the alleged embezzlement estimated to be around Rs 39.28 lakh.“We’ve heard of the allegations about the misappropriation of funds. Our government has formed a two-member inquiry committee to investigate the matter and it’ll submit the report soon,” state law minister Ratan Lal Nath told media persons. Earlier, Roy Barman had alleged that a section of government officials are taking advantage of Covid-19 pandemic to line their pockets with ill-gotten wealth. He also alleged that the state health department authorities failed to make necessary data entry related to the stock of Covid-19 kits that have been received from government and private entities and also public sector undertakings.Such items have been misplaced and also sold in the open market by a few health professionals in connivance with others, Roy Barman, who was stripped off the health portfolio in 2019 for his alleged involvement in anti-party activities, alleged. State chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb is holding the additional charge of the health portfolio. Roy Barman has written a letter to the CM, drawing his attention to the alleged embezzlement. “When the entire world has come together to fight Covid-19 -- the invisible and vicious enemy – when the Centre and other state governments have pledged to fight this common enemy together when our countrymen are generously donating in Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund and CM relief funds during the topsy-turvy situation, it’s frustrating to see a section of officials are hand-in-glove with some nefarious traders to take advantage of this precarious situation in making money,” he wrote in his letter to the CM. Roy Barman has alleged that an additional Rs 5.45 lakh was paid for the supply of 5,000 hand sanitiser bottles amid the ongoing nationwide lockdown restrictions, which have been imposed from March 25 to May 3, to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak.The former health minister pointed out in the letter that the Central government has assigned a fixed rate for hand sanitisers “... not more than Rs 100 per bottle of 200 milliliters (ml) and the prices of other quantities shall be fixed in the proportion of these prices.”The state NHM director placed an order of hand sanitisers, priced at Rs 359 each for a 500-ml bottle, inclusive of Goods and Service Tax (GST), despite the Centre’s stipulated guidelines, he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-govt-orders-inquiry-into-fund-misappropriation-to-buy-covid-19-material/story-ZPMVZ5PjBTT0pOffZ5nxJM.html

25-04-2020||India||Covid-19 pandemic: Centre’s do’s and don’ts on maintaining AC temperature, ventilation||Amid public concerns associated with air conditioning, ventilation and the spread of coronavirus, the government has issued guidelines compiled by the Indian Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE).The ISHRAE guidelines on the use of air conditioners at homes and workplaces were shared by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). As per the guidelines, it is ideal to operate the air-conditioner between 24-30 degree centigrade at home amid the coronavirus pandemic. The humidity levels must be maintained between 40-70% and rooms must be well-ventilated. “The best action to limit risk of COVID-19 infection by air is to ventilate indoor environments with outdoor air as much as possible. Mechanical ventilation systems and air conditioning systems, which provide ventilation, can perform this function more effectively than simply opening the windows, because they improve the quality of the outdoor air with filtration,” ISHRAE guidelines read. Here’s what the guidelines suggest:For homesIt is suggested to keep rooms ventilated when the AC is not running, too much humidity should be avoided. “Too much humidity leads to higher levels of dust mites and fungi, two of the worst culprits for indoor allergy sufferers.

The Centre seems to have delegated its responsibilities to state governments,” he said.The state governments aren’t in a position to effectively deal with this pandemic as they don’t have the required human and physical infrastructure and adequate financial resources, Sibal said.Calling on the judiciary to evolve a policy to ensure that the justice delivery system is considered an essential service during such a crisis, Sibal alleged that bureaucrats, who do not have any idea about ground realities, are formulating policies during the lockdown.“Apart from a few exceptions with available yet depleting resources, states are doing a commendable job. However, our prime minister’s limited role is addressing the nation from time to time,” he said.Sibal said the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had made no preparations to put in place a plan despite the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the Coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency by January-end.“Why were detailed plans not made within seven weeks of the WHO declaration? We are in the fourth week of April. There is no plan in place even now,” he said.Sibal said the Union home secretary, presumably presiding over the National Executive Committee (NEC) under the act, is issuing directions to state governments to deal with the situation.“Going by the advisories issued so far, it is clear that neither has NEC prepared a plan which is to be submitted to the NDMA for approval, nor have various ministries prepared disaster management plans,” he said.“The NDMA, chaired by the prime minister, has distanced itself from the responsibilities of the Union government and in gross violation of the provisions of the act, authorised the home ministry to issue such directions as it chooses. This too was de-hors the law,” Sibal added.The former law minister said government advisories pay scant regard to the responsibilities of the NDMA.“We would like the prime minister to inform the nation about minimum standards of relief that are required to be provided to persons affected by the disaster,” he said.Instead of discharging its responsibilities to provide relief to the poor and helpless stranded migrants, Sibal said the Centre was shifting the onus to state governments to do what they can without a plan and without guidelines prescribing minimum standards of relief.“It is unfortunate that even till date, there is no plan. We are all aware that the provisions in shelters are pathetic without adequate sanitation, medical cover, food and clean drinking water. States are not able to make available adequate food supplies to those affected,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/formulate-national-plan-to-deal-with-covid-19-crisis-congress-to-centre/story-XiACbky8S1XqAsuPQqjBSN.html

Thereby, the device can prevent the spread of coronavirus. By wearing the band, the urge to shake hands with other people can also be avoided. Harsh has already sent the proposal of his device to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He is awaiting a response on his request to demonstrate the wristband.Harsh studies in Xth standard at National English High School, Virar. His father, Kunjan (50), deals in used cars while mother, Shraddha, is a BMC teacher at an Andheri school. His sister Krisha, 7, studies in the 2nd grade.A person touches his/her face 10 times in an hour on an average and by doing so, he/she could spread Covid-19 and many other infections. “By wearing the wristband, the urge to touch the face can be stopped,” Harsh said, adding that, “my device can also kill coronavirus by electronegative ionisation of hydroxide ions”.“The electronegative ionised solution will already be inserted in the band with a pallet on it,” Harsh said. The device is waterproof so a person does not need to remove it while washing their hands.The device can detect a person shaking hands with another. A buzzer will go off when the device detects the activity, thereby preventing a person from shaking hands and from touching the face. The band also works in silent mode, if the person does not want to hear the buzzer, the band can work on a vibrator mode as well.The wristband was made out of scrap collected from his house. Harsh put together a buzzer, switch, button cell, tilt sensor, aluminium foil, plastic tubing and other materials to create the device. “Due to the lockdown, I could not procure the materials so I sourced them from what was available at my house,” he said. Harsh’s father has also set up a small laboratory for him in his house so that he can conduct his experiments. “School students could visit the laboratory but due to the lockdown, the activity is stopped,” said Harsh.Production planThe cost of one wristband comes to around Rs 90. Harsh plans to mass-produce the bands and sell them for around Rs 40 each. “I am waiting for the patent to be registered after the lockdown is lifted so that the production can be started and I can source raw materials from shops. I have received a huge response from locals for the wristband,” Harsh said. Ventilated mask Harsh has also invented a ventilated mask which has an inbuilt fan that can keep a person cool. “Police personnel and medical staff have to wear the PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) while dealing with coronavirus patients. While wearing the PPE, the plastic screen gets foggy due to lack of ventilation and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. My ventilated mask will circulate air and also prevent fogginess of the plastic screen. Thus, a person can get fresh air and the longevity of the PPE is also extended,” he stated. Proposal to ICMR and PM ModiIn late March, Harsh had sent his proposals to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ICMR. He is awaiting a response. Harsh expects PM Modi and the ICMR to show interest in his innovation. After the lockdown is lifted, his father will apply for the patent on Harsh’s two inventions.Pride of schoolDeepak Kulkarni, Principal at National English High School, said the school is proud of Harsh. “Right from the beginning, he has shown sparks of a scientist and is academically very bright. He actively participates in our school’s scientific workshop along with his classmates,” Kulkarni said. “I am sure he will make our school proud,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-teen-invents-wristband-from-scrap-to-keep-coronavirus-at-bay-proposal-sent-to-pm-modi-icmr/story-wHSRBbHMVZI8McZNSWVioL.html

Lucas, who was earlier living in an adjoining forest, shifted to the cave a day before the lockdown came into effect on March 25, the police said. Lucas and the other five foreigners, including a couple from Ukraine, an American, a Turkish and a Nepalese national, have been shifted to a quarantine facility after undergoing a medical examination as a precautionary measure against Covid-19, the police added.Lucas has been at peace in Rishikesh and considers the Hindu sage Ramana Maharshi as his guru. “I’m familiar with the surroundings, as I have been living here for the past one year. I’ve adopted the life of an ascetic in my quest for serenity and soul-searching,” Lucas told HT over the phone. “When the police found us, I was living with a Nepali baba in the cave, who had returned from Kedarnath a few days ago. The other foreigners were living in the vicinity. We used to spend our time together,” he said. Lucas said even during the lockdown, he used to visit Lakshman Jhula daily along with the other foreigners to buy groceries, as most of the shops have been open. “We used firewood to cook our meals in between doing meditation, yoga, and occasional writing,” he added.The French national claimed he did little work back home and has been on the move for the past five years. He visited several countries, including New Zealand, Spain, Portugal, Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, and Morocco before coming to India.“In India, I made Rishikesh my base. I have also visited Almora, Jammu & Kashmir, and Dharamshala. I would’ve visited other parts of the country, had it not been for Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.He is open about his future plans. “Now, I’ve chosen to live like an ascetic. It all depends on God and what he wants me to do. I’m yet to make any plans for myself,” he added.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesUttarakhand authorities said that around 600 foreigners were stranded in Rishikesh because of the lockdown. The state health department officials are regularly screening the foreigners for SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, they added.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/28-year-old-french-baba-found-in-a-rishikesh-cave-near-ganga-during-lockdown/story-57KB1iBqMwi2SyTqHbqt6K.html

The video-conferencing facility has been enforced because of the ongoing nationwide lockdown, which was initially imposed for 21 days on March 25 and then further extended by another 19 days till May 3, to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. “The counsel for the petitioner was contacted through video-conferencing. He was found to be wearing a banian (vest). The court’s decorum required to be maintained even through video-conferencing,” Justice Sanjeev Prakash Sharma stated in his order.The HC adjourned the case while referring to an earlier instance when it had to similarly caution lawyers to appear in proper uniform after a lawyer appeared in a vest to argue a case on April 7 amid the lockdown restrictions.“The court has already observed that during this pandemic where it is functioning through video conferencing, lawyers must appear in proper uniform. Keeping in view that the petitioner’s counsel was not in proper uniform, the matter is adjourned,” the court said.Justice Sharma was also on the bench on April 7 when a lawyer’s inappropriate attire had forced a similar adjournment. The judge had asked the Rajasthan High Court Bar Association to urge lawyers to be dressed appropriately while appearing via video- conferencing. The Bar Association officials had assured compliance with the court’s directions.Section 49(1)(gg) of the Advocates Act empowers the Bar Council of India (BCI) to frame rules prescribing the dress to be worn by advocates after taking into account the climatic conditions.The BCI has framed rules, which stipulate an advocate to wear a white shirt and long trousers that are black striped, white, or grey teamed up with black open breast coat and gown. They are also required to wear a white band. They can also wear black, white or grey dhoti instead of trousers. Various high courts and the Supreme Court have issued orders, asking lawyers to be dressed in the prescribed uniform while appearing via video-conferencing in view of the ongoing lockdown restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-hc-objects-to-lawyer-appearing-in-vest-through-video-conferencing/story-jMCkE0PBdCNsavVCPYORlL.html

It also warned to bring the issue to the notice of the apex court. “The ministry must share responsibility for causing harm or death of any Covid-19 patient due to the ‘off-label’ use of HCQ and AZM despite the FDA warnings. Unless you take immediate and meaningful measures for protection of hapless Covid-19 patients, we will be compelled to bring this burning issue to the notice of the apex court when the pending PIL comes up for hearing,” the letter to the Union health ministry and ICMR said.The ICMR had said that abdominal pain and nausea have been observed as some side effects in healthcare workers. HT had reported that a study was conducted in India to look at the prophylactic (preventive) effects of HCQ against the viral disease.“Rampant use of the drug or using them in terminally ill and critically ill patients should not be done. HCQ should only be given to moderately ill patients as a therapeutic drug and to health care workers as a prophylactic drug,” said Dr Sukumar Mukherjee, a medical expert in the advisory body set up by Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-ngo-writes-to-health-ministry-icmr-after-fda-warning-against-hcq/story-O4paWk5TusGym8xVaUjPwO.html
25-04-2020||India||Bats cannot directly infect humans with Covid-19: Scientists||Sixty-four scientists have said bats do not spread Covid-19 after reports of people requesting local authorities to clear trees over a fear of the colonies the winged mammals host.The chiropterologists issuing the statement said they came together after reports of public requesting removal of bats, destroying bat roosts, bursting crackers or smoking them out and sealing crevices where bats and their pups roost came to them from various parts in India.They argued in their statement on Friday that Sars-Cov-2 may have diverged from the closest coronavirus found in bats called RaTG13, about 40 to 70 years ago indicating that the bat virus cannot directly infect humans.“The coronavirus found in one species of bat was found to be the closest match to the novel Sars-Cov-2. However, studies show that it cannot bind efficiently to receptors in the human lungs. This suggests that the virus may have evolved in an intermediate host. At the moment, a lot of evidence points towards pangolins as being the intermediate host. However, there is, as yet, no scientific consensus,” Rohit Chakravarty, a research scholar at Berlin’s Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, said.Also read: Covid-19 not the last pandemic, world has to build resilience“This should not become a reason to demonise pangolins which are currently the world’s most trafficked animals. Instead, we must push for the increased protection of these rare and elusive animals,” Chakravarty said.A recent study by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had found coronaviruses in two bat species in Indian but they are not the same as Sars-Cov-2 and cannot cause Covid-19, the scientists said.The driving factor behind viruses jumping over from animals to humans is encroachment and destruction of wildlife habitats.Also read: Maybe once in 1000 years, says ICMR on Covid-19 transmission from bats to humans“Human activities and encroaching upon wildlife habitats puts us at risk of encountering new viruses. These viruses may come from any wildlife species and not necessarily just bats. Thus, we need to modify human practices to prevent the emergence of new pathogens,” Arinjay Banerjee, a postdoctoral researcher at McMaster University, Canada, who studies bat viruses.Banerjee was a part of the team that isolated the Covid-19 virus.Changing human-wildlife interface, global wildlife trade and industrial livestock farming are all suspects in causing zoonotic disease outbreaks  like Covid-19, they underlined.Six myth busters from the team of bat experts:• The exact origin of Sars-Cov-2 or its precursor is not known yet• Scientists strongly suggest that it is highly unlikely for Sars-like viruses to jump directly from bats to humans. Also, there is no evidence of humans contracting coronavirus or any such viruses through the excreta of bats.• ICMR report on the discovery of bat coronaviruses (BtCoV) in two species of South Asian bats poses no known health hazard.• Information on the current, and past zoonotic disease outbreaks suggest that global wildlife trade and/or large-scale industrial livestock farming play an important role in such events.• Killing bats and other wild animals, or evicting them from their roosts in retaliation is counterproductive and will not solve any problems.• Bats pollinate the flowers of some mangroves, and many other commercially and culturally important plants.• Insect-eating bats are voracious eaters of pest insects in rice, corn, cotton and potentially, tea farms. Therefore, bats benefit ecological and human health and provide intangible economic benefits.• South Asian countries should strengthen the legal framework to protect bats in view of their ecosystem services and their slow breeding capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bats-cannot-directly-infect-humans-with-covid-19-scientists/story-uuEwHKcI0x266H1fxawFbN.html

This is constructive criticism,” said Kapil Sibal.The Congress leader asked why the states were not consulted before the lockdown was imposed. “You never held discussions with the state government before announcing the lockdown, just like you did while announcing the decision on demonetisation,” Sibal added. Sibal brought to attention the plight of the migrant workers stuck in various states. He said their situation reminded him of an old Hindi song “jaaye toh jaaye kahan (where to now)”.“There should have been a national plan. The people are on streets. But they have not been provided with anything,” said Sibal.The veteran leader, who also is a lawyer, questioned the government’s decision to freeze the dearness allowance till 2021. “The dearness allowance must not be held back till 2021. It was for the common man. We must give it to the people. In this economic crisis they need this money very much,” said Sibal.The Centre on Thursday held back a revision of the dearness allowance paid to all Union government employees for 18 months and proposed a similar move by state governments to collectively save about Rs 1.20 lakh crore to fund the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.Dearness Allowance and Dearness Relief will be restored prospectively after June 30, 2021, but no arrears for the period from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 shall be paid,the government order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-have-lockdown-of-people-economy-kapil-sibal/story-DkmU2bHvVERO336trNTXjO.html
25-04-2020||India||The state of States: What numbers show a month after Covid-19 lockdown||With over 500 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 11 deaths, the country was put under a complete lockdown on March 25, starting the country’s full-blown battle against the pandemic. At the end of the first month of the lockdown, we take a look at the numbers that the outbreak has resulted in.Test vs Cases vs DeathWith over 6,400 cases and 283 deaths as of April 23, Maharashtra remains the worst-hit state in the country by a large margin. But, with over 96,000 samples tested, it is also leading in terms of the number of people being tested there. Gujarat and Delhi have 2,624 and 2,376 cases as of April 23 and have both conducted more than 30,000 tests. Rajasthan, meanwhile, has the second highest number of tests in the country with over 69,000 samples tested. Test per million vs Cases per MillionOnce the population is factored in, the chart presents a new picture. Punjab, with the highest cases-per-million population (226) and tests-per-million (7,017) stands out from the rest of the country. With the third highest testing rate per resident and the second highest case rate in India, Delhi also stands out. States that have a high death rate such as MP and Gujarat have relatively low testing figures when population is taken into account.(Regions compared by tests per million and cases reported per million residents; size of circle denotes total number of deaths reported in the state) Top 10 states: Last 10 daysIf we look at the data from the last 10 days, the spike of cases in Gujarat has been alarming. On April 14, the western state had only reported 650 cases. In the 10 days since, it has seen more than a 300% increase in number of cases. With a nearly 140% increase in total cases in the last 10 days, however, Maharashtra remains the state with the highest number of cases in the country. The national tally, in this period, has more than doubled in the past 10 days. The 4 weeks of lockdownA day after the lockdown was clamped across the country, India reported 722 total cases. In the next 7 days, nearly 1,800 new cases were reported. Nearly 46% cases reported between March 27 and April 2 came from one of three regions – Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. A total of 4,181 cases was reported in the week between April 3 and April 9. The same three states remained the biggest contributors to the national tally next week, accounting for 45% of all cases in the country. In the last two weeks, Tamil Nadu and Delhi dropped out of the top 5 regions that reported new cases. In the week between April 17 and April 23, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan have together reported more than 60% of all new cases in India. A month later, on April 25, India’s tally of the coronavirus disease stands at 24,506—including 18,668 active cases, 5063 cured, discharged or migrated and 775 deaths, according to the health ministry’s dashboard at 8am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-state-of-states-what-numbers-show-a-month-after-covid-19-lockdown/story-g17EDRD1rClF6a4wWw9S3N.html

On Friday, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath gave officials 14 days to bring the migrant workers back home. Upon return, the workers will be quarantined for 14 days in government shelter homes and subsequently sent home along with food grain and cash. “The initiative taken by the Uttar Pradesh government of bringing back stranded migrant workers is laudable. We have been stressing on this issue and this is a positive step in this direction.Earlier, the Uttar Pradesh government sent buses to bring back students stuck in the coaching hub of Rajasthan’s Kota. “To ensure that this initiative succeeds fully, the state government must evolve a scheme for the return of rest of the labour force.

25-04-2020||India||Former IAS officer Sanjay Kothari takes oath as CVC||Retired IAS officer Sanjay Kothari, who was secretary to President Ram Nath Kovind, took oath as the new Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) on Saturday, the Rashtrapati Bhavan said in a communication. The post of CVC, autonomous anti-corruption watchdog, was lying vacant since June last year and Vigilance Commissioner Sharad Kumar was holding the interim charge of the top post since then. Kothari, an officer from the 1978 batch from Haryana, was named as new CVC by a high powered committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February this year. In the same meeting, ex-Broadcasting Secretary Bimal Julka was appointed as the next Chief Information Commissioner (CIC). “At a ceremony held today at 1030 hrs at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Sanjay Kothari was sworn in as the Central Vigilance Commissioner,” the Rashtrapati Bhawan communication said. At the time of his appointment, Congress floor leader in the Lok Sabh, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury who was in the selection panel along with Prime Minister Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah had opposed the decision. The Congress had then termed the process of appointing the CVC as “illegal, unlawful and unconstitutional” and demanded immediate scrapping of decision. The CVC is a statutory body and derives its powers from Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2013. It is free of control from any executive authority and has the responsibility of monitoring all vigilance activities in the Central government besides advising various authorities in planning, executing, reviewing and reforming their vigilance work. A major part of its work is to refer important corruption activities to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The CVC was instrumental in removing former CBI Director Alok Verma from the post in January 2019 after allegations of corruption were levelled against him in 2018. All the Central Vigilance Officers (CVOs) in government departments submit reports to the CVC and operate on the basis of guidelines/circulars issued by the CVC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-ias-officer-sanjay-kothari-takes-oath-as-cvc/story-85yYizvRzYaN5PtMHQroIM.html

25-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Rajasthan readies for plasma therapy, seeks permission from ICMR||Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital is following the footsteps of Delhi, Kerala, and Karnataka and gearing up to administer convalescent plasma therapy to critical coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients. Rajasthan government has sought the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) permission to begin trials.Clinical trials of convalescent plasma therapy are underway in several countries and states across the country and have shown encouraging results so far, the state government officials said.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “Plasma therapy could prove beneficial for critical Covid-19 patients and reduce the mortality rate, as no vaccine or anti-viral agents are available yet to treat the viral outbreak,” Dr Sunita Bundas, in-charge of SMS Hospital’s blood bank.“SMS Hospital doctors, who have recovered from Covid-19, can become donors for patients suffering from the viral infection,” she added. Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal of SMS Medical College, however, said that it is premature to comment on the plasma therapy trials.“The process hasn’t yet begun. We’re hopeful of getting the ICMR’s approval. We’ll start the therapy with critical patients,” he said.The state government has formed a team of doctors from the SMS Hospital to do a feasibility study on plasma therapy on critical patients. The team, comprising Dr Bhandari, Dr Bundas, professor of medicine Dr Raman Sharma and senior physician Dr Ajeet Singh, has agreed to conduct the plasma therapy after conducting research and tests for a week.“An antibody is a passive vaccine that helps to bring down the viral load in a patient. It’s given via blood transfusion and it fights and neutralises the virus,” Dr Sharma said.“The concept of plasma therapy is to inject antibodies taken from the plasma of a recovered Covid-19 patient into a positive patient to fight the disease,” he said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Dr Sharma pointed out that the convalescent plasma therapy was tried during the Spanish Flu, which ravaged the globe in 1918, and it helped lower the mortality rate by 20%, as per the available data.“At that time the entire blood from a donor was given to a patient. Now we only take the plasma, anywhere between 300 and 500 milliliters, from the blood and administer it to a patient,” he added.“The therapy is still at a trial stage. It’s too early to say if it’ll cure Covid-19 patients, but it has shown encouraging results so far,” Dr Bundas said.In Rajasthan, Covid-19 positive cases continue to rise, as 2,059 positive cases and 32 deaths have been reported to date. Rajasthan ranks fourth in the country after Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Delhi, as far as Covid-19 positive cases are concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-readies-for-plasma-therapy-seeks-permission-from-icmr/story-55LoAWjefp4GgD3vF0jKON.html

About 800 people have succumbed to the viral infection so far.However, the government says that with linear growth in the number of cases, India has, to quite an extent, managed to flatten the curve, with respect to other countries where cases have been reported exponentially and many more people died during the past three months.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It is hard to say whether peak will arrive in May or later, but if you look at the graph it is quite linear. The case positivity rate has been about 4.5% throughout, so we can safely say that we have managed to flatten the curve,” says Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and secretary, department of health research.The Union health minister, Harsh Vardhan, on Friday also said that India has been saved from getting into the stage three of transmission, which is community transmission stage where getting to the source of infection is near impossible.He also said that India has improved testing capacity over the past one month, with at least half a million tests already done so far, but the case positivity rate remaining around 4% bears witness to the fact that India is doing enough testing and the numbers are not alarmingly high.India has been constantly ramping up testing; on March 23, 14914 tests were done, and by April 22 at least half a million tests were done, which is about an increase of 33% in 30 days.There are about 325 laboratories in India, both government and private, currently testing for Covid-19, with a testing capacity of around 50,000 tests per day.Click here for Covid-19 updates“This is the capacity if we work in a single shift, but it can be scaled up to do almost double the number of tests. We have enough testing kits to perform tests for at least 8 weeks and ICMR is in the process of procuring more. There is absolutely no shortage of kits or any other material in the country that would hamper the testing. Everyone who needs testing is being tested,” says Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head, epidemiology and communicable disease division, ICMR.To date, 5,062 Covid-19 cases have recovered taking the recovery percentage to over 20%. There are 17610 patients currently undergoing treatment at various hospitals across the country. Close to 9.45 lakh people are under community surveillance either in home quarantine or housed in various quarantine facilities, shows government data.“The government is keeping a close watch and it is not like our intensive care units (ICUs) are overflowing, or there has been an increase in the sale of medicines for cough, cold or fever that would have been an indication that the disease is not under control; it is limited,” says Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.Paul is also chairman of the empowered committee 1 that takes care of availability of doctors and medical staff to manage Covid-19 in the country. Experts also say that lockdown measures, even though an extreme step, were implemented at the right time, and have helped in keeping the numbers in check.“It is not possible to stop an infectious disease but what lockdown has done is delay the spread, and successfully so,” says Dr Jugal Kishore, community medicine specialist, Safadrjung Hospital, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-cases-set-to-cross-25-000-mark/story-5ju9NfqcuLgKJS3pQwRcoJ.html

25-04-2020||India||‘Make rural economy the focus in coronavirus aftermath’: Bharatiya Kisan Sangh||The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has urged the centre to focus on rural economy as it draws up the plans for reviving economy and job sectors in the aftermath of the corona pandemic.“It is a good time for the government to ensure that while they offer stimulus packages to the medium and large enterprises, the cottage industry and the small scale sectors that keep the rural economy going are not neglected. That is where the revival will be and where the jobs will be,” said Badri Narayan Chaudhary, the national general secretary of the BKS.Large scale movement of workers back to their native states has led to concerns that many sectors including manufacturing, construction and even agriculture will face labour shortage. Even as the government claims the movement of migrant workers will be reversed after the lockdown is eased; the BKS functionary claimed otherwise.“A majority of the workers who have moved back to their native places from urban centres are unlikely to move back. The government will have to find them jobs or ensure they have entrepreneurial skills to sustain their livelihood,” he said.Chaudhary said, small sectors such as flour grinding mills, packaging etc. can be encouraged at the rural level.Emphasis on rural economy has been underlined by the RSS and its affiliates even during consultation that take place before the annual budget is prepared.“We have also suggested to Prasar Bharati (public broadcaster) that instead of focusing on old forms of agriculture on their DD Kisan channel, they should invite experts who can given demonstrations to the rural youth on how to become entrepreneurs and on the latest techniques that can be used to employ more people,” he said.The BKS has also urged the centres to ensure its advisories on transportation of agriculture produce and purchase at minimum costs are followed on the ground.Concerned by the losses faced by farmers on account of the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the corona virus, which has hampered the transportation and sale of farm produce, the BKS has urged the government to ensure that farmers are paid the minimum prices.“Our suggestion to the government is to ensure that administration at the local level follows the guidelines that have been issued. When trucks carrying goods are stopped for days at police check points, it affects the farmers because their produce is perishable and cannot be stocked for long. This problem is being faced by farmers growing fruits, vegetables and other produce,” said Chaudhary said.Prabhakar Kelkar, the all India vice-president of the BKS said there should be monitoring in the mandis to ensure that farmers are paid the minimum prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-rural-economy-the-focus-bharatiya-kisan-sangh/story-P8xffDC58nZELWTTbUfcrI.html
25-04-2020||India||Don’t allow entry into Delhi without Aarogya Setu App, Lt Guv Anil Baijal told||The Delhi government is taking a hard look at a “strong recommendation” to require people to install the Aarogya Setu app launched by the central government before they enter the national capital.The recommendation was made at Lt Governor Anil Baijal’s review meeting on the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic on Friday.National Centre for Disease Control director Surjit Kumar Singh, who had been asked to advise the city government, strongly recommended that the government allow people to enter the capital only after they have installed the Aarogya Setu app.Dr Singh also pushed for raising the number of people who were being tested in the capital and supported repeated rapid testing - on the 3rd, 5th and 14th day - so that a Covid-19 positive individual does not get left out due to a false report.It was at this meeting that Lt Governor Baijal decided to rationalise and carve out safe zones within large containment zones to prevent micro-transmission.A senior official told Hindustan Times that the government hadn’t taken a decision on the Aarogya Setu recommendation yet. But it hasn’t knocked it off the table either.The big hurdle to mandating the mobile application would be that there could be lakhs of people who may not have a smartphone. It has been downloaded on 75 million phones by Friday evening.India has 1.2 billion mobile phones; only 350 million have smartphones.‘In Delhi, we are told 80 percent of the mobiles are smartphones,” an official said.“Let us weigh the pros and cons,” he said.Dr Singh isn’t the first person to push the mobile application. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been nudging people to download the application launched on April 2. He made the same request when he spoke to a group of village heads via video conference on Friday.Already, the Central Industrial Security Force - which is responsible for security at key airports and Delhi metro - has made a similar recommendation.Why the app? First, the diseaseThe problem stems from the insidious nature of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19: it can be spread by a person who does not show symptoms, and is thus probably unaware of the illness, and merely breathing, coughing and sneezing could pass it on to anyone close by.There is also some evidence, according to studies, that the Sars-CoV-2 virus may spread as an aerosol that lets it linger in the air for longer and disperses over longer distances.How do you trace the contacts of such a person? Say two people who come close to each other in a metro, a bus (when the lockdown lifts) or at a grocery shop. Anywhere. One of them is positive, but doesn’t know it yet.Tracing contacts through conventional methods, would therefore be ineffective.Now the appAarogya Setu app could address this critical handicap in contact tracing.“You need to have a way of focusing (contact tracing) as an asymptomatic person travels over various distances, over time. We need to find out who all were close to that person and warn the others after the person is identified as positive. This is what Aarogya Setu also does – it will find the symptomatic person and also identify all asymptomatic people around them in the past few days and advise them too,” said Dr K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific advisor to the government of IndiaAlso Read: How to setup the Aarogya Setu appEric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told Hindustan Times earlier this month that a mobile phone-based tool would take care of an infected person having difficulty to recall who they met. “You don’t need the manpower and it is instantaneous – the speed is the most crucial aspect,” he said.How Aarogya Setu app worksLike similar mobile applications being used elsewhere, the phone exchanges details with phones that are within range of their Bluetooth radios. This information will be shared by the Aarogya Setu app with health authorities once the mobile phone subscriber confirms that he has tested positive, triggering an alert to all other devices that may have been in the proximity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-allow-entry-into-delhi-without-aarogya-setu-app-lt-guv-anil-baijal-told/story-eADHEVyCTs2sYfhKJQIIuO.html
25-04-2020||India||Finding freedom in fashion: A virtual fashion show by the specially-abled!||While the coronavirus pandemic has led to unprecedented restrictions for billions of people, for many with disabilities, the lockdown has paradoxically opened up the world. As society embraces “virtual” living, differently abled people are keeping themselves super busy with online styling and grooming sessions. They recently hosted the very first online fashion show and are in the process of hosting many more such events for their friends.Mohit Agarwal, convenor, says, “The idea is to get everyone busy so that they beat anxiety, depression and loneliness. With two days of rigorous training, these specially abled people performed with alacrity.”With lockdown in place, it is important to be positive and realistic optimism boosts physical and mental health and assists active coping.Mohit adds, “These people have a lot of talent. What they require is just a platform to showcase their talent.” Around 30 models with disabilities walked at a make shift ramp created by them at their homes last week. With confidence and aplomb, these paraplegics and wheelchair bound differently abled persons have been participating in events designed for them including fitness sessions and styling and grooming sessions as well as mental health classes. Gulfam Ahmad, wheelchair artist, says, “With the extended lockdown in place and restrictions on movement, we will keep organising such events to motivate others and encourage them to explore their ability rather than hide their disability.” Gulfam through his social media account has been giving fitness and grooming lessons to all his followers. He says “ Differently abled people who are wheelchair bound are not able to exercise at all due to the shutdown of gyms. Through my social media account, I have been giving them tips on how to exercise at home with limited resources.” Kamlesh Patel, dancer and model, says, “Many modelling agencies contacted me after the fashion show. We all are talented and it is just time that us that skill to our benefit. The lockdown has given us an opportunity to reflect on our skills and hone them.”As the idea of the novel online fashion show was floated to other people of the community, each one of them was more than willing to participate. Gulfam adds, “ We gave them training through videos on WhatsApp and calls. We guided them about the correct lighting and the camera angle and all of them walked with confidence and joy. We look forward to other such events.” He further adds, “For our upcoming events, we are getting visually impaired people and persons suffering from Down’s syndrome .” They understand that sitting at home to flatten the curve is an imperative to fight the virus. But that doesn’t stop them to lead their time productively. Gulfam says, “ We are constantly getting support online and on our virtual fashion show video.” He adds, “ Online auditions for Mr and Miss Wheelchair have begun and the response we are getting is immense.”With the ongoing coronavirus crisis and its impact on our day-to-day lives, there’s never been a better time to shift focus on a positive mindset. Kamlesh adds, “Ghar par reh kar hi hum corona ka vinaash kar sakte hai. So use this time constructively and wisely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finding-freedom-in-fashion-a-virtual-fashion-show-by-the-specially-abled/story-QNRHxY7ybNJpn99LbrGlIM.html

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said: “We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.”  The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.“The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,” it said.In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.“In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products,” it said.The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people. These take around five to six hours to show the results.In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-suppliers-of-covid-19-rapid-test-kits-ready-to-cooperate-with-india-after-icmr-s-advisory-to-states/story-Q9JzNpQO2JBbiLg4UG2ykO.html

Almost 90% of the 800 large and 453,000 small and medium factories in Gujarat have pending orders and nearly 70% are not in containment zones, officials said. About 80% of the salt and 70% of jewellery exported from India is from Gujarat.“In the first phase, factories with pending export orders will be allowed to start operations provided they are not in Covid-19 containment zones,” Ashwani Kumar, secretary to chief minister Vijay Rupani, said.Kumar said 98 sub-registrar offices in the state will also start working from Monday where social distancing norms will be strictly enforced.Purvin Mariyankari, director of the Ahmedabad Export Import Development Association (AEIDA), welcomed the order and said the industry is going to suffer as there is not much demand internationally.Mariyankari said the total exports from Gujarat in 2018-19 stood at $67,401 million.“The export industry has already witnessed $846 million fall in exports in February 2020 as compared to the same month in 2019 because of the slowdown,” he said.Shailesh Patwari, former president of Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), said it would be difficult to operate the industries in absence of workers.“Mostly, migrant workers from states such as Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh work in the export units and about 70% of them have already gone back,” Patwari said.The state government on Friday decided to lift the curfew from Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodra, the three most affected districts of the state, after 191 cases of the coronavirus disease cases were reported from Gujarat, taking the state’s tally to 2815.“But there will still be a tight implementation of the lockdown until May 3,” Shivanand Jha, Gujarat’s director general of police, said.The state has reported 127 Covid-19 related deaths.Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health), said the situation was fast coming under control and decision has been taken to test all pregnant women in the Covid-19 hotspots areas even if they don’t any symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-export-units-in-non-containment-zones-to-start-functioning-from-saturday/story-GU1q7qhWnLkb21XVulJY2N.html

We have completed all the documentation and have arranged an ambulance but none in the administration is granting us the permission to ferry him to his native place,” Rajeev, Singh’s nephew, said.Sanjeev Verma, Jammu’s the divisional commissioner, however, said there were certain rules to be followed in such cases.“First, they need to apply.

25-04-2020||India||Lockdown brings back 90s ki #GarmiKiChutti, and how!||The lockdown has got everyone reminiscing about the 90s. Adults are waking up to the theme song of Doordarshan’s famous Mahabharat, and siblings — who are now working professionals — are back to playing chess, carrom and snakes and ladders, like they use to in their childhood. For some, the lockdown has brought back memories of their school summer vacations, thus compelling one to feel nostalgic of the time when garmi ki chuttiyan used to be the highlight of the year. “I live with my parents and grandparents, and this lockdown has brought back memories of my garmiyon ki chuttiyan,” says Meera Malkotia, a fashion designer who is living with her family in Gurugram amid the lockdown. She adds, “I am able to join dadi for the evening aarti at six because we don’t have to physically go to office for now. Dadi is so delighted that she treats us to aam panna, which she use to make for us in our childhood!” READ: This lockdown, Bollywood actors go from bored to boardSome city folks are revelling in all the time they’re able to get away from their hectic schedule, with their parents pampering them like they used to years ago. “It’s a hot summer morning. Mom is serving breakfast. Ramayan on the TV, and glasses of Rasna in our hand. Some ads on TV are also depicting a happy family. We’re having meals together. The blue skies can be seen from the windows like it was in our childhood, when the pollution was less. We also wait to watch Shaktimaan. Lockdown sure seems like a mother’s prayers being heard. It’s a perfect break from the chaos of the world,” says Soumyaa Shrivastava, a resident of Noida.READ: Virat Kohli beats Anushka Sharma in a game of ludo, she announces ‘I am not a loser’Some couples have also celebrated their wedding anniversaries, amid lockdown, in the 90s style! “Now that malls are closed and e-commerce sites are either out of stock or not delivering on time, I went old school to surprise my wife on our anniversary. I wrote a love letter to her in ink, and plucked flowers from our garden because I couldn’t get a bouquet delivered. She loved the gesture; it reminded her of the times when I used to gift her the plastic red rose from the Archies gift shop back in the 90s,” says Anukrit Gupta, a resident of Noida who recently celebrated his marriage anniversary amid the extended lockdown.Mothers are doing all that they can to make their children’s birthday special. Gurugram resident Ruchika Trivedi, mother of a 10-year-old, “Meri beti ka birthday tha and lockdown mein party was not possible. Toh maine, uske birthday ke liye, ghar par chole bhature, rasgulle aur aaloo patties banaye. It took me back to my teenage years, when birthdays weren’t celebrated at Pizza Hut or any other restaurant, but at home where mom used to cook.

25-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||When there is no cure, metrics such as the prevalence of infection and immunity in a population become important.Which is why the results of New York’s study of 3,000 people picked at random for an antibody test that were announced on Thursday are being studied around the world.With the caveat that there are still question marks over the first phase of antibody tests for Covid-19 — it turns out there have been issues with the first phase of antibody tests for pretty much anything, including HIV-AIDS — the study found that around 21.2% of the sample in New York City tested positive.Also read: In midnight order, Home Ministry allows neighbourhood shops to reopenNew York City may be an outlier given its population density (the corresponding proportion for the state, in the same study, was 14%), but the study, which needs to be validated across a larger population is very significant: it means the extent of the infection is much larger than previously measured; it also means the fatality rates are much lower (in fact, much, much lower).There’s long been a theory that the number of people infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, is actually higher than that reported — one that has gained currency following confirmation that many infected people are asymptomatic and 97% of the cases (according to worldometers.info ) are mild. In New York City, for instance, this would mean that around 1.8 million people have been infected, didn’t know about it, and either didn’t fall ill or fought off an all-too-brief illness.A similar study in France claimed that 6% of the French population was infected.The New York study is important because it shows that antibody tests can be used to gauge prevalence of disease in a population. Some countries also want to use these tests to decide how and when to open up — a person with antibodies should, in principle, be immune to the disease and can safely return to work. Experts aren’t so sure because not enough about Covid-19 is known to assess just how long people with antibodies will remain immune to the disease.Also read| Covid-19 lockdown: Finance panel calls for extra support to small businessesSuch tests, which are being refined and improved continuously, will also help measure if and when countries achieve herd immunity. This is the proportion of population that needs to be infected with the virus (and therefore become immune, at least in theory) to ensure that the virus doesn’t jump easily from person to person. Experts put the number at 60-65%.The studies from France and New York show that it will be a while before that number can be reached.Sars-CoV-2 is clearly a vexing virus — it is highly infectious, hasn’t mutated and weakened and died out like many other viruses before it have, and remains without a cure. Every promising line of prophylaxis and treatment has ended up failing. The latest among these is Gilead’s failed Ebola drug remdesivir. The Guardian reported that the drug didn’t work in its “first full trial”. A previous trial in China, the report added, came up with a similar result.Also read| Mandatory masks, no in-flight meals, restricted lavatory use: Delhi airport to reopen with all new rulesAdding to its vexatious nature is the discovery that while it infects more of a population than initially thought, the virus doesn’t infect enough to cause herd immunity.Now, everyone is pinning their hopes on a vaccine trial that began on Thursday in Oxford. The vaccine, which uses a weak strain of a virus that causes a cold in chimpanzees, has generated excitement after one of the scientists involved in its development, Sarah Gilbert of the Jenner Institute, told media last week that she was 80% confident of the vaccine’s success. Everyone is hoping she is right.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-Nv96Urk58r4g4vC43WqwZJ.html
25-04-2020||India||In midnight order, Home Ministry allows neighbourhood shops to reopen||In a late night move, the government on Friday night permitted opening of neighbourhood and stand alone shops, including those located in residential complexes within municipal areas, but at a 50 per cent strength and after taking necessary precautions in the light of coronavirus pandemic, which has infected over 23,000 and claimed 723 lives so far in India. The Delhi government, however, wants to put a hold on the order and take a call on April 27.However, shops in market places, multi-brand and single brand malls located in municipality areas shall continue to remain closed till May 3, the order released by Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) stated.

25-04-2020||India||6 vaccines in human trials bring hope of early Covid-19 relief||Human safety trials of a coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University began on Thursday even as Indian company Serum Institute of India started work on making the vaccine locally so as to be ready in case the trial succeeds. The trial began in Oxford on Thursday, with the first two of 800 healthy volunteers recruited for the study being injected with a new vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 . This is the sixth coronavirus vaccine to enter the first phase of clinical trials, raising hopes of an antidote against the virus that continues to ravage the world.If the trials are a success, scientists hope to have one million doses ready by September, and to dramatically scale up manufacturing after that.Watch | Covid-19: Why a vaccine is likely by end of 2020 Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has partnered with the Oxford University to manufacture the vaccine in India even as the trial starts. “SII plans to begin manufacturing the ChAdOx1 vaccine in anticipation of the clinical trials in the UK succeeding by September/October. SII will initiate the manufacture at its own risk to jump-start manufacturing and have enough doses available, if the clinical trials work,” said SII CEO Adar Poonawalla.The trial will study whether the new vaccine is safe and can generate strong immune responses against Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and protect healthy people from infection.The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold adenovirus taken from chimps and genetically modified to make it impossible for it to infect humans. To develop the vaccine, researchers added genetic material to ChAdOx1 from the Sars-CoV-2 virus’ surface protein, spike glycoprotein (S), which helps the virus to bind to Ace2 receptors to enter human cells and cause an infection.“This type of vaccine uses recombinant technology where you insert a gene for an important protein of the virus you want to build immunity to, into a weak virus that can safely infect human beings. Here it is the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2 by which it enters cells, into a weak adenovirus. The expectation is that the weak recombinant adenovirus infection will cause antibody development against Sars-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby creating immunity,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology.“The ChAdOx1 vaccine uses a modified adenovirus carrying the coronavirus spike protein like a Trojan horse to enter human cells. The cells start making and releasing spike proteins, and, bingo, the immune system responds,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.The vaccine is safe and well tolerated, but some people may report mild and temporary side effects such as a sore arm at the injection site, headaches or fevers in the first couple of days after vaccination, said researchers. In the study, half of the healthy volunteers, between 18 and 55 years old, will receive the Covid-19 vaccine, and half a control vaccine, which protects against meningitis but not Covid-19.“By vaccinating with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, we are hoping to make the body recognise and develop an immune response to the spike protein that will help stop the Sars-CoV-2 virus from entering human cells and, therefore, prevent infection,” said researchers led by Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group.Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Oxford University, told The Times last week that she was “80% confident” that the vaccine being developed by her team would work.“I think there’s a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine. It’s not just a hunch and as every week goes by we have more data to look at,” she said.The ChAdOx1 vaccine platform has been used to produce vaccine candidates against many viruses, including those causing influenza, chikungunya, and zika. The Oxford group has used it to develop a vaccine against Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) coronavirus, which showed promising results in clinical trials.“Vaccines based on viral vectors offer a high level of protein expression, have long-term stability, and induce strong immune responses in humans, which make them highly effective,” said Dr NK Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research.Vaccine development against Covid-19 has progressed at an unprecedented pace and scale, with 78 projects reaching the active stage of development since China shared the genetic sequence of Sars-CoV-2 with the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020, according to the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), one of the world’s biggest public funders of vaccine development.Like the Oxford Vaccine Group, most developers are leveraging existing work on vaccines against Mers and rapid response platforms with 2019-nCoV genetic sequences inserted to speed up vaccine development. The research focus is on platforms based on nucleotides, which are the building blocks of genetic material, DNA and RNA, because of their potential for speed and flexibility for antigen manipulation. “The Oxford vaccine will be the third CEPI-funded vaccine to enter into phase 1 trials, along with Inovio’s INO-4800 DNA vaccine candidate and Moderna’s mRNA-1273 candidate... Producing a safe, effective, and globally accessible vaccine is our best hope in ending this pandemic. We aim to do this at a speed never before seen in vaccine development,” said Dr Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer, Cepi, in a statement.Cepi has initiated eight Covid-19 vaccine development projects with Curevac, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Moderna, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Queensland, and a consortium led by Institut Pasteur, with a goal of having at least three vaccine candidates submitted to regulatory authorities for licensure for general use.“If an international vaccine trial is successful, its emergency use can be sanctioned globally. If a vaccine trial is well designed and successful anywhere in the world, it can be used as the virus is the same. Some other countries are more suitable for efficacy trials, but no regular trial approval is needed in India following emergency use approval,” said Dr Ganguly.Vaccine development, on an average, takes 10.71 years from the preclinical phase, and has a market entry probability of 6%, according to a study in PLOS One, a peer reviewed scientific journal.Adaptive and parallel vaccine development phases, innovative regulatory processes, and advanced scale up manufacturing capacity have helped fast-track development, which traditionally takes an average of a decade. Even accelerated efforts, such as that for the first Ebola vaccine, took five years.“Our goal is a vaccine before 18 months. Normally, it takes about a decade to develop a vaccine, but global partnerships (between health agencies, academics, donors, industries, nations and philanthropies) have helped hasten development of vaccines against emerging public health threats. A vaccine against Ebola took five years, the one against zika took less than two years. The global effort to develop a Covid-19 vaccine in less than 18 months is unprecedented and would be an amazing achievement,” Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, World Health Organization, told HT on the phone from Geneva.The Oxford scientists ar hoping to cut even that optimistic estimate by two-thirds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-vaccines-in-human-trials-bring-hope-of-early-covid-19-relief/story-visLZbOv8tSYdAjFJZHGDN.html
25-04-2020||India||Self-reliance India’s biggest lesson from Covid, says PM||The coronavirus disease pandemic (Covid-19) has offered India a valuable lesson on the importance of self-reliance and self-sufficiency, and the country, each state within it, each district within every state, and each village within every district must aspire to attain the twin goals, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday. The PM also praised rural India for maintaining the norm of social distancing, and offered a simple, yet effective slogan to illustrate the concept -- ‘do gaj deh ki doori’ (a distance of two yards) -- which, he said, attested to the wisdom of the people in the countryside. “This pandemic has thrown at us new challenges and problems which we have never imagined, but it also taught us a very good lesson with a strong message,” Modi said in an address through video conference to India’s 250,000 gram panchayat heads on National Panchayati Raj Day. “It has taught us that we have to be self-reliant and self-sufficient. It has taught us that we should not look for solutions outside the country. This is the biggest lesson we have learnt,” the prime minister said.The address was delivered 10 days before India emerges from an extended 40-day lockdown ordered by PM Modi to stop the spread of Covid-19, which has taken a heavy toll on the economy with residents confined indoors, industrial production coming to a halt, air and rail services suspended and public transport going off the roads.Restrictions have been loosened selectively in some areas from April 20. Global supply chains have been disrupted and all nations have become preoccupied with meeting their own challenges. Restrictions on travel and mobility have meant tight controls over the flow of goods, services and labour across international, state and district borders. Modi emphasised that the development of the nation and democracy hinges on the progress made by the panchayats at the grassroots. “Every village has to be self-sufficient enough to provide for its basic needs. Similarly every district has to be self-sufficient at its level, every state has to be self-reliant at its level and the whole country has to be self-reliant at its level,” he said.“The international economic order is changing; the possibility of greater economic cooperation is diminishing. So the PM is emphasising the need to leverage India’s inner potential. There is also a larger message — wherein the PM is conveying to people they are equal partners in development,” Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies said.Gram Panchayats are local, constitutionally empowered, political and administrative units of grassroots governance across villages in India. Panchayats are playing a key role in supporting the government’s outreach in vast belts of rural India to spread awareness about the coronavirus disease. Panchayats have also undertaken door-to-door campaigns; stitched masks; made hand sanitisers for local populations; and provided support to the local administrative and security machinery in both providing basic services to residents and enforcing the lockdown. With the rural population slowly going back to work — this is a busy time in the agricultural cycle and rural industries have been opened up in non-hot spot districts —securing public health throws up additional challenges. Negligence by even a single individual can endanger whole villages, Modi said, warning against any sense of complacence. He asked panchayat heads to provide accurate information about the disease to each family in the villages, ensure that every individual downloads the Aarogya Setu app that tracks Covid-19 cases and takes care of the elderly, disabled, and the poor while maintaining social distancing. The PM said that his government had worked to make panchayats stronger and villages self-reliant. “In the last five years, nearly 125,000 panchayats have been connected through broadband from a mere 100 before. Similarly, the number of Common Service Centres has crossed 300,000,” he said. On Friday, the Prime Minister launched the e-Gram Swarajya app and the Swamitva Scheme. E-GramSwaraj is aimed at helping prepare and execute gram panchayat development plans; the Swamitva scheme is aimed at mapping inhabited rural lands, using drones and other latest survey methods. “The scheme will ensure streamlined planning, revenue collection and provide clarity over property rights in rural areas. This will open up avenues for applying for loans from financial institutions by the owners. Disputes related to property would also be settled through the title deeds allotted through this scheme,” a government statement said.Minister for rural development Narendra Singh Tomar was also present during the PM’s video conference with gram panchayat representatives on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/self-reliance-india-s-biggest-lesson-from-covid-says-pm/story-MRmhLClsDjbkmma9CyFt2O.html
25-04-2020||India||Maharashtra bans roadside fish stalls, wholesale allowed amid Covid-19 crisis||The Maharashtra fisheries department has banned retail sale of fish at roadside markets in a 43-point standard operating procedure (SOP) for the trade on how to operate during the Covid-19 pandemic.Wholesalers can sell their catch while maintaining social distancing norms but retail fish sale by vendors across markets has been banned until further notice, to avoid crowds.“Safety of citizens is of utmost importance. The decision is mainly focused on fisherfolk who set up stalls at sections of the market, landing sites or main roads, to avoid overcrowding and chances of community transmission,” said Rajendra Jadhav, joint commissioner, state fisheries department. “It comes as a difficult decision as lots of fisherwomen are employed in such activities across the Konkan but we were left with no option following overcrowding incidents being brought to our notice by the police.” Fisherfolk have opposed the restrictions. “Fisherwomen across 350 such sites in the Mumbai region will be directly affected due to this decision. No such decision has been taken for vendors selling agricultural produce. We demand that the fisheries department withdraw this SOP,” said Damodar Tandel, president of a fishing group in Mumbai.While the department has banned retail fish vendors, it has approved door-to-door supply of fish while maintaining social distancing norms.Other restrictions include medical screening of fishing boat staff and monitoring of boat movement. A committee, chaired by the district collector and with members from the fisheries department , will issue permits based on valid identity proof, health documents, and information of family members, submitted through the Aarogya Setu mobile app. “This is being done across 91 fish landing sites and three major harbours [two in Mumbai and one in Ratnagiri] functioning currently,” said Jadhav. “A proposal for mandatory thermal testing is in its final stage of approval from the state, and will also commence soon.”Other rules include social distancing during fishing at sea. “Not more than three people as crew will be allowed for smaller boats or vessels. If any crew member has reported sick or developed any flu-like symptoms, fishing activities need to abandoned and the boat will return to the jetty immediately,” said Jadhav, adding that the fish caught should not be consumed or touched. The catch will be disposed of as per bio-medical waste disposal norms. “If any crew member tests positive, the entire crew will undergo mandatory isolation for a minimum of 14 days,” said Jadhav. “Overall sanitation, disinfection of boats, wearing masks and gloves under all four scenarios is mandatory.” According to the National Purse Seine Fishermen Welfare Association (NPSFWA), Maharashtra fishermen have incurred losses over ₹800 crore over a month and had dumped 15,000 tonnes of fresh catch into the sea during the first two weeks of the lockdown. “The present guidelines are confusing and developed haphazardly. The state needs to first support the market by designing a supply-chain of how fish will be sold before drafting guidelines for fishing. By banning retail vendors, a source of income has been destroyed,” said Ganesh Nakhawa, chairman, NPSFWA, who is developing a supply-chain for door-to-door delivery.The Centre has also announced that there will be no relaxation for the annual fishing ban along the west coast from June 1 to July 31 – during the breeding season||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-bans-roadside-fish-stalls-wholesale-allowed/story-bs0EmzGaMNh816MD3Kty5L.html
25-04-2020||India||Covid-19 deaths cross 300 in Maharashtra||Maharashtra’s death toll in the coronavirus disease outbreak passed 300 on Friday and the number of patients was within striking distance of 7,000 , but a medical expert said it was premature to judge that the state had entered the stage of community transmission after 32 days under lockdown.Maharashtra detected 394 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday, taking the total to 6,817, including 5,279 in the . Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Eighteen more deaths -- 11 of them in Mumbai city -- vaulted the state’s death toll to 301. In Mumbai city alone, the case count went up to 4,447 as 242 new cases were registered on the day.The growing number of coronavirus cases despite the lockdown, which was imposed in the state at midnight on March 23, prompted the government of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to cancel all the relaxations that took effect on April 21 within a day.Even so, Friday’s increase in the number of cases was far lower than the 778, a record single-day jump, that had been reported on Thursday in Maharashtra .Maharashtra took 30 days to cross 1,000 cases on April 7, and exceeded 2,000 in six days on April 13. From 2,000 to 4,000 cases on April 19, it took six days. But for the number of cases to rise from 4,000 to 6,000 cases, the state took only four days. Although the numbers are high, senior officials said the state was yet to reach the community transmission stage, and there had been no exponential growth in Covid 19 cases. Community transmission is deemed to have started when a person with no recent history of travel and no exposure to a Covid-19 patient tests positive for the disease, and the source of infection cannot be traced. “The two 14-day cycles of incubation of infection were completed on April 20. It had begun from March 22 when international traffic was stopped. We will have to wait for another seven days to see the rising trend,” said Dr T P Lahane, head of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER).“If the rise continues and if the number of fresh cases is rising more than 50% (over the previous day) on a daily basis then it can be called exponential growth and only then we can say that the stage of community transmission has arrived,” Dr Lahane said, adding that exponential growth too is of two levels -- one entails a 50% rise in daily cases and the other a doubling of cases. “If exponential growth continues, then the state government will also have to extend the lockdown period for another three weeks till May 24 to break the incubation cycle,” Dr Lahane said.One silver lining is that the mortality rate dropped significantly in Maharashtra to 4.40% on Thursday from 7.41% on April 13.To be sure, it continued to be higher than the national mortality rate of 3.11% until Thursday.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government is set to start clinical trials of plasma therapy after receiving approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to do so. In the beginning, the therapy involving use of the antibody-rich plasma -- a blood component -- of recovered coronavirus patients on people with the disease will start at Sassoon Hospital in Pune as permissions for other three hospitals in Mumbai, Nagpur and Solapur are still awaited. The state has also got permission for pool testing for Covid-19.“We have received permission from the Centre for conducting clinical trials of plasma therapy in the state. Once cleared by the ethics committee of the state, it is going to be started in the next 3-4 days at Sassoon Hospital, Pune. It will also be started at JJ Hospital in Mumbai, Indira Gandhi Medical College in Nagpur and Solapur Medical College in Solapur once permissions are in place,” said Dr Lahane.(With inputs from Swapnil Rawal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deaths-cross-300-in-maharashtra/story-Hy48lggL2YIaCdWrp4tlQK.html
25-04-2020||India||Mumbai Covid-19 cases high due to aggressive testing: Govt||Mumbai reported 522 Covid-19 cases on Thursday, the highest single-day jump for any Indian city since the first coronavirus patient was detected in Kerala on January 30. Mumbai is also the Indian city worst hit by Covid-19, with 4,205 cases recorded until Friday morning. Since April 13 (242 cases in 24 hours), Mumbai has consistently recorded the highest one-day increase among Indian cities, with a single exception: April 17, when it reported 12 cases. Even the exception was because of the exclusion of private lab results and not an actual dip.Here are Mumbai’s single-day jumps for the last 10 days: April 14: 216; April 15: 140; April 16: 177; April 17: 12; April 18: 183; April 19: 456; April 20: 308; April 21: 419; April 22: 232; April 23: 522; April 24: 242.What explains the financial capital’s high Covid-19 numbers?Intensive contact tracing, testing and quarantining of high-risk individuals has contributed to the consistently high numbers, according to the health department officials of Maharashtra and Mumbai “Between 40% and 45% of our total cases are [the result of] efforts at contact tracing and fever camps in containment zones,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). According to BMC data on April 24, at least 400,000 people have been screened across 813 containment zones in the city (the number of containment zones increased to 930 on April 23), and at the airport since the Covid-19 outbreak. Simultaneously, Maharashtra’s health department has screened 2.726 million people across the affected districts. Nearly 2 million of these are in Mumbai.A senior BMC officer who asked not to be named said: “We have to consider the remaining 55% as well. These are coming from the untraced population, but the good thing is that many of them are coming voluntarily [for testing] and it is only later that our health officers realise that they are contacts of existing positive patients.”According to data analysis of positive patients by the Maharashtra Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD), 81% of the state’s patients are asymptomatic. Mumbai’s numbers are similar (80%).Notably, although the cases are rising, the mortality rate in Maharashtra is dipping. On April 12, the city’s mortality rate was 7.41%. This reduced to 4.4% on April 23. On April 12, of the 1,996 patients detected, 148 had succumbed to the infection. Until Thursday night, Maharashtra recorded 6,427 cases with 283 deaths. Mumbai’s mortality rate has fallen too. On April 12, it was 7.09% (92 deaths and 1298 positives). This came down to 3.97% on April 23 (167 deaths and 4205 positives). “Identification and quarantining of high-risk contacts has been helpful in keeping Mumbai’s numbers realistic. We will see high figures, but there is no reason to panic because these are expected results of the intensive contact tracing and isolation programme in Maharashtra,” a state government health official said. “Besides, we are aggressively testing a large number of high-risk contacts.”As of April 23, Maharashtra had conducted 96,369 tests, of which 55,000 (or 57.07%) were in Mumbai alone, according to Pardeshi. Maharashtra has recorded 89,561 negative samples. The remainder are repeat tests. According to data available with states on per million tests till April 22, Andhra Pradesh leads Indian states with 830 tests per million (41,512 total tests till that day), followed by Tamil Nadu (781 per million, 53,045 total tests) and Maharashtra (665 per million tests). Gujarat is on the fourth spot with 604 per million tests (36,829 total tests).As of April 23, 11pm, the number of home-quarantined people in the state touched 114,398, while 8,702 were in institutional quarantine, according to data provided by the state health department. In Mumbai, a total of 98,000 people are in government-enforced quarantine — 92,000 at home (in containment zones and hot spots) and 6,000 in institutional quarantine facilities (hospital isolation wards, stadiums, sports complexes and hotels). Mumbai’s municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said: “A significant proportion of Mumbai’s cases are of people that have already been quarantined and those that are under observation. The ones that are testing positive, BMC had already anticipated in some measure that they may have the virus.”“On any given day, between 70-80% of the city’s active cases are asymptomatic,” BMC deputy health officer Shah said on Thursday night, soon after the city’s highest one-day jump was announced. “It is a good thing that so many positive patients are asymptomatic, because they don’t easily spread the disease. They don’t cough or sneeze, and transmit it to someone else. In fact, these patients are adding to our collective immunity. It is the symptomatic ones we have to pay attention to. Not only because they spread it, but because they need medical attention, we need to treat their symptoms before they get worse and change into more complex conditions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-cases-high-due-to-aggressive-testing-govt/story-BTsNdQvP2aaORGZV1fJFzO.html
25-04-2020||India||Bihar, J&K students still stranded in Kota||Patna/Kota: Most students, barring those from Bihar and Jammu & Kashmir, are expected to leave for their homes by April 27 from the coaching hub of Kota as their home states were arranging transportation for them, Rajasthan officials said on Friday.Around 35,000 to 40,000 students were stranded in Kota when the national lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19 was announced on March 24. About 175,000 students enrol in Kota for coaching for admissions to medical and engineering colleges every year.About 18,000 students from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Daman and Diu have left Kota on buses arranged for them this week.Over 2,000 students from different parts of Rajasthan were also sent home, officials said. Over the next few days, students from Assam, West Bengal, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra were expected to return to their homes on buses arranged by these state governments.Jammu & Kashmir and Bihar are yet to make arrangements for about 11,000 students to return to their homes, officials said.The Bihar government on Thursday said it is sensitive to the plight of the stranded students but bringing them back amid the lockdown was not desirable and as it would amount to a violation of the Centre’s guidelines that bar interstate transport.A group of students from Bihar on Thursday sat on a hunger strike in Kota demanding that they be sent back home.“All state governments are taking back their students from Kota but the Bihar government is not listening to the students,” said Milan Jaiswal,18, a student. She added that her parents were under a lot of stress as she is stranded in Kota. Another student, Noor Shazima, 19, from West Champaran in Bihar, said she was under a lot of stress as no studies were happening and the coaching town looks like a ghost city as most students have returned. “Only a few of us are there. And, we do not know what will happen next.”Adnan Altaf, 19, a student from Jammu & Kashmir, said their families back home were very concerned and in a panic regarding the Covid-19. He said the government should help them return home.Bihar’s Congress leader Premchandra Mishra on Friday sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s help in ensuring the return of Bihar’s students. “Leaving our students there when Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh governments are sending buses for students from their states is absurd. Chief minister Nitish Kumar should explain his compulsion in not helping these students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-j-k-students-still-stranded-in-kota/story-W2w6XRSfjCRGKxwO1JfqPP.html
25-04-2020||India||‘Parivarwaad, members are auditors’: Why Centre wants to acquire Delhi Gymkhana Club||The central government has cited “parivarwaad” (nepotism), financial irregularities, misuse of allocated land and issues related to membership as the primary reasons behind its move to acquire the Delhi Gymkhana Club. The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) filed a petition, seen by the Hindustan Times, with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking to take over the premier club. The NCLT heard the petition through video-conferencing on Friday and set the next date of hearing for May 13, granting time to the Delhi Gymkhana board to file its response. The board sought the time to counter the government’s charges. “Some people who had applied for membership of the club and some member, filed a complaint with the MCA a few years ago,” said President of Delhi Gymkhana Club, Lt. Gen (retd). DR Soni. “We have been undergoing investigations by the MCA over the last three years.We received a petition, filed by UoI (Union of India) vs Delhi Gymkhana Club on 22nd, to appear before the NCLT, over video-conferencing, on 24th. The petition was incomplete in content and thus, our team of lawyers have sought more time to prepare our case, as the Club is currently in complete Corona lockdown.”“We need time to open our offices and prepare our case. The present Club management that has been petitioned by NCLT is barely six months old, while the alleged issues pertain to earlier times, so we have sought time,” he added.The Delhi Gymkhana, which shares a wall with the Prime Minister’s residence, has been under investigation for around three years. The first inspection report of MCA was submitted in March 2019 and a supplementary report in March 2020. According to the petition filed by the Government of India on Thursday, Delhi Gymkhana was registered under sections 25 and 26 of Companies Act in 1913, making it a “limited company” that is formed to promote art, commerce, science, religion, charity or any other useful theme. “The land was allocated to Delhi Gymkhana for sporting activities,” a person familiar with the matter, an official at MCA, said on condition of anonymity. “Instead only 2% of their accounts show expenditure on sporting activities. The club is being used for all purposes other than sporting activities. It has not produced a single international medal-winning athlete. This is misuse of land for purposes other than what it was allocated for.”“The government has alleged a misclassification of features,” said a former Gymkhana official. “It has alleged that money collected was not used for the purposes it was meant for. Hence, the government said the club was violating the terms of the land allotment.”The petition states that 30% of the expenditure of the company is in the form of catering consumables, wines, beverages and cigarettes.Moreover, it adds that Rajiv Jain, a member of the club, informed the President of the club that the “statutory auditors”, SN Dhawan and Company, appointed in 2013, are “ineligible” as they are “permanent members of the club”. “The auditors are members of the club,” confirmed the MCA official. “That is a conflict of interest.” The government’s petition also alleges arbitrary grant of membership. Membership is given after due election with a waiting list that stretches over years. The registration fee for government members is Rs 1.5 lakh and for non-government members, Rs 7.5 lakh. Government members pay Rs 5 lakh for a lifetime membership once elected, and non-government members, Rs 22 lakh.The government has alleged that the club is charging an “exorbitant amount for pending membership application where the moratorium on membership is at least three decades”. No interest is paid on the registration fee. Other than the 5,600 permanent members, and the categories mentioned in the club’s Articles of Association (AoA) , the club has also been granting non-permanent memberships to eminent people, holders of green cards, non-resident Indians, women, and Use of club membership pending elections (UCPs) (those whose membership has lasted 6-7 years and allowed to use the club pending an election other than those mentioned in the AoA), according to the petition. According to the petition filed by the Government of India on Thursday, Delhi Gymkhana was registered under Section 26 of Companies Act in 1913, making it a “limited company”. The petition adds that under section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956, it has to prove to the ‘satisfaction of the central government that it is formed to promote art, commerce, science, religion, charity or any other useful theme’. Moreover, the petition also mentions that under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, ‘sports, education, research and social welfare were added to the above list’. “It is to be noted that these green card holders have been enjoying preference in grant of memberships,” states the petition. “They primarily consist of dependents over 21 years of age of permanent members.”“Added to this is the fact that of the permanent members, 50% would be reserved for children of present members,” said the MCA official. “Others would have to wait 30-40 years to become members, while the children’s membership would be fast-tracked to five years by using a special queue. This is parivarwaad.” The government has also alleged misuse of power by officer holders . “In the interim, it has been proposed appointing an administrator from the government with a team of advisors till the Club is claimed by the government. Then elections can be held and the unauthorised members can be removed,” the MCA official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-gymkhana-club-to-fight-legal-battle-against-govt-takeover/story-2UxjRHw9BTpKcq4tQIa6ZN.html
25-04-2020||India||Maha coalition awaits guv’s call on CM Uddhav’s MLC nomination||Maharashtra’s Shiv Sena-led ruling coalition is anxiously waiting for governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s decision on the state cabinet’s recommendation to nominate chief minister Uddhav Thackeray as a legislative council member. Thackeray needs to become a member of either houses of the state assembly before May 28, when he completes six months as chief minister, to remain in office.Koshyari is consulting legal experts given the tenure of the nominated seat for which Thackeray’s name has been proposed ends on June 6, which is less than the one-year norm for filling such seats, while all polls have been deferred in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Representation of the People Act (RPA) mandates filling of vacancies in Parliament and state legislatures through bye-elections within six months from the date of occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the remainder of the term in relation to a vacancy is one year or more. The cabinet sent the recommendation to Koshyari on April 11 to nominate Thackeray as a member of the legislation council (MLC) from the governor’s quota after the Election Commission (EC) deferred all polls in view of the Covid-19 pandemic that has prompted a nationwide lockdown since March 25.The governor can nominate anyone with “special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art, cooperative movement and social service” as an MLC under Constitution’s Article 171. There are two vacancies under this quota following the resignations of two members last year.The Bombay high court dismissed a petition last week seeking a stay on the state cabinet’s recommendation, saying the governor had the power to take a decision on it.Thackeray was sworn in on November 28 last year as the head of the coalition government of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has maintained that it is not against Thackeray’s nomination but insisted that he should have contested the election earlier. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said it did not look good to “pressurise” the governor amid the coronavirus crisis.The Congress and the NCP have urged the governor to accept the state cabinet’s recommendation and avoid a Constitutional crisis in the state, which is the worst-affected by the pandemic in the country. A Shiv Sena leader said the party is planning to move the Supreme Court if the governor does not take a call till May 15. “Our argument is clear. The country is going through extraordinary times in view of Covid-19 pandemic that has also led to the indefinite postponement of all the polls. While the EC is not holding the polls, the governor is not accepting the state cabinet’s recommendation. This is unfair,” he said on condition of anonymity.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has questioned the delay in the governor’s decision. “Koshyari’s affiliation with the BJP is not a secret, but this is not the time to indulge in politics.” Political analyst Abhay Deshpande said the governor should accept the cabinet’s recommendation because of the extraordinary situation in the country. “There are no hard and fast rules. It is entirely governor’s discretion. If he does not accept the recommendation, there will be political ramifications.”Deshpande said a delay in the decision could backfire on the BJP given that Thackeray has since gained huge popularity and sympathy due to his handling of the Covid-19 crisis. “The situation has changed since the time Uddhav ditched the BJP. There was not much sympathy with him that time. But his handling of the Covid-19 crisis has earned him praises from all quarters.”A BJP functionary said it is too soon to speculate. “Let the governor announce his decision after consulting legal experts,” he said. “There is no question of party politics here. The governor will take a call based on legal advice. But the Sena should have been aware of the provision [Article 164(4)] of the Constitution that allows a non-legislator to occupy a position in the council of ministers only for six months. They should have planned for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-coalition-awaits-guv-s-call-on-cm-uddhav-s-mlc-nomination/story-hxJUB5Q5xNb7LPrx2a6J1L.html

The suspended official, identified as Girish Singh Rana, an assistant engineer in the irrigation department, was deployed as Covid-19 magistrate by district magistrate (DM) Ashish Chauhan in Chinyalisaur area of the district to ensure home quarantine of people who return to the district, said local government officials. “The children and their parents returned to their village in the area along with 47 others and were asked to remain in home quarantine as a precautionary measure. However, it was found that they didn’t follow this. The Covid-19 magistrate Rana was asked to prepare a report of the violators for necessary action,” said Chauhan.Rana should have visited the village, but, according to Chauhan, conducted his investigation over phone. ” He didn’t get details about the age of the violators due to which the names of the two children were included in the list. Based on the report , a local revenue police officer booked 47 people including the two children for violating home quarantine and endangering lives of others while four others were booked by the regular police for the same.”Villagers came to know about the case registered against the two children and raised strong objection on it. The district administration ordered an inquiry into the incident. “During the inquiry when the revenue police officer asked Rana, he said his report was based on details collected over phone , without any ground visit. Considering it as a serious dereliction of duty, I immediately suspended him on April 2,” said Chauhan.A government official familiar with the matter said since the report is “bogus”, the cses against the adults would be “quashed” too. According to the district administration, about 5,700 people returned to Uttarkashi during the pandemic. Of this, 2,900 are no longer being monitored; 2,400 are still under surveillance after completing their home quarantine; and the rest are still under home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarkashi-official-suspended-for-booking-toddlers-over-quarantine-violation/story-CYMZfE5PJEEDoTlTGj7SfM.html
25-04-2020||India||Rural minister Tomar meets with states to scale up flagship projects||With the nationwide lockdown nearing its end on May 3, and the government keen on extending concessions to more sectors of economic activities, the Union rural development ministry is eyeing ways to strengthen the rural sector that provides livelihood to a majority of Indians.Union rural development and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar met his state counterparts through video conferencing Friday to discuss ways to scale up key flagship schemes such as the guaranteed employment programme MGNREGS, the rural housing scheme (PMAY-G), rural roads programme (PMGSY) and the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).Tomar, who heads two crucial sectors that hold the key to rural growth, maintained the challenge presented by Covid-19 must be used as an opportunity to “strengthen rural infrastructure, create employment in rural areas and facilitate diversification of rural livelihoods.”His comments assume significance as tens of thousands of rural labourers have lost jobs and are either at home or in government-aided shelters currently. The supply chains are stretched and production process has been hit badly. Even some big states can’t maximise their opportunities in MGNREGS due to large areas coming under Covid-19 containment zones.Tomar’s comment came hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the gram panchayats to become self-sufficient, indicating a major shift in the government’s approach to tap rural potential.The government has already released more than ₹36,000 crore to the states and Union territories this current fiscal, which includes ₹33,300 crore under MGNREGS to quickly pay all dues and help states start new works.Tomar reiterated that MGNREGS should focus on water conservation, water recharge and irrigation work. Under PMAY (G), the government wants to complete 48 lakh houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rural-minister-tomar-meets-with-states-to-scale-up-flagship-projects/story-zWTGxOUwBfkEgFqyXIoQ5M.html
25-04-2020||India||CMs’ wishlist: Interstate transport options, funds||Chief ministers, especially of non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled states, are likely to discuss inter-state transport of migrant labourers, an increase in their borrowing capacity and food for work programmes when Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets them through video-conference on Monday.This will be the third such meeting between the Prime Minister and the chief ministers. While the meeting will deal with the Covid-19 pandemic in general, one of the main items on the agenda is likely to be whether the lockdown imposed to check its spread should continue beyond May 3.Most chief ministers want the lockdown to be lifted in districts not affected by the pandemic, even as differences remain on how the curbs should be enforced in the remaining areas.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa and his Andhra counterpart, YSR Jagan Mohan Reddy, want the lockdown to be restricted to the containment areas and their buffer zones and not entire districts. Others like Maharashtra and Delhi chief ministers, Uddhav Thackeray and Arvind Kejriwal, want no relaxation in norms in entire Covid-19 affected districts. Officials in most BJP-ruled states said they will follow the Centre’s directions on the lockdown.Across multiple states, officials said chief ministers would submit detailed proposals on reviving the economy at the meeting and seek economic stimulus for small and medium scale industries. Reopening of industries is seen as an important step in dealing with the growing concern over joblessness among migrant workers. Distress calls from migrant workers have reduced in states where industries have reopened after the Centre’s conditional permission for reopening them in rural areas outside the Covid-19 zones following the extension of the lockdown until May 3. “In Assam, where industrial activities started from April 20, the calls for bringing back migrants have fallen,” a Bihar government official said on condition of anonymity. Chief ministers of Rajasthan, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar are expected to seek relaxation on interstate transport for allowing stranded migrant labourers to return home. “Whenever the lockdown is lifted, there will have to be a definite plan for the migrants, maybe through special trains so that they can be tracked, screened and quarantined accordingly,” the Bihar official said. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has also sought special trains for bringing back workers to his state.Officials in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Haryana said they will seek additional relaxations for factories including making in-situ lodging for workers voluntary and allowing them to run in multiple shifts. Reopening of liquor vends is likely to be sought by most states. Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu are likely to demand the reopening of automobile sector supply chains as well as showrooms. Officials in West Bengal and Bihar said they are likely to seek full resumption of work in the tobacco industry as it employs around 15 million women. Telangana, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh want the information technology industry to fully function in non-Covid-19 regions with social distancing and hygiene norms in place. The states are expected to raise the issue of their worsening financial condition. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh is likely to seek the release of the state’s Goods and Services Tax arrears worth Rs 4,400 crore for the last four months and also an interim compensation of Rs 3,000 crore for April, said a state government official.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has sought implementation of the Finance Commission’s recommendation of giving 42% of the Central taxes to the states as against 41%. The commission reduced the funding to states citing slower than expected for the current fiscal. Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao on Thursday said the Centre needs to help the state financially. “I will request the PM to take states into confidence while making changes in the monetary policy and defer payment of loans taken by the state governments,” Rao said. He insisted the Centre must relax the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management rules to increase the borrowing limits of the states. An Andhra government official said Reddy too will raise the issue of a cut in central tax devolution for April and seek compensation for the same. He added the state has lost revenue of about Rs 15,000 crore in March and April. Officials said Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh are likely to demand food for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Kerala is expected to seek flights to bring back around two million expatriates, mostly from West Asia. The state will also ask for a special financial package, said a Kerala government spokesperson. Several chief ministers are expected to raise the issue of the shortage of personal protective equipment and testing kits. “Our chief minister [Mamta Banerjee] will raise the issue of not enough testing kits and faulty rapid testing kits...,” said a West Bengal official, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cms-wishlist-interstate-transport-options-funds/story-hNV5s7xBXQLbrGtL7TZtlK.html
25-04-2020||India||Covid-19: India, Gulf talk essentials’ supply, economic recovery||Uninterrupted supply of food and essential items from India to West Asian states and the role of energy security in post-Covid-19 economic recovery figured in external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s recent conversations with his counterparts from several Middle East countries.Negative social media posts from fake handles that went viral in some West Asian countries also figured in the conversations, where Jaishankar and his counterparts agreed that these efforts were aimed at impacting the special relations between India and countries in the Middle East, people familiar with developments said on Friday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe welfare of some 8 million Indian expatriates in West Asian states – who account for annual remittances of about $40 billion – also figured in Jaishankar’s conversations with his counterparts, including those from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Jaishankar had telephone conversations with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Oman on Thursday and with the foreign ministers of Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Palestine on Friday. He earlier spoke to his counterparts from Bahrain, Kuwait and Algeria.These conversations were a follow-up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s telephone discussions with leaders of GCC countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman and the leaders of Palestine, Jordan and Egypt. Modi’s conversations emphasised the “strong bilateral relations and the priority attached by India to ‘Think West’ in its foreign policy”, said one of the people cited above.“The Gulf countries import large quantities of food and other essential items from India, and the special efforts made by us to ensure uninterrupted supply of these items was appreciated by the external affairs minister’s counterparts,” the person said.“The post-Covid-19 economic recovery, particularly its energy implications, came up for discussion as India is a key market for crude oil coming from West Asia,” the person added.The people said negative social media posts from fake handles, such as the one impersonating an Omani princess, had “come in for adverse attention” from West Asian governments. “Both sides realise that such attempts are intended to create discord in the special relations between India and countries of the region,” said the person cited above.The West Asian states, the people pointed out, are very sensitive to attempts to create social disharmony and have zero tolerance in such matters.Over the past few days, a handful of Indians were either fired from their jobs or faced legal action in the UAE over their social media posts that were deemed Islamophobic. Princess Hend Faisal al Qassemi, a member of the UAE’s royal family, criticised these social media posts and emphasised India’s secular background. The Omani princess issued a clarification that she had no connection to the fake tweet from an account impersonating her.Jaishankar’s counterparts from GCC countries appreciated the contributions made by Indians to the growth and prosperity of those nations. “These countries have been very supportive and have gone the extra mile in taking care of the welfare of Indians in these trying times and the external affairs minister expressed his deep gratitude for their efforts,” a second person said.Many West Asian countries have sought essential medicines such as hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol from India to support their efforts against the Covid-19 pandemic. India has already supplied or is in the process of providing these medicines to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Egypt and Palestine as humanitarian aid and on a commercial basis, the people said.At the request of Kuwait, India deployed a rapid response team comprising doctors, nurses and paramedics to train and exchange best practices with local professionals for the containment and treatment of Covid-19. India has also helped the embassies of West Asian states to evacuate their citizens from different parts of the country.The foreign ministers of some Middle Eastern countries requested that their medical personnel currently in India should be allowed to go back, and Jaishankar has assured them this matter will be given sympathetic consideration, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-gulf-talk-essentials-supply-economic-recovery/story-cB6o1yOLjH5g0ujIe952WK.html
25-04-2020||India||Promising antiviral trial hits roadblock||What had been thought to be a promising antiviral drug to treat the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was found to offer no benefits to patients or prevent death, according the draft findings of clinical trials in China that were accidentally published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on its website on Thursday.“The Chinese study, which will soon be published, was inconclusive. We have to wait for larger studies,” said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the Geneva-based WHO, told HT.Remdesivir, an experimental drug developed by US-based biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences Inc. displayed no positive impact in the clinical trials conducted in China, according to the trial findings that caused shares of the company to drop sharply.“In this study of hospitalised adult patients with severe Covid-19, [which] was terminated prematurely, remdesivir was not associated with clinical or virological benefits,” said the draft result of the first randomised clinical trial of remdesivir, which was posted online by the WHO and first accessed by Stat, a health-oriented news website.The agency quickly took the report off its website, saying it had posted the findings by mistake and that the manuscript was still under peer review. Gilead Sciences told Stat that the document had mischaracterised the study.In a statement, WHO spokesperson Daniela Bagozzi, said: “A draft manuscript was provided by the authors to WHO and inadvertently posted on the website and taken down as soon as the mistake was noticed. The manuscript is now undergoing peer review and we are waiting for a final version before WHO comments on it.”The trial found remdesivir did not improve the condition or prevent death when administered to 237 Covid-19 patients.The drug was given to 158 patients, whose progress was then compared with 79 others given a placebo. A month later, 13.9% of the patients given the drug died, compared to 12.8% of those on the placebo. “Remdesivir was not associated with clinical or virological benefits,” said the trial summary.The trial was stopped early because of side effects, said the study. “Remdesivir was stopped early in 18 (11.6%) patients because of adverse effects, compared with 4 (5.1%) in the control group.” There were no details in the short report on the side effects that caused the trial to be halted.Remdesivir, which inhibits viral RNA polymerases, has shown in-vitro activity against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The drug had failed Ebola trials in Africa, and China had halted two trials for remdesivir, saying that there weren’t enough patients to fully enrol in the studies.“Remdesivir is part of the WHO’s multi-country solidarity trial that is comparing four promising treatment options against standard care to assess their relative effectiveness against Covid-19. We were following it, but haven’t started use in India,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, Institute of Critical Care and Anaesthesiology, Medanta-the Medicity, where patients are being treated in Covid-19 isolation ward since March 4.The other drugs being tested are chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir with ritonavir; and lopinavir with ritonavir plus Interferon beta-1a. Until there is sufficient evidence, the WHO cautions against physicians and medical associations recommending or administering these unproven treatments to patients with Covid-19 or people self-medicating with them.India is a part of solidarity trial, but the Indian Council of Medical Research has not approved remdesivir for Covid-19 treatment in India. “A Gilead study found reduced oxygen support in about 68% of the Covid-19 patients, but it was an observational study of patients being treated with it on compassionate grounds, and {NOT} a clinical trial. There is not enough evidence to suggest it works, so when we have clinical evidence that shows it working then we will act accordingly,” said Dr. Raman Gangakhedkar, head, epidemiology and communicable disease division, ICMR.A study of remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support,found clinical improvement in 68% patients, according to a Gilead Sciences-funded study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on April 10.In India, only the angti-malarial drug hydrocxycloroquine has received the ICMR’s approval for treatment of severely ill Covid-19 patients, but some hospitals have begun giving plasma therapy as part of registered clinical trials.India took the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir off the Covid-19 treatment list after it was found to offer no benefit compared to standard care, according to a study published in the NEJM on March 18.In the absence of a specific treatment for Covid-19, most clinicians depend on using antimalarial hydrocxycloroquine along with an antibiotic to treat people hospitalised in isolation wards.“It is all we have. All patients in isolation wards are given a combination of hydroxychloroquine twice a day and azithromycin once a day for five days, and it has been tolerated well. No adverse reactions have been reported,” said Dr Mehta.Gilead Sciences shares fell 4.34% to $77.78 on the Nasdaq following the report’s publication. In a statement, Gilead Sciences said the study had been terminated early because of low enrolment Stat news and “underpowered to enable statistically meaningful conclusion.” “There are multiple ongoing Phase 3 studies that are designed to provide the additional data needed to determine the potential for remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19. These studies will help inform whom to treat, when to treat and how long to treat with remdesivir. The studies are either fully enrolled for the primary analysis or on track to fully enroll in the near future,” the statement said .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/promising-antiviral-trial-hits-roadblock/story-3otpIB9M1UBK7tjCMwq7NN.html
25-04-2020||India||Govt, RBI must take bold decisions, not incremental measures: Amit Mitra||West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra is an economist by both training and practice. A Ph.D scholar from Duke University in the US, Mitra is an ardent advocate of developmental economics. In this difficult time of the coronavirus pandemic, in a telephonic interview with Hindustan Times, he says that the role of the Centre is to live up to the true spirit of cooperative federalism and take all possible measures to boost the sagging economy without worrying about breaching the laid-down fiscal deficit glide path. Edited excerpts: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slashed India’s economic growth to 1.9% in the current year when the global economy would contract by 3%. What do you suggest to boost the growth?This is an unprecedented situation and the Central government should come up with a comprehensive plan to boost the economy, which is a must to check rising unemployment, poverty and hunger. The Centre must announce a package of 6% of GDP as suggested by the CM [Mamata Banerjee] to the PM [Narendra Modi]. This is around Rs 10 lakh crore.The Union government and the Reserve bank of India must come out of their ‘Lakshman Rekha’ and take bold decisions, not incremental measures. There must be a big bang announcement. A substantial stimulus is a must, and also possible, because India has headroom to borrow. Compared to many developed countries, India’s debt-to-GDP ratio is less than 70%, while it is 106% for USA and 240% for Japan. Besides, international oil prices are subdued, which is in favour of a country like India that imports more than 80% of its crude oil requirements. Another source of headroom is India’s large foreign exchange reserves. The Centre must leverage these incidental advantages now and stop worrying about the fiscal deficit at a time when the question is of survival. The government must provide money in the hands of the poor, who are fighting to survive. About Rs 4 lakh crore could be transferred to the states which have the capacity to digitally transfer the requisite money into the bank accounts of the poor. In West Bengal, all disbursements are done digitially, no cheques or cash is used in our treasury. The poor must be provided free ration as we have done in West Bengal providing rice and wheat at zero price from ration shops. What about the formal sector?Industry is facing both demand and supply challenges as supply channels have broken down. The stimulus will help in creating demand and provide liquidity in the system. It can even be considered to provide what is internationally {done during such times} -- 80% salary of the works paid {for} by the corporate sector during the lockdown is borne by the government. This will allow the retention of the worker and this human capital can be quickly put on use when the Covid-19 pandemic is over.The liquidly crunch is acute, particularly for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). It calls for soft loans for a period of four years with a moratorium on repayments and interest for at least the first year. This will give them the breathing space. Similarly, other formal sectors need calibrated support. Sectors like aviation, hospitality, tourism, and non-essential retail have been almost crippled due to the lockdown.What is your assessment of economic growth post Covid-19?It is difficult to predict at this juncture when even developed countries are unable to give any precise answer when this [the pandemic] will end. If the pandemic ends by October and with adequate policy and fiscal stimulations, India could see at best 1% GDP growth. But if the pandemic continued for longer, it will have direct impact on GDP, which may even contract, posting negative growth.Is Centre providing enough financial support to the states, particularly to West Bengal?The Centre is not as responsive as it should have been in an ideal cooperative federalism and at a time when states are fighting a pandemic. Finance minister [Nirmala Sitharaman] has not replied to any of my letters, though I had one conversation with her. I have written eight letters, highlighting some genuine concerns of states and precarious financial positions they are suffering from. Of course, one or two suggestions have been accepted partially. An ideal cooperative federalism must encourage a culture of dialogue. States are the real implementers of policies and welfare programmes. They must be considered as part and parcel of a united India.Are you referring to the controversy regarding the interministerial central teams (IMCTs) sent to West Bengal?The Centre’s decision to send two interministerial central teams to West Bengal was done without consulting the state government. This is a breach of federalist protocol. The Centre’s move was not in the right spirit of cooperative federalism. We are also unable to understand why particular districts had been chosen. In terms of both -- number of [Covid-19] cases, and the rate of increase – Ahmedabad in Gujarat had a far larger numbers of cases and faster rate of increase.

The enquiry follows news reports that the election strategist was urgently summoned by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for consultations even as the state and the Centre traded charges over the former’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.“We have begun an enquiry and asked the airports to check whether Kishor defied lockdown orders and attempted to take a flight. Information has been sought from the airlines as well,” a senior civil aviation ministry official said on condition of anonymity. Denying the allegation, Kishor said the media reports are false. “I have not been to any airport after March 19. If anyone has any information contrary to this, they must put the details in the public domain.”  Kishor flew out of Kolkata on March 19 after a series of meetings with the state government. The lockdown was announced a few days later. “We have asked airlines who were operating cargo flights to Kolkata and they have denied any involvement,” a senior official at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on condition of anonymity.Both international and domestic passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 22 and March 25, respectively. Only cargo flights have been allowed to operate. Thus far, 347 cargo flights have operated since the lockdown. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has pulled up the West Bengal government over its handling of the lockdown and the Covid-19 crisis in the state in at least three letters written in the past week. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee hired the Kishor-led I-PAC in June last year after the the Lok Sabha election. The BJP won 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state, only four fewer than the TMC’s 22. In July, I-PAC kicked off an outreach campaign – ‘Didi Ke Bolo’ (Tell Didi) with the aim to reach out to at least 80% of the 16 million crore households in West Bengal over the following 20 months. The assembly elections in the state are scheduled for 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-probe-if-kishor-took-cargo-flight-to-kolkata-he-denies-charge/story-CKN5Lzh48SHSPauZ7z4KXN.html
25-04-2020||India||Some export units to resume work in Gujarat amid lockdown 2.0||From Saturday, export units in located in districts of Gujarat not affected by Covid-19, will resume operation, an official from the Gujarat Chief Minister’s Office said. On the day when 191 new cases of Covid-19 were reported from Gujarat, taking the total number of cases in the state to 2,815, the government decided to lift the curfew from Ahmedbad, Surat and Vadodra, the three most affected districts. “Now the curfew has been lifted from all the three districts of state. But there will still be a tight implementation of the lockdown until May 3,” said Gujarat police director general of police Shivanad Jha.Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health), said the situation was fast coming under control and a decision has been taken to test all pregnant women in Covid-19 hotspots areas even if they don’t any Covid symptoms.Ashwani Kumar, secretary to chief minister Vijay Rupani, said: “In the first phase, factories that have pending export orders will be allowed to start operations provided they are not in Covid containment zones.”Almost 90% of the 800 large and 4.53 lakh small and medium factories in Gujarat have pending orders and close to 70% of them are not in containment zones, government officials said.Purvin Mariyankari, director, Ahmedabad Export Import Development Association (AEIDA), welcomed the order , but said that business would sill be affected as there is not much demand internationally.“Gujarat accounts for 25% of India’s total exports in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, textile, ceramics, chemicals, gems and jewellery, even auto components,” Mariyankari said. About 80% of the salt and 70% of jewellery exported from India is from Gujarat.He said total exports from the Gujarat in 2018-19 stood at US$ 67.4 billion. “The export industry has already witnessed US $ 846 million fall in exports in February 2020 as compared to the same month in 2019 because of the slowdown.” Shailesh Patwari, former president of Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) said it would be difficult to operate the industries in absence of workers. “Mostly, migrant workers from states such as Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh works in the export units and about 70% of them have already gone back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-export-units-to-resume-work-in-guj/story-j0WqreH3BcrDbYfSzlfcqL.html
25-04-2020||India||At least nine RPF personnel test positive for Covid-19 in Bengal||At least nine Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel out of a group of 28 people who recently travelled on board a special train from New Delhi to West Bengal have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), an official statement said on Friday.The ministry of railways said that the 28 RPF personnel travelled by the special parcel train and later took a bus to Kharagpur in West Bengal on April 14. Out of these, nine RPF personnel were detected to have contracted Covid-19.“It is also clarified that these RPF personnel, while undertaking journey, did not come in contact with any public. There has not been any violation of the guidelines issued for management of Covid-19 by the central government or any state government. Nonetheless, a fact-finding committee has been constituted to ascertain the circumstances under which some of the RPF personnel of the contingent got infected,” the railway ministry said in a statement.“The RPF contingent of South Eastern Railway (SER) left Kharagpur for Anand Vihar on March 19 by train number 12443 with a purpose to collect ammunition for RPF of the South Eastern Railway zone. The contingent arrived at Anand Vihar on March 20.The ammunition collecting contingent arrived at Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF) 6 Battalion (BN) Dayabasti to deposit arms on 20th March 2020,” it added.Passenger rail services have been suspended since March 22 and a national lockdown is in place since March 24 to control Covid-19 outbreak in the country. The government said that the members of the contingent, therefore, stayed from March 19 to April 12 at the RPF’s barracks in Dayabasti, Delhi.“It was decided to run parcel special trains for transportation of essential goods during lockdown. Subsequently, the parcel special trains started from March 31. Since there was scarcity of ammunition with RPF in SER, the ammunition collecting contingent was advised to move by suitable parcel train from Delhi. It is pertinent to note that the on duty movement of armed forces was exempted from the restrictions imposed during the lockdown,” the ministry said.An official said on condition of anonymity that the test results of four others were still awaited.The contingent collected their arms and stock of ammunition on April 12 and proceeded by a parcel special train on April 13 from New Delhi railway station to the Howrah Junction railway station in Kolkata. They reached Howrah on April 14 around 8am and boarded a bus to Kharagpur, officials said. “Staff posted at en-route stations deboarded from the bus during the road journey. They were quarantined in respective barracks. Rest of the staff with ammunition were taken to Kharagpur. The bus arrived at Kharagpur at 13.30 hrs of 14th April. One constable boarded another parcel train from Kharagpur and reached Balasore on 14th night. He was also quarantined like other staff. He developed slight fever on 15th and was taken to Government Hospital Balasore on April 16 where he was tested positive,” the ministry said.Subsequently, he was kept in quarantine in a separate room at the RPF barracks in Balasore, Odisha, and tested positive on April 20. After that, the rest of the staff was tested, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-nine-rpf-personnel-test-positive-in-bengal/story-KAkSkdxbeSYQ985CmIsGdP.html
25-04-2020||India||No shortage of kits in Bengal: ICMR||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Friday refuted West Bengal’s claim that the state’s Covid-19 testing process has been hampered because it has not been supplied with any testing kits.“This is not true as the primary Covid-19 testing laboratory, that tests maximum samples, in West Bengal is ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Disease (NICED), and it has been regularly conducting tests. On April 22 alone, the lab tested 634 [552 new and 82 repeat] samples, with 50 confirmed positive among the new samples tested,” said a senior ICMR official who asked not to be namedThe clarification from India’s apex biomedical research organisation came after West Bengal health and family welfare department this week said that as of April 22 ICMR/NICED had supplied it no kits to conduct tests as per the ICMR’s recommendation. “Three types of ICMR-supplied Covid-19 test kits and their present status in Bengal: 1)Rapid Testing kits- they are being held back on account of poor functioning as per ICMR advisory. 2)BGI RT—PCR kits- they are being withdrawn as per communication from National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Disease (NICED) on April 21. 3)Antigen kits- Not supplied to hospitals in Bengal...,” the department tweeted. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday accused the Centre of maligning the state and spreading “canards” about its testing figures when the “real problem” was with the testing kits supplied to the state.The state and the Centre clashed this week after central teams were constituted to assess the Covid-19 situation in West Bengal, which has drawn flak for mishandling the situation, not enforcing the lockdown strictly and for low testing.The spokesperson said NICED is also one of ICMR’s regional kits storage depots. “The institute keeps releasing kits to eight other testing labs in the state every two days or as per their requirement.”According to ICMR data, NICED had sent 17,100 screening kits and 2,000 confirmatory kits until April 22 to the eight Covid-19 laboratories in the state apart from the main NICED lab to conduct real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. NICED has an additional supply of 22,300 testing kits in stock that can be distributed even at a short notice, the ICMR official quoted above, said.He added that the states have only been asked to stop rapid testing for the time being as experts were field-testing the kits currently because of the huge variation in results.  ICMR said no RT-PCR kit is faulty, and blamed handling issues for the problems reported from a couple of testing labs in Kolkata. “The RT-PCR kits are from many companies. The problems in one or two Kolkata labs were found to be in the BGI kits but that was not because the kits were faulty; rather they weren’t stored properly. These kits are heat sensitive, and if they are not stored under 20 degrees temperature, then the enzyme it contains degrades and test results won’t be accurate. These are also being replaced,” said the spokesperson. “All other labs are doing fine; none has complained so far. As for antibody-based tests they have been stopped across the country for time being.” ICMR said it has strengthened 16 depots across the country to ensure a smooth supply of kits. “There may be some logistical issues that the depots face in transportation these days because of restricted movement which may delay supplies sometimes, but to say that nothing is being supplied to the labs is wrong. The same kits are being supplied everywhere, why should only a particular state have a problem,” the official said.The Centre on Tuesday put on hold the use of antibody-based rapid testing kits for testing Covid-19 as many states complained that they were faulty and giving inaccurate test results. West Bengal chief secretary Rajiv Sinha on Friday did not comment on the ICMR claims and reiterated that ICMR has failed to provide sufficient RT-PCR kits to the state and the kits provided were faulty. The minister of state for health Chandrima Bhattacharya said: “The state health department will respond. I am not aware.”“It is not true,” was response of a senior scientist at one of the 12 authorized laboratories in West Bengal to ICMR’s claim that the kits were not kept in right temperature. “We maintained the right temperature. I believe the kits supplied by ICMR-NICED were defective and other states have also complained,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-shortage-of-kits-in-bengal-icmr/story-nCkOpL6f78uwUm3cLuzSLI.html
25-04-2020||India||Inspection teams rushed to Guj, TN & Telangana to control Covid-19 spread||The Centre is deputing interministerial to three more states -- Gujarat, Telangana and Tamil Nadu -- to probe perceived lapses in efforts to control the coronavirus disease and violations of lockdown regulations, the home ministry said on Friday, amid a bitter row with West Bengal over the alleged targeting of opposition-ruled states . The ministry said the situation was “especially serious” in major hotspot districts or emerging hotspots like Ahmedabad and Surat in Gujarat, Hyderabad in Telangana and Chennai in Tamil Nadu besides Thane in Maharashtra, where two teams have already been dispatched.The Interministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) will focus on a range of issues, including implementation of and compliance with lockdown measures,the preparedness of health infrastructure, safety of health professionals and conditions in relief camps set up for migrant workers and the poor. The teams will be headed by additional secretary rank officers and comprise public health and disaster management specialists.Earlier this week, the Centre had sent six IMCTs – two each to Maharashtra and West Bengal, and one each to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh -- for a spot assessment of the situation in the hotspots in the four states.The Centre had a run-in with West Bengal’s Trinamool Congress government, which reluctantly agreed to host the teams; it said that while the states were waging a battle against the coronavirus disease, the Centre was fighting the states.“About 70%-80% of the districts chosen for the Central teams’ visits are from states ruled by opposition parties. Why is no district from Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat a part of the list,” the party’s Derek O’Brien, who is a Rajya Sabha member, asked.The central team overseeing Mumbai-Pune has been asked to expand its inspection to Thane district in Maharashtra as well.Sharing the feedback sent by the IMCTs that toured Mumbai and Indore, two cities where the number of Covid-19 cases has spiked, home ministry joint secretary Punya Salila Srivastava said: “The Indore team has reported that there are 171 containment zones in the city, of which 20 are very critical”.The official added that the team visited the hotspots and had a detailed discussion with officials involved in contact tracing and so on. “The team found that there were adequate testing kits, PPE {personel protective equipment}, masks and other safety equipment available. Lockdown is being followed properly and safety of health infrastructure and safety of healthcare workers is being ensured,” Srivastava added.She said that the Indore team also interacted with farmers, the disabled, traders, non-government organisations, medical colleges, and migrant labourers in camps. The Indore team, Srivastava added, found the government had provided a facility whereby farmers could sell their produce at the minimum support price without visiting farm markets, decongesting the usually crowded markets.The Mumbai IMCT visited the slums of Dharavi and suggested the installation of portable toilets in the densely populated area to augment community toilets.Srivastava said the Mumbai team had also suggested arranging institutional quarantine for 2,000 -3,000 people; increased testing capacity and reinforcing the strength of surveillance teams using volunteers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inspection-teams-rushed-to-guj-tn-and-telangana/story-SO1OrBoEwj7vDRE7jK9e2I.html
25-04-2020||India||Central team finds lapses in Bengal’s Covid-19 response||One of the two  Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) sent to West Bengal to assess the on-ground situation there in terms of dealing with Covid-19 has highlighted several anomalies in its letter to West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha: a waiting period of at least five days for test results of patients in isolation wards; the possibility of dead bodies lying on beds in wards for four hours; and the lack of social distancing at hospitals. In a separate letter to the chief secretary, the IMCT has also asked for details on a committee of doctors set up to declare cause of death for Covid-19 patients and time taken by the committee in coming to its conclusion. West Bengal has asked the panel to consider co-morbidities (associated health conditions) while deciding the cause of death, unlike most other states which ascribe Covid-19 as the cause of death in the case of patients sufferIng any co-morbidity (such as diabetes or heart disease). Hindustan Times has seen a copy of the letters dated April 23, 2020; the observations by the IMCT are based on an inspection of two hospitals in Kolkata. The IMCT has also sent its observations to the ministry of home affairs. The IMCT letters were written by Apurva Chandra , the team leader. The first letter also sought details of the testing capability of the state , and of people who returned to Kolkata from overseas destinations till March 8. The West Bengal government, in its response, said it is looking into the observations made by the central team. “As some issues were related directly to health department, I have forwarded those queries to the state health secretary. He will respond. We are always ready to answer. They (the Central teams) have not come here as inspector or auditors. We do not have to pass any exam,” Sinha said. He also claimed that the expert committee to audit Covid-19 related death cases was set up as per the protocol of the Indian Council of Medical Research. “Till date the committee, which was formed on April 3, has audited 57 cases. Out of this, 18 have died directly because of Covid-19. In 39 cases, severe comorbid conditions were found to be immediate cause of death, while Covid-19 was incidental finding,” Sinha said.The exchange is the latest in the ongoing war of words between West Bengal, whose Trinamool Congress government is headed by Mamata Banerjee, and the Centre. Banerjee has previously accused the Centre of providing it with inadequate and defective kits; the state also initially objected to the creation of the IMCTs by the home ministry pointing out that five of the original six IMCTS created were for regions in states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s rivals. “The teams have been created with ulterior motive of doing politics with the opposition ruled states,” the West Bengal chief minister said, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 22, claiming that sending the teams was ‘undesirable’ and a ‘breach of established protocol’.Till Friday, Bengal reported 514 positive cases and 18 deaths. The state has carried out about 7,990 tests. In the past one week, Bengal has tested 800 people per day. Sinha said the testing capacity is being increased to 1,000 tests every day. Till Thursday evening, the state has tested 199 people per million, lagging behind most large states. The India average is 370 per million. The IMCT visited Chitranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI) and MR Bangur hospitals in Kolkata, dedicated for Covid-19 patients, on Thursday.In his first letter, Chandra wrote: “There were a large number of patients in isolation wards of CNCI as well as Bangur hospital awaiting Covid test results for five days or longer. Specifically at CNCI, there were four patients, since April 16 awaiting test result, two since April 17 and 3 since April 18. Some of the patients have tested negative. It is not clear why the test results should take such a long time and there is a danger of Covid negative patient acquiring the infection in the hospital while awaiting his test result.”The team further observed: “The patient admission at Bangur hospital appears to be chaotic. There was no social distancing in the waiting area. Two patients appear to be in very poor health but there was no medical support available.” It also said that patients at Bangur are sometimes referred from other medical facilities. “However, it seems the patients are left on their own to report to the hospital and are not escorted. This would always leave the scope for some patients not turning up or delaying reporting to the hospital.”It noted that there were only 12 ventilators at Bangur hospital which caters to 354 serious Covid-19 patients. The team said it was informed by hospital authorities that in case a ventilator is not available and ventilator support is required for a patient, the patient is transferred to some other facility. Sinha said the response of the health department has been sought on all these issues. After social media posts claimed dead bodies were lying on beds in a ward, IMCT asked about the matter on the spot and said in its letter that “it is possible that dead bodies were lying on bed in a ward as it takes at least four hours to issue a death certificate, after which the body is shifted to mortuary”. It has asked the state government for details. Sinha refuted the claims of the dead bodies not being removed from the hospital beds and said the test reports were coming without the time frame mandated by ICMR. Based on a presentation given to the IMCT by the state’s principal secretary (health), Vivek Kumar on Thursday, Chandra asked for the details of people who came to Kolkata from overseas destinations till March 8 and whether all those required to be tested have been tested. Sinha said all suspects with symptoms from airports were sent to government quarantine. “Asymptomatic cases were sent to home quarantine. Later the protocol changed and we followed the protocol without any lapse.” The state government has told IMCT that the number of tests has gone up by around 400 to 900 a day in the past four days; the team has asked the chief secretary for details on how many these are repeat tests. Sinha reiterated that the state’s effort to ramp up testing was hampered by not availability of enough testing kits from the Central government. The state has also informed IMCT that surveillance teams are screening 1.25 lakh to 2 lakh people every day in each district. The central team has sought details of number of screened persons actually tested for Covid-19 and found positive. IMCT also observed that from state government’s presentation before it, “it appeared that the state is reaching its peak capacity for testing”. IMCT has suggested that West Bengal consider conducting 2,500 to 5,000 tests a day.The chief secretary refuted the IMCT’s claim that there was any relaxation in enforcing lockdown saying in all 33,997 people have been arrested and 3749 FIR have been lodged till date during lock down period. “We have extended all cooperation to the IMCT. After we have cleared the position of the state government we have told them that they can visit any pocket,” Sinha said, claiming that he will not accept that the state government did not cooperate with the IMCT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-team-finds-lapses-in-bengal-s-covid-19-response/story-NVClxzdaULZJS2TfVbQjHJ.html

He explains that gaamchha, which has found resonance in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech as a homegrown personal protective equipment (PPE) kit against Covid-19, can double up as a mask, soap as hand sanitiser and a person’s own house to enforce social distancing norms.Initially, the government announced a nationwide lockdown for 21 days and then further extended for another 19 days till May 3 to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak.Mandal, who was born on October 1, 1911, in a family of marginal farmers in Gauripur, which has a population of around 5,000 people, was elected sarpanch at the ripe old age of 104 in 2015. The then Katihar district magistrate, Mithilesh Mishra, had felicitated him for his feat.His daily routine is one of strict discipline, as he gets up early in the morning, maintains a healthy diet, and serves his fellow villagers with love and affection. Mandal holds a rare distinction that none of his judgements -- delivered to resolve petty villages disputes -- have ever been challenged in court by any disgruntled party. “I’m happy that during my four and a half years’ stint as a sarpanch, all my decisions have been acceptable to both the opposing parties. I must have resolved around 350 disputes to date,” he said. Pratap Singh, a local villager, agreed. “No one has ever raised a finger against him.Any appeal made by Mandal ji has a divine ring to it. All of us obey his order,” he said.“His kind words hold the key to strict enforcement of lockdown restrictions in our remote village,” he added.Mandal, a Gandhian at heart, is dreaming of a prosperous future for Gauripur after the battle against the viral outbreak is won. “We’ll develop our village and the nation with renewed vigour after Covid-19 pandemic is defeated,” he said.His wife, Basumati Devi, helps Mandal in his social service. “I feel proud of my husband’s zeal and concern for the betterment of our society. I try to help him whatever way I can,” she said.Mandal was blessed with there sons. However, his youngest son, who worked as a lawyer at Katihar civil court, died a few years ago. The son’s death didn’t deter him from carrying on his selfless social work. His eldest son has retired from the sales tax department, while the middle one is working in the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-warrior-109-year-old-sarpanch-is-spreading-awareness-about-the-outbreak/story-y2lO2hJ5ui6uZhVDCEf5bI.html
25-04-2020||India||India opens bridge in Arunachal Pradesh setting stage for China face-off||India has opened an all-weather access along its border with China to enable faster movement of troops and artillery, another potential irritant in relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.The bridge, which can take 40 tons of weight, was built in Arunachal Pradesh in India’s remote northeast, a region that’s claimed by China and near the scene of previous clashes. Border intrusions have risen 50% in 2019 compared to the previous year, people with knowledge of the matter said.”That part of the border has always had a tendency to friction point between India and China. Lack of reliable and all weather connectivity was vulnerability,” said Nitin Gokhale, a New Delhi-based strategic affairs expert. “The new bridge and improved road overcomes that and ensures uninterrupted supply to troops.”The new access along the border with China comes amid heightened tensions between the two nations after Beijing accused India of blocking its companies in the South Asian nation after New Delhi tightened laws for foreign investors from acquiring local firms. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a message requesting comment.India claims the Chinese army violated the 3,488 kilometer (2,167 miles) long un-demarcated border over 600 times, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is not public.“India and China have different perceptions of the border,” Indian Army spokesman Aman Anand said on Thursday. “Perceived transgressions are result of the perceived boundary.”Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is ramping up its infrastructure along the border, which it says isn’t aimed at any particular country, but rather the development of remote border areas. It has completed 74 strategic roads along the eastern border, with plans afoot to finish 20 more by next year, the people said. It will reduce time taken to move and material by half and help 431 villages that lie across the region during the Covid-19 outbreak.India tweaked its law on foreign investment by making it mandatory for companies from countries that share a land border to acquire local firms only after seeking an approval from the government. The move, which cuts the risk of opportunistic takeovers as the coronavirus outbreak drives down valuations of Indian companies, had so far applied only to FDI from Bangladesh and Pakistan. India shares its land border with seven countries, including China.The bridge opened by India also strides one of the main access routes of the Chinese Army into India from Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-opens-bridge-in-arunachal-pradesh-setting-stage-for-china-face-off/story-QBRkW8PKz0fhbT7WNYdUUN.html
25-04-2020||India||More scientists write to FAC about treading carefully on hydropower projects in Dibang Valley||Several scientists have written to the six-member Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) after they came to know that the panel is considering granting forest clearance for the 3,097 mage-watt (MW) Etalin hydroelectric project, which will involve clearing of at least 2.7 lakh trees in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley. The area is rich in subtropical evergreen and rain forests and rare flora and fauna.On Friday, besides Umesh Sreenivasan, assistant professor at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, and Nandini Velho, a wildlife biologist who had written to the FAC on Thursday; Aparajita Datta, a senior scientist at Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF); Anindya Sinha, a professor at National Institute of Advanced Studies; Rohit Naniwadekar, Rohan Menzies and Megha Rao -- all scientists from the NCF -- also wrote to the FAC in two separate letters, seen by HT, citing a number of peer-reviewed studies that highlighted the ecological and biodiversity richness of the Dibang Valley.One of the letters highlighted that community-managed forests or what is termed as unclassed state forests outside the Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary, which is rich in biodiversity. Earlier, one of the camera trap-based studies referred by the FAC had found that community-managed forests hosted a much higher diversity of mammals than within the wildlife sanctuary.A 2016 study, titled, “Mitigation of Damage to Wildlife Habitats”, by the Pune-based Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) found that 24 mammal and 100 bird species recorded during an eight-day survey underestimated the area’s biodiversity. “Actual bird list within a 10 km radius of Etalin-Damro road is more likely to be closer to 300 species, including some rare ones like Blyth’s Tragopan, Rufous-necked Hornbill, Ward’s Trogon, Hodgson’s Frogmouth, Beautiful Nuthatch, Wedge-billed Babbler, Mishmi-Wren-babbler, etc,” the study had said.Scientists sought a cumulative impact assessment of all the hydropower projects in the region, including the 3,097 MW Etalin and 2,880 MW Dibang multipurpose projects --- two of the country’s biggest hydel ventures in the same region. “We respectfully submit that the impacts of multiple projects placed in close proximity on the same river limb must be assessed together because these impacts will be cumulative and not independent,” they wrote.They found high diversity and said critically endangered White-bellied Heron and the White-winged Duck were also spotted there by other researchers.Hydroelectric projects are known to affect the river flow resulting in modifying the habitats of these birds. Dams are known to negatively affect food supply also for riverine birds and alter the sediment dynamics. “We’d like to kindly request you to direct the necessary agencies to conduct systematic studies on assessing the potential cumulative impacts of a run of the river projects on the riverine habitats and riverine birds before these projects are given clearance and before the river systems are permanently and irreversibly altered,” they wrote to the FAC, which is a panel of experts and bureaucrats appointed by the Union Ministry for Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC).The FAC heard the forest clearance proposal for the project on Thursday. A senior FAC member, who didn’t wish to be named, said though a decision on granting forest clearance to the project has not been taken yet, most members had a favourable view of it because it is a large “clean energy project” that could replace dirty energy. “We had a long discussion and all the views of the members have been taken on record. Most members had a favourable view, and also the sub-committee that had visited the site,” he added.The FAC member also said that the members haven’t received many representations directly but they will check if representations from scientists have been made. HT had reported on April 23 that a FAC sub-committee, which had visited the site in February, has recommended in their report dated April 21 that Etalin project be allowed on condition that the developer deposits money for wildlife conservation in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-scientists-write-to-fac-about-treading-carefully-on-hydropower-projects-in-dibang-valley/story-ikGnHIt843sVrLI1aAtmlJ.html

Calls will be placed from the phone number 1921, asking people questions about symptoms of the disease. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The tele-survey, announced late on Tuesday, will be done by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), and is intended to help the government detect areas where the Coronavirus has spread. An interactive voice response system (IVRS), back-ended by a NIC team, will be rolled out. Analysis of call data will be done by other wings of the government, said officials. A senior official of the IT ministry said the tele-survey is expected to reach out to 900 million feature phone users across the country. Officials said of the 1.2 billion mobile phone users in India, only 350 million have smart phones.“Just as the Aarogya Setu is reaching out to smartphone users, the tele-survey will collect details from feature phone users,” an official said on condition of anonymity. The call will lead to successive prompts for SMSes on the user’s feature phone, and seek answers to a set menu of questions. The systems are being readied and will be rolled out by the weekend, officials said. The service will be available in languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi. The tele-survey was initially piloted in Tamil Nadu a fortnight ago with the help of the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, simultaneously when the IT ministry was rolling out Aarogya Setu. Another ministry official, wishing anonymity, told HT the pilot was successful and helped authorities find the next area of spread. “It helped us find the next red zone or containment zone,” said the official. During the pilot, 15,000 people were screened through the tele-survey, helping authorities finalise a list of people suspected to be infected by the Coronavirus. “State authorities would then reach out to them for necessary action,” said an official. The number 1921 was selected as the number 1922 is a toll-free service for people to listen to the prime minister’s popular radio programme, Mann ki Baat, the first official quoted above said. In a statement, the government said calls placed to mobile phones are aimed to “enable proper feedback of the prevalence and distribution of Covid symptoms”. It added, “Please be aware of any other calls by pranksters or or calls from any other number in the guise of such similar survey.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-success-in-tamil-nadu-government-to-roll-out-telesurvey-to-identify-covid-19-hotspots/story-BPcqjuxBhebLYHPrdRw8jN.html
25-04-2020||Today's||Guest Column: Use lockdown selectively, not repetitively||The data published at the worldometers website details that on March 24 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the national prolonged lockdown, there were cumulatively 536 coronavirus cases and 10 deaths.While the figures have increased exponentially since, it is difficult to predict when these statistics will be lesser. No worthy epidemiologist will predict whether that point will be reached this year. Optimistic politicians talk of us winning the war on coronavirus, to improve the depressed public sentiment and call for our collective resolve. Yet, the reality is that the virus is embedded in society, will remain at much higher levels than those that triggered the lockdown, may progress to subsequent waves that are worse with higher levels of transmissibility, morbidity and mortality. Therefore, if at the end of the current lockdown our decision makers inevitably are forced to accept higher prevailing infection levels, then surely a future lockdown should necessitate a higher statistical trigger, at least a magnitude greater than those reported in government statistics to date.Alternatively, the government needs to consider whether any further lockdown is necessary beyond all but the worst of the hotspots. WE CAN LIVE WITH ITWe now know much more about the fight that we are waging. Whatever the initial governmental failings, we are now better equipped in our hospitals and slowly our testing capabilities are being enhanced, though we still lag significantly Pakistan and Sri Lanka on a per capita basis. We also know that most people, possibly as high as 95%, that get infected do not require hospitalisation, many of these are truly asymptomatic throughout. Of those hospitalised, the mortality rate is about 20%, with experts predicting an eventual fatality rate of below 1%; worse than regular flu but less than SARS, MERS and Ebola.The Prime Minister, in his drive to make the lockdown effective, played to the inherent insecurities of a poor and fearful nation. In doing so, he created mass hysteria with each patient becoming an untouchable.The Prime Minister calls for synchronised candle lights and a unified national spirit, but he has failed with his communications if his actions have resulted in the distressing and distasteful situation of families refusing to cremate their loved ones.Modi needs to urgently convey to the masses that this disease is not the plague, nor smallpox, nor Spanish flu. It is a vicious condition, worse than most flu epidemics, but we can live with it, lead reasonably normal lives and salvage what there is left of a tattered economy.Stop the extreme commotion behind each new case. Stop sealing entire neighbourhoods surrounding each new case when all we really need to do is to isolate the recent contacts of the patient.FISCAL STIMULUS NEEDED, FASTLockdown works in reducing the spread of the infection, but the collateral damage is huge. The massive additional financial resources being allocated to support industry and social welfare, could be better repurposed for healthcare alone. Contagion relief measures announced on March 23 by the finance minister are reported to cost Rs 1.7 lakh crores, which is less than 1% of GDP. It is shocking that more than a month later, the government has not felt compelled to revisit this. Contrast this with many western governments announcing new relief measures almost weekly, in some cases already exceeding in aggregate 5% of GDP and with the distinct possibility of overall coronavirus related expenditure approaching some 15% of GDP or more in the short term.This government needs to accept that its actions have exacerbated the situation, it needs to provide must greater fiscal stimulus expeditiously, even at the risk of inflation and currency depreciation, and it needs to move the fight from lockdown to testing, isolation, tracing and treatment. This can be done at a fraction of the cost of the relief measures announced and those in the pipeline.NOT A RISK INDIA CAN TAKEIndia does not have the resources to provide repetitive fiscal stimuli for each likely wave of this virus if each wave is to be accompanied by another lockdown. Society must be allowed to live. Farmers must have a market. Business and industry must be allowed to operate. All within an environment where we test pervasively, isolate the infected and hospitalise those with severe symptoms. Concentrate the resources on a testing and therapeutic strategy, save the livelihoods of hundreds of millions and resuscitate industry while there is still a chance.Failing to do so and continuing to rely on repetitive lockdown will risk a prolonged depression, lasting possibly a generation.If that sounds alarmist then look at the GDP data for Spain and Greece from 1928 to 1953, which took a generation to recover from the Great Depression.This is not a risk that India can take.The writer is a Congress leader and a former Punjab MLA.
