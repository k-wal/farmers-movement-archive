17-04-2020||News||Covid-19: Protecting both lives and livelihoods||Should we save lives or livelihoods? This question has put policymakers, citizens and scholars in a quandary. Other questions include: How long should public health be prioritised over economic prosperity? By temporarily shutting down the economy, is the cure becoming worse than the disease? Until when can we sacrifice the nation’s economic potential and reduce GDP growth? At first blush, these questions appear to be valid and logical. However, a recent survey, conducted by the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business where more than 40 economists from across the best universities in the United States (US) were asked similar questions, found that the overwhelming response was that any reductions in the current lockdown restrictions in the country will result in much deeper, long-term economic damage.Similarly, a statement issued by the Economic Strategy Group of The Aspen Institute on March 25 stated: “Saving lives and saving the economy are not in conflict right now; we will hasten the return to robust economic activity by taking steps to stem the spread of the virus and save lives.” In other words, economic experts seem to be stressing that premature lifting of lockdowns will result in a resurgence of the pandemic with greater virulence. The fact is that the questions referred to at the beginning of this piece present a false binary of having to choose between the economy and public health. The two are not, and cannot be viewed as, mutually exclusive, but must be seen as interdependent. Curbing the virus is a sine qua non for the economy to rebound. It is fallacious to presume that the obliteration of growth and jobs is a corollary to social distancing, and not the pandemic itself.Curiously, according to a 2014 study published in the Preventive Medicine journal, an increase in the unemployment rate during the Great Recession had a beneficial health effect across European countries, except for suicide mortality. Therefore, it is incorrect for anyone to argue that a recession will “kill” more people, in the ordinary course, than the virus.In times such as this, public trust in the government’s strategy is more critical than the strategy itself. If by lifting the lockdown, the virus rebounds with equal or higher velocity, will the public still trust the authorities who misguided them? The importance of public trust cannot be overstated in the present construct since the success of any government strategy requires public acceptance. It is only the public that can ensure the efficacy of maintaining strict social distancing, good hygiene levels and testing compliance.Most economists continue to urge that the only way to minimise long-term damage to the economy is to first control the virus, as being not only an end in itself, but a prerequisite for saving livelihoods and the economy.A start-stop approach, which refers to imposing a lockdown, getting complacent and lifting it, only to see a surge in infections and reimposing restrictions — will yield a haphazard result, thereby compromising the mental, social and economic benefits to a methodical, sustained and phased economic recovery. The most glaring example of this is Singapore, which has been compelled to reintroduce a harsher 30-day lockdown after it prematurely eased the initial restrictions and permitted international travel, leading to a spike in cases. On April 3, the World Health Organization and the International Monetary Fund laid out the task ahead for all governments that are dealing with the coronavirus crisis. They point out that an economic stimulus can only be “in addition to” — and not a substitute — to health care spending. Governments across the world have the unenviable task of striking a harmonious balance between spending on health care (enhancing support to existing hospitals and new makeshift treatment stations, ramping up testing infrastructure and procuring kits, paying salaries and providing medical equipment to frontline health care workers) and providing an economic stimulus to those most in need, enhancing unemployment benefits and minimising corporate insolvency. It is only by walking this tightrope that we can achieve the most optimal outcome of minimum health care burden and maximum economic recovery. It could prove instructive for economists and policymakers to reassess the functioning of modern-day capitalism to a more broad-based form of capitalism that works for a majority of the population as pointed out by hedge fund investor Ray Dalio. He points out that capitalism “is producing a self-reinforcing feedback loop that widens the income/wealth/opportunity gap” and continues to concentrate wealth within the hands of a few and, thereby, increasing the gap between the wealthiest 1% of the population and other 99%. It is a cause for concern when in the near future, millions of people will have to undergo a dip in living standards while investors in big corporations, especially those which have capitalised on the current lockdown due to the specific nature of their businesses, reap the benefits of all-time high share prices. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, while the combined net worth of the world’s 500 richest people has dropped $553 billion this year, it has surged 20% from its low on March 23. This is largely due to the benefits that government bailouts will bring to behemoths, particularly in the United States. It is time for society to use this pandemic as an opportunity towards increasing the value of human life in a more qualitative way to create a society that truly understands what Mahatma Gandhi, said: “It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-protecting-both-lives-and-livelihoods/story-N9oc13PAvAy51Jc8jAFgmK.html
17-04-2020||News||Kerala offers the rest of India a model to fight the pandemic||Calamities, it seems, bring out the best in Kerala. Be it the floods of 2018 and 2019 or the current coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), the Keralites’ collective resilience and solidarity across religious and political divides set the state apart. It was in Kerala where the first Covid-19 case in India was detected on January 30, and exactly two months later, the state had 235 cases, the maximum number reported in the country. Fast forward to April 16, the state recorded 394 confirmed cases, 245 recoveries and two deaths.The credit for this incredible achievement primarily goes to effective grassroots-level government institutions and a proactive, level-headed political leadership. People in the remotest corner of the state have access to medical attention and ration shops, and, if required, the state government intervenes to ensure that the basics reach the needy. Migrant labourers constitute nearly 10% of the state’s population. Due to an unambiguous communication, a majority of them left for their homes after the state announced a partial lockdown, well ahead of the national lockdown.However, health is just one of the many battles. It is time to confront the elephant in the room: Securing the life and livelihood of the people. If the former was a battle, the latter is nothing short of a war, something that the state governments cannot fight on their own, without the Centre leading from the front. New Delhi could leverage the lessons learnt from Kerala’s battle for health.Covid-19 is perhaps the single most impactful economic crisis of our lifetime. It has shrunk our needs to the basic necessities of life – food, medicines, electricity, water, and communication technology. As the coronavirus grinds the world to a halt, the crisis can kill millions due to hunger, and can even bring serious civil unrest.We need to think of crisis management and stabilisation of the economy and its recovery, which might even spill over to the second half of 2021. We must be prepared for the long haul.India will need an economic stimulus package equivalent to 10-15% of its GDP. This is unlikely to cause inflation in the short-term, considering the subdued demand. Of course, it will aggravate the fiscal deficit and government debt, but that should not be of prime concern now. Several other countries have taken this route – the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Korea, Italy, France and the United Arab Emirates. Japan, for example, announced an economic stimulus package of $1 trillion, which is 20% of its GDP, whereas the package announced by India so far is below 1% of its GDP.How the stimulus package is distributed to achieve the desired results is another major question. It is a difficult proposition in a country like India, with the majority employed in the unorganised sector. Over a three-month period, a considerable part of the relief package should be transferred directly into the accounts of the most vulnerable people, especially the daily wage earners. In the organised sector, employers should be paid an employment subsidy to help them keep the people employed. For example, the UK government provides up to £2,500 per month per employee as a payroll subsidy to the employer. Such an unprecedented crisis requires proactive central governments and central banks, because only they can ensure liquidity and cash flow. This is the time to seize the moment. Tough times do not last long, but tough people and determined communities do. If Kerala can do so well against the virus, India can surely do so, too.VK Mathews is founder and executive chairman, IBS SoftwareThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/kerala-offers-the-rest-of-india-a-model-to-fight-the-pandemic/story-bGZc91aEE4ePJVquomTDHK.html

He attacked the Delhi government for giving a go-ahead to private schools to charge one-month tuition fee and said the state should bear a major part of the expenses on salaries of their teachers.“It is wrong to ask private schools to take a month’s fee. How will the parents pay the fee when there is a lockdown? The Delhi government should pay 75% of expenses borne on teachers’ salaries so that these schools get relief and waive three-month fees,” added Maken.Earlier in the day, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia announced that no private school in the national capital could hike fee or charge anything from the parents other than one-month tuition fee.Maken also claimed that 55 health workers in Delhi have so far tested positive for coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-seeks-power-water-charges-waiver-in-delhi-slams-kejriwal-government-over-school-fee/story-fmsIsEjyGAQuPCIpXgke9H.html

In this context, I hope that all schools would be concerned about providing proper salaries to their teachers and other staff,” the HRD minister said.“I hope all state education departments will find a balanced solution, keeping the interests of the students’ parents as well as the interests of the schools,” he saidHRD officials said that while they understood the parents’ concerns, schools have to pay their staff.So far, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Punjab, among other states, have curbed fee hikes and asked schools to not insist on immediate payments.In the higher education sector, the All India Council for Higher Education (AICTE) has told colleges under its purview not to pressure students into paying fees till the lockdown ends.In an order issued on Wednesday, AICTE member Rajive Kumar said that it had come to the notice of the regulator that some institutions were insisting that students pay the fee, including admission charges. “Institutions should not insist on payment of fees till the ongoing lockdown is lifted and normalcy is restored,” the AICTE directive said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pvt-schools-should-rethink-fee-hike-quarterly-payments-hrd-minister/story-Zv8HnfgmDZmDPrSePa0L1N.html
17-04-2020||Chandigarh||Managing Covid patients needs multidisciplinary approach: PGI study||An article published in the Asian Journal of Psychiatry by the faculty members of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research states that healthcare providers need to be equipped to deal with the stigma attached with the coronavirus disease, which in all likelihood will affect patients who have recovered and may face difficulty in reintegration with families and communities.Based on interviews of healthcare providers, the article explores the perceived motivations influencing morale among those working in a multi-specialty tertiary hospital.The article states that patients in isolation have many needs beyond medical management. “This includes psychological, social and rehabilitative needs. All these cannot be looked after by the treating doctor alone. The treating doctor becomes a one-stop shop. This can be draining and exhausting,” reads the article.Treating doctors do not have solutions to manage the safety and welfare of the family of the patient that may be quarantined, for which the study suggests possible solutions.A background multi-disciplinary team can be helpful. Similarly, development of tools and screening questionnaires to rapidly identify problem areas and getting on board local administration are other ways.Among personal fears and annoyances experienced by doctors and nurses are isolation and worries about going back home and possibly being sources of infection to their families. Possible solutions for the same are employing more manpower, acknowledgment of work beyond call of duty, respite, and projection of healthcare providers as role models.Also, people in the community stigmatise and worry that healthcare providers themselves may transmit infection for which colleagues need to be better informed and made conscious of not saying anything or behaving in a way that may be construed as stigmatising.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/managing-covid-patients-needs-multidisciplinary-approach-pgi-study/story-x59eUAQZq2JRB2T2fxx2AK.html

Please wait for her action. I am sure she will take appropriate redressal steps.”Commissioner Joshi told HT: “I will meet him and work out the appropriate way ahead, as instructed by the honourable minister.”On Thursday, Joshi had posted a string of tweets: “He (Dr. Singh) not only misled the donor, defied the Medical Superintendent of the hospital, and diverted the material, but also gave it away to people who didn’t need it to the loss of those who needed it more, taking decisions which were nowhere in his purview.” Hindu Rao Hospital in Malka Ganj is a designated “COVID-19 screening centre” in the city.The Delhi Medical Association (DMA) had also demanded that the doctor be reinstated. A letter from DMA President, Girish Tyagi, on Friday, said, “We condemn the termination of Dr. Piyush Singh at the time of COVID-19 pandemic emergency with allegations of bringing disrepute to the hospital. The commissioner accused him of theft (but) he has produced the bill (for purchase of PPEs) which is in the name of Dr. Piyush Singh.”The Joint Director of the National Board of Examinations, Dinesh Chand, also wrote to the hospital’s medical superintendent on Friday: “The available documents have not been taken up before the Grievance Redressal Committee… which is an essential requirement for the NBE to address such issues. We therefore direct to cancel his termination…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/union-health-minister-intervenes-in-feud-between-doctors-north-body-commissioner/story-7oUVHC04iBegiMLElA9gjP.html

The tally of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad is now 29.“After the first oncologist had tested positive on April 14, we had ordered comprehensive sanitisation of the hospital. We had also asked the hospital authorities to provide us with a list of patients which had been attended by the first doctor during the past 14 days in the department. The help of electronic surveillance will also be taken to trace the contacts,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad district.“The test report of the second resident doctor was received Friday. He probably came in contact with the first oncologist. We are trying to trace his contacts as well. The 90 samples of the probable contacts of the first doctor were also received and they were all negative. The tests were conducted by the hospital and reports were sent to us. The test reports of seven of his primary contacts are awaited. The source of infection of the first doctor is yet to be ascertained,” the CMO added.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not take calls despite repeated attempts.Till Thursday, at least 15 areas in Ghaziabad were listed as hot spots which included one of the residential pockets of Gyan Khand in Indirapuram where the first doctor lives. “Since the second doctor has tested positive and he lives in Vaishali Sector 1, the area will now be sealed. We are waiting for written formalities from the health department. The hospital will not be sealed. We are issuing directions to hospital authorities to take up extensive sanitisation and also conduct tests of their staff members. The area where doctors used to sit for duty will also be asked to shut down for three days and extensive sanitisation of the department where the doctors were working will be taken up. The renewed directions will be sent soon,” said Aditya Prajapati, sub divisional magistrate.Meanwhile, a company spokesperson said that Max Healthcare has recently commenced testing all of its 24,000 healthcare workers, in-patients and new admissions for Covid-19 in all network hospitals.“A second resident doctor working at Max Hospital, Vaishali has tested Covid-19 positive today (April 17). He was in close contact with the resident doctor who had tested positive on April 14, working at the hospital. Both our doctors have been shifted to Max Hospital, Saket, east-wing, and are stable and asymptomatic. Local authorities have been informed as per protocols to conduct contact tracing,” the spokesperson added.“Meanwhile, the 90 samples collected from patients this week at the hospital have so far tested negative. Health care workers who were contact traced have been asked to home quarantine,” the spokesperson added.They added that all routine precautions such as disinfection, as per internal statements of purposes, are being taken up in all the areas of the hospital.“The primary area of movement of the resident doctor (who tested positive on April 14th) was the operation theatre (OT). The OT complex has been disinfected and closed for 72 hours. All close contacts have been asked to do home quarantine and their samples have been collected today (April 17). They have been asked to report to the flu clinic of the hospital in case of any symptoms to them or their family members,” the spokesperson added.Out of the total of 29 in Ghaziabad till Friday evening, seven patients have already been discharged from different hospitals. However, 672 reports are yet to arrive, according to the health department officials.The state health department officials said that the total number of positive cases in the state stood at 846, reported from 46 districts. Out of these, 74 patients were discharged from different hospitals.They added that the number of hot spots in Uttar Pradesh have also risen to 279 till Friday evening, which have a total population of about 24 lakh.“At least 58 samples from different districts like Lucknow, Gonda, Bareilly, Hardoi, Shahjahanpur, Agra and Pilibhit were taken for pool testing on Thursday. Three pool samples came out positive while 55 other pool samples were found negative. We will soon be introducing the pool sampling in other districts as well,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).In connection with the violation of lockdown norms, officials said that Uttar Pradesh police have so far registered 20,453 first information reports in which 1,62,811 persons were booked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-another-resident-doctor-from-max-hospital-vaishali-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-Twa3C8PyvJWKas5cCKOewN.html

She said the state’s glass, brassware, carpet, furniture, handloom, leather, pottery, fishery, poultry and many other sectors were in bad shape and facing a serious impact of the economic slowdown following the pandemic.On farmers, Priyanka said the state government had allowed use of combine harvester machines for harvesting wheat crop but there was a need to give permits to harvester machines as they come to UP from other states. She said dues of cane growers should be cleared and compensation should be distributed to farmers whose crops were damaged by hailstorm.She said families of labourers had been facing shortage of food and cash due to the lockdown.“As a considerable number of workers have not been registered with the government they fail to get benefits of government schemes. The state government should ensure that benefit of government schemes reached unregistered workers/labourers,” she said while insisting that the food grains should be distributed even to those who do not have a ration card.She appreciated the move to provide free ration to MNREGA and said no financial relief was, however, being given to them. She said the amount of Rs 611 crore disbursed to them was payment of their due wages and the state government should announce a package for them as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/priyanka-suggests-task-force-for-up-s-economic-reconstruction/story-IbZSVa4XazyWAip3RX4nML.html

17-04-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: Lockdown-hit daily wage workers turn vegetable vendors||Twenty-four-year-old Rajendra Kumar has found a new job during the lockdown. Like many other daily wagers in the unorganised sector, Kumar earlier took up daily welding jobs with small firms in Loha Mandi area of Ghaziabad. However, with the lockdown putting paid to that vocation, he and many others like him have now turned into vegetable and fruit vendors.The state government has stressed on doorstep delivery of essential items during lockdown and vegetable vendors are playing a vital role in this delivery system. Kumar said he has taken a cart and weighing machine on a daily rent of ₹100 and have been selling fruits and vegetables for the past one week.“This is a most beneficial job and several of my friends are also doing this. People need daily supplies and our movement is also not restricted by the police. I now have a means to feed my family. I go late night to the market in Dadri to purchase vegetables and sell these in residential areas of Ghaziabad,” he said.“However, the work fetches me less than my work as a welder -- I earn about ₹200 a day. I used to earn about ₹15,000 a month (about ₹500 a day) doing contractual welding job. Once the lockdown is lifted, I will return to my welding job,” Kumar said.Ashok Kumar, who hails from Gorakhpur and lives in Panchvati Colony, used to work as a tent and venue decorator before the lockdown. He, too, has now taken a cart on rent to sell vegetables.Sixty-two-year-old Saleem Ahmad from Usman Colony in Dasna sold biryani near Dasna jail and earned about ₹300-500 a day. Ahmad is also selling vegetables after fetching them from the Hapur market.“Initially, I waited for about 10 days in the hopes that the lockdown will be lifted and I can resume my work. Since the lockdown was extended till May 3, I decided to sell vegetables. Although I earn daily, it is not a profitable proposition. Sometimes, the vegetables remain unsold and have to be thrown away,” he said.“In some areas, people have barricaded the lanes and don’t allow vendors inside. They get suspicious of new vendors and ask for names and even Aadhaar cards, etc. If they are reassured, they purchase from us,” he said.Vishvendra Kumar, secretary of Mandi Samiti, said the number of new retailers/vendors has increased at the Sahibabad vegetable market by about 25%-30% since the lockdown.“We have issued 3,680 passes to vendors for purchase of stocks from Sahibabad vegetable market. This includes about 2,000 vendors who earlier used to sell vegetables inside the market. The remaining are new vendors/retailers. They arrive at specific timings and collect their stock,” he said.According to the industries department officials, Ghaziabad has about 32,000 different category of industrial units.“About 600 units are presently operational and these are the ones engaged in providing essential items. From April 20, we expect another 1,500 units to open. This will help contractual workers to get back their jobs,” Virendra Kumar, deputy commissioner (industries), said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-lockdown-hit-daily-wage-workers-turn-vegetable-vendors/story-lXP4Dj7aFXAxCO6wSwgyFO.html
17-04-2020||Noida||22-year-old woman ends life in Dadri||A 22-year-old woman allegedly hanged herself to death in Dadri after her husband left home for his in-laws’ place in Palwal Friday morning. The woman wanted to accompany her husband, but he did let her come with him because of the lockdown, police said.Dinesh Singh, station house officer, Dadri police station, said the woman lived with her husband in Brahampuri Mohalla in Dadri. “The couple had married last year, and the husband works as an electrician. Our preliminary investigation shows the couple had some marital discord in the past. Around 10 am on Friday, the man left home for his in-laws place in Palwal,” he said.Police said that the woman also wanted to accompany him. “They had a heated argument in the morning. Her husband did not allow her to accompany him due to the lockdown. He left the house saying he would return soon,” Singh said.Police said after her husband left, the woman got angry and locked herself in a room. “The woman hanged herself with a ceiling fan and died. The woman’s neighbours later reached the spot and knocked on the door but they did not get a response. They then informed her husband. Local people had broken the door open, and had found her hanging,” said the SHO. The husband informed the police and a team from Dadri police soon reached the spot and sent the body for an autopsy, police said.“The woman’s husband was on the way when he received a call that his wife has ended her life. Police have not found any suicide note from the spot. We have not received a complaint from the woman’s family,” the SHO said. The autopsy report is awaited, he added.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/22-year-old-woman-ends-life-in-dadri/story-beTNy94QbfkiNfJnxFsrlL.html

17-04-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana gears up to start manufacturing operations from Monday||Financially starved due to a sharp revenue dip amid the lockdown, the Haryana government on Friday inched closer to resuming commercial and manufacturing activity in the state from April 20, the Centre-designated day to operationalise the enterprise.The industries and commerce department and labour department held consultations with the industry representatives on resuming manufacturing operations on Friday evening.Industries and commerce additional chief secretary TVSN Prasad said they would come up with the state implementation guidelines for resumption of manufacturing operations on Saturday.“We have constituted district and block level committees to process approvals and monitor containment requirements including social distancing,”’ Prasad said. These committees will evaluate which factories or industries can be permitted to carry out operations.As per the central government’s guidelines, industrial activities cannot be permitted in the containment zones of hotspots.Chief minister M L Khattar on Friday said the state government was planning to resume manufacturing activity in the hotspots of Gurgaon and Faridabad also. There are nine containment zones in Gurugram and 13 in Faridabad where no industrial or commercial activity can be started presently.“However, we do have scope of resuming operations in other areas within the hotspots. Also, a large number of industrial estates of Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) are outside the municipal limits and qualify for resumption of operations,” said a top official.4,000 TRANSIT PERMITS ISSUED TO FIRMSChief secretary Keshni Anand Arora told HT that for facilitating smooth movement of goods and supplies, the state government has issued around 4,000 transit permits to more than 120 companies in the last 48 hours.

17-04-2020||City||Tardy wheat procurement leaves Ludhiana farmers jittery||Even as the wheat procurement exercise commenced at the two local grain markets - near Jalandhar Bypass and Gill Road - on Friday, farmers complained that due to sheer mismanagement at the markets, their troubles had only begun. Slow procurement process was not only putting their crop at risk of getting damaged by rain, but they also had no option but to spend the night at the market to guard their produce. Others highlighted that the lack of adequate workers in the grain markets was delaying the procurement process and will make their coupons issued for a certain day invalid.The government is issuing the farmers coupons, which will act as a curfew pass for unhindered movement of their loaded tractor-trolleys. To limit crowding and ensure social distancing, the farmers are being invited in batches through the coupons, with permission to sell up to 50 quintals of wheat.Gurdeep Singh from Jamalpur village said he was issued a coupon for Friday, but after he reached the market, the commission agent asked him to wait till Saturday as the procurement was held up. “The government should procure the crops the same day, otherwise issuing passes for different days serves no purpose,” he added.Another farmer, Kuljeet Singh said while migrant labourers had left for their hometowns, the local labbourers were not as efficient, which was slowing down the procurement process. “Farmers are allowed to bring in only a single truck or trolley on one pass. What will farmers with bigger landholdings do? This process is putting their remaining yield at risk of being damaged by rain or fire,” said Singh. Manohar Gill, president of the Ahrtiya Association at the grain market near Gill Road, said the farmers were being issued coupons, and a few also arrived in the markets on Friday. “The procurement will be done as per the guidelines issued by the administration to avoid rush,” he added.Darshan Lal (Laddoo) Baweja, chairman of the market committee, said he had been apprised of the farmers’ concerns regarding slow procurement. “I have scheduled a meeting with officials of the market committee and commission agents on Saturday to fix this at the earliest, he added. Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal said passes were being issued in phases to avoid crowding at the markets. The market committee and administration were also keeping a check on cleanliness and disinfection of markets, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tardy-wheat-procurement-leaves-ludhiana-farmers-jittery/story-Sy2Wa8GG9pbbMHzTYs8oYO.html

17-04-2020||Gurugram||Haryana receives 10,000 rapid antibody testing kits; Gurugram, Palwal and Nuh to benefit||Haryana received 10,000 rapid antibody testing kits from the central government on Friday. The state health department said they were likely to begin testing blood samples of suspected cases in Gurugram from Sunday. State officials said that as per their plans, the kits will be deployed in hotspots as a useful surveillance tool. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “Gurugram, Nuh, Hathin (Palwal) are the affected Covid-19 districts where the kits will be distributed in the first place. We will be testing frontline workers in healthcare, sanitation and police department on priority.”The test will involve collecting blood samples to check whether the body has antibodies to fight the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. If the antibody is present, it means the person was infected and that they have developed immunity. The whole process -- from collection of sample to results -- with the antibody test is expected to take only around 20 minutes. The other test -- Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) -- takes around five to six hours.As of Friday, the state recorded a total of 223 Covid-19 positive cases and two deaths. Gurugram had 32 cases.According to the detailed plan prepared by the doctors in PGIMS, Rohtak, for rapid testing in hotspot areas, those whose report is positive in the antibody test, their nasal/throat swabs will be taken for the RT-PCR for confirmation. Even if the antibody test is negative and the medical officer feels that there is a need to confirm the result, then throat and nasal swabs for the RT-PCR test. Also, suspected cases will be required to be in a quarantine facility for 10 days and then tested. If positive, an RT-PCR would be done.The antibody test will be useful to check if the person had the virus but did not show any symptoms, and thus could pass on the infection to others. “There is a possibility that the patient was only recently infected too [The virus has an incubation period of two to five days during which the person will not show any symptoms]. For them, a quarantine for 10 days will be suggested, thereafter the rapid antibody test will be done again. If positive and symptomatic, the patient will get a PCR test and admitted to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer.On April 4, the Indian Council of Medical Research issued a letter to the states on starting the rapid antibody-based blood test for Covid-19 in clusters with containment zones and large migration gathering or evacuees.Earlier this week, the district health said the rapid test would be conducted in a 3-kilometre radius of the containment zone where a Covid-19 positive case is reported. A team of health workers and doctors would do tests of all occupants in 50 houses, chosen randomly, in each of the four directions of the containment zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-receives-10-000-rapid-antibody-testing-kits-gurugram-palwal-and-nuh-to-benefit/story-zwq36nPNEm2upTULb4CtQO.html
17-04-2020||Gurugram||Use labour welfare funds to help pay salaries: Industry owners write to Haryana govt||In its letter to the state and the Union governments on Friday, the Industrial Development Association of Gurugram(IDAG) reiterated that the government should use labour-related welfare funds to help them pay salaries for the month of April to their employees. The industry body also demanded a financial relief package to help them tide over the crisis brought by the outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Industries are shut, production has been halted, and the industry owners have already paid the salaries for March, including their provident funds, said the association pursuant to the order of the government.Labour-related welfare funds, include employees’ state insurance (ESI), labour welfare fund, building and other construction workers’ welfare cess, etc. Industry owners want government to use these welfare funds for paying the salaries of the employees.Dushyant Chautala, deputy chief minister of Haryana, said the guidelines of labour welfare fund do not allow government to use it for the purpose of salary.“Labour welfare fund cannot be utilised for salary purposes as the Act does not permit it. As far as ESI is concerned it pertains to the Central government. However, Haryana government is issuing a SOP (standard operating procedure) to all deputy commissioners on Saturday regarding the opening of industries in a phase-wise manner, with strict guidelines for social distancing and operating with a labour force of less than 15% of the strength,” Chautala told HT on the phone. The association wrote to governments, both Union and state, through deputy commissioner’s office, Gurugram, on Friday. This their second letter after a gap of a week. Earlier on April 12, the industry had sought from the governments a reply to their relief package demand.“The government must provide the company with generous funding to cover the wages for April and then for the next three months. It is better to pay up and keep people on payrolls of the employers rather than risking economic disruption from the mass layoffs, which appears to be only option for employers in the absence of immediate support of the government,” stated the letter.As per the ESI record, there are 11 lakh employees engaged in the industries in Gurugram.“The government can pay the salaries during lockdown period from the huge funds accumulated and is available under various statutes such as ESI, Labour Welfare Fund and others which were enacted keeping in mind sole objective of welfare and social security of labour. Hence in present situation of crises, payments from these funds should be disbursed to those who are actual beneficiaries (sic),” said the letter.ESI is a medical fund the government uses for health emergency purposes, while labour welfare fund is aimed to provide employee-cum-beneficiaries financial help during marriage, repayment of loans, emergency help in accidental cases, etc.“There are ₹350 crore funds available in the labour welfare fund currently. However, if the government wants to use it for the salary purposes, it will have to revise the policy,” said Amarendra Singh, chairman labour welfare board.However, a senior Haryana government official told HT that the poor people, currently reeling under the Covid-19 lockdown are being fed from this fund only.JN Mangla, industrialist, said, “This is high time, the government gives some relief to the industry to save it from ruination. If this is not done, mass layoffs can take place. The ESI and the labour welfare funds are hardly used by the government. We believe that this is an emergency-like situation, when the funds should be used.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/use-labour-welfare-funds-to-help-pay-salaries-industry-owners-write-to-haryana-govt/story-NtEci6ldYntlhEIMNA5f4L.html

The civic body received a total of 8,151 calls between March 30 and April 16, of which 7,992 calls requested cooked food or groceries. Moreover, 1,178 of these were repeat calls, where the same callers asked for food or groceries, on another day. Based on phone call requests, the BMC provided cooked food packets to 1,15,192 people and groceries to 85,189 people. The BMC has received only 12 calls requesting arrangements for stay and seven calls requesting transportation.The highest number of cooked food packets were provided to the F-North ward, covering areas of Wadala and Matunga (45,524), followed by M-East ward (Govandi and Mankhurd) (16,943), then G-North ward, which has Dharavi (10,561).

They also have a need to save the money they can for now. In some cases, the areas are containment zones, and no one is allowed to go out even to buy essential items.”He said, “The F North ward comprises not just of slum pockets, but is also remote and congested. It has a lot of containment zones. So we receive a lot of calls from this ward asking for food and groceries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-helpline-gets-most-calls-for-groceries/story-r8giu0LjMWxXqg2Ia823tN.html

17-04-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan first state to carry out rapid antibodies test: Govt||Rajasthan started rapid testing of people for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday with the arrival of 10,000 kits from Delhi, and all 52 people who underwent the tests turned out to be free of the virus. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said 50,000 more kits were expected to arrive on Friday night and over next three days. The state government proposes to simultaneously continue tests using the laboratory technique called reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Rajasthan plans to use rapid test for community surveillance and to scale up testing capacity to 10,000 tests per day over the next 10 days.Rapid tests for Covid-19 began in the country on Friday after the arrival of the kits ordered from China by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). China had restricted exports of the kits after quality issues surfaced, but an ICMR official, requesting anonymity, said the kits were found to be of satisfactory quality. The rapid testing kits are being dispatched and distributed among states that have a high burden of the coronavirus disease, said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the Union health ministry.“The kits are being directly given to states and will be deployed or used by them as per their requirement, as long as ICMR guidelines for testing are adequately followed,” said Agarwal.Rapid testing kits are meant for mass testing to detect undiagnosed infections. “Rapid testing works when you have to test a large number of people in a short span of time, as it is quicker and cheaper,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.Apart from getting a share of the central pool, the states have also been given a free hand to procure kits locally depending on their needs.Andhra Pradesh received a consignment of 100,000 rapid test kits manufactured by SD Biosensors based in South Korea, which arrived on a chartered Air India flight on Friday. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, who was the first to get tested using the kit, tuned out to be negative for the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-first-state-to-carry-out-rapid-antibodies-test-govt/story-PcrOLA8c4lS1anbk8P6W5I.html
17-04-2020||Chandigarh||IAF’s Apache combat helicopter makes emergency landing in Hoshiarpur village||An Indian Air Force (IAF) Apache combat helicopter made an emergency landing in the fields of Budhawar village of Hoshiarpur’s Mukerian sub-division on Friday afternoon, reportedly due to a technical glitch. This is the first such instance in eight months since the IAF inducted eight AH-64E Apache stealth helicopters, capable of firing missiles and rockets, in September last year. The AH-64E Apache is one of the world’s most advanced multi-role combat helicopters, and is flown by the US Army. Two pilots on board — Flight Lieutenant Anoop and Flight Lieutenant Rajat — are safe. There was no damage to the helicopter, they said. The choppers are based out of the Pathankot airbase. Sources in IAF said the air force will check the helicopter and then take it back to its base. Yesterday, a Cheetah helicopter of the IAF had made a precautionary landing due to technical snag on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh.

17-04-2020||Gurugram||Staring at bleak demand post lockdown, real estate industry welcomes RBI move to improve liquidity||While a nationwide survey of the real estate industry shows that the lockdown, announced to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), shows that business sentiment is at its lowest, the industry and all stakeholders have welcomed the measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday. The report released by Knight Frank, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry and National Real Estate Development Council, on Thursday showed that as per 60% stakeholders the Covid-19 global crisis will adversely impact residential new launches (65%), will significantly impact sales (65%) and prices (64%) in the next six months. The report stated that the residential sector, which was already experiencing weak demand, will find it difficult to complete the ongoing ones due to construction halts and labour shortage, and launch new projects. Looming uncertainty has adversely impacted the stakeholder sentiments for the coming six months, it said, adding that the lockdown will translate into a vicious sequence of stalled construction, delays in project deliveries, delays in loan repayments and debt servicing to banks and an overall slump in demand due to uncertainties in employment and salary cuts. “All these factors have marred the future sentiment score of stakeholders,” it added.Sentiments of the financial institutions have also become pessimistic. Shishir Baijal, chairman and managing director of Knight Frank India, said, “The pandemic has created an unprecedented condition which is impacting global markets and societies. There is already a severe shortage of liquidity due to the complete standstill that most economies have come to. Managing liquidity and sustaining through the length of this pandemic will be critical for economic survival in the post-pandemic era.”However, the move by the RBI to reduce the reverse Repo rate on Friday has sent some positive signals to the realtors and consultants.Anshuman Magazine, chairman and CEO, CBRE said, “RBI’s recently announced liquidity measures are a clear step towards encouraging liquidity in the banking system. To further ease flow of funds to the housing sector, the National Housing Bank (NHB) has also been provided with a refinance facility of ₹10,000 cr for housing finance companies as additional liquidity for individual housing loans, which is a much-needed boost at this time.”Jones Lang Laselle (JLL), a real estate consultancy major, said the relaxation of NPA classification norms and extension of one year for commencement of projects to real estate developers by NBFCs will provide relief. “The refinance facility to the extent of ₹10,000 crore to NHB is a welcome move to provide the much needed liquidity to housing finance companies,” said Ramesh Nair, CEO and country head, JLL India.Gurugram-based developers also welcomed the move and said that despite the negative sentiment, the RBI move will help. Pradeep Aggarwal, founder and chairman, Signature Developers said, “The RBI has addressed the concerns of realty sector too, which is a clear indication that the government understands the importance of the second largest employer in India. All the economic machinery has to work together to make sure the country comes out of this economic downturn as soon as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/staring-at-bleak-demand-post-lockdown-real-estate-industry-welcomes-rbi-move-to-improve-liquidity/story-zSzjqJaXJVz7o46We8mjnK.html

17-04-2020||Mumbai||After Dharavi, rising Covid cases in slums of Govandi, Deonar a worry||While G-North ward is in the spotlight with the rising number of coronavirus cases in Dharavi, experts are also concerned about the cases in M-East ward, which they say is at a greater risk, as it has the worst health indices in the city.The ward, which includes slum pockets of Deonar, Govandi, Bainganwadi, Shivaji Nagar and Cheetah Camp and the Deonar dumping ground, is spread across an area of 32.50sqkm. The population density here is 36,923 per sqkm, more than the average density of (32,303 per sqkm) of Mumbai, which is the fifth most-densely populated city in the world, according to a United Nations Population Prospects study released in July 2019. The M-East ward on Thursday crossed the 100 mark with 8 new cases, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data. Between April 6 and April 15, the number of cases in M-East went up to 103 from 16, with 25 containment zones.One of the major worrying factors is that M-East is a hotspot for tuberculosis (TB) owing to the poor living conditions. A study conducted by Doctors For You (DFY) for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) found that 8-10% households in the Lallubhai compound and Natwar Parekh compound in Govandi had at least one TB patient. The study found that these slum rehabilitation colonies, with no ventilation, were breeding grounds for the disease.According to the Mumbai Human Development report 2009, United Nations Development Programme, the average life expectancy in the ward is 39. The same report ranks M-East the lowest among the 24 wards in terms of human development index. Another situational analysis by Apnalaya, an NGO working in Shivaji Nagar in M-East, in 2017 found that 44% children are underweight, 57% are stunted and 88% pregnant women are anaemic. Most of the people living in the ward are daily wage workers, who have been hit by the lockdown.Social distancing – one of the key preventive measures recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) – is almost impossible to sustain in the densely populated ward. Dr Peehu Pardeshi, who was a part of the DFY study, said, “Covid-19 can be a major risk factor in the ward as their lung capacity has already been compromised and their immunity is low owing to the conditions they live in. The lack of ventilation, cramped spaces and lack of sanitation pose a huge threat.” Arun Kumar, CEO, Apnalaya, said the situation is more alarming than any other part of the city. “M-East has the highest disenfranchised, unenumerated people in Mumbai. The government records show its population as little over eight lakh, when it has a population of 12 lakh. The testing abysmally low.” Sudhanshu Dwivedi, assistant commissioner of M-east ward, BMC, said, “We have been taking all steps to address the situation. All 25 containment zones are being sanitised daily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-dharavi-rising-covid-cases-in-slums-of-govandi-deonar-a-worry/story-ZlFkeBQKKm55DHKY1VYqcP.html

A fire tender was immediately rushed to the spot. It took an hour to douse the fire,” leading fireman Rajan Sharma said.So far, the reason behind the fire couldn’t be ascertained, however, the locals claim that the car might have caught fire due to the negligence of sweepers who burn dry leaves in the area, a fireman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/car-catches-fire-near-dmch-in-ludhiana/story-ghWCN4bI1HBNzymyUwmxTK.html

Since then, the count has increased by over five times.These volunteers are deployed at around 125 check posts installed in various areas of the city.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Gurdev Singh, who is also the nodal officer of the curfew enforcement team, said to arrest the spread of coronavirus, residents must maintain social distancing, for which the curfew was imposed. “But we required a lot of manpower to enforce the curfew imposed in the city that has a population of 1.69 million people. So we decided to take help from civilians. Today, 2,020 volunteers are helping us in achieving the goal and are also providing door-to-door emergency services,” he said, adding that to monitor these volunteers, 28 police personnel had been appointed at every police station.“As there were a few complaints regarding misbehaviour by volunteers, we have formed a WhatsApp group on which I send videos to give instructions to the volunteers and counsel them,” he said. “If any resident is facing any issue regarding a curfew enforcement officer, they can contact me,” he added.The ACP said it was the duty of the department to take care of these volunteers and other police personnel deployed at various check points. “As summers have begun, it has become tough for volunteers to stand in scorching heat and perform their duties. So, we are providing them with umbrellas and also distributing water campers and cold drinks to them,” Singh said.So far, 50 umbrellas and 500 cartons of soft drinks have been distributed to the volunteers and police personnel, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/enforcement-of-curfew-in-ludhiana-20-more-join-as-volunteers-total-count-now-2-020/story-asNyl68PDY2ADkHb57AHMO.html
17-04-2020||Lucknow||Hemophilia patients facing problems during lock-down||Hemophilia patients in Uttar Pradesh are facing acute problems during the lock-down, due to non-availability of factors, a protein in the blood that controls bleeding.Hemophilia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the blood’s ability to clot. There are around 800 registered hemophilia patients in Lucknow and 3000 across Uttar Pradesh. The patients were restricted even from accessing healthcare facilities under the lock-down, said Vinay Manchanda, secretary, Hemophilia Society, Lucknow.He said there were 26 hemophilia treatment centres in Uttar Pradesh and most of them did not have anti-hemophilia factors for the past two months. Hemophilia patients have low immunity which makes them vulnerable to contracting Sars-Cov-2.Gopal Agrawal, Patient Advocacy, and Patient Services, Takeda India that works in the field of hemophelia treatment said it was an inherited single gene disorder. About one in every 5,000 males was born with the disorder. There are approximately 21,000 registered hemophilia patients in India. This rare disease mostly impacts pediatric males.“The restricted movement is further adding to the woes of the patients and their families. It is our humble appeal to the concerned departments to ensure the availability of factors across the state,” said Manchanda.“Police authorities should help the patients in safely reaching healthcare facilities during this emergency. As ambulance facilities are mainly used to carry Covid-19 patients, private vehicles should also be arranged by the government to ensure intra-state travel for the patients,” said Manchanda.As per the recent guidelines, the centre had advised the state governments to ensure essential services for patients with blood disorders like hemophilia, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/hemophilia-patients-facing-problems-during-lock-down/story-MbU8bgFYIi342tj9FNKwhJ.html
17-04-2020||Mumbai||Defer rent collection if you can: State advice to owners||The state government on Friday issued an advisory to landlords/house-owners to defer their rent collection by three months in view of the current lockdown and avoid evicting tenants over non-payment of rent during this period. The state, however, clarified that the advisory was issued as a majority of the trades were hit, but was not an order which would be binding on landlords.Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary (housing), who issued the advisory, maintained it was just an advisory to citizens and not a law.Housing activists, however, are not impressed. “It will not give any relief to tenants, if any landlord insists on rent or evicts the tenants,” said advocate Vinod Sampat, who deals with property matters. Leo Tharmi Raikhan, who hails from Manipur and represents a group of north-eastern migrants in the city, said, “A majority of firms have not paid our salaries and we are finding it difficult buy groceries. In such a scenario, paying rent is impossible,” said Raikhan.There are around one lakh people in the state from the north-east, a majority of whom live in rented flats and shared apartments in Kalina, Khar, Juhu and Mira Road. Khushi Surendra Prasad, who runs a polyclinic at Colaba, said: “For the past two months, my polyclinic has been shut and there is no income.” However, those who depend on rental incomes said they cannot abide by this advisory. “We depend on rents for survival and being a senior citizen, even I am hassled with various expenses. I can understand the problem of lockdown, but even we are facing issues,” said a 68-year-old senior citizen who has leased out his second home in at Andheri.Meanwhile, former CM Devendra Fadnavis demanded the state should reduce the stamp duty and registration fees to give relief to the realty sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/defer-rent-collection-if-you-can-state-advice-to-owners/story-38HH8J6iTHk9gmCYHn0V6M.html
17-04-2020||Chandigarh||Tokens given, farmers not ready; Punjab changes system||With the state’s decision to issue procurement tokens for farmers through commission agents (arthiyas) based on last season’s trends not yielding desired result, authorities will implement a new system that will be based on demand from farmers. Under the previous system, most farmers who got tokens were not ready with the harvest, so they were unable to come to mandis. Conversely, farmers who were done with the harvest were made to wait. The procurement, under strict regulation due to covid-19 pandemic, started on April 15. “Instead of issuing tokens on the basis of the crop arrival trend of the last season, we will now follow a demand-based system. Farmers would get tokens after they tell their commission agents that their crop is harvested and moisture in the grain is within permissible limit of 12%,” said state’s food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. He added that the mandi board would take demand from farmers whose crop is ready, through mandi secretaries. Token would again be issued through the arhtiyas. The changes were introduced after Ashu met farmers and arhtiyas in Khanna mandi on Thursday. He found some dissatisfied farmers and some commission agents alleging bias. “Arhtiyas who have connections in the government are managing token for their farmers,” alleged Raghbir Singh of Khant village near Khamano in Ludhiana.“Arhtiyas would meet every morning and share demand. Tokens will be issued on this basis,” Vijay Kalra, president, Commission Agents’ Association told HT, adding, however, that to ensure speedy procurement, trends of previous years would need to be taken into consideration. This is the first time procurement is happening through a token system since the 1960s and is to be wound up in 45 days this year against the usual 21. “We are bringing in a new system, but want to clarify that without a valid token no farmer would be entertained. If any farmer is found without a token in any mandi, his arhtiya would face cancellation of licence,” said a senior officer of the food department. The daily lifting has already been capped at 3 lakh tonne.MANDIS IN FEROZEPUR,  LUDHIANA VILLAGES SHUTGrain mandis of Payal village in Ludhiana and Wara Bhai Ke village in Ferozepur were sealed after positive cases were reported. Arhtiyas have been asked to shift to other mandis. MANDI BOARD ISSUES  2.85 LAKH CURFEW PASSES The mandi board has issued 2.85 lakh curfew passes to farmers through arthiyas. Additional chief secretary (development) Viswajeet Khanna said said the passes were being issued to farmers through arthiyas and there was no condition or restriction to get these through any mobile app.SYSTEM HAS FLOPPED, TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION: SUKHBIR TO CMShiromani Akali Dal (SAD) President Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday said the e-token system had failed in Punjab and urged CM Captain Amarinder Singh to take corrective steps. “It seems most plans have been made on paper only as there is a big mismatch between the announcements of the government and ground situation,” he claimed. He also requested the CM to intervene and resolve all pending issues of commission agents who were demanding payment of Rs 200 crore in dues and insurance cover for labourers, besides other issues.Light rain predicted in regionLight to moderate showers are likely in Punjab and Haryana till Sunday, the weather department has predicted. It added western disturbances are active in the region. “Rain up to 20 mm can be expected at a few stations (between 25% to 50% stations) in Haryana and Punjab on Saturday and in isolated stations on Sunday and Monday. Gusty winds up to 40km per hour are also likely, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tokens-given-farmers-not-ready-punjab-changes-system/story-0mQmsGMdqIeidvBH6obUEN.html

The defence lawyers however, on Friday, did not press for bail for Sarang and only argued for Wadhawan’s bail plea.Based on a report presented by the chief medical officer of the jail before the court, the defence pointed out that Wadhawan has been put in the category of high-risk patient for cardiac, pulmonary and infectious diseases. The defence also had pointed out that Wadhawan had to be admitted to JJ Hospital in February after a medical emergency.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Sunil Gonsalves, representing the enforcement directorate (ED) opposed the plea on the grounds that medical facilities are available in prison and that Wadhawan had been given proper treatment at the hospital before he was discharged.After hearing both the sides, the court observed that the defence had failed to point out any urgency to release Wadhawan on bail. The court also held that the defence’s bail plea on merits is also pending for hearing. Hence, the court rejected the plea observing that there is nothing on record to show that the accused are unsafe in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-fraud-case-special-court-refuses-bail-to-hdil-promoter-rakesh-wadhawan/story-X8jPpuTNIhb3m4HJURt16O.html

While the accused told police that he did not spit on the woman deliberately, Kabai said, “It was not by accident, he purposefully spat on me. I was standing on the side of the road and if he wanted to spit normally why did he come close to me.”After Linda Newmai, a social activist from Delhi tweeted about the incident, the office of Mumbai Police commissioner directed the local police station to register a first information report (FIR) against Elias. A case was then registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act.Kailas Avhad, senior inspector of Vakola police station, said, “We had formed different teams and one of them was checking for CCTV footages in the area. On Thursday night we identified the accused and called him for an inquiry. We have now arrested him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kurla-resident-arrested-for-spitting-on-northeast-woman-in-kalina/story-UiKEoxVstkj6g28k8aYM0L.html

17-04-2020||Mumbai||Pre-monsoon road work to start, workers to be regularly screened for Covid-19 symptoms||With monsoon less than a month and a half away, it has now been decided that all desilting and monsoon road works will start wherever possible, other than in containment zones.This was decided in a review meeting held by the civic commissioner on Friday, along with Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray.In a series of tweets, Thackeray, on Friday, said, “This afternoon, I took a zoom video meeting of BMC officers, along with Municipal Commissioner Pravin Pardeshi for the preparations of the onset of the monsoon and to complete the essential pre-monsoon works in time, along with our fight against Covid. As guardian minister, Mumbai Suburbs, I’ve been in constant touch with the officers. Today once again in the zoom video call, I briefed them on my conversations with the MLAs, Corporators and citizens, their suggestions and pain points as well.”Thackeray added, “In times as the fight with Covid, the world is on pause, but not our monsoons and the onset would mean we have to complete our essential works before the monsoons arrive. I’m thankful to all the officers for their hard work and outreach, managing the situation and works together.”The BMC has also decided to not start digging or repair of any new roads, but only focus on completing the ongoing road repair works before the onset of monsoon. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), monsoon is expected to arrive in the city by June 11 and is likely to stay on till October 08. Given this schedule, BMC has little time to complete its monsoon preparedness work.Sanjay Darade, deputy municipal commissioner, BMC (infrastructure) said, “We are starting work wherever it necessary to finish work before monsoons. At places where we can delay works due to the current scenario where there is a shortage of labour, we will start work post-May 03. Also, we are going to monitor the health condition of those working on our pre-monsoon work site.”Currently, post the lockdown announced last month, repair and maintenance work on 336 major and minor roads along with that of ambitious Coastal Road work was hit. However, work has started here with bare minimum work-force at the Coastal Road site. At many sites work may not start until the lockdown period ends on May 3 given the labour shortage.Manish Valanju, Assistant Municipal Commissioner, BMC’s L-ward in Kurla where Mithi River is located said, “Desilting work for Mithi River has started, however, there were problems at ward levels for minor desilting works. For this, we have worked out a solution to extend contracts of the contractors who were involved last year for similar work to be doing the same to ensure minor nullahs are desilted before the onset of monsoons.”Meanwhile, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which has city’s two arterial roads - the Eastern Express Highway (EEH) and Western Express Highway (WEH) - under its jurisdiction, has started desilting works along the 25-km WEH on Friday. It is also in the process of starting works at EEH soon. “The stormwater drains that need to be realigned or fixed at various metro sites in Mumbai will also be done soon,” a senior official from MMRDA said.(With inputs from Tanushree Venkatraman)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pre-monsoon-road-work-to-start-workers-to-be-regularly-screened-for-covid-19-symptoms/story-uLCJOqrgT16c1K1IWspcBO.html

17-04-2020||City||Rain adds to woes of farmers||The untimely drizzle witnessed in parts of Majha since the wee hours of Friday has delayed harvesting and procurement of wheat, adding to worries of farmers. With harvesting already delayed due to prevalence of moisture in the grain, mandis are yet to see normal arrival. Punjab Mandi Board officials said regular arrival was expected after April 20.“The rainfall is mild and will not have a major impact on the crop. However, it would increase moisture. If rain stops in a day or two, it would not cause much damage, but harvesting will be delayed,” said Harinderjit Singh, Amritsar chief agriculture office.Similar weather in Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot — have resulted in a lowering the temperature. At this stage, wheat needs high temperature and dry climate.“Rain is delaying the process. The sky is cloudy, which is a major cause of worry,” said Tejinderpal Singh, a farmer of Rasoolpur village of Tarn Taran. Farmers protest in GurdaspurFarmers protested against wheat procurement norms put in place in the district. Kirti Kisan Union’s state general secretary Satbir Singh claimed under the current system, farmers were required to take his crop for procurement a number of times, which was a waste of effort.Drizzle interrupts harvesting in NabhaHarvesting was interrupted at Kot Kalan, Sadhoheri and Binaheri village in Nabha due to drizzle that lasted an hour. Department of food and civil supplies joint director, Ajayveer Singh Sarao, inspected arrangements at the Nabha grain market. — With inputs from Kamaljit Singh Kamal and Mohit Singla Overcast conditions will impede procurement: PAU Mohit KhannaMohit.khanna@htlive.comAdvising state’s farmers to avoid rushing to the grain market amid overcast conditions and rain, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has said farmers were better-off in ensuring that the crop stayed dry, by staying home. Admitting that overcast weather will impede procurement, the varsity’s extension education department has said farmers must be patient. “These are tough times. Covid -19 has hit all sectors. Due to paucity of labour, harvesting is getting delayed. There would be instances of rejection of crop due to over-ripening. Farmers are advised to show restraint and cooperate with procurement agencies,” said director, extension education, JS Mahal. New DSR technique could be handyThe varsity has also developed a new Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) technique. PAU senior agronomist MS Bhullar said the technique was developed after three years of research and was successfully tested in fields last year. In this, the field is first laser-leveled followed by pre-sowing (rauni) irrigation and its preparation when it reaches tar-wattar (good soil moisture) condition. Rice is sown immediately with a tractor-operated Lucky Seed Drill that simultaneously sprays herbicide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rain-adds-to-woes-of-farmers/story-gGpeXq8B4FA4wT7S17QrhI.html

In this epidemic situation we are unable to come to the hostels to collect our belongings,” said a law student hailing from Haryana.In a letter written by some students to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, it is stated, “Thousands of students residing in the university hostels are from other states. Many students have left their important documents in hostels and there are chances of these documents getting misplaced and if this happens, who will be responsible?”In a tweet to the CM and the Punjab DGP, a girl student said, “Students are asked to take away their belongings by Sunday else it (sic) will be sealed by hostel authorities themselves. It is clear violation of privacy. Help us please”.Another student said, “There would be risk to the health of students if Covid-19 patients are isolated in the hostels and any virus remains there despite sanitisation”. Notably, some research scholars are still staying in their hostels. They have been asked to vacate the hostel immediately, which is not possible for them amid the lockdown.Dhillon said, “We have asked the GNDU to constitute a committee to supervise the removal of students’ belongings from the rooms with proper videography in case they are not able to come. These can be placed in a big hall.”“Many students have taken away their belongings. We have constituted a committee under the supervision of dean (students welfare) to shift the belongings from the hostels to a place where these will be secured.The students who are unable to come need not worry,” said Karanjit Singh Kahlon, GNDU registrar.He added, “We have not asked research scholars to vacate the hostel rooms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/asked-to-take-their-belongings-away-from-hostel-rooms-by-tomorrow-students-write-to-punjab-cm/story-pLGzru0Nc1Bag2mdtFFB9I.html

This is a good initiative and an imitable work,” the DC said, adding that he has sent the money to the PM-CARES fund.Talking about his daughters, Mishra said, “The girls had some money... whatever they have got from us and my parents. When they saw the prime minister’s appeal on TV to donate money during this crisis, they brought out their savings and evinced the desire to give it to the PM uncle.” Trainee IAS officer Manish Kumar, who was present when the girls handed over the money to the DC, said, “It is a proud moment for all of us and their initiative is inspirational.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/give-our-pocket-money-to-pm-uncle-2-minor-kids-donate-2k-to-pm-cares/story-Qj9rVSn2G6TjJv4qBwq2cN.html
17-04-2020||City||‘Zoom app unsafe’: Ludhiana education dept, schools switch to WhatsApp||After the ministry of home affairs (MHA) asked government officials not to use Zoom video meet app for holding meetings citing it unsafe, the district education officer, secondary, has also switched to WhatsApp conference calling. According to the ministry, the software of the US-based app is said to be made in China and is prone to hacking as some calls are routed through the eastern Asian country. For the past three weeks amid the lockdown, the officials have been holding meetings with school heads and teachers through Zoom app. After the MHA’s direction, even the schools have stopped holding online classes through the app and are sending the assignments and recorded videos to the students through WhatsApp.However, many teachers are of the view that WhatsApp is not as useful as Zoom. Zoom conference allowed them to hold online classes for a batch of 30 to 40 students for two to three hours, however, it is not possible with WhatsApp, which allows maximum of four people to go live at one point of time, they rued. Ishita Sharma, a private school teacher, said, “I teach Class 8 and 9 students. I used to take three-hour session with the students through Zoom app and was even able to clear their doubts. It allowed us to cover the syllabus conveniently. Now that we have switched to WhatsApp, we are recording the lectures and replying to the queries of students through the messaging app. This is time-consuming and not very useful. There is a need to come up with a new software or app, which is totally safe to use.”District education officer (DEO), secondary, Swaranjit Kaur, said, “To interact with school principals, I have been holding meetings with them through Zoom app since March 23. I have now switched to WhatsApp conference call after the ministry’s guideline.”Principal of Green Land Senior Secondary School, Jalandhar Bypass, Baldeep Pandher, said, “A few teachers were using Zoom app for holding online classes, but not so actively. Majority of them were already using similar Microsoft software. Now that the hacking concern has come to the fore, we will discontinue the use of this software for online classes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/zoom-app-unsafe-ludhiana-education-dept-schools-switch-to-whatsapp/story-Yifv6ONTgfUYcsGsUaPAlL.html

He also issued strict directives for protection of all employees on the frontline of Covid-19 duty, including health, agriculture, police and revenue department staff, in the light of the death of a kanungo.Additional chief secretary (ACS) Vini Mahajan, who heads the procurement committee for Covid-19 related purchases, said that out of the 4.5 lakh personal protective equipment (PPE) kits ordered by the state, 26,500 have been received and 3,0000 more are expected to come by next week. There is sufficient stock of masks, gloves etc, she added.The CM said there could be no compromise on the lives of the people and the government’s priority continues to be on saving and protecting the citizens of Punjab. “I can get a factory started again but cannot bring a Punjabi back to life,” he said.Amarinder directed the health department to launch rapid testing in all the 24 containment zones of the state. Four Punjab districts (Jalandhar, Pathankot, SBS Nagar and Mohali) have been declared hotspot districts by the Union health ministry.10,000 RAPID TESTING KITS RECEIVED FROM ICMRVini Mahajan said the state on Friday received 10,000 rapid diagnostic kits (RDKs) from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The 10,000 kits ordered from private vendors are expected to start arriving from Saturday.Of the 527 rapid tests conducted with the 1,000 kits received earlier from ICMR, 7 were found negative, she said, adding that all these tests were conducted in Jalandhar and Mohali.Regarding the high mortality rate in the state, former PGIMER director KK Talwar said it was on account of higher prevalence of comorbidities/high risk factors in the state, as well as the higher footfall of international tourists/NRIs, among other factors.Principal secretary (health) Anurag Aggarwal said the department was putting all 24 containment zones in the state on the COVA app. The number of ventilators in government medical colleges is being ramped from 102 to 220, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/challan-those-moving-around-without-masks-capt-to-police/story-g0KdYKjAVSQo7d3oKEUodM.html

The directive came from the high court bench of justice Gurvinder Singh Gill in response to a bail petition of three Nabha jail inmates who are accused of having caused loss to state exchequer to the tune of Rs 20 crore by evasion of payment of goods and services tax. A complaint against them was lodged in November 2019 in Fatehgarh Sahib.The bail was primarily sought on account of the prevalant conditions of spread of Covid-19 virus. It was also argued that the apex court on March 23 had asked all states to take steps to decongest jails so as to prevent spread of Covid-19.The high court dismissed their plea observing that the move certainly cannot be treated as a windfall for all the prisoners even when there is no imminent threat or apprehension of spread of pandemic within the jail premises.The court further observed that after imposition of lockdown, everything has come to a grinding halt and even the inflow offresh inmates would have been drastically reduced. “Since it is more than 3 weeks after the lockdown was imposed, the number of fresh entrants in the jail would be minimal,” the court said, further taking note of the submissions from the state’s counsel that there is no congestion in Nabha Jail and that the number of inmates is less than the capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-asks-nabha-jail-authorities-to-examine-new-inmates-for-covid-19/story-4Sh25WP6fG3gNpUDpqasfK.html

Following the death of the adjacent Vaishali district’s man here in AIIMS, Patna, the adjoining district administration said the deceased had no travel history and feared that his testing positive could be indicative of community transmission of the virus. The death marks the second COVID-19 casualty in Bihar. A 38-year-old from Munger had died on March 21, a day before his test reports confirmed him to be coronavirus-infected. The Vaishali man, who died in AIIMS here, was also suffering from numerous complications besides having tested positive for COVID 19, Patna AIIMS Director Prabhat Kumar Singh told PTI-Bhasha. According to sources in the health department, the deceased belonged to Raghopur panchayat falling under Vaishali district and suffered from tuberculosis, typhoid, brain fever and several other illnesses. Before being referred to AIIMS, Patna he was admitted to a private hospital here, which has been sealed, and its occupants quarantined, after he tested positive two days ago. Vaishali District Magistrate Udita Singh said, the deceased had no travel history. After falling ill, he had visited Samastipur and, later, Patna for treatment. Given the circumstances, his testing positive raises the probability of community transmission. Accordingly, instructions have been issued to strictly enforce lockdown in the district. The area within a radius of three kilometers from the village of the deceased has been made a containment zone wherein entry and egress has been banned and all essential supplies were being made by the administration, which was also carrying out sanitization of the zone, she added. More than 60 samples, of people who may have come in contact with the deceased, have been sent for testing. None has reported positive so far, she said. The deceased happened to be the lone case reported from Vaishali district, which is among the 13 out of 38 in Bihar where people have tested COVID-19 positive. Siwan and Munger districts have reported maximum cases of infection. At least 83 people have tested positive for the dreaded coronavirus in the state so far. Of these, 37 have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-fears-community-transmission-after-two-deaths-in-24-hours/story-GMMj5RyQD8N82eNCPEu7nM.html

17-04-2020||City||Covid-19 puts desilting of drains, sewer lines on hold||New Delhi: A severe shortage of labourers owing to the Covid-19 outbreak in the city has put essential maintenance and repair works — such as desilting of drains and sewer lines — in the city on hold. Work on desilting of drains and sewer lines — an important part of the monsoon preparedness plan of the government and the civic bodies — usually begins by March end and is completed by the first week of June. Major drains across the city are cleaned by the Public Works Department (PWD), while drains laid alongside internal roads and lanes are cleared by the municipalities. Officials of the PWD and civic bodies confirmed that desilting process of drains across the city is yet to start because of lack of adequate workforce.All the agencies have to finish desilting of drains by the first week of June before the monsoon sets in the city.A senior PWD official said that the lack of availability of labourers have delayed the process, which should have begun by the end of last month.“Normally the desilting process of big drains take around 2.5 months. We keep two deadlines for the process, May 31 and June 15, to ensure that drains are cleaned before monsoon hits the city. But this year the process is yet to begin due to restrictions amid the pandemic that is raging in the city and the resultant scarcity of workforce,” the official said.According to PWD officials, the department manages around 1,700km length of drains along 1,260km of road across 17 divisions in the city. The officials said that around 1,200-1,500 labourers are engaged every year in the desilting process. This year, the workforce has drastically gone down.“Our estimates say that the workforce has gone down by over 50%. Contractors are unable to bring labourers as they have gone to their hometowns due to the pandemic. Many of those who had gone to their villages in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to celebrate Holi have refused to return. Hence, getting labourers for the desilting process is a tough task. We are hoping that things will become normal after May 3,” the PWD official said.He added that after April 20, the department will ask details from contractors about the available workforce and start issuing curfew passes to start the desilting work.A similar problem of scarcity of labourers is being faced by the civic bodies too. They also have departmental staff for desilting purposes who at present are involved in Covid-19 control measures. The municipalities, however, said they might start desilting process from next week.South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) mayor Sunita Kangra said all her staff is engaged in Covid-19 related duties but still the corporation would float tenders for desilting process next week.“Labourers are not available in the city and our departmental staff ,such as sanitation and DBC workers, are busy in spraying disinfectants along with collection and transportation of garbage from containment areas. Even the machines — such as jetting machine, lifters, tippers — are engaged in Covid-19 related work. So desilting process couldn’t be started. We will float a tender next week and try to complete the process before June,” she said.Avtar Singh, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that small drains are being cleaned but that is not enough. “I will convene a meeting with the municipal officials and the sanitation employees later this week to discuss the issue. Hopefully we will start desilting process properly from next week,” Singh said.A senior official of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation said, “We are not only short on workforce but are also cash strapped. We are working with limited staff as sanitation employees above 55 years age are on leave due to safety reasons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-puts-desilting-of-drains-sewer-lines-on-hold/story-QLF746rY0EjZJBevRICAmM.html
17-04-2020||City||PAU suggests direct seeding of rice to address labour pangs||Amid the labour shortage due to coronavirus outbreak, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has suggested a new direct seeding of rice (DSR) technique to address the issue during rice transplantation season.PAU senior agronomist MS Bhullar informed that the technique was successfully tested on large fields last year.In DSR, the field is first laser levelled, followed by pre-sowing (rauni) irrigation and preparation of the field when it reaches tar-water (good soil moisture) condition. Rice is then sown with a tractor operated lucky seed drill (LSD), which also sprays herbicide at the same time. “In case the machine is not available, paddy could be sown with the help of rice seed drill having inclined plate metering mechanism and herbicide could be sprayed immediately,” said Bhullar.For herbicide spray, he suggested to dissolve one litre stomp/bunker 30 EC (pendimethalin) in 200 litre of water for one acre area. Use 8 to 10kg seed for one acre and imbibe rice seed in water for 8 hours and then dry in the shade, he said. “Before sowing, treat rice seed with 3g sprint 75 WS (mencozeb + carbendazim) by dissolving in 10-12 ml water per kg seed, make paste of fungicide solution and rub on the seed. Apply first irrigation at 21 days after sowing and schedule succeeding irrigations as per monsoon rains,” the agronomist said.As weather is sweltering during June and evaporation is also high, the delayed first irrigation under this technique saves lot of water. Besides, it also reduces weed problem and helps roots of rice penetrate deeper, reducing incidence of nutrient deficiency, especially iron. Furthermore, with the new DSR technique, rice can be directly seeded into medium to heavy textured soils (sandy loam, loam, clay loam, silt loam), which accounts for 87% area of the state.Also, the profit generated from rice sown with the new technique is at par with the rice transplanted in a puddle field. Asking farmers to prefer short duration rice varieties for direct seeding, Bhullar urged them to adopt this technique and bring rice area under direct seeding during first fortnight of June, before beginning rice transplantation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pau-suggests-direct-seeding-of-rice-to-address-labour-pangs/story-idWVOmo2ounWgpmGOHpzWN.html
17-04-2020||City||Mohali residents face difficulty disposing daily garbage amid lockdown||Despite the best efforts of the municipal corporation (MC) officials, residents of various sectors and housing societies here have complained that they are facing difficulty in daily garbage disposal amid lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.“We are trying our best to clear the areas of waste, but the only issue is the shortage of manpower as workers are scared of the deadly virus,” said the officials.The president of ATS society in Kharar, Rajan Kapoor, said, “Since the announcement of the curfew, the residents have been facing an issue of waste disposal. We are now using a nearby dumping site to throw garbage generated by our society.”Adding to this, another resident of the same society, Atul Gupta, said, “The garbage dump has started smelling bad and has also become a breeding ground for mosquitoes.”A resident of Sector 69 here, Shiv Dutta, said that no garbage collector had visited the sector in the past two weeks. “Residents of the area have to dispose of daily waste at the nearby Safai Sehaj Kendras,” he said.What MC says?Mohali MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, the work of garbage collection is outsourced and the department had already directed the persons concerned to collect the garbage daily. He said the problem is arising as the garbage collectors are themselves scared of coronavirus.A similar problem is being faced by people living in the Maya Garden Colony at Zirakpur where the garbage collectors visit the area only once or twice a week. On the days when the waste is not lifted by the collectors, it becomes difficult to manage the heaps as stray dogs come and scatter the waste and litter the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-residents-face-difficulty-disposing-daily-garbage-amid-lockdown/story-9zbI2FjdLIQHYFUHsapsdJ.html
17-04-2020||Delhi||Log in to a new literary life in times of corona||New Delhi:Recently, when his publisher requested Vinod Kumar Shukla, 83, one of the veterans of Hindi literature, whose several novels have been translated into English, to do a Facebook live session, the reclusive writer agreed, though apprehensively. “I like to convey my ideas through my books, not by speaking on social media. In fact, I do not even have a Facebook page,” says the Sahitya Akademi Award-winning writer.The Raipur-based writer finally went live with the help of his son on the social media page of his Delhi-based publisher, talking about his journey as a writer, how he spends his time during the lockdown, and ending the live session by reading from one of his poetry books. Shukla now feels that technology can really help writers like him, who find it difficult to travel, have meaningful conversations with their readers. “ I generally do not attend literary events and have not travelled for many years, but it was great to have been able to speak to my readers. I do not mind another live Facebook session.”Shukla is one of over 60 writers, including Mridula Garg, Mrinal Pande, Javed Akhtar , among others, who, in the past three weeks have attended StayAtHomeWithRajkamal—a series of Facebook live sessions organized by Rajkamal Prakashan , one of the country’s biggest Hindi publishers. With all modes of public transport suspended and gatherings barred to stave off the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Delhi’s literary life has moved online. These days one can come across literary festivals, book readings, conversations with authors, creative writing workshops and even occasional book launches happening online on Instagram and Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Zoom.The Jaipur Literary Festival ( JLF) -- one of the most popular and high-profile events in India’s literary calendar -- recently rolled out what it calls ‘Brave New World,’ a series of online conversations, where writers from across the globe speak on their books, globalisation, the pandemics, celebrity, sexism, and power, and a host of other issues.The authors featuring in the series, which goes live on JLF’s social media platforms on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday-- include top-notch names such as Siddhartha Mukherjee , Tina Brown, Peter Carey, Pico Iyer, Jhumpa Lahiri, among others. These online conversations are garnering thousands of views.“JLF is a platform for ideas and conversations. During the coronavirus pandemic, when the borders are closed and the idea of de-globalisation is gaining ground, it is important that the ideas and knowledge continue to be shared across borders,” says Sanjoy Roy, MD, Teamwork Arts, which produces Jaipur Literature Festival, and is also organising the series.How difficult was it to get such a stellar line-up of writers online? “In fact, it is often more difficult to get writers to Jaipur Literary Festival. All of them readily agreed to be part of these live sessions, because it allowed them to engage with their readers from the comfort of their homes in different parts of the world, ” says Roy. “Online literary events can draw much larger audiences than is possible in an off-line event.”Satyanand Nirupam, editorial director, Rajkamal Prakashan, says their online literary conversations have presented a good opportunity to several writers who do not get invited to conventional literary festivals. “Generally, you get to see almost the same set of writers at all the lit fests getting invited year after year. Online events are changing that; we have already done live sessions with several writers who never before spoke at a literary event,” says Nirupam.“Not all the writers, especially the older ones we requested to do live session with, are tech savvy and we had to involve their younger relatives. But even those who had never heard of Facebook live are now getting tech-savvy, and it will help them communicate with their readers more often,” adds Nirupam. “People want to hear and see more and more writers during the lockdown. Considering the excitement and the people’s response, we can carry on our live events for a year. But we will surely continue it till the lockdown is over. ”Many publishers are also running online literary festivals –Penguin , for example, is runningOnceUponABookWithPenguin ; Harper Collins India is organising ‘Reset’, live conversations with authors; and Juggernaut has launched ReadInstead LitFest, an online literary festival featuring conversations, workshops, masterclasses, writers’ bookshelves, among others. The schedule for most of these events is published online a week in advance. Both JLF’s ‘Brave New World’ and ‘ReadInstead’ have also sessions on coronavirus crisis. On Saturday, JLF’s event---“ Corona Chronicles: The past, present and future of pandemics”--- saw Siddhartha Mukherjee and Peter Frankopan in a live conversation.ReadInstead features a creative writing workshop by Amitabha Bagchi , the winner of the DSC Prize for South Asian Literature 2019 for his novel ‘Half the Night is Gone’.“I was quite surprised to find that a fairly technical workshop about the fine points of literary prose received so many views and got such good feedback,” says Bagchi. “Under the lockdown, the possibilities for digital interaction have been opened up for the literary culture, and these possibilities will remain and hopefully even flourish later. This is extremely important, especially for literary fiction writers such as myself whose audience is dispersed widely.”Talking of ReadInstead initiative, Chikki Sarkar, publisher, Juggernaut Books, says, “Getting people reading is at the heart of what we do and we also believe there is nothing like reading to focus your mind, and for you to learn and grow from. The idea behind ReadInstead was to remind people and get them excited to read and think about books and writers,” says Sarkar. “For us there has been one major learning. We have underused video as a tool to communicate with our readers. From now, you’ll see a permanent lit fest across juggernaut social.”In fact, not just lit-fests, a few online book launches were also organised online during the lockdown. For example, Polis Project, a New York-based non-profit, planned an online release of the book ‘His Father’s Disease’, a collection of short stories by Aruni Kashyap, a well-known, award-winning writer from Assam, who writes both in English and Assamese. The event, streamed live on Twitter, saw the writer in conversation with Suchitra Vijayan , founder, the Polis Project.“This event was originally scheduled in New York City, but because of the current crisis, we decided to have it online. Of course, I would have loved to travel to the city and meet my host personally, but this is the best alternative that we have. This was a new experience for me and I think even when we return to normal times, we should have more such conversations and book-talks online (not book launches, though) to hear from writers who don’t have the privilege to travel,” says Kashyap.And what does the spurt in online literary activities during the coronavirus lockdown mean for literature? “Not just online, people have returned to the book format. I spent the first few days of lockdown watching movies and television series, but after a while, it got extremely exhausting and boring and I returned to what I love best: reading. This is true even for people who don’t read regularly and I believe the lockdown has made us realise what we value most: books, company, family, friends, loved ones,” says Kashyap. “This is good news for literature. It reminds us that the book will never die. As long as the human curiosity of “what happens next” exists, literature will thrive”.Bagchi though has a different take. “My heart hopes that the people who have picked up books at this time when the movie theatres and restaurants and nightclubs are shut will stay with books after they reopen. But my mind says that most of them will probably not. Nonetheless, if they carry with them the memory of some books they read in this time, that’s not a bad thing either,” says Bagchi. “Today, even apart from the pandemic, our nation is at a critical juncture and we need people who have had the experience of reading and reflecting. So if this lockdown helps more people learn the pleasures and benefits of reading, it will have served an important, if unintended, purpose.”Aditya Sharma, a Delhi-based author, feels that the ongoing online events will help make literature more accessible to common people who otherwise do not attend literary events. “ People are searching for their favourite books and authors online like never before. Eventually, the growing online literary activities under the lockdown would help boost books culture in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/log-in-to-a-new-literary-life-in-times-of-corona/story-BtlBpumYMnhLEMENjUxvSP.html

17-04-2020||Lucknow||Alert citizens make a point in corona battle||Their concern for the nation’s welfare overrides their personal interests and inhibitions. Bucking the trend of those hiding travel history details amid the Covid-19 outbreak, a few alert citizens have stepped forward to volunteer for medical examination and go for quarantine so that others don’t get infected. Police have announced they will honour such people with the Alert Citizen award.Take the case of Mohd Hamid, a preacher from Deoria who says he left his home district in November and visited several places for work ever since. “I went to Delhi from Hardoi on March 18 and then came to Lucknow on March 21. I visited a religious congregation at the Aminabad mosque (in the state capital) before calling my son, who lives here,” he recalls. The Janta Curfew was observed on March 22. The next day, some mosques were sealed as some infected persons were found in Delhi and some other places, he says.“I called a policeman and informed him about my travel to Delhi and then the Lucknow mosque. He got me medically examined and put in a quarantine centre after I tested negative. Since I had met my son and daughter-in-law, they are also in quarantine. I urge other people to come out on their own. This is the only remedy to save ourselves as well as others,” he says.Then, there is Gomtinagar’s Yash, who was studying in London and arrived in India on March 18 amid the Covid-19 outbreak.“I was aware of what’s happening around. When I reached home here, I felt some symptoms like cough and cold. The next day, I went to hospital and apprised them about my travel history,” he says.He was medically examined. Although he tested negative, he was put in quarantine as a precautionary measure. “I was in hospital and came back home on April 6,” he says. “I think this is the right thing to do instead of waiting for the infection to be severe or for others to get infected,” he adds.Joint commissioner of police (JCP), Law and Order, Naveen Arora has advised members of the Tablighi Jamaat and those who have come in contact with them to come forward for medical examination. “Tablighi Jamaat member or those who have come in contact with them should go for quarantine and call 0522-2780880, 8005192677,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/alert-citizens-make-a-point-in-corona-battle/story-AxqiQyZHhhzDjWlGj7h8SN.html

17-04-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana miffed over PGIMER’s refusal to admit critical patient from P’kula||The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)’s refusal to admit a critical coronavirus patient from Panchkula two days ago has reportedly not gone down well with the Haryana health authorities.On Wednesday, a 44-year-old woman from Sector 15 in Panchkula had developed respiratory distress, forcing the district’s chief medical officer (CMO), Jasjeet Kaur, to approach the PGIMER for immediately shifting her to the premier institute in Chandigarh.The CMO said the PGIMER doctors declined the request, stating that there were clear cut directions from the UT authorities to only admit positive cases from Chandigarh.“This put us in a tight spot. We immediately tied up with a local private hospital. They were hesitant at first, but finally admitted her after some pressure,” she said, adding that the patient is stable now.“I have already conveyed my objection in the video conference chaired by the UT administrator on Thursday. I have also communicated the same to higher officials in the Haryana government. I have been told that the officials are writing to PGIMER authorities on this episode,” she said. Sources said that the Haryana chief secretary also intervened and took up the matter with the PGIMER.BOUND BY DIRECTIONS: PGIMeanwhile, Dr GD Puri, dean (academics), who spoke on PGIMER’s behalf on the issue, told HT that they are bound by the Epidemic Act as evoked by the UT administrator banning the movement of inter-state migration of positive cases. He further said, “People think PGIMER is a tertiary care unit. But it is understandable only if we have a certain facility and others don’t.”“In case of the Panchkula patient, the government hospital there has as many as six ventilators. They have even designated a private hospital for Covid treatment. Despite all this, insisting for admitting a patient who just needed to be put on oxygen does not fall under the protocol,” he said.On why Panchkula was still trying to shift the patient to PGIMER, Dr Puri said, “I don’t know but if bigwigs call repeatedly, the patient must be related to someone. We had an ‘out of the way’ request from Punjab too but the administrator has already made a protocol on the basis of some long-term planning. Today we have 20 cases, it may be 50 or 100 in future.”‘WERE NOT READY FOR CRITICAL CARE’However, later Panchkula CMO Jasjeet Kaur clarified that the ventilator facility in their hospital was recently installed but their covid treatment protocol for critical patients was not adequate as yet.She added that the state had also roped in Paras hospital where the protocol for treatment facilities was not complete, which is why they had approached the PGIMER.“We will be ready to deal with serious patients shortly. But my request to PGIMER is that if there is a similar situation where they need their help as a tertiary care institute, they should accommodate,” said Kaur, adding that they will never bother the institute with mild or moderate cases which they are already treating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-miffed-over-pgimer-s-refusal-to-admit-critical-patient-from-p-kula/story-TYwA8NEoIETjLD1Txni66J.html

17-04-2020||Lucknow||Artists face tough time in lockdown, many struggling to survive||Artists are caught in the throes of multiple woes following Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown.As exhibitions, cultural events and even religious functions have been put on hold after the lockdown, artists, dependent on their art for survival, are facing acute hardships these days.“All painting exhibitions have been postponed or cancelled across the country. As a result, sale of paintings through such events has also come to a naught. With art buyers out of the scene, freelance painters like me have been hit hard,” shared Poonam Kishor, a resident of Rambagh locality of Sangam city.She said that many painters reside in metros as they find more scope to succeed there. “Many such young artists as well as MFA students known to me also take painting classes to supplement their earning and pay the monthly house rent. However, the lockdown has put their very survival on the stake,” she added. Folk artists are another lot, who are in deep trouble. “Barring big cities like Mumbai and Delhi, there are very limited options for a folk artist to make a living through his art. However due to the lockdown, all cultural events including local ones and those in metro cities have been either cancelled or postponed indefinitely right since March 2020,” shared young folk musician Saundarya Singh, a harmonium player and a resident of Jhunsi.“As a result, opportunities for earning Rs 1000 to Rs 1500 at each local event or even more at out-station events have all dried up. I am struggling financially”, rued the 25-year-old artist.His friend and colleague Hansraj, a percussion artist and a resident of Naini said that with religious events like jagrans also no longer being held, bhajan singers and instrument players like him were facing acute financial problems.The scale of the problem can be understood by the fact that North Central Zone Cultural Centre (NCZCC), Prayagraj— a centre dedicated to promoting arts and artists while functioning under the central government—has set up a dedicated helpline (Amit Srivastava: 8840885937, Shailendra Kumar: 9026304208 and Ravi Sahnkar Gupta: 9140215796) to extend helping hand to urban, folk and tribal artists in distress during the lockdown.The initiative has been taken following orders in this regard from the union ministry of culture.“As part of the initiative, the centre will help out artists of the seven states under its jurisdiction including UP, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttaranchal and Delhi with the help of respective state governments. At a time when the artists are facing problems, we wish to stand with them and do everything that we can to help them,” said NCZCC-Prayagraj director Indrajeet Grover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/artists-face-tough-time-in-lockdown-many-struggling-to-survive/story-MhRDYKSA5VduODkOYwZ2jM.html

They are also opposing the proposal to covert their community centre into an isolation ward.Greater Mohali Area Development Authority had built 1,620 apartments in 2017, of which around 1,000 have been allotted and families are residing in nearly 600.In a letter to deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan, members of the Purab Premium Apartments Allottees Association said that instead of allotting the flats adjoining theirs, the administration should provide the front-line workers 300-odd apartments in vacant blocks or allot space in school and college hostels as they are likely to remain closed till June end.Association president SK Loona said front-line workers are at high risk of contracting the virus and might infect others. Harpal Singh, a resident, said: “I have raised the issue with the Punjab chief minister through Twitter and I am hopeful of his intervention. We really run the risk of turning the complex into a Covid-19 hotspot.”The Mohali administration had taken the decision on April 4, citing that temporary accommodation will help those who are apprehensive of returning home and infecting their family members. As of now, no one has been shifted. Dayalan said he has received the letter and will look into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohali-society-residents-oppose-move-to-allot-flats-to-front-line-covid-19-workers/story-gTFLUsvgks3oC9Vs36NHoJ.html

Police pacified the protesting labourers but one of them, identified as Raju Yadav, was arrested for instigating the others. Before his arrest, Yadav said the factory owner had not paid wages to all but cleared the dues of a select few. “It was becoming difficult for us to survive. Therefore, when we came to know that the owner is giving wages to some of the workers, I along with the other workers reached the factory to demand our dues,” he said while adding that later police intervened and asked the labourers to vacate the area and walk back to their quarters.Sahnewal station house officer, inspector Inderjit Singh said that around 11am, he received an alert from the control room that some labourers are protesting outside AH Exports in Jugiana. A team rushed to the spot and found over 100 migrants gathered there. “When we talked to the owner, he said that he had called four labour contractors to whom he was to give Rs 1.65 lakh for further distributing the amount to the workers but all labourers gathered at the spot,” informed SHO.He added that he interacted with the labourers and convinced them that they will receive their wages at their respective quarters. “All labourers were pacified but one of them was arrested for initiating the protest and collecting all the labourers outside the unit,” he said.A case under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Sahnewal police station against him.Industry expresses helplessness to pay wagesFederation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) president Gurmeet Singh Kular requested the central and the state governments to intervene and share 50% of the salaries to be paid by the industry for the month of April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/anxious-labourers-continue-to-protest-social-distancing-goes-for-a-toss-in-ludhiana/story-0tp5AuB1yr4ul1kVCjPy6N.html

17-04-2020||City||30-year-old Nayagaon man tests positive for coronavirus; Mohali count reaches 57||After a gap of two days, a 30-year-old of Nayagaon in Mohali has tested positive for Covid-19, as per a report that came on Friday late evening, taking the total count in the district to 57.The man was working as a safai karamchari in the Covid-19 ward of PGIMER and has been admitted there itself. His sample has been sent for further testing.Mohali district has the highest number of cases in the state and the tricity at 57, but the administration is now hoping that in the coming week, around 10 patients will be discharged.Dr Manjit Singh, civil surgeon of Mohali, said, “We have started the process of discharging patients, and in a week’s time we will be discharging around 10 patients from Gian Sagar hospital in Banur. If two consecutive samples return negative, we will discharge the patient. The good news is all patients are responding well to the treatment.”Of the 57 cases in the district, 38 are from Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi, six patients have been discharged and two have died. Over 900 people have been tested so far.RAPID TESTING BEARING FRUIT: DCDeputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “Rapid testing kits launched two days back are helpful as we have screened 400 persons in Jawaharpur village and Kharar. We were doubtful of two persons, but their reports came negative.”The rapid testing kits use a single finger prick to take blood samples and give the result in 15 minutes. The method will be used for those with symptoms for more than seven days at various government health centres. Samples of those found positive will be sent for further testing.The first patient from Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi, panch Malkit Singh who was admitted at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), has been shifted from the ICU to the general ward.

17-04-2020||Chandigarh||Jammu industries department announces slew of measures for construction workers||The department of industries and commerce, Jammu and Kashmir on Friday said that it has initiated a slew of measures to restart industrial activities in the Union territory in a graded manner.The administration has started construction activities but with certain riders. However, industrialists were miffed over a “cumbersome” standard operating procedure (SOP), which has been put in place for the operationalisation of their units.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured that from April 20 there shall be a limited exemption in some key areas to restart some economic activities keeping in mind the poor strata.Lalit Kumar Mahajan, chairman of Federation of Industries Jammu, said, “A cumbersome procedure has been put in place to restart industrial activity. An order has been issued by the chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam that entails us to approach general manager district industries centre with details of workers and production line to be started, passes for vehicles and manpower, who in turn will forward our case with remarks to director industries and commerce. Then, understaffed deputy magistrates, who are already overburdened with administrative work, have also been involved in this process. Why can’t the industries department do all this on its own.”Commissioner secretary to industries and commerce department MK Dwivedi said, “We have prepared a list of industries to be started in a graded manner from April 20. They are largely associated with essentials, like pharmaceuticals, packed processed food, manufacturing masks, sanitisers etc.”“The administration has decided to restart the construction work with less movement of workers. Construction contractors have been asked to make arrangements of their stay at the construction site so that with a minimum movement they can work and live at the site itself,” he said.The government has also decided to conduct weekly inspections to check whether the units were following the SOPs properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jammu-industries-department-announces-slew-of-measures-for-construction-workers/story-kCgnhK3ReLon1Gw4qZaxlO.html
17-04-2020||Mumbai||Surge in encroachments, garbage burning at mangrove forests during lockdown||Encroachers are taking advantage of the lockdown to occupy mangrove forests in Borivli and Dahisar, alleged residents. Residents of the area have photographed encroachers burning garbage to destroy mangrove trees near Ganpat Patil Nagar slum opposite to IC Colony in Borivli.BMC demolished some new encroachments in the mangroves on Thursday but said it was impossible to monitor such violations during the outbreak. “As concerned authorities like the police and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) are busy containing the Covid-19 crisis, people are taking advantage and expanding illegal structures into mangrove forests. These violations are leading to permanent damage, and need to be addressed on priority,” said Harish Pandey, secretary, New Link Road Residents’ Forum. “Even if the fires are put out, the sheer expanse of the mangrove forests extending up to Gorai creek, allows encroachers to find new spots daily.”Borivli resident Aakash Sarin said, “This is systematic destruction. I have spotted at least one fire on lockdown days from my balcony, and subsequently structures coming up on the same spot. If such cases are neglected very soon they will spread across the entire green zone.”Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove cell) said, “These areas do not fall under our jurisdiction. However, alerts have been issued to the revenue department for action against such incidents but all authorities are busy fighting Covid-19. As a result cases have increased.”Member of legislative assembly (MLA) from Dahisar Manisha Chaudhari said that local residents were burning garbage closer to mangroves. “The issue has been highlighted to the mangrove cell, BMC and the revenue department. Lack of waste management facilities in these zones is allowing such cases to increase. Corrective action is being taken,” she said.The revenue department said cases were on private land and mangrove trees had not been destroyed. “A recent Bombay high court order has also directed us not demolish all unauthorised structures for the fear that more people may congregate on streets breaking the social distancing norm and also increase chances of Covid-19 community spread. However, such cases are being closely monitored by us and BMC,” said Vinod Dhotre, Borivli tehsildar (revenue officer).“The fires are being lit at mangrove buffer areas and so far all complaints have been addressed. Major illegal structures have been removed but a lot of debris is dumped inside the reserved forest zone and we cannot access those areas” said Sandhya Nandedkar, assistant municipal commissioner of R North ward adding, “As per a report by the fire department, trucks are dumping debris at the site to flatten the mangroves followed by dumping and burning of garbage. While we are finding it very difficult to respond to frequent cases, major areas fall under the mangrove cell’s purview and an offence report needs to be filed for enhanced protection.”Not just the northern suburbs but mushrooming of illegal structures and tree felling cases were reported from Aarey Colony, Goregaon and inside Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Borvili during the lockdown said other environmentalists. Meanwhile, a fire was reported near the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) camp in Aarey Colony, Goregaon on Friday evening. The fire department said it was due to burning of the garbage but was not a major fire, and doused in less than an hour. Aarey authorities were clueless about the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/surge-in-encroachments-garbage-burning-at-mangrove-forests-during-lockdown/story-O0QGWf1rQQ4MmCoX40vlxH.html
17-04-2020||Mumbai||Pandemic may affect flying habits: Survey||The coronavirus pandemic, which has brought the aviation industry to a near halt with only few cargo flights operating, may impact the flying habits of passengers in times to come. According to a survey by a global aviation consultancy ICF between late March and early April, nearly 50% of respondents indicated that they will prefer a direct flight with a stop-over (post-Covid-19) while another 46% respondents said the pandemic may give rise to demand for private jets. The survey was conducted on customers across the aviation industry to understand their views on the times of recovery, on how the crisis is likely to affect the passenger behaviour and industry practices, among others.“Nine out of 10 respondents expect the widespread adoption of video conferencing for work and education, which would undoubtedly impact the demand for air travel. The implications for business travel, much of which is driven by intra-company meetings, could lead to reduced demand,” stated the findings.Among other customer behaviours covered under the survey, the views were found to be largely split.It said, ‘In an attempt to avoid crowds, some passengers will limit their presence at large gatherings, will increasingly prefer non- stop flights to avoid exposure to crowds at connecting airports or will prefer the exclusivity of private aviation (if they can afford it)’ “The Covid-19 pandemic has introduced new practices (such as social distancing and telecommuting), raised hygiene awareness, and increased the popularity of video conferencing. We have never witnessed a social experiment of such magnitude and on such a wide scale, but it would be naive to think the new normal will be identical to the one we knew before Covid-19 upended our lives,” ICF said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pandemic-may-affect-flying-habits-survey/story-KhOhAOMbN5gVHkFld6PgfJ.html

17-04-2020||Chandigarh||SC upholds Himachal HC order on regularisation of PTA, PAT teachers||The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the decision of the Himachal Pradesh high court order thus paving the way for regularisation of around 15,000 parent-teacher association (PTA), primary assistant teacher (PAT), and para teachers.The orders were passed on civil appeals filed by Chander Mohan Negi and others against the order of the high court.The case pertains to the appointment of teachers made by the state government under Prathmik Sahayak Adhyapak/PAT Scheme; the HP para teachers (lecturer school cadre), para teachers (TGT’s) and para teachers (C&V) policy of 2003 and the Himachal Pradesh Gram Vidya Upasak Yojna, 2001.In its orders, the division bench comprising Justice Mohan M Shantanagoudar and Justice R Subhash Reddy observed that it is true that in the initial schemes notified by the government there was a condition that such appointees should not seek regularisation/absorption but at the same time for no fault of them, they cannot be denied regularisation/absorption.It is in view of the requirement of the state, their services were extended from time to time and now all the appointees have completed more than 15 years of service.Further, it is also to be noted that though appointment schemes were notified as early as in 2003, nobody questioned such policies and appointments up to 2012 and 2013.A writ petition was filed in 2012 without even impleading the appointees as party respondents. In the writ petition, there was no rejoinder filed by the writ petitioners disputing the averments of the state as stated in the reply affidavit.“Having regard to nature of such appointments, appointments made as per policies cannot be termed as illegal,” said the SC Bench.Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur hailed the SC order said that the state government was already giving these teachers a pay scale equivalent to the regular teachers.“However, regularisation could not be done as the matter was pending in the SC. The government will study the verdict and tread on the issue accordingly,” said Thakur.Meanwhile, education minister Suresh Bhardwaj said that the process for the regularisation of teachers will be started after the lockdown is over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sc-upholds-himachal-hc-order-on-regularisation-of-pta-pat-teachers/story-ej2t3s0k7P5uqPLwNwtGkJ.html
17-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s pay-and-use toilets will be free for users until the lockdown||Public toilets in Mumbai will be free for users until the lockdown. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said that this has been done for migrant workers who have been stranded in the city with no source of income. “We have instructed all public toilet facilities not to charge money from customers. This will continue until the situation comes under the control and stranded people in the city can go back,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC.Mumbai has around 8,500 public toilets which are run by BMC or by charities. The centres charge between Rs 2-5 for one-time use. On an average, over a million people in the city use the toilets, but since the declaration of the lockdown, footfalls at pay-and-use toilets has decreased by over 80%, with commuters locked up at home.Presently, the only users of the toilets are homeless migrant workers. A labourer from Malda, West Bengal, who is currently residing in the slums of Bandra (East) said, “Due to the lockdown, I have lost my job and I have only Rs100. As the public toilets charge for usage, I defecate openly on the railway tracks and take bath once a week for which I pay Rs5.”Human right activists have applauded the decision. According to them, it is the responsibility of the government to make arrangements for the necessities of the stranded workers during the outgoing epidemic. “Thousands of workers have lost work due to the lockdown. It is a responsible act that the corporation has levied the usage charge of public toilets. This will also control the cases of open defecation,” said Robert D’sSouza, a human right activist from Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-pay-and-use-toilets-will-be-free-for-users-until-the-lockdown/story-C3pkOKmc00h5W306zLdGsJ.html

17-04-2020||Mumbai||City NGO moves HC, seeks speedy decongestion of Maharashtra prisons||A city-based non-governmental organisation moved the Bombay high court on Friday seeking speedy decongestion of prisons across Maharashtra, as ordered by the Supreme Court.Taking due note of the threat created by coronavirus pandemic, on March 23, the apex court directed all states and union territories to decongest prisons to the possible extent. SC ordered setting up of high-powered committees at state level to determine the class or classes of prisoners who could be temporarily released from prisons in the wake of coronavirus outbreak. The apex court said the states and union territories could release certain categories of prisoners, like undertrials facing charge of offences punishable with imprisonment for up to seven years or prisoners convicted for similar offences.The petition filed by Global Care Foundation, through advocate Tanveer Nizam, states that the Maharashtra government, accordingly, set up a high power committee and according to a release issued by home minister Anil Deshmukh, it has been decided to released two categories of prisoners - under-trial prisoners and convicts sentenced to imprisonment for upto seven years. The petition adds that approximately 11,000 prisoners were, this, expected to be released on emergency parole for 45 days.“This order should be implemented at the earliest as grave and irreparable loss will be caused, especially in view of the fact that State of Maharashtra leads number of infections in India and is the worst hit with the pandemic and each day there is a great surge in the number of cases,” states the petition.“That, despite the eminent danger to lives of inmates and the only option of quarantine as a sole suggested measure, should the authorities fail to consider releasing the categorised inmates it would lead to loss of lives of inmates,” it adds.It has urged the high court to order the state government to forthwith release about 11,000 prisoners falling in categories identified by the high power committee either on emergency parole or furlough leave for a period of 45 days.The NGO has also sought list of the categorised prisoners and permission to allow the petitioner body to deposit bail amount ranging between Rs. 3,000 to 5,000 per prisoner. The petitioner body has offered to deposit the bail amount on behalf of the categories prisoners in order to ensure the process is not delayed any further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-ngo-moves-hc-seeks-speedy-decongestion-of-maharashtra-prisons/story-Ot1Oo7IZETgmy6hsxEIJWN.html

But if the rain does not end in a day or so, the moisture content in grains will increase and cause considerable loss to the farmers,” said Amritsar chief agriculture officer Harinderjit Singh.He added that though procurement started on April 15, it is yet to kick-off properly due to slow arrival of grains. “Yes, grains have started arriving in mandis but the quantity is less,” he said.Procurement is expected to speed up around April 20 when more farmers are expected to come with their produce, mandi officials said.Similar weather conditions are prevailing in other Majha districts—Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot, bringing a dip in the temperature while the wheat crop needs high temperature and dry climate at this stage.Tajinderpal Singh, a farmer from Rasoolpur village of Tarn Taran district, said, “We want to finish harvesting and procurement of our produce quickly but the rain is delaying this process. The uncertain weather conditions are making us worried.”Harpreet Singh, a farmer from Pandori Sidhwan village said, “Low temperature may affect the quality of grain and yield. If that happens, we would be in losses. The moisture contents in grains will create problems for us as procurement agencies won’t accept it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amritsar-s-wheat-farmers-anxious-as-intermittent-rain-delays-harvesting-procurement/story-aKM0uyV0Lm2lYgMApuuNqL.html
17-04-2020||Mumbai||‘Asymptomatic people are going undiagnosed’||As the lockdown continues and social distancing is observed by a large section in view of Covid-19 endemic, HT spoke to Jacinta D’Souza, professor and chairperson, school of biological sciences at UM-DAE Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences, Kalina, on the city having turned into an epicentre of the outbreak in the state, the need for extensive testing, testing mechanisms and more.What are the possible reasons that led to Mumbai becoming an epicentre of the outbreak?Infection trajectories of epidemic outbreaks are multifactorial and are numerically governed by initially-infected individuals, international travellers and Covid-19 positive entries at ports (particularly in February and until March 25), population density of a region, availability of testing kits, protection of technicians/ doctors/health officials who come in direct contact with samples and/or patients, and the ability to effectively identify and quarantine ‘prospective’ super-spreaders. Networks modulate through person-to-person interaction, shared spaces/surfaces, transport/travel, and exchange of articles/items that carry the viruses. Based on this, the number of suspected individuals is high in Mumbai (and Maharashtra), thereby making it a hotspot. In addition there are ‘escapers’ who were Covid-19 positive and ‘managed’ to escape the screening system. With the lockdown being announced for a 21-day period starting 25th March, these ‘escapers’ turned into super-spreaders.Though testing in Mumbai has ramped up, a section of experts say extensive testing is required to identify Covid-19 cases to contain the spread. What are the repercussions of inadequate testing?Demand and supply of kits worldwide has caused paucity in testing, and hence there is a set line of priority in investigating individuals – symptomatic over asymptomatic cases. It is difficult to know the exact numbers of asymptomatic individuals that go undiagnosed in testing. Unless this subset is diagnosed with critical surveillance, we won’t be able to gauge the spread of the virus in the community. Please explain the testing mechanisms.Currently, there are more 200 assay kits available for detecting Sars-CoV-2 virus and these are based on two scientific premises – molecular detection of genes that are specific to the virus from naso-pharyngeal swabs, and serological detection of antibodies specifically raised by the patient’s immune system against viral proteins. While the first requires a high-throughput real-time polymerase chain reaction machine, the latter is simpler, faster and requires the patient’s blood serum. The former is slower, more sensitive and can detect viral particles immediate to an infection in the throat or nasal swab. The latter mandates the patient’s immune system to develop antibodies after an infection. Additionally, each assay kit, in principle needs the presence of internal controls for testing every sample. Another requirement is the cold-chain transportation of samples. If these are not fulfilled, false negatives are bound to take place and become an inevitable part of the process. Given this, approved diagnostic testing by Indian Council for Medical Research is majorly based on molecular detection.What then is the way forward as far as testing is concerned?The need of the hour is to produce a comprehensive assay kit based both on molecular and serological principles. This will require more knowledge on the virus and the infection, and will take time. Many laboratories around the world are already working in that direction.India has laid out six criteria for testing that excludes asymptomatic individuals unless they have travelled in the last 14 years. Won’t this approach have implications in terms of underreporting of Covid-19 cases? The World Health Organization’s Covid-19 situation report 73 suggests that the number of asymptomatic individuals, who have tested positive, has been very few and the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual has yet to be documented. Currently, the idea is to cater to those individuals who are symptomatic, the obviousness with which they can spread the infection and not to simply ‘burden’ the diagnostic laboratories/centres and hospitals.Large number of containment zones have been created where a person tested Covid-19 positive. Only family members, neighbours and those in close contact are tested, while the remaining populace is quarantined for 14 days. Is this an effective strategy especially in densely populated areas of Worli-Koliwada and Dharavi slums with cases spiralling?Indeed. The need to test others does not arise; if infected, they would develop symptoms during this 14-day period. A close watch and monitoring of these contacts is very important. However, in areas where the population density is very high (Dharavi, for example) the infection-spread-recovery cycle gets skewed; home quarantining might not prove to be the best solution. These contacts should be isolated from such regions and quarantined into a separate locality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/asymptomatic-people-are-going-undiagnosed/story-0An55rFfOrvwxRkEXkO6aM.html

They are deliberately targeting villagers. Our children, women, and seniors are getting injured. We constantly live in fear,” said 55-year old Bagh Hussain Rathore, a resident of Salamabad in Shahpur sector of Poonch.“In these difficult times, we are as good as dead. Pakistan, for the past 20 days now has been opening artillery fire on villages in Balakote, Gulpur, Shahpur, Mankote, Kirni sectors,” he added.“We cannot move out of our houses because of the lockdown imposed to combat coronavirus and on the other hand Pakistan has been targeting human habitations with artillery fire,” he said.Tufail Hussain, 32, a labourer from Gotrian Mandhar village on zero lines said, “We are totally perplexed. Instead of combating the Covid-19 in their country, the Pakistan army has been targeting poor villagers on the border.”Hussain said that every five minutes Pakistani troops rain down a barrage of mortars on Indian villages in the Poonch sector.He said that the civil administration has not provided bunkers to households on the borders.On Friday, an 18-year-old youth was injured in Pak shelling in the Kerni sector of Poonch while three civilians including an 8-year-old boy were killed last week in Pak shelling in Kupwara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-fear-pak-shelling-hits-j-k-border-residents-with-double-whammy/story-kEnS18abeKnZLd1KimZbQP.html
17-04-2020||Lucknow||Now, UP’s Maharajganj, Hathras become corona-free districts||Maharajganj and Hathras became the second and third districts in Uttar Pradesh to become coronavirus-free, officials said on Friday. Pilibhit was the first district in the state to shed the corona tag earlier this week.“Maharajganj and Hathras districts have been also declared coronavirus free. The state government declared Pilibhit district coronavirus free on April 13 after the second report of two Covid patients was found negative in laboratory tests,” principal secretary, Health and Family Welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said at a press conference in Lucknow.In Maharajganj, all six Covid-19 patients tested negative for the Sars-Cov-2 virus for the second time, district magistrate Ujjwal Kumar said. There was no fresh Covid case in Maharajganj at present and the reports of 36 family members of the six patients were also negative, Kumar said.The district administration decided to discharge all six patients from hospital and shifted them to a quarantine facility for observation, according to state government guidelines.To make sure that no other person was infected with the coronavirus, health department teams collected five samples at random from the villages and sent them for tests, the district magistrate said.“All the samples tested negative, it was a major relief for us,” he said.In Hathras, the second report of four Covid positive patients was negative, principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said.Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar said all four patients were discharged from hospital and shifted to a quarantine centre. There was no positive case in the district, he said.Last month, the district police had detained four Tablighi Jamaat members who had attended the Delhi congregation, he said.After their samples tested positive, they were admitted to the isolation ward of the Covid hospital. The samples of 14 people who came in contact with the Jamaatis were negative, he said. Similarly, Maharajganj was in the news after Tablighi Jamaat members, who attended the congregation organised in Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi last month, arrived in the district a fortnight ago.After receiving information that Tablighi Jamaat members were staying there, the district police raided dozens of villages near Kolhui town.Four villages and the market area of Kolhui town were sealed.The health department and police teams surveyed 7,500 people and screened 40,000. The samples of suspected patients were collected for tests.The villages and markets were sanitised and people were directed to stay home, follow social distancing norms and inform the district administration about the movement of suspected persons, Kumar said. After the Tablighi Jamaat members arrived in Maharajganj by train, the district administration alerted the Gorakhpur, Kushinagar and Deoria administration as people of these districts had travelled in the same coach as some of the infected patients.All the passengers were tracked and screened, but they tested negative, Kumar said.Maharajganj is located on the porous India-Nepal border. The border was sealed and samples of villagers nearby were collected for tests, he said.These steps were taken after the district administration received information that some suspected patients had moved toward the border.Meanwhile, 10,000 migrants workers from Maharajganj had arrived in the district from various states last month and they were shifted to quarantine centers established in schools.Thousands of Nepali migrants settled in various cities also arrived at the border town of Sonauli.“The Nepal administration refused them entry, but we called the Nepal Embassy to allow their citizens to cross the border. Permission was granted. After a few days, 300 Nepalese nationals again arrived on the border. They were quarantined in a school in Nautanwa town,” Kumar said. “We are keeping our fingers crossed, the population of Maharajganj is around 25 lakh. A majority of the people are settled in the rural areas. There is a large movement of the migrant population from neighbouring Bihar and Nepal. Vigil has been tightened, mandis (markets) are being opened in the morning. The administration has hired postmen to distribute money among the villagers and regular sanitisation is being done in public places,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/now-up-s-maharajganj-hathras-become-corona-free-districts/story-mejYCJlPBbhWj6WkSMdXqM.html

According to him, the festival is conducted in the evening annually and the temple authorities had a few days ago given a written commitment to the SI that they would not organise it this year.They gave the commitment after the SI persuaded them during a meeting he held with them, citing the national lockdown and bar on large gatherings, including religious, the SP said.“Usually the function is conducted in the evening but perhaps they knew that if they try to do it in the evening police will be there. So they performed it in the morning for about 15 to 20 minutes,” Marbaniang said.Kalaburagi is one of the major COVID-19 hotspots where the first coronavirus death in the country had taken place.Till Thursday, the district has reported 20 positive cases, including three deaths.There are 14 active cases undergoing treatment in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/scores-attend-temple-chariot-festival-in-karnataka-village-5-held/story-gDvcooTQoad3e82VsS8QcM.html

Four weapons have also been recovered from the slain militants,” said a senior police officer.Two weapons of the SPOs have also been recovered from them.“After meticulous search and painstaking efforts for three continuous days, security forces zeroed in on Saunder village in a Nallah (rivulet). On observing the movement of forces, the militants fired at the search party and in the retaliatory action, both the militants were eliminated. One AK-74 rifle and one INSAS rifle were recovered from them,” said inspector general of police Mukesh Singh.With timely and sustained effort, an attempt by the Hizbul Mujahideen to revive their terror activities in the Dachan and Marwah areas of Kishtwar has been nipped, he said and added that this action of security forces was a tribute to the police martyr Basit Iqbal.One of the two slain militants was a rape accused released 20 days ago in the wake of the spread of the novel coronavirus.He was identified as Ashiq Hussain and his associate as Basharat Hussain, both residents of Tander village in Dachhan.The deceased SPO was identified as Basit Iqbal and injured SPO as Vishal Singh.Terrorism had re-surfaced in Kishtwar region after senior BJP leader Anil Parihar and his brother Ajit Parihar were killed outside their house in Kishtwar town on November 1, 2018.The next year, RSS leader Chandrakant Sharma and his security guard Rajinder Kumar were killed in Kishtwar district.Mohammad Amin Bhat, alias Jehangir Saroori, the longest surviving militant commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen, is believed to be the man behind revival of terrorism in the region. He had joined militancy in 1992.In October last year, Jammu and Kashmir Police had put up posters of Jehangir Saroori in Kishtwar region and had also announced a cash award of Rs 30 lakhs on information leading to his arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-terrorists-responsible-for-killing-spo-eliminated-in-kishtwar/story-U38adxHKi70uHVpg0Zqh1M.html

Such acts will not be tolerated and warrant strict action, said Mardi.The DGP said that some landlords were asking their tenants to vacate the premises on the basis of religion. Maintaining that the security of Kashmiri labourers was also the responsibility of the state, Mardi directed Station House Officers (SHOs) to ensure that the Kashmiri labourers residing in the territorial limits of their respective police stations remain safe.Mardi said authorities had also formed peace committees in sensitive areas: “These committees should hold meetings and take steps to maintain communal harmony,” he said. He also made a case for the security of students from north-eastern states: “This is important from the point of view of national integration,” said Mardi.The police chief added that there had been reports of some students stepping out to procure drugs.“Earlier, I had appealed to parents to keep a watch on their wards. If you can’t stop your children from taking drugs during the lockdown then don’t expect the government will be able to do something about it,” Mardi said, cautioning people against consumption of methyl alcohol or adulterated beverages, which may result in loss of eyesight or life.‘USE ZOOM APP’Mardi also advised people to use the Zoom Application to hold official conferences and cautioned them against downloading unauthorised Covid Apps, which compromise data.He also warned those bringing essential supplies to the state to not smuggle in people. “An incident was reported in Kullu, wherein an ambulance driver was caught smuggling in people from Hamirpur.

Researchers working on the project said its deployment in hospitals will help in minimising the risk of the frontline health staff getting infected with the deadly virus. Based on the smart line following, WardBot, fitted with sensors, can work on a known path and can carry food items and medicines for delivery at different beds to patients in a ward, Ekta Singla, Associate Professor and Head, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Ropar, said on Friday. Singla, who is heading the team of the researchers, said the ‘WardBot’ uses simple gesture sensors for a quarantined person to wave a bye to the bot, as an indication of receiving the material. Patients will get the intimation through bed-IDs being displayed on small LCD units, she said. The design of an autonomous WardBot is such that it can be instructed to receive and deliver food and medicines and necessary equipment from one room to the other from the remotely located control room, the researchers said. The control room can instruct multiple bots to accomplish tasks simultaneously on different floors, they said. WardBot also has a feature of self-sanitising on the return path and could be used for sanitising walls of the hospitals, said the researchers, adding it can also work under low-light conditions. WardBot can serve as a support structure to the healthcare sector at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on minimising human interaction with the coronavirus patients, they said. “All team members are currently working from home. We plan to provide robust support to the frontline workers to combat well in the battle against this pandemic. We are also looking forward to industry collaborations to take this concept to virtual use,” Singla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/iit-ropar-designs-wardbot-to-deliver-food-medicines-to-covid-19-patients/story-spjINaQ0NGycfD4dKlf7pJ.html

Covid-19 has hit all sectors of the economy. The farming sector is no different. Due to the paucity of labour, harvesting has also been delayed. There would be instances of rejection of crops by procurement agencies due to over ripening. So I would advise farmers to show restraint and cooperate with them,” said Mahal.“If procurement agencies refuse to lift grain on account of high moisture content, farmers should wait and let the grain dry. As per the process, a farmer can reapply for a token two days after the expiry of the first token. They could also get in touch with the arhtiyas concerned for issuing them tokens,” said Mahal.He said that the department of extension education was in talks with the government to mitigate the issues being faced by farmers.On the other hand, school of climate change and agricultural meteorology of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has stated that light rainfall and windy conditions will prevail for next 24 hours.The head of the department Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu has stated that the overcast skies will continue till Saturday.“We are expecting light rainfall and windy conditions. It is unlikely that such conditions will hamper the harvesting operations across the state,” stated Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/weekend-showers-won-t-hamper-farming-ops-pau/story-Wa1QIeSisDcu5Tia2EOzeK.html

Wadhwani Institute is India’s first research institute dedicated to developing artificial intelligence solutions for social good.“Every cough has a distinct pattern. Cough of a Covid-19 patient will also have a distinct pattern, different from other (influenza-like) coughs, which a machine will be able to recognise,” Kumar said.NIPI, he said, would need a fairly large number, at least 500 Covid-19 patients, to record their coughing pattern to develop the tool. Once it has as reference the coughing pattern, the AI-powered machine would be able to detect a Covid-19 suspect as soon as the individual coughs in front of the machine, said Kumar.Also read: Bihar intensifies outreach programme for stranded migrants in other states“I have given NIPI the go-ahead to collect Covid-19 related information it may require from us. Since we do not have as many Covid-19 patients, the NIPI may need to collate data from patients in other states as well,” added Kumar.Four new Covid-19 cases were recorded during the last 24 hours, taking Bihar’s tally up to 74 on Thursday.“The AI-based tool seems exciting and may have the potential to triage suspected Covid-19 cases through cough sound analysis,” said Kumar.“We granted NIPI our approval in principle on April 14 to develop the tool in keeping with our proactive response to Covid-19 crisis and several measures taken to identify suspected cases, testing the high-risk population and quarantining them, besides looking at the introduction of innovative solutions to control and break the chain of transmission of infection Covid,” he said.Also read: Most patients in Bihar recover without critical care, govt keeps fingers crossedNIPI was established in 2006 through a joint statement by the Prime Ministers of Norway and India.

The constables alerted three other policemen who were deployed at a barricade picket, said a senior police officer.  # Vigilant Covid Patrol Police of PS Mangolpuri, Outer Delhi, saved a man trying to jump from flyover... @DelhiPolice @CPDelhi @ANI @LtGovDelhi pic.twitter.com/ngjNDi4Yds“The two constables immediately reached the flyover and grabbed the man by his hands. In the meantime, the three policemen stopped a garbage collecting truck and asked its driver to position it right below the place where the man was dangling. The constables pulled him up and saved his life,” the officer said.When the man was questioned, he told the police personnel that he was upset because of the frequent quarrels he had with his wife, who works as domestic help.“The man is unemployed and his wife often scolded him for not looking for employment. The family lives in Tilak Nagar, which is almost six kilometres away from the spot where tried to jump off the flyover. He had walked to reach there,” the officer added.A video of the rescue operation has also been circulated on social media by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-man-trying-to-jump-of-flyover-saved-by-cops/story-AaBZTgf76bIX4v1xFtheTJ.html
17-04-2020||Delhi||‘It felt like Ram Rajya’: Rs 500 notes lay on street, no one dared to pick them||About a dozen people watched from a safe distance as three Rs 500 currency notes lay unattended right outside a house in Delhi. For several minutes, no one dared to touch the currencies. Then someone dialled the police.The fear among many people that currency notes could be carriers of coronavirus disease Covid-19 resulted in this peculiar situation in North Delhi’s Lawrence Road on Wednesday afternoon.It all began around 1.15 pm when someone noticed three soiled notes lying outside a house. Soon, there were a host of curious onlookers and no one to claim the unattended cash.A call was made to the Keshavpuram police station at 1.27 pm. A police team arrived at the spot, but they too didn’t want to take chances. “We cordoned off the street and sent the onlookers into their homes. One of us wore hand gloves to pick up the notes. We then sprayed them with sanitiser and packed them in an envelope,” said a senior police officer.The police asked around, but didn’t find anyone who would claim the cash. The residents of the house outside which the currency notes were found too did not claim them. “No one had picked the money off the street. No one would claim it either. It felt like Ram Rajya,” said the officer.But the suspense over the notes ended soon after the policemen returned to the police station. “A woman, Charanjeet Kaur, visited the police station to claim that the notes belonged to her,” said Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west). Kaur, a 49-year-old teacher at a government school in nearby Shakurpur, told the police that the notes were part of Rs 10,000 she had withdrawn from an ATM in RG City Centre, a mall in Keshavpuram. “Afraid that the notes could be carrying the virus, she had washed them with sanitiser and put them on a table in the balcony of her second floor house to dry. The wind may have blown away three of them,” said DCP Arya.Kaur had remained unaware of the drama when the police had landed outside her house. It was only when she walked out to her balcony, that she got to know of the missing notes and the drama that had unfolded.The police asked her to produce the other notes she had withdrawn. “The notes found on the street were of the same series as the other notes with her. We gave back the currencies to her,” said the DCP. While there isn’t enough scientific evidence to suggest that the virus survives on currency notes, many people have tried to play safe while exchanging notes. At a fuel station in Delhi’s Saket, for example, many customers chose not to take loose change from attendants after paying for the fuel. Earlier, some residents of Saharsa in Bihar had found currency notes scattered outside their homes. The currencies were accompanied by notes which said, “I have come with Corona. Accept this note, otherwise I’ll harass everyone”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/it-felt-like-ram-rajya-rs-500-notes-lay-on-street-no-one-dared-to-pick-them/story-qfhZNIlJHlSlOYPlbOSkkJ.html

The association has demanded that inter-city movement be allowed between Baddi, Nalagarh and industrial areas of Punjab. “The government should allow entry to at minimum five persons from each pharma unit from outside the state. Vehicle passes should be issued to pharma industry staff,” said Gupta.He said that during shift timings the movement of pharma unit workers should be allowed on foot or two-wheelers to avoid transport burden on MSME or Himachal Road Transport Corporation-run bus service be provided on select routes.Gupta said if the associations’ demands are not met at the earliest, the supply and production of medicines will be affected.“Given the situation, the lockdown may not be relaxed for the next two-three months, thus the government needs to formulate a roadmap till September to facilitate the pharma industry,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-drug-manufacturers-seek-relaxation-in-restrictions-to-salvage-pharma-industry/story-KcHrstB8rrmQWuXjBav1VM.html

17-04-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka scales up Covid-19 tests 5 times to 1,500 per day||Karnataka has scaled up the number of coronovirus tests by five times, said a key Minister, who regretted that some of those who died due to Covid-19 pandemic could have saved their lives had they opted to avail the treatment early.In the biggest jump in a day, Karnataka reported 36 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, taking the total to 315 in the State, where the death toll stands at 13.Speaking to P T I on Friday, Medical Education Minister Sudhakar K, who is in-charge of all matters related to Covid-19, said those are not new cases in the sense they are related to primary and secondary contacts (who have been quarantined) of those who have already tested positive.He said 200-300 real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real time RT-PCR) tests, one of the most accurate laboratory methods for detecting, tracking, and studying the coronavirus, were used to be conducted a day in the State.The number has now been increased five times, to 1,500 such tests per day, the Minister said, adding, it would be further scaled up substantially once rapid test kits are delivered from China in a day or two.A medical professional himself, Sudhakar said the patients who lost their lives had co-morbidities, in addition to being Covid-19 positive, adding, they sought medical treatment only after their symptoms aggravated and their health condition worsened considerably.He said he has convened a meeting of specialists to discuss in detail the pattern of treatment of Covid-19 patients, adding, he has told doctors to adopt a little more aggressive treatment protocol without waiting for symptoms to aggravate.“Major reason for deaths, apart from co-morbidities and other things, is that the patients intentionally coming in (for treatment) at the last stage,” Sudhakar said.“When they knew they have fever, sore throat and difficulty in breathing, they should have come quickly and get test done and admitted; things would have dramatically changed. I have seen all these patients. They (some of them) have gone to some quacks initially. Had they come in the first week itself (once they had symptoms), 100 per cent I will tell you mortality would not have happened,” he said.Sudhakar said people should be a little more sensitive and responsible in the sense they have to report to the health system the moment they have cold, cough or any medical issue if they have contacted Covid-19 positive patient.“We are doing on our own to identify, trace and track (Covid-19 cases) but (some of) those people try to hide from us. My earnest appeal to them is ‘come and report to the health system’; they will be saving themselves,” the Minister said.He said he would suggest to the Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa that the government issue an advisory to information technology and other companies to test their own employees with rapid kits when they restart operations with 50 per cent staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-scales-up-covid-19-tests-5-times-to-1-500-per-day/story-Y6RANiankz0o6Wcgohn9QM.html
17-04-2020||Kolkata||Sweet shop owners in Bengal hopeful of making profit after extended lockdown ease||Sweetmeat makers in West Bengal have welcomed the state government’s decision to allow their shops to operate from 8 am to 4pm, an extension from its earlier noon-4pm window, amid the lockdown imposed by the government to combat COVID-19.Several confectioners, who were sceptical about opening their outlets for just four hours, fearing more losses, will now confidently lift shutters in the next two to three days, West Bengal Sweetmeat Shop Owners’ Association Secretary Jagannath Ghosh said.“There are around one lakh sweet shops in Bengal. Just about 30 per cent shops were doing business since March 31 (when the 4-hour order was issued), trying to recover the cost incurred. The new notification will encourage more owners to open their outlets. By Sunday, 50 per cent shops will lift shutters and hopefully make profit.“I say 50 per cent as employees of many sweet shops have returned to their villages and the owners will find it extremely difficult to run the show without them,” Ghosh said.Dhiman Chandra Das, the owner of popular confectionery ‘K C Das’, said he would have to make arrangements for the safety of customers and staffers over the next three days.“We need to clean the entire premises and make adequate provisions for sanitisers and hand wipes before starting operations. Hopefully, we will be able to offset the mounting losses during the morning hours, when more people are out on the streets to buy essentials,” he said.The government, in a notification on April 16 said “in continuation of the order dated March 30, it is hereby noted that sweetmeat shops (mistir dokan) may be open from 8 am to 4 pm” from now on.The notification clearly spelt out that only takeaway services will be allowed for dry sweets.Ghosh said all shops have been asked to abide by the lockdown norms, and customers will not be allowed to crowd the counters.“Our members will adhere to the guidelines issued by the government. Customers will not be entertained if they do not maintain social distancing rules,” Ghosh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/sweet-shop-owners-in-bengal-hopeful-of-making-profit-after-extended-lockdown-ease/story-kE7M3XrWef9H2pQ2G9kGJO.html

Due to the lockdown, thousands of labourers and students are stranded within and outside the state as they don't have permission to go anywhere while on the other hand, BJP leaders are going anywhere they want.”“This is injustice. The rules should be the same for everyone. Coronavirus is very dangerous and lockdown is the only way to curb its spread,” he said.The Congress leader also asked the state government to provide essential seeds and pesticides to farmers and orchardists.He said that as the lockdown has been extended till May 3, the state government should make special arrangements to send stranded people to their homes after carrying out their medical check-up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-hits-out-at-bjp-mp-ramswaroop-for-entering-state-amid-lockdown/story-2MaMJMb87uN0rFOrCEXX0L.html

17-04-2020||Education||Officials skip office, university teachers, staff go unpaid in Bihar||Owing to the callous approach of senior officials in the state universities, thousands of teaching and non-teaching staff working in various constituent and affiliated colleges have not received arrears of their upgraded salary, the fund for which was released by the government last month.General secretary of the Federation of University Services Teachers’ Association of Bihar (FUSTAB) Dilip Choudhary, who is also a member of legislative council (MLC) of ruling Janata Dal (United) said, “Salary for March and arrears as recommended by the 7th pay commission could not be paid in various universities due to prolonged absence of registrars, financial advisors (FA) and finance officers (FO) from the headquarters.”“This is ridiculous. Crucial staff of the universities have been absent from their duties for weeks, even though they have been exempted from the lockdown,” alleged Choudhary after seeking the intervention of chancellor’s office in the matter.Citing the cases of Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LMNU), Darbhanga, and Kameshwar Singh Sanskrit University (KSSU), Darbhanga, Choudhary claimed that salary and arrears of more than 1,700 teaching staff of 43 constituent colleges of LMNU and 70 of KSSU could not be paid as FA and FO were out of station for many weeks now.Teachers of Patliputra University, Patna; JP University, Chapra; Kunwar Singh University, Ara and Purnia University have neither been paid salary for March and nor arrears of upgraded salary structure owing to absence of important officials. Patna University is, however, exception which paid its staff salary and arrears.Purnia University vice-chancellor Rakesh Singh, who is also in-charge of LMNU, said that the FA and FO had been sent reminders to come to office and prepare the bills for all the staff to arrange the arrear payments. “Salary amount for teaching and non-teaching staff of Purnia and LMNU has not been released yet by the government,” added Singh.Vice-chancellor of Kunwar Singh University Devi Prasad Tewari said that they had paid salary to non-teaching staff from the varsity’s internal resources. “Arrears of revised salary could not be paid due to non-availability of some important officials.The teachers will get salary for March probably in the next few weeks as the government is likely to release the necessary funds soon,” added Tewari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/officials-skip-office-university-teachers-staff-go-unpaid-in-bihar/story-EZPZzKq6L4lUTgR3RqYf8L.html

17-04-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal tea growers suffer losses due to coronavirus lockdown||Bearing the brunt of the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb coronavirus, the tea industry is suffering due to reduced workforce and lack of transportation.“When the lockdown was announced, the plucking of tea leaves and processing had stopped. On March 30, we were given permission to restart the activities with minimum use of labour and ensuring cleanliness. But we are still facing issues of reduced workforce and transportation,” Aman Pal Singh, the manager of the Dharamsala Tea Company, said.“Our produce in April is usually in demand in the European markets and in Kolkata. However, due to European markets being almost shut we will have to send all the produce to Kolkata, but transporting them is difficult as trucks are not plying. Our stock is held up here. If this continues for a few more days then we will have to face 30% to 40% loss,” he said.The tea estate manager hoped that the government will allow the inter-state movement of trucks after April 20, which will ensure that the produce fetches good price and losses can be reduced for all growers in the region.REDUCED WORKFORCESachin Butail, a tea grower from Palampur, said that the lockdown not only resulted in the reduced workforce in the tea gardens and factories but hit the small tea growers financially.“In a normal situation, I would employ more than 20 people in my factory. The number has now come down five. The workload has increased,” he said.“The transportation of the produce has halted, which means our sales are zero. It was from the earnings from sales that we would meet our expenses. The banks are asking us to pay instalments,” he said, adding that transporters were not ready to ferry tea to Kolkata market due to the lockdown as they fear harassment by authorities.“Work was stopped for many days. The number of people working in tea gardens has also gone down drastically. We are afraid of the (coronavirus) disease and are using masks besides washing our hands regularly basis while working,” Vishu Oraon, a worker, said.The lockdown, which was originally scheduled to continue till April 14, has been extended to May 3 in view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases.If the situation continues the tea growers will face heavy losses, Butail said, adding that the tea plucked in March would fetch a profitable price in the auction but the delay would result in prices lower than even the manufacturing cost.Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Small Tea Growers’ Association of Himachal Pradesh, Gokul Butail, said since the authorities prohibited engaging labour from outside the state, tea plucking was delayed in the region.“If there is further delay due to transportation, the Kolkata market will be flush with the produce because of the arrival of Assam tea. Kangra tea will fetch nominal prices, resulting in growers incurring heavy losses,” he said. NO SUPPLY TO AMRITSARGokul Butail said that the Kangra tea growers stopped sending produce to the Amritsar market several years ago.“The tea from Amritsar was mainly supplied to Iran, but the market was closed due to conflicts in the Gulf,” he said. Sachin Butail added that the Amritsar market was no more viable as the commission agents would frame rules on their whims, causing harassment and losses to the growers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-tea-growers-suffer-losses-due-to-coronavirus-lockdown/story-NJ6kOPniURFkNLXSZFrkvM.html
17-04-2020||Education||Unauthorised absence: Chancellor pulls up V-Cs, seeks clarification||Taking serious note of several vice-chancellors (V-Cs) of the state universities remaining out of headquarters during the lockdown period, Bihar governer-cum-chancellor Phagu Chauhan late Wednesday sought clarification from them for the unauthorised absence from university headquarters without taking leave of absence or permission from the chancellor, as per the provisions.While some of the V-Cs, including those having additional charge of another university, rushed back to their respective headquarters soon after receiving the letters, others are yet to do so.“In view of Covid-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown, the V-Cs were expected to be in headquarters and exercise leadership role as the principal executive and academic officer of the university. It is during the hours of crises that the responsibility of leaders of organisations goes up manifold,” said the letter from Raj Bhawan additional secretary Ram Anugrah Narayan Prasad to the Pataliputra University V-C Gulab Chand Ram Jaiswal.The letter stated the order did not “explicitly or implicitly state or imply that the officials could leave their headquarters and stay on unauthorized leave during lockdown.”“In fact the V-Cs were expected to enforce lockdown in their universities and colleges, besides taking measures for facilitating online education,” the letter said, seeking clarification within a week.The chancellor has asked his principal secretary to seek report about online teaching on weekly basis. All the university officials have been asked to facilitate online education and put links of the topics on the university website for the students.V-C Jaiswal could not be contacted despite repeated attempts on his mobile number. Pataliputra University Pro-VC Girish Kumar Choudhary, however, said that he was given charge for three days only from March 16-18 through a WhatsApp message. “I don’t know anything after that,” he added.BRA Bihar University V-C Hanuman Prasad Pandey, who also holds the additional charge of JD University, Chapra, said that he had applied for permission, but left before its approval as he required medical help. “I am a heart patient and had gone to Faziabad (UP) on March 21 for check. I was hospitalised and in the meantime, there was lockdown and I was stuck there. I requested the DM for a pass to move from there,” he added.Pandey said that he had reached JP Univeristy, Chapra and would join at BRABU in Muzaffarpur on Friday.Nalanda Open University V-C HN Prasad, who was appointed on March 9, has been out of Patna since March 22. He sent a WhatsApp message from UP to the pro-VC that the latter should discharge routine functions in his absence. He did not pick up phone despite repeated attempts.Prof RK Verma of Munger University, though within state, is in Gaya. “I was on leave on March 21 and had applied for the same on March 18 as I had to go Jamshedpur for work. As there was a meeting with additional chief secretary and principal secretary to Raj Bhawan on March 23 and then lockdown was announced, so it became difficult. Also, the death of a Munger man due to coronavirus created further problem,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/unauthorised-absence-chancellor-pulls-up-v-cs-seeks-clarification/story-Uvg4ggjELjFqCY57p2Yi3H.html
17-04-2020||Education||Online learning without textbooks challenging||Though majority of schools in the city have switched to digital platforms for academic activities, non-availability of textbooks is yet another challenge for the teachers and the students alike in the virtual learning process.Parents, who generally buy textbooks after announcement of results of final examination, are facing trouble in arranging them as both schools and local book shops remain closed owing to the lockdown. Seema Sinha, whose daughter studies in class 7, said, “Every year, I buy books from the school counter after collecting result of the final exams. This year, however, the school promoted students without holding a parents- teachers meeting. I had no idea about the lockdown and hence, I didn’t go out to buy the prescribed books in March.”“My daughter often demands books, complaining that she is not able to understand properly through online lessons. But, I am left with no option other than waiting for schools or book shops to reopen to buy the textbooks”, said Sinha. Shashank Kumar, a class 8 student, complained that he will have to again go through the lessons after buying the books. “I have almost completed the first unit of each subject through online classes. But, after getting the textbooks, I will have to redo it for systematic learning which may take extra time.”Teachers also agreed that it was quite difficult to teach without books, especially subjects like mathematics and science. Deepak Kumar, a senior teacher at a private school, said, “Higher classes students can deal with non-availability of books as all private schools prefer NCERT textbooks, which are available as e-books free of cost. However, various schools prescribe private publication books till class 8 which are not available in the digital format. It is difficult to teach numericals and maths problems without referring to the textbooks.”Earlier, the Patna district administration had asked the education department to provide a list of schools interested in home delivery of books for the purpose of issuing a vehicle pass to them, however, the procedure has not started yet.According to an education department official, around 50 schools have applied for vehicle passes for home delivery of books so far.“Around 50 schools have applied for the vehicle pass for more than 200 vehicles for home delivery of books. The pass will be issued after April 20 once the list of schools is finalised.”Meanwhile, Bihar Public School and Children Welfare Association (BPSCWA) has requested the administration for permitting the schools to open for a short period to sell books.D K Singh, chairman of BPSCWA, said, “Students are scattered in different localities and hence it is difficult to chalk out a plan for covering a wider area. Moreover, every school doesn’t has a private vehicle for delivering books. It would be convenient for both schools and parents if schools get permission to distribute books through their counters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/online-learning-without-textbooks-challenging/story-Gq7t21mavvpvwJweT3ZhwK.html

Maharashtra has 297 active containment zones.“We have given the policemen the necessary safety equipment and are using drones to monitor containment zones,” Pranaya Ashok, DCP (operations), told Hindustan Times.The number of positive coronavirus cases in Dharavi have tripled in the past five days, from 28 cases on April 11 to 86 on April 16, while the death toll during the same period has also increased from four to nine, data from the state health department revealed.On Thursday, Dharavi saw its highest spike in the number of coronavirus-positive patients, with 26 new cases. A 58-year-old man from Laxmi Chawl, who had been tested positive last week, also died on Thursday.The first case in Dharavi was reported on April 1, following which there has been a rapid surge in the number of positive cases, which may soon pose a grim challenge for civic authorities. If the pattern continues, Dharavi could see around 100 cases in the next few days.Mumbai, the city affected most by the spread of Covid-19 in the country, saw 177 more patients on Thursday, taking its tally past 2,000 to 2,073, and reported three deaths. The city’s death toll is now 117. The other four deaths were from Pune.The Mumbai Police, meanwhile, has the maximum number of Covid-19 cases among all state police.

The silver lining of the lockdown is that families now have enough time to spend together,” she says, adding that this should be used to bridge the gap between parents and children.Mother of two daughters, an eight- and a five-year-old, Pandit says as a parent, she makes sure to involve her children in prayer rituals and meditation. “Every morning, my husband and I perform yoga and meditation, along with other exercises. This is followed by recitation of prayers, when we take the opportunity to pass on traditional treasures to our children. Now, we also have the chance to teach them ethics through Ramayana and Mahabharata,” she says, while appreciating the government’s decision of re-telecasting these historical epics.Her rest of the day, Pandit says, is spent taking care of household chores, such as cleaning and cooking, helping her daughters with their online classes and interacting with her school staff. When possible, she relishes reading books and newspapers, and indulging in dancing and singing with her children.The ample time has also given her the chance to try out various recipes. “Apart from our staple diet, I am also trying my hand at pasta, pizza or whatever I can whip up with the available ingredients,” she says.But the lockdown has also brought along a new challenge - persistent inquiries by the blossoming minds at home.Being home all day, she says, the children can’t help but be restless about not going to school or playing with children. “These are indeed challenging times, but it’s parents’ duty to help their children understand the prevailing situation and the risks involved in stepping out,” she says, not forgetting to remind her daughters to wash their hands before eating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/life-in-the-times-of-lockdown-now-s-the-perfect-chance-to-bond-with-kids-shares-this-mother-teacher/story-Zf6YEABzLbJ90y4Da4I3eI.html

17-04-2020||Chandigarh||Untraced sources of four Covid-19 patients in Chandigarh add to authorities’ worry||As the tricity remains under lockdown for Covid-19 for over three weeks now, health authorities are racing against time to come up with answers to “untraced” sources of the disease as the count of patients with no known history of contact with people from infected zones has gone up to four.Teams tracing the 113 contacts of a Panjab University teacher and Chandigarh’s 19th positive case are clueless about the disease source.As of now, the search has narrowed down to the teacher’s 64-year-old mother-in-law, who came down from Delhi to help during her daughter’s pregnancy and childbirth.The teacher who tested positive last Friday, is in the intensive care unit of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). Even as his wife (32) and infant daughter are negative, the mother-in-law and elder daughter (8) have tested positive. “We have not been able to trace his source. The man has no travel or contact history,” says Chandigarh health secretary Arun Gupta.The only man with history of foreign travel the teacher had come in contact with on March 10 had tested negative. So, the “only possibility is that he might have caught infection from his mother-in-law, who came from Delhi,” Gupta adds.Contacts of teacher’s relative being testedHowever, even as the Chandigarh administration had written to Delhi to test the woman’s family, calling it a case of community spread would be wrong, Gupta cautions.A PGIMER based epidemiologist, however, does not agree, saying: “We are afraid this could be a case of community spread.”Indicating that there is no need to panic, the epidemiologist says other indications of community spread are not holding true for Chandigarh. “For instance, we are not finding corona positivity among patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). But, it’s worrisome if source is not found.”Sources of three more cases in Mohali that are yet to be traced include the panch of Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi, because of whom 38 more cases turned positive, pushing up Mohali district’s tally to 56, the highest in Punjab.The source of infection of the tricity’s first fatality, a 65-year-old Nayagaon man who died on March 31, also remains a mystery even though 35 of his contacts were traced.On April 7, the reports of another 78-year-old from the Mundi Kharar area of Mohali district, a woman, came out positive after her death. Only 15 of her contacts could be traced, of whom two tested positive.Markaz link“We are trying our best to find the primary source, but have not been able to do so,” says Dr Manjit Singh, civil surgeon, Mohali. “ As far as the panch of Dera Bassi is concerned, we are suspecting that he came in contact with a worker who in turn came in contact with one of the attendees of the Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz event at Nizamuddin in Delhi last month, but we have not confirmed this yet,” he adds.Apart from the four, the Panchkula health department is also struggling to trace the source of infection of the a 44-year-old woman living in the city’s Sector 15, who tested positive on Tuesday, following which eight of her family members were also infected.(With inputs from Yuvraj Kaushal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/untraced-sources-of-four-covid-19-patients-in-chandigarh-add-to-authorities-worry/story-HMT9JLVoSlhLDaxMYnjqPK.html
17-04-2020||City||Coronavirus curfew: Two women arrested for attacking councillor in Mohali||Two women of Phase 11, Mohali, were arrested for assault, violating the curfew, and house trespass after they allegedly attacked a councillor on Thursday.The women have been identified as Saroj and Raj Rani and they were booked on the complaint of Congress councillor Jasbir Singh Manku. The women were angry as the councillor did not concede to their demand to give in writing that “they belong to poor families and deserve to be provided ration”.“They said an organisation was distributing ration near Bawa White House in Phase 11 and wanted a vetting from me that they belong to needy families,” said Ward 33 councillor Jasbir Singh Manku.Ignorant of any such condition for ration distribution, Jasbir asked the crowd of about 50 people gathered outside his house in Phase 9 to let him talk to the NGO people. “The women entered my house and Raj Rani held my hand while Saroj slapped me before leaving after issuing threats,” Jasbir said in his complaint to the police.“We have arrested the women and sent them to jail,” said Amandeep Singh, station house officer of Phase 11, Mohali. The women have been booked under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life)NAYAGAON MAN BOOKED FOR FALSE ‘OUT OF RATION’ ALARM A resident of Dashmesh Nagar in Nayagaon, Sanjay, was booked under the Disaster Management Act for making a false call to the police control room on Wednesday that his family has run out of food. The information was shared with naib tehsildar Jaskaran Singh Brar, who sent volunteers of an NGO to the family and they found around 30kg flour, rice, dal stocked in the house. A report was sent to Kharar SDM Himashu Jain on whose directions, a case was registered against Sanjay. The entire process was video graphed.“The district administration is fully committed to provide the essentials to the genuinely needy. It is imperative and our primary duty,” said Mohali DC Girish Dayalan, adding ”raising fake alarms regarding non-availability of ration in this hour of crisis is not just morally wrong but also a punishable offence”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-curfew-two-women-arrested-for-attacking-councillor-in-mohali/story-WKLLoNvO83wat9ezdEJaeK.html
17-04-2020||Chandigarh||A day after warning, Chandigarh parks wear a deserted look||A day after the UT adviser took to Twitter to issue a stern warning of exposing ‘VIPs’ found walking in parks amid curfew, the parks in the city on Thursday wore a deserted look.The houses of notable bureaucrats from Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh and judges of Punjab and Haryana high court are located in the northern sectors of the city. The reaction from adviser Manoj Parida was a result of the fact that police personnel on the lookout for violators in city parks were facing difficulty in handling VIPs, who would indulge in name-calling and resort to threats if stopped from taking walks.This Hindustan Times correspondent visited the Bougainvillea Garden in Sector 2, Shanti Kunj Garden and Rose Garden in Sector 17, areas of Sector 39 that are frequented by Punjab ministers and bureaucrats. Police presence was noted in the area and a few persons found walking were being let off after a warning.On Thursday, police rounded up 359 and arrested nine persons in seven cases of curfew violation by stepping out of the house for a walk or without wearing a mask.Since April 10, the police have arrested 156 walkers in 40 cases, and more than 800 persons have been let off after a warning including bureaucrats from Punjab and Haryana. Yesterday alone, six persons were arrested for stepping out of their house and 347 were rounded up. Station house officers (SHOs) at police stations have been directed to click pictures of those violating curfew orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/a-day-after-warning-chandigarh-parks-wear-a-deserted-look/story-6rxywpxUq5CbXeEaBTeKXN.html
17-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh SSP orders rest for 20% force on rotational basis||To ensure that contact among police personnel is minimised and to prevent them from getting fatigued, the Chandigarh Police has directed station house officers (SHOs) and deputy superintendents of police (DSPs) of three sub-divisions to give rest to 20% of the force deployed in the field.The orders issued by senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nilambari Jagadale state, “All SHOs and DSPs will give rest to 20% force on a rotation basis so they can rest even with such a hectic schedule.” She said officers concerned will send a list of personnel who have been given rest. The order, however, bars or restricts members of the force from leaving the station or city. Since the lockdown was turned into a curfew, prohibitory orders were made more stringent. “More than 2,500 police personnel deployed in the city are not only maintaining law and order, but are also helping provide food and ration to the needy. Non-stop duty puts them at risk of fatigue and more prone to infection,” said Jagadale. She added that a rotation policy will be followed so that the entire force gets adequate rest.So far there is no scheduled rest in place for SHOs and DSPs of Chandigarh Police. ADDITIONAL FORCE DEPLOYEDAccording to police records, the south sub-division has been provided with an additional force of 150, while the central and east sub-divisions have been provided with 100 personnel each. Additionally, specialised investigators posted with the economic offences wing, vigilance, crime branch, PO summon staff, women police station, cyber cell, deputy district attorney, police lines, intelligence unit and police headquarter have been asked to do field duties.Police have identified 56 entry points that connect Chandigarh to Panchkula and Mohali; of these, 18 have been sealed. The remaining 38 points are patrolled by the police round the clock and incoming traffic is being checked.A special team to screen field officials is carrying out regular health checks. So far, at least 10 police personnel have been quarantined due to various reasons, of which most have rejoined active duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-ssp-orders-rest-for-20-force-on-rotational-basis/story-K1Axq6pIV7Zm6b1zw2K01L.html
17-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra virus tally crosses 3,000; city’s count 2,073||India’s worst-hit state, Maharashtra, crossed a grim mark of 3,000 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases on Thursday, with the addition of 286 new infections. The state, which accounts for a fourth of the country’s tally, has so far reported 3,202 cases and 194 deaths, including seven on Thursday.The state’s capital, Mumbai, which is the country’s most affected city, saw 177 more patients on Thursday, taking its tally past 2,000 to 2,073, and reported three deaths. The city’s death toll is now 117. The other four deaths were from Pune. The state government said that there was a drop in the rate of doubling of cases and an increase in the number of patients recovering. The state government has also started planning to relax lockdown restrictions in about half its districts from next week, by allowing industrial operations and intra-district movements.Of the day’s deaths, four of them were above 60 years of age, while the remaining were above 40 years. Six had underlying ailments, including diabetes, heart ailment, asthma and high blood pressure, read a statement released by the state health department. The state has conducted 56,673 tests at various public and private facilities, and has marked 297 active containment zones. A total of 5,664 survey teams, comprising doctors and assisting staff, have screened more than 20.50 lakh people. A total of 300 patients have been discharged from hospitals, while 71,076 people in the state are home quarantined and 6,108 are under institutional quarantine.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the rate of doubling of cases has improved to 5.5 days, from 2 and 3.5 days a few days ago. “We expect to improve it further. It is true that the mortality rate in the state is high at 7%, but it’s owing to comorbid issues in patients. 83% deaths are related to underlying ailments such as diabetes, and ailments related to heart and kidney. We have also formed a task force of experts to suggest measures to minimise the death rate and clinical management of Covid-19 patients who are critically ill,” he said.He said that the percentage of patients being discharged after recovery has increased. “Our focus on expediting the recovery has been reaping fruits as the rate of discharged patients has increased. 300 patients have been discharged so far,” he said. The minister said that only 2.5% of the 51,000 tests conducted turned positive.He said that six more labs are expected to be added to the existing 36 laboratories. “We are expecting approval from the ICMR to our proposal of pool-testing rapid testing,” he said. He said that all 1,400 people from Maharashtra, who had attended the international congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi, have been traced, quarantined and tested. “Only 50 of them are diagnosed with Covid-19, the rest are kept in quarantine facilities,” he said.The state government is also planning to relax the lockdown restriction in the state from April 20. The relaxation will, however, be in the non-affected areas and limited only to the essential services, industries and agriculture sectors by strict following of the lockdown norms. Tope clarified that no public gathering will be allowed nor will educational institutions, such as school and colleges, be allowed to function.The state government is also planning to increase the workforce in government offices to 33%, according to the Central government. In a video conference on Thursday, top-level officials held discussion on the guidelines by the Central government. “Based on the notification issued by the Centre, we have already included a few auxiliary sectors in exempted essential activities. The districts with no Covid-19 patients or less than 15 patients can have more relaxed lockdown restrictions,” said an official on the condition of anonymity.There are seven districts with no patients and four other districts, where rural parts are unaffected. These districts will get maximum relief although all the activities will be within the district boundaries, which have been sealed. The districts with less than 15 patients are expected to get relief in unaffected areas. However the most affected areas, mostly governed by municipal corporations, will continue with the strict implementation of lockdown, said the official.Industries minister Subhash Desai said the state government was considering to allow industrial operations in at least 20 districts, which have either no case or very few cases from April 20. “Following the Centre’s guidelines for the second phase of lockdown and by using our own powers, we are preparing a proposal to begin industrial operations in some districts. The industrial units, following the standard operating procedures (SOP) laid down and making arrangements for their employees, would be allowed to commence operations,” he said. The minister said that the industrial units will have to make arrangements for the shelter and transportation of workers. According to officials, the state government has planned to begin operations of at least 60% MSMEs by the end of the month.Palghar district in MMR saw a sudden spurt in cases over the past few days after a 3-year old daughter of brick workers and two intern doctors tested positive for the virus. “We have 75 patients, including 62 in Vasai-Virar, who have tested positive. Its spread in remote areas is a matter of worry for us. All contacts of the doctors who tested positive are being traced. Our priority is containment of the spread, for which we have identified five hotspots,” said Kailash Shinde, Palghar collector.According to officials from the state government, the doubling rate of cases is a little over five days. “Our aim is to contain it at that rate, if not improved, immediately. Endeavours are put in to ensure that the doubling rate does not drop below 4. In such a scenario, the condition can be said to be under control. Our major concern is areas like Dharavi and Worli, where the number of patients are rising rapidly. But with full focus on these areas, we expect it to be contained soon,” the officer said.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former education minister Vinod Tawde, while attacking the state government for suppressing the freedom of press by arresting a journalist, has also criticised its failure in handling the Covid-19 pandemic. Tawde said that journalists are being booked to cover government failures in handling the Bandra crowding incident on Tuesday. “A journalist of a Marathi channel was arrested, holding him responsible for the crowding of migrants outside Bandra station. In fact, it was a failure of the government and the action against the journalist was just to cover its own failure in handling law and order. The state government has also failed to handle the pandemic effectively. It has not even done adequate financial arrangements to combat the outbreak,” he said in a video statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-virus-tally-crosses-3-000-city-s-count-2-073/story-XyOvp8rommgIulECoqOXtL.html

17-04-2020||Gurugram||Three held with 107 kg marijuana; were waiting for lockdown to end||The police on Tuesday arrested two men allegedly in possession of 107 kilograms of marijuana (ganja), estimated to be valued at least ₹50 lakh, from a housekeeping shop in Udyog Vihar. One of their suppliers, a Bangladeshi national, was arrested from Delhi on Wednesday. According to the police, the gang was active in Delhi-NCR and its members allegedly sold smaller consignments of 10 kilograms each to drug peddlers for potential sale to people. The police said the crime branch of Sikanderpur had received a tip that the men had been hiding in a housekeeping shop in Udyog Vihar, following which the police raided the premises and arrested Rajan Kumar, 34, from Samastipur (Bihar) and Abhishek Kumar, 19, from West Champaran (Bihar).A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that during questioning, the men revealed that they had sourced the marijuana in a mini truck from two suppliers in Delhi on March 18, a few days before the nationwide lockdown was announced to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “They had been peddling drugs for over two months. They planned to wait for the lockdown to end and then supply the consignment to several suppliers in the city. Due to frequent police patrols, their movement within the city had been restricted,” the police officer said, adding that several bags packed with the marijuana packets were confiscated from the shop. One of their alleged suppliers, identified as Nur Islam alias Dada from Bangladesh, was arrested by a police team on Wednesday from Delhi Cantonment area. The police said the main kingpin of the gang, who used to source the narcotics from Odisha, was yet to be arrested. The men were produced in a district court on Thursday and sent to police custody for one day. A case was registered against them under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at Udyog Vihar police station, the police said.In August 2019, the city police had arrested four men in possession of 54 kilograms of marijuana, while they were trying to peddle the consignment. The marijuana had been procured from Odisha and smuggled into the city in a truck. The police said that they were investigating if this week’s arrests had any link to the supply chain network of the arrests made last year as both consignments had been procured from Odisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-held-with-107-kg-marijuana-were-waiting-for-lockdown-to-end/story-R9ZxDfHcC2DetQeMEPuzJM.html
17-04-2020||Delhi||Security guard blamed for Defence Colony coronavirus cases tests negative||A security guard employed by a Defence Colony family, three members of which tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19) and of whom one died, has tested negative for the virus.This comes days after the Delhi Police registered a first information report (FIR) against the security guard, on the family’s complaint, for allegedly hiding information about visiting the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin in March.Three members of the family had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 9 and were shifted to a private hospital. On Wednesday, one of the family members died. The guard and his family have been placed in home quarantine at their Okhla residence, after his sample was taken for testing at RML Hospital. Two senior RML Hospital doctors confirmed that the security guard tested negative for Covid-19.Bhavreen Kandhari, a resident of Defence Colony, has been in touch with the security guard since the incident. Kandhari said, “He had called me on Thursday morning to inform that he has tested negative for Covid-19. He was very disturbed, as the family had to suffer a lot due to what has happened. He said they were starving in quarantine.”Major (retired) Ranjit Singh, the president of Defence Colony residents’ welfare association (RWA), said, “Earlier, the police and the government told us that the man has tested positive. If now, they are saying that his test result is negative, then it is for the authorities to answer. We are taking the usual precautions in our neighbourhood anyway.”A senior police official said that an FIR was filed on the basis of the statement given by the members of the family, who had employed the security guard, and other employees, who had said that the guard had informed them about his visit to the Nizamuddin Markaz. Also, the guard had his duty after the three members of his employer’s family were found positive with Covid-19 and a technical probe confirmed his presence near the Markaz.“Our investigation is still in progress. Moreover, neither the guard nor anybody else has been arrested in the case. The family has told us that only the guard had been visiting their house,” the officer said, adding that the guard was ill and they sent him to quarantine at his Okhla residence. A senior police officer privy to the case said that registering an FIR does not mean the person has been held guilty. “The investigation will tell us who infected the members of the Defence Colony family. The investigators will question the family members again to find how they were infected. A charge sheet will be filed accordingly,” the officer said.There were reports that one of the family members had a foreign travel history. When the police were asked about it when three members tested Covid-19 positive, they said the family members had already got themselves medically examined after the person returned to India around one-and-a-half month ago. Their medical reports confirmed that they were not positive with Covid-19 at that time, the police had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/guard-blamed-for-def-col-cases-tests-negative/story-2W3iSwoziJsKlxxVl88kGI.html

17-04-2020||City||Stricter norms likely in Delhi after food rider tests Covid-19+||A day after a food delivery person working for a Malviya Nagar restaurant tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) -- leading to residents of at least 72 households being put under home quarantine -- the city administration is scrambling to put in place rules and standard operating procedures to ensure proper safety norms for local delivery firms and stand-alone restaurants in the Capital.While larger food delivery chains and essential supplies providers have strict processes to ensure the safety of their deliveries, smaller firms may fall below the radar, senior civic officials said, highlighting the need for standardised norms.“This incident shows that modalities should be chalked out under which the employer must issue fitness certificates to all its delivery persons and other staff at least once a week after proper health checks,” said BM Mishra, district magistrate of the south Delhi district, from where the case emerged. “All our Covid containment efforts will go in vain if there is no safety mechanism for the thousands of delivery persons operating in the city,” he added.Other district magistrates also called for protocols to be put in place. One district magistrate said that “if rules are laid down, people will have clear directions on what to do”; while Central Delhi district magistrate Nidhi Srivastava said the “daily temperature screening of all workers should be mandatory in these outlets”.Police on Thursday said that the man was an employee of Box 8, and the pizza was from the kitchen of the adjoining restaurant MOJO Pizza, also located in the same building. Police said that apart from serving its own menu, Box 8 has a tie-up with multiple food chains. In a statement on its official Twitter account on Thursday, Box 8 said: “After all precautions and vigilance, in an unfortunate turn of events, a delivery partner of our Malviya Nagar kitchen in south Delhi has tested Covid positive yesterday….The delivery partner has been keeping well and getting the required medical attention. All his co-workers have been quarantined and we have shut down the Malviya Nagar kitchen in South Delhi for the next 14 days.” Mishra, the South Delhi DM, said the delivery person had not been feeling well for nearly a month and had visited several hospitals. “He had a cough but some hospitals had dismissed it as common flu. But when he didn’t recover, he went to Safdarjung Hospital for a check-up from where he was referred to RML. He tested positive for Covid-19 on April 14,” said Mishra.Government officials said at least 16 employees and the owner of Box 8 have been put under institutional quarantine in Chhatarpur. The delivery person, who tested positive on April 14, is at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur for treatment.Larger firms involved in aggregated food delivery and chain restaurants said they were already following strict guidelines and the norms for their staff were assiduously enforced.Domino’s Pizza, a food chain, said it was the first company to start the “zero contact delivery” to contain the spread of the virus and that it was taking several other precautionary measures. “We would like to reassure all our customers that in these uncertain times, we are taking all possible precautions to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and customers. As a rule, all our Safe Delivery Experts are 100% company employees and are following heightened sanitisation and hygiene protocols in all our restaurants. All employees in the stores are being temperature screened every day and they follow a mandatory hourly hand wash protocol for a minimum of 20 seconds. We are deep sanitising our restaurants as well as delivery bikes, boxes and pizza hot bags every 4 hours. Besides, we have moved all our deliveries to Zero Contact Delivery thereby avoiding any physical contact with the customer. Additionally, all our Safe Delivery Experts are wearing gloves and masks to ensure the safety of our customers,” it said in a statement. Food delivery aggregator Zomato said orders delivered by the restaurants directly were sometimes placed on the Zomato platform and it was not sure if this delivery person had delivered any such orders while he was infected.“At Zomato’s end, we are leaving no stone unturned to make sure that our customers, our delivery partners, and our restaurant partners are safe. Covid-19 could happen to anyone - and it is near impossible for all of us to completely isolate ourselves, especially when we need outside support for essentials such as food... We believe that none of our riders should and would knowingly keep working if they knew they were infected with Covid-19,” the company said in a statement.Another food delivery platform, Swiggy, said it regularly shared guidelines on best practices with its delivery partners. “We regularly send reminders to our delivery partners on best practices of respiratory hygiene, proper method and frequency of washing hands, as well as identification of associated symptoms. A series of videos capturing pertinent details shot in multiple languages are being circulated as a ready reckoner. We have also started the distribution of N95 masks to all our delivery partners in the affected cities, free of cost,” the company said in a statement. There are least 25,000 food delivery persons in the national Capital, estimates the RedSeer consulting firm. The number of active riders, however, has gone down after the Covid outbreak and the nationwide lockdown, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/72-houses-quarantined-as-delivery-boy-tests-positive/story-GqdMBjS9RybSkjDIdrogwJ.html

17-04-2020||Noida||People under government quarantine allege misbehaviour by officials||Four people, suspected of being infected by Covid-19 and currently under isolation at two government-run quarantine centres in Greater Noida, on Thursday complained of misbehaviour by officials, delay in food and unhygienic conditions under which they are being forced to lived. A 42-year-old domestic help of two Ceasefire employees is under quarantine along with her family for the past 13 days and has been waiting for her test reports for Covid-19.“I have been kept under quarantine at the Galgotias hostel along with my daughter while my husband and son are at the Kasna centre. Whenever we go to ask for our reports, we are shooed away rudely. The premises and rooms where we live in are very dirty. Food comes very late and nothing is given for breakfast, except tea. I just want to know the reports so that we can leave. It is difficult to live like this for so many days,” said the 42-year-old domestic help, who worked at the houses of two Ceasefire employees in sector 93.The woman lives with her family in Gheja village of Noida in Sector 93. “The staff over here have not addressed any of our queries. It’s been 13 days and our test reports are yet to come. We just want to know if we can go home . I worked at houses of people who worked with Ceasefire company in sector 135. We were brought here on April 4,” the domestic help told HT over the phone..The district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar said he had received complaints regarding the cleanliness of the premises at the Galgotias hostel, but the issue has been resolved. “I received complaints and we sent the chief development officer to look into the matter. The cleaning has already started. As far as a complaint regarding food is concerned, I will have to cross check that. If there is any issue then it will be resolved,” said Suhas LY, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate.The teenager son of the woman is at the Kasna quarantine centre, along with his physically challenged father. “My father is in another room. My mother and sister are at Galgotias. Life is very difficult under such circumstances. We want to go home if our results are negative, but no official is ready to give us any feedback. When we ask for food, we are shouted at,” said the 15-year-old boy.“There are many reports which are pending because load has been increasing on laboratories tackling Covid-19 tests. Most of these delayed reports had gone to the Aligarh Muslim University, which is facing a lot of pressure following increase in number of sampling. We are also waiting for their reports and they will be informed as soona s we have them. Now, National Institute of Biologicals in Noida is also conducting tests, so the pressure has eased a little. But their reports were sent to AMU. One lab has already started functioning at the Government Institute of Medical Sceinces and another will be ready soon at the Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute,” district magistrate Suhas said..The daughter of the domestic help said that the cleaning staff was on leave following which the premises had become very dirty. “The cleaning staff wasn’t coming to clean our rooms or the premises. When we asked, we were told to mind our own business. There is no fixed timing for lunch and dinner here,” said the 23-year-old woman.The district magistrate said, “Few of the cleaning staff at Galgotias had gone on leave but now they have been replaced by others. Only once, some food related issue had come up and it has been resolved.

17-04-2020||Noida||Noida: Migrants leave rented houses, shift to slums amid lockdown 2.0||Working as a construction labourer in Noida, despite being a Delhi University commerce graduate, Pawan Ahirwar says life and survival have become all the more tougher during the lockdown.With no work or income, the stranded migrant from Chhatarpur, Madhya Pradesh, who once aspired for a job suited for a DU graduate, can no longer afford even the one-room apartment in Noida’s industrial sector where he lived. Abhishek had no other option but to shift to a slum cluster at Sector 66 with his family.“The lockdown might just be extended again and there is no guarantee of work. I have a wife to look after, and I belong to a landless farming family. What other option do I have? Shifting to a slum will cut my costs. At least I’m spared the tension of paying rent for my apartment at Sector 67,” Ahirwar, who got his BCom degree from PGDAV College, DU, last year, said. With his meagre savings, Ahirwar has to look after his parents in the village and also support the education of his wife Vineeta who is pursuing her BEd from a private college in Greater Noida.Pawan is not alone in facing such adversity, as almost every slum cluster around the industrial area comprising sectors 63, 62, 66, 67 and others is seeing such new shanties or jhuggis being constructed by stranded families from MP, Bihar, Jharkhand and even the remotest villages of Uttar Pradesh. Some of these families had earlier left slums to move to comparatively cleaner and better localities, however, they had to return as the lockdown changed their priorities from ‘quality life’ to ‘sustenance’.Anticipating another extension of the lockdown, migrant labourers consider the slum a better choice, even as they compromise on hygiene, water and electricity and live in fear of being shooed away by the administration.“I had been renting a room for ₹3,500 a month in Garhi Chaukhadi where I live with my wife. I did not get the salary for March and the chances look bleak for April as well. Our landlord waived the rent for March, but who knows how long the lockdown will continue? Do you think he will keep waiving rent as long as the lockdown continues? My wife and I had to shift back here last week as we had lived here a few years ago, but the circumstances have changed,” Abhishek Singh, a migrant worker from Nawabganj, Farukhabad district, who made a tenement at a cluster in Sector 67, and worked at a garment factory in Sector 63, said.Sarlaya Kumar, another migrant daily wager who hails from Khaddipur village in Hardoi district, moved to a slum cluster in Sector 67 from Khanpur, Delhi, where he used to rent a two-room house he shared with another family. While the other family went back home during the exodus, he preferred to shift to this slum.“The jhuggi I’m living in now belonged to a friend who left for his village. The family I lived with and the friend had some land as well as the promise of work during the harvest season; I didn’t. So, I had to stay back and made affordable living arrangements,” Kumar, who manages to make ₹150 to ₹350 on a normal day, said. According to the officials, people have an option to stay at shelter homes until the situation returns to normal. There are over 20 such facilities across the district that offer food, accommodation and medical facilities.“We will look into the matter; people don’t have to leave their houses. There are facilities for shelter homes, and anyone in crisis can go there as those facilities are meant for them,” Praveen Mishra, additional chief executive officer, Noida authority, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-migrants-leave-rented-houses-shift-to-slums/story-QnXDjOZd8evsH1MonPJPRO.html
17-04-2020||Delhi||In times of a pandemic, Delhi Police go mask and glove to nab criminals||On Wednesday, after Delhi Police’s special cell finally managed to nab 32-year-old Bijender alias Gadgu, who was wanted for several crimes — including murder — and carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh, the first thing they did was give the man a mask and a pair of surgical gloves.Bijender is a hitman of Karambir alias Kala’s gang, which operates in Delhi-NCR, and is involved in killings over land grabbing, personal enmity and gang rivalry.On way to the court, Bijender wore the mask and surgical gloves, while armed police officers maintained a radial distance of at least 5-6 feet from the suspect.The law does not allow policemen to handcuff an arrested person, unless there is a court order. So police personnel usually grab the hands of the arrested suspects to ensure they do not escape. As the number of police personnel with symptoms of Covid-19 continues to rise, police officers working on the ground have had to adopt different techniques to ensure that they do not catch the virus. The city’s criminals, too, have realised the importance of social distancing and have in some instances asked police not to hold their hands while promising that they will not escape, many police officers said.The city’s police force — from ensuring social distancing norms are followed to conducting security checks on the roads and the hotspots across the city — have been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19 pandemic that is raging in Delhi at the moment. Till Thursday, Delhi had recorded 1,640 Covid-19 positive cases with 38 deaths.Till Thursday evening, at least seven Delhi police personnel had tested positive for Covid-19, while around 261 others were in home-quarantine. A senior police officer, however, said that the seven cops who had tested positive had not been infected by anyone they had arrested. A police station in Chandni Mahal was also sealed later in the day after two cops tested positive.A senior police officer said that around 25-30% of police officers in each police station are already on leave. With the crime rates falling, the officers were advised to go on leave but to be prepared to join duty if the numbers continues to increase. With a number of healthcare workers on home quarantine after catching the infection, earlier this week the Delhi government had decided to deploy post-graduate medical students to help the district health authorities. Delhi chief secretary, Vijay Dev had issued an order in this regard.A crime branch officer, who did not wish to be named, said the city’s criminals seem to have realised the do’s and dont’s related to Covid-19 and request police personnel not to hold their hands. They even ask if the lock-up has been sanitised because police station lockups, usually a single cell, is shared by several people.“At least three such criminals, who we arrested in the last five days, requested us not to hold their hands. They promised us they will not try to run. We stood in a circle around the suspects, while maintaining a distance of 5-6 feet. One such photograph also went viral on social media later. I was also told that a man arrested for snatching in outer Delhi on Wednesday asked the station in charge if the lock-up had been sanitised,” the officer said.At places such as Chandi Mahal and Nizamuddin, which have been declared hotspots for Sars-Cov-2 infection, police personnel have also been given Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said, “Apart from sanitation masks and hand sanitisers, those deployed in containment zones have been given Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits. They also regularly disinfect and sanitise the PPE kits before using it again.”Sanjeev Yadav, who is the DCP of the special cell, said that apart from social distancing at work, the force are following all guidelines during raids, transporting suspects to courts or jails and while keeping the arrested in the police stations lock-ups.“The raiding team members wear masks, hand gloves, and use sanitisers before and after they physically nab the suspect. Social distancing is maintained during interrogation as well. The lock-up is properly sanitised before locking the suspect. Following precautionary guidelines is the most important thing to avoid getting infected from Covid-19,” he addedOn preparedness in the backdrop of police personnel testing positive for the virus,additional commissioner of police, Mandeep Randhawa, who is the city’s police’s spokesperson said, “We have advised all our personnel to be cautious on duty. All police stations have been provided with masks and surgical gloves. We have managed our resources well. With fewer crimes, around 25-30% of the force are on rest. They can also join anytime if the need arises. Our police commissioner also issued a message for everyone on the field on the ways to ensure social distancing. We have enough police personnel in this fight against Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-times-of-a-pandemic-delhi-police-go-mask-and-glove-to-nab-criminals/story-2CL5EjujlvaQfDZULtoBWM.html
17-04-2020||Delhi||Admin says those gathered on Yamuna plains were local homeless not migrants||A day after 700 people had gathered on the Yamuna floodplains in search of shelter, the district administration said they were not migrant workers but homeless people who remain in that area, especially during summer. While some of whom were later shifted to various shelter homes by local authorities, others continued to take shelter under a flyover on the banks of the Yamuna on Thursday as well. The local authorities had swung into action after several media outlets ran a photo showing hundreds of people under a flyover on Yamuna floodplains. District magistrate (Central) Nidhi Srivastava said nearly 3,000 people have been relocated from Yamuna Pushta and Chandni Chowk. “They are not migrant workers but mostly the homeless who remain in the surrounding areas of different shelter homes. They move in groups and during the lockdown, most of them congregated near the Yamuna to carry out their daily needs (bathing, washing etc.) When they came to know that they were being watched, many of them moved to Chandni Chowk area,” Srivastava said.She also suggested that many of the homeless abused substances. “Around 18 shelters across different districts have been set up for them. Apart from providing food and shelter, the government will soon introduce rehabilitation facilities in these shelters for patients of substance abuse,” Srivastava said. Bipin Rai, member, DUSIB, which is the nodal agency for shelters, however, said many of those seen in pictures and videos put out by media outlets were those who live in rented rooms and railway sheds nearby. “Since they did not have a proper home, they came out to the floodplains, which is cooler than other areas during the day. We have shifted most of these people,” he said.Social activists, who had visited the floodplains, did not agree with the administration. “I had visited Yamuna Pushta on Wednesday. Not all of them could be local homeless. The place is close to the Kashmere Gate bus terminal and has two railway stations in the vicinity, which is the reason why they gathered on the floodplains, since they had nowhere else to go,” Indu Prakash Singh, member of the Supreme Court-appointed state-level shelter monitoring committee, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/admin-says-those-gathered-on-yamuna-plains-were-local-homeless-not-migrants/story-odec7yj4zHZYO8I3x13keN.html
17-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s PDS distribution far from enough to alleviate hunger||The ongoing distribution of wheat and pulses under centre’s public distribution system (PDS) is not enough to mitigate hunger among thousands of poor affected by the Covid-19 lockdown in Chandigarh.Those affected say that a substantial fraction of the poor are not given the ration because they are not enrolled with the local food and supplies department for free ration.PDS beneficiaries get 5kg wheat per month per member and 1kg pulses per month per family. The UT administration, through 11 teams, is distributing three months of ration in one go in line with the central government’s directions.AFFECTED POPULACE MORE THAN REGISTERED BENEFICIARIESUT administration figures reveal that 63,616 beneficiary families are eligible for ration distribution, whereas, according to industrial bodies, the city has over 1.25 lakh labourers, who along with their families, are struggling due to scarce resources.Former mayor and Maloya colony councillor Rajesh Kumar Kalia said the second phase of the lockdown will be much more severe on the unemployed daily wagers, as whatever stock of ration they could manage before the lockdown will be exhausted. “Distribution of cooked food is not a permanent solution. We need a little compassion from the administration in terms of ration distribution to people outside the enrolment list,” he said.Kanwaljeet Singh Rana, councillor from Sector 45, said in his ward, only 2,500 people got the ration under PDS, while at least 10,000 were bereft of it. “We are trying to give them cooked food, but that is not an effective solution,” he added. On Thursday, the administration distributed ration in Bapudham Colony near Sector 26. During distribution, councillor Dalip Sharma appealed to the beneficiaries to share the supplies. Chanderwati Shukla, councillor of Sectors 43 and 52, where over 10,000 migrant families live, said, “There are people who got over one quintal of wheat under PDS, then there are those who don’t have anything at all. Such inequality must be addressed before it causes unrest among the underprivileged,” she said.‘INVOLVE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, TEMPORARY RATION CARDS’Dr Rajesh Gill, professor of sociology at Panjab University, said the situation was definitely alarming, as snatching of livelihoods had pushed thousands into starvation. “We don’t know how long it will be before the economy revives. As India has sufficient stock of food grain, we need to devise a mechanism to reach out to non-PDS beneficiaries,” she said.She said local councillors could identify such people and issue them temporary ration cards till the lockdown was in place. “Quick mapping of poor is possible in a small territory like Chandigarh,” she said.Teachers in PU’s economics and public administration departments also emphasised the need for effective distribution of cooked food among the needy, something where UT was struggling even three weeks after lockdown.UT secretary, food supplies and consumer affairs, Vinod P Kavle, could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-pds-distribution-far-from-enough-to-alleviate-hunger/story-zqvzi15t3sduyxHCAO9heO.html

I will go back as joint director, directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) tomorrow (Friday). Since September last year, when I took charge as dean at Sassoon, I have always worked hard to ensure that hospital remains ahead in offering treatment to needy patients. During these difficult times as well, I have offered my best,” Dr Chandanwale said. Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar, confirming the transfer, said, “Dr Chandanwale was holding the position of joint director and in view of the prevailing conditions, he has been asked to report to that position.”Sassoon is testing swab samples from Satara, Ahmednagar and Nashik, in addition to Pune. To minimise the mortality rate in Pune, the state government has constituted a task force under Professor (medicine) Dileep Kadam.On Thursday, four deaths due to Covid-19 were recorded in Pune city, all from Sassoon General Hospital. The first Covid-19 patient admitted at Sassoon General hospital, a 42-year-old male, was discharged from the hospital. He was admitted on March 31 and is from Parvati. His second test came back negative on Thursday.Amongst the deceased, was of a 65-year-old female who had type 1 respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome, due to Covid-19. She was admitted on April 3.The second causalty is a 54-year-old male admitted on April 13, and had myocarditis with acute kidney injury, also with acute respiratory failure.Similarly, the third patient to die is a 55-year-old female, admitted on April 14, with acute respiratory failure and pneumonia due to Covid-19.The fourth deceased patient is a 47-year-old female admitted on April 9, who died due to myocarditis and respiratory failure.With inputs from Dheeraj Bengrut||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dean-of-city-s-covid-19-treatment-hub-sassoon-hospital-transferred-by-state-government/story-De1VtSvWlnv1hrH6j44pVN.html
17-04-2020||Delhi||Chandni Mahal police station shut after cops test positive; 2 ASIs in north Delhi get disease||The Chandni Mahal police station in central Delhi was sealed on Thursday after two constables posted there tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. Along with this, at least 26 other police personnel, including the station house officer, were quarantined there too. This is the first police station in the Capital to be sealed. Chandni Mahal was earlier declared a containment zone by the state government that placed severe restrictions on its residents, after many tested positive for the disease.Deputy commissioner of police[DCP] (central) Sanjay Bhatia said that the two constables lived in the barracks inside the station because of which such an action was necessitated. Bhatia said the other police personnel of the station will now be working from the nearby Jama Masjid police station. The constables, both in their 40s, were taken to Max Hospital, Saket for treatment.ASIs test positiveTwo assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) with the Delhi Police tested positive for Covid-19 in north Delhi.One ASI tested positive after his wife, a nurse at the Lok Nayak Hospital that is a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, contracted the disease. The hospital, however, maintains that she did not get the disease from there. Police are still to determine how the second ASI officer contracted the disease. The first ASI officer lived in Model Town’s Police Colony. His 21-year-old son too tested positive. Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west), said that the ASI was posted with the provision and logistics department and that his duty profile did not require him to have much contact with his colleagues.The ASI was on a medical leave for a few weeks and that was extended once his wife fell ill. His wife was shifted to Lok Nayak Hospital’s isolation ward for treatment.“The ASI’s wife tested positive last week. The ASI and his two sons went into quarantine as per protocol and got themselves tested. On Monday, the ASI and a son tested positive,” said the DCP. The duo have been moved to Lok Nayak Hospital too, while the son has been home quarantined. “Ever since the lockdown, the couple had not been interacting with their neighbours, maintaining social distancing. So, it is unlikely that their neighbours were infected because of them. But we are investigating all possible contacts,” said Arya. An official from Lok Nayak hospital said that the nurse did not contract the disease from the hospital but could not confirm from where she eventually got it from. “Two of our nurses were diagnosed with Covid-19 and they might have got it from outside the hospital -- one of them lived in a containment zone and the other lived close to a quarantine centre,” said the official. On Wednesday, a doctor from the hospital also tested positive for the infection. The doctor worked in the high-risk Covid-19 ICU.The other ASI lived with his wife and four children in North Delhi’s Burari and was posted as the persona security officer with a private doctor. He had become symptomatic last week and was tested. Santosh Kumar Meena, deputy commissioner of police (security), said that it was unlikely that the ASI’s association with the doctor had anything to do with him contacting the virus. “The doctor and others known to the doctor have not tested positive for the virus. The policeman told us that a scrap dealer had visited his house. We don’t yet know how the policeman contracted the disease,” said Meena. The ASI was found positive on Tuesday and was moved to Lok Nayak Hospital on Wednesday. “His wife and four children have been home quarantined and their test results are awaited,” said Meena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chandni-mahal-police-station-shut-after-cops-test-positive-2-asis-in-north-delhi-get-disease/story-4hY4aYGMxLfbn4JAXKM6pL.html
17-04-2020||Delhi||68 people at Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital quarantined after death of Covid positive patient||At least 68 people at Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital in Pitampura had to be quarantined after a patient who did not reveal her travel history tested positive for Covid-19, and later died during treatment, officials said. Of the 68 quarantined, 20 were doctors, 21 nurses, 15 technicians, and other housekeeping and security staff.Hospital authorities said a 25-year-old woman with an ectopic pregnancy – where the embroyo is attached outside the uterus – underwent a surgery at the hospital on April 13. She did not reveal her travel history and that she had been advised home quarantine by the district authorities.Two days later, her condition deteriorated and she had to be put on ventilator. She later revealed her travel history and contact with Covid-19 positive travellers. She died on Wednesday night.Four of the woman’s family members have been put in quarantine.Meanwhile, a 49-year-old man, under treatment at the Delhi State Cancer Institute, succumbed to the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) late Wednesday. The man was recovering from surgery after a cancerous tumour had been removed from his brain. He is the second patient to have died of Covid-19 at the hospital.He was admitted to the Institute on March 24, after having been operated elsewhere, as his condition was deteriorating. After several members of its staff tested positive for Coronavirus, the hospital shut down all of its services and transferred its patients to private hospitals. The patient who died Wednesday was one of those transferred to Dharmashila hospital, where he and one of his family members had tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2.They were then sent to the Rajiv Gandhi Super-Speciality hospital in Tahirpur, which is a dedicated Covid-19 facility. So far, of the four Covid-19 patients who were admitted to the Institute, two of them have died.Twenty-five of staff members in the hospital have tested positive for the infection, making the hospital a hotspot. The first one to test positive was a 35-year-old doctor of preventive oncology. However, the health department has been unable to pinpoint the source of the infection. Healthcare workers continue to be at a higher risk of contracting the infection, with another doctor from Lok Nayak Hospital testing positive for Covid-19 Wednesday night. He was a PG student from the department of anaesthesia and was working in the Covid-19 intensive care unit of the hospital.Lok Nayak is one of the two dedicated Covid-19 hospitals of the Delhi government. At least 50 people from the hospital have been quarantined after two nurses and the doctor tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/another-patient-dies-at-dsci-25-healthcare-workers-and-four-patients-infected-at-the-hospital/story-gdKRNnntHlCV3mCAtQ0NJM.html
17-04-2020||Delhi||CCTV footage helps arrest three men involved in hit-and-run that killed cycle-riding doctor||Three men were arrested on Thursday for mowing down and killing a cycle-riding doctor in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar on Monday.The 52-year-old doctor, Jai Prakash Yadav, was returning to his home in Greater Kailash-1 in the afternoon when the incident happened. Yadav was posted at an MCD polyclinic in south Delhi’s Mehrauli and served as the south zone’s nodal officer for Covid-19.Surveillance footage from close to the accident site helped police identify the car and thereafter, its occupants: 37-year-old Vijay (identified only by his first name),an assistant at an automobile showroom; and 35-year-olds Ajay (identified only by his first name) and Sandeep Pal Singh, both of whom sold and repaired vehicles.“The three friends have told us that they were driving from their homes in east Delhi’s Mandawali to the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in Vasant Kunj. They are still being questioned.They did not carry any curfew passes to move about during the lockdown and were not into providing any essential service either,” said deputy commissioner of police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur.Another police officer, on condition of anonymity, said that arrested men claimed they were on their way to give blood to a friend admitted in the hospital and that they hit the doctor when he took an unexpected turn. “Each of these claims are yet to be verified,” this officer added.The incident had happened at a traffic junction near the Police Training School in Malviya Nagar. As part of the probe, police obtained surveillance footage from CCTV cameras along the route. None showed the actual accident.However, the doctor’s colleague who had been following him in a car that day had given police a clue: it was a white car.“We checked the footage for all white cars passing on that route around 3.30pm when the accident happened. We found five such white cars,” said Thakur. Armed with the registration numbers of those five cars, the police physically checked the owners of each of them. “One belonged to a man named Sonu in Rohtak. On Wednesday, we visited him and got to know that he had given the car to his friend, Vicky, in Sonepat. Further inquiry revealed that Vicky had let his friend, Sandeep Pal Singh, drive the car. Singh was questioned and he said that he and his two friends, Ajay and Vijay, were driving the car to Vasant Kunj when the accident happened, said the DCP. “All three of them have been arrested and the car - a Maruti Swift - was recovered from Mandawali. It bore the marks of an accident. The men have confessed to being involved in the hit-and-run case,” said the DCP.“The car occupants had driven away without caring to help the injured doctor,” said the DCP. The doctor had later succumbed to his injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cctv-footage-helps-arrest-three-men-involved-in-hit-and-run-that-killed-cycle-riding-doctor/story-i8XyiXxipwnfuMkGhonMuJ.html
17-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi gets nod to start plasma enrichment technique trials||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the Capital has got the Centre’s nod to start trials for plasma enrichment technique, which will begin in the next three to four days. If successful, plasma enrichment can be used to treat seriously ill Covid-19 patients.“We had asked for permission for testing plasma technology (for Covid-19) from the Central government. Today we got the nod for the same… If successful, we can save the lives of seriously ill patients,” Kejriwal said on Thursday.There is currently no cure for Covid-19 and convalescent plasma is an experimental procedure . Plasma enrichment technique entails taking blood plasma from a person who has recovered from Covid-19 as it contains antibodies which, when transfused to a sick patient, can boost immunity and help in recovery.Delhi so far has recorded 1,640 Covid-19 positive cases and 38 deaths.“We are ready to conduct the experiment in the next 3-4 days. The technology, if it turns out to be successful, can increase the chances of saving lives of seriously ill patients. We are likely to get a sense of the results of the trial after another 4-5 days,” the chief minister said.On Wednesday, Delhi’s lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal had said he has advised all the concerned authorities to strictly adhere to a standard operating procedures, guidelines and protocols issued by the Union Health Ministry while dealing with Covid-19 patients. Baijal ahd also mentioned about plasma therapy in a review meeting with the Capital’s health minister and top bureaucrats.Baijal’s office said in a statement: “Delhi to use plasma technique for treatment on a trial basis to save lives of critical Covid-19 patients. Advised all to strictly adhere to SOPs/guidelines & protocols issued by the Union health ministry while dealing with Covid-19 patients.”On April 13, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had sought the participation of researchers for conducting a clinical trial of convalescent plasma therapy to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients and floated a protocol for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-gets-nod-to-start-plasma-enrichment-technique-trials/story-uQYdzOS1SQwKZ1wnt0DgGK.html
17-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: The tempo service that delivers food to at least 2,000 job-less daily-wage earners||Sachin Jadhav, a tempo driver, delivers food packets to the needy who have been affected by the lockdown which is in place to contain the spread of Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection. The food packets are provided by various non-government organisations (NGOs) which is delivered by Swiggy, an online food ordering and delivery platform. He speaks to HT about his role.What is your role in this crisis?Since the lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 many people fled to their villages. I too thought of taking my wife and child to our village near Sangli, but, by then, the lockdown was in effect. There are many people who are daily wage earners who have no source of income during this time of crisis. As a result, they would have to starve without any food coming their way. I have been hired by Swiggy to help deliver the food plates to the people who have no way to buy food for themselves. I pick up the food plates from the designated kitchens and deliver it to the places they ask me to. This way, at least 2,000 people get to eat daily. Though I had no work for the first week, this job came my way and I am happy that I can help those who are worse off than me.How does your day begin and roll out?I live in Bhosari with my seven-year-old son and wife. I start from my home at 9 am. I drive to the kitchen in Hinjewadi that prepares the food for the morning shift. I reach there by 10 am. The food packets are loaded onto my tempo, after which, my job is to deliver it to two sites, Phursungi and Yerawada. I get to the delivery spots where the parcels are offloaded. I generally finish the two sites by 1-1.30 pm. I eat my tiffin that my wife packs for me and then head back to the second kitchen at Balewadi. From this kitchen I have to deliver the food packets to three sites - first to Budhwar peth (500 plates); then I drive to Kondwa where 600 packets are offloaded; and then Yerwada where 200-300 plates are given. After this, around 8pm, I head back home.What precautions are you taking?I’ve bought a face mask, sanitiser and gloves. I wear a mask and gloves especially when the food is being loaded and offloaded since that has a lot of people around. But whilst I am driving and the roads are quite free and I am not at the signal, I let the mask drop. It does tend to get very hot with it. I use the sanitiser when I get in and out of the tempo. When I get home, I take a bath and my clothes are washed. I do not touch anything till I have bathed.What is your assessment of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune? How is it unfolding?I think everyone should do their bit in this fight against Covid-19. Whist I am driving I see some places where people loiter on the streets. I wish they would be more responsible and sit at home instead. This infection is very dangerous and the less we get out of our homes the better. This epidemic is taking its toll not only on human lives, but also on our earnings. The government and non-government organisation (NGOs) are doing their best to provide food to the poor, but people who are daily wagers or who don’t have a job are on very shaky ground. In 15 days, I had work for just eight days. I have an EMI of Rs 9,500 to pay for my tempo. Of course, I get an extension of two months, but the sooner we get out of this Covid-19 the better it will be.What gaps do you see in healthcare and relief work?I think the food delivery system that is being taken up by various agencies is good. People are now getting food, but the real trouble is lack of jobs. The poor can get help from the government or NGOs, but for small-time businessmen like me, it is very hard. We cannot seek help and yet have financial responsibilities. Along with food and temporary shelter the government should think of providing jobs as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-the-frontline-the-tempo-service-that-delivers-food-to-at-least-2-000-job-less-daily-wage-earners/story-h3qBlDBh12QBEqsdhYryRJ.html
17-04-2020||Pune||Stay home, or face action: Pune police chief sends out firm warning||Since the lockdown 2.0 has begun, from April 15, restrictions and rules to fight Covid-19 were expected to evidently become stricter.However, a spot visit to several areas in the city by HT lensmen on Wednesday, revealed busy roads with no social distancing or mask-use in place.Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham, responding to the pictorial evidence, believes this is the exception rather than the rule.“Lockdown rules are very clear and a majority of Punekars, like 99.99 per cent of them, are following the rules and staying at home for the sake of everybody. But, 0.1 per cent of people, do not have respect for other citizens; so, shame on them. We will be very firm and from now onwards; strict action will be taken on such violators by Pune police department,” Venkatesham said on Thursday.“At many places we have taken action where violators were found roaming the roads, which is not acceptable. We will do whatever is required to enforce the lockdown. These people, without any reasons, are coming out on the roads and are likely to spread the disease. Many citizens themselves are objecting to such careless behaviour,” he added.“Why do we need police all the time to tell people to follow the rules, when it is clearly laid out by the government - do not come out and stay at home. I request Punekars to follow all the rules and regulations of lockdown and please stay at home,” Venkatesham said.

This is apart from 74 flu centres already set up across the city, and 35 in areas under PCMC.Pune, as of Thursday, had recorded 46 deaths related to Covid-19, with 442 positive cases. Currently mortality rate in the city stands at 10.40%.Deepak Mhaisekar, divisional commissioner, said, “We have noticed that often senior citizens or people comorbid conditions, like diabetes, hypertension, or any diseases which affect the kidney or liver, go for preliminary treatment and take medicines off the counter. This may suppress the symptoms for a few days, which then come back and worsen the situation. We request every patient who shows any flu-like symptom to directly go the flu centres set up by the local body.”As per data released by the Pune municipal corporation’s (PMC) health department, since March 1, 2.24 lakh citizens have been screened, of which 58,872 patients were found to have flu-like symptoms.However, of these, only 326 were sent to Naidu hospital, and 497 were sent to Sassoon hospital, for the Covid-19 test.Further, data from the PMC’s door-to-door survey, on from March 16 until April 14, reveals a total of 1,483 persons with flu-like symptoms have either been home quarantined, or isolated in hospitals.Thirty of these are in the Naidu hospital, one at the flu centre at Sanas ground, and 15 at the Laygude hospital. An Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR) study, released earlier this week, found that 21 out of 577 patients with severe acute respiratory (SAR) illnesses tested positive for Covid-19 in Pune.Doctors have been emphasising that all symptomatic patients, irrespective of travel history, location or contact with Covid-19-positive person(s), be tested.Dr Avinash Bhondwe, head of the Indian Medical Association’s Maharashtra chapter, said, “More patients with flu-like symptoms need to be tested. There was a case in Panvel when a man tested negative and then died. Many people attended the funeral. The second test results, which came later, showed he tested positive for Covid-19. Since Covid-19 first attacks the respiratory system, all patients with flu-like symptoms must be tested.”Covid Care Centres (CCC) or flu centresThese are institutional quarantine facilities set up in hostels, hotels, guesthouses, lodges, stadiums, banquet halls and schools for high- and low-risk contacts, who are not identified as Covid-19 positive, but need to be kept under observation.Prominent flu centres: • Rakshak Nagar sports centre, Kharadi (70 beds)• Draupdabai Murlidhar Khedekar hospital, Bopodi (50)• Murlidhar Pandurang Laygude hospital, Wadgaon Dhayari (60)• Namdevrao Shivarkar Maternity Centre, Wanowrie (10)• Meenatai Thackeray Maternity Centre, Kondhwa (10)• Sanas Sports Ground hostel (175)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-46-deaths-pune-flu-centres-now-front-line-defence-in-covid-19-attack/story-hF9j39Lcqb0YeuGE4CgeAO.html
17-04-2020||Pune||Aundh, Kothrud among bright spots in Pune’s Covid-19 saga; Shivajinagar, Yerawada demand closer attention||While Bhavani Peth (BP), Dhole Patil Road (DR) and Kasba-Vishrambaugwada (KV) areas have emerged as the three hotspots in Pune city with the highest number of Covid-19 positive cases as of April 16, an analysis of the spread of the disease in the city has brought to light some bright spots too. As of April 15, Bhavani Peth area had 96 positive cases, Dhole Patil Road (48) and Kasba (KV) had 45 cases. Next to the three hotspots of Pune, the two other areas which need closer attention are Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori (YK) and Shivajinagar-Ghole Road (SG), an analysis of 368 positive cases during April 8 to 15 has shown. Both of these areas have shown a rising trend in positive cases in the last eight days with 33 cases in the Yerawada (YK) area and 27 in Shivajinagar (SG) area as of April 15, said data analyst Sahil Deo.Co-founder of a city-based data analysis firm, Deo has been interacting closely with elected representatives and officials while analysing Covid-19 data released by the government on a daily basis and presenting data based insights on the current situation and its socio-economic implications. Data over the last eight days shows that areas such as Kothrud-Bavdhan (KB) and Aundh-Baner (AB) has shown the least number of positive cases in spite of a large concentration of people working in the IT and other industries and travelling abroad for work. While Kothrud had one case, Aundh-Baner had three. “This is in a way very surprising and very good also because areas like Aundh Baner, Kothrud and Bavdhan would have a lot of travellers. In spite of that we don’t see cases there,” said Deo. Significantly, the data shows that the situation in Sinhagad Road (SR), which saw the first two positive cases in Pune and then went up to eight cases, has also been brought under control with the line graph showing a steady flattening. This area had just eight cases as of April 15. Although Warje-Karvenagar (WK) showed a slight rise in positive cases and then flattened in the last three days with a total of nine cases, Deo said the fact that this was still below 10 was not a cause for worry. “Given our population, anything below 10 positive cases in an area would be a bright spot,” he said. The analyst noted that while the number of positive cases were clearly rising in Bhavani Peth followed by Dhole Patil Road; the rise in the number of cases in Kasba-Vishrambaugwada area was not as steep as compared to the first two areas. Yerawada-Kalas Dhanori also needed closer attention from the authorities as the graph was showing a rising trend as compared to the others. Areas which were in the “medium band” and demanded closer attention were Shivajinagar-Ghole Road (SG), Dhankawdi-Sahakarnagar (DS) and Wanawdi-Ramtekdi (WR), he said. The Shivajinagar-Ghole Road area which saw one Covid-19 related death on Wednesday had been showing a rising trend since April 11-12 with a total of 27 cases as of April 15.

Professor Nachiketa Tiwari (IIT Kanpur), and professor Devendra Gupta, in-charge, Covid-19, ICU SGPGIMS, Lucknow have led the innovation.“While the existing N95 respirator does not protect the user if there is an imperfect seal between the mask and the face, as there is negative pressure inside the mask. In contrast, the PPRS provides uncontaminated air because it uses positive pressures. Thus, contaminated air from the room cannot enter the PPRS even in presence of leakages,” professor Tiwari said.“The PPRS is better placed vis-à-vis N95 respirator in one more way. The N95 respirator is only 95% efficient. Thus, health professionals working in isolation wards with large number of Covid-19 infected patients may fall sick due to exposure to significant viral loads. The PPRS eliminates this risk as well,” Tiwari added.Prof Gupta of SGPGIMS said, “This is just the prototype. We have applied for patenting of the design of the product. A lot of refinement will be done in due process of time.”“The PPRS is essentially made up of a snug, comfortable and leak-proof transparent enclosure for mouth and nose which receive positive pressure air from a portable, light, and wearable air-bottle as well as a trolley-mounted large cylinder,” said Gupta.“The device can deliver uncontaminated air for over six hours. It uses locally producible reliable one-way valves to avoid the inflow of contaminated air,” he said.The new PPRS is simple, rugged and incorporates multiple design features to protect the user. It is a universal, i.e. one-size-fits-all, design. It uses easily available local materials for fabrication. “And finally, it can be produced locally as it uses commonly available skill sets. Thus, such PPRS devices can be produced in very large numbers in a very short time frame across the country,” the IIT-K professor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/iit-kanpur-lucknow-institute-develop-alternative-to-n95-masks/story-uveeaisH5VgLLHubL9p73I.html

For her social distancing is a privilege given the size of her house and the vicinity in which she lives is densely populated. So, when the Pune Municipal Corporation appeals to the residents to maintain distance to prevent the spread of Covid-19, she laughs and says, “It may be possible for them, not for us.” ​If Mumbai’s Dharavi or Worli Koliwada are major contributors to the Covid-19 positive cases in the state capital, three wards in Pune - Bhavani peth, Kasba-Vishrambaug wada and Dhole Patil road – have emerged as the city’s hotspots. These three wards, according to statistics provided by PMC till April 15, account for 50 per cent of city’s total covid-19 positive tally. Of the 388 cases till Wednesday evening, these three wards reported 189 cases with most coming from slums and densely populated areas, according to PMC assistant medical officer Vaishali Jadhav.​According to PMC, Bhavani peth has 96 cases, Kasba-vishrambaug wada 45 cases and Dhole Patil road has 48 cases. The PMC records show more than 70 per cent of overall cases in each ward have come from pockets such as Kashewadi and Tadiwala road, which are slums from Bhavani peth and Dhole Patil road respectively.​“Lack of social distancing along with lack of hygiene are some of the reasons that these areas have seen maximum cases. Alcoholism, which brings down immunity, has also been a major contributing factor,” said Jadhav.​High concentration of population in small geographical area has now prompted PMC to send family members and neighbours of every positive case to facilities set up by the PMC for institutional quarantine. ​“We have turned maximum focus on some of the hotspots in the city with our health teams conducting house surveys in every locality having positive cases. Since it is increasingly becoming difficult to ensure that social distancing norms are followed in these slums, we have asked people living in pockets to shift to the institutional quarantine as it is difficult for them to follow social distancing norms at home,” said PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad. ​The spread of Sars-Cov-2 virus in these areas can also be witnessed from another PMC report which shows that of the 37 deaths in city till April 14, 11 deaths have come from Bhavani peth ward alone. The city has till Thursday witnessed 43 deaths of Covid-29 positive patients, most of whom also had pre-existing ailments such as diabetes, hypertension along with alcohol driven liver failure, said Jadhav. ​Aggressive screening has also been initiated with a special test centre started in Bhavani peth area by PMC.​“PMC took the first step to seal these areas and made it mandatory for residents to use masks when stepping out of their homes to purchase essential commodities. Now, the police is ensuring that there are few people on the roads,” added Gaikwad.​PMC issued a press statement on Thursday and said that they have started flu clinics in these areas which are mobile units. People with symptoms of flu can approach these mobile clinics for inspection.​A health worker, Sushma Pawar, raises her concern. “Police has sealed the areas and there is control on vehicle movement, but people who are living in crowded areas and mainly in slums or chawls are coming out on the streets, which is a concern for us as it can lead to the spread of the virus.”​Ramesh Bagwe of the city unit of the Congress who represents Bhavani peth area, on Thursday went to the slums to appeal to residents to stay at home.​Steps taken by PMC and police​- Quick response teams formed which are led by regional ward officer and medical officer.​- Contact tracing sped up and more survey teams deputed in these localities.​- Administration is ensuring that there is enough supply of essential commodities at the doorstep.​- PMC staff is visiting homes which have reported positive cases and sending the family members to a quarantine facility after a test. They are also sanitising the zone immediately. ​-PMC is taking help of NGOs and political personalities to convince the citizens to stay home.​- Thermal scanning of all the people residing in Bhavani peth area has started.​||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/congested-houses-lack-of-hygiene-and-alcoholism-in-three-wards-adding-to-pune-s-covid-19-positive-cases-tally/story-u9NyU9Ls2A3dnrn0GX2zoM.html

The 22-year-old, whose pet events are steeplechase and running, does all her drills on the terrace at her home in Ambegaon Budruk near Taljai.Chavarkar delivered memorable performances in 2019 as she emerged as the top runner in the 10km event at the Pune International Marathon and Bhakti Shakti Nigdi Marathon. Chavarkar, whose best timing is 38 minutes15 seconds in 10km run, has also participated in the Skechers Performance Los Angeles Full Marathon in March last year where she was placed 24th with the timing of 3 hours 43 minutes and 2 seconds in the age group of 20-24 years. Chavarkar has also won a bronze medal in the National Cross Country in Warangal, Telengana and another bronze medal in the 3000m steeplechase event during the Maharashtra State Athletics Championship. She trains under two-time Shiv Chhatrapati award winning coach Bhaskar Bhosale and practices on regular days at the Baburao Sanas Ground. Morning sessionMy day starts at 5.30am and my routine is to follow my workout schedule. I start my workout with a 20-25 minutes run on the terrace. After that I skip, do squats, lunges, core workout and other functional strength exercises. These workouts focus on a single muscle each day.Afternoon sessionAfter my workout, usually in the afternoons, I love to spend time with my family. I like to help my mother in the kitchen and as I am a foodie, I like to cook too. I play with my dog, listen to good energetic music and watch videos to learn new techniques of running. My event is 3000m steeplechase and marathon running, so my favourite player is Emma Coburn from the United States, who I follow. There are many things to learn while watching Coburn perform in steeplechase events. She is one of the best in the world. Evening sessionOn normal days, I practice twice and generally go out for running, but because of the lockdown, I prefer to stay at home and do stretching and yoga sessions on the terrace which helps me increase my concentration. Sometimes, my mother joins me. Then, I spend my evening, tending to the plants in our garden.Gym – not an issueLife without gym is not an issue for me as with body weight exercises, I maintain my fitness at home.Hobbies Swimming, trekking and watching videos online. I really miss going to the swimming poll since the summer season is here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/lockdown-no-hurdle-for-pune-athlete-priyanka-chavarkar-whose-daily-runs-on-terrace-bring-her-closer-to-the-finish-line/story-0K41gFdT1Teb2eQVRASgoO.html

Since he was not responding to treatment and his condition was serious, he was referred to GNDH on Tuesday. As soon as he was admitted here, he was put on ventilator. He was also suffering from diabetes. The patient, however, died due to Covid-19 at 12.30pm on Thursday,” Dr Kishore said.Punjab special chief secretary Karan Bir Singh Sidhu tweeted on Twitter and said, “Sansar Singh, the first Covid-19 patient from Gurdaspur district, has expired at GNDH Amritsar. His cremation will be held in Gurdaspur today.”The patient was admitted to a private hospital in Gurdaspur on April 9 after he complained of increased sugar level and problem in breathing. The doctors advised him to undergo treatment at Fortis Hospital, Amritsar, but he preferred the civil hospital in Gurdaspur.Sidhu had said in his tweet on Tuesday that the patient’s brother had died in Jalandhar with some symptoms although his posthumous sample has not yet been received.”Sources said that his brother died in Jalandhar on April 7 and he was cremated the same day at his native village of Bhaini Paswal in Gurdaspur district.Sources said that the lady doctor who attended to him in the private hospital has been quarantined for 14 days.Also, the health department has traced 46 close contacts of the deceased. Their samples have been sent to Government Medical College (GMC), Amritsar, and their reports are awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/60-year-old-gurdaspur-man-dies-of-covid-19-in-amritsar-hospital/story-hdxTxhgJEC0qv0qlVMCCgK.html

They then stood at the PTL Chowk in Phase 5, with the message, “Stay indoors, or we will take you.” Phase 1 station house officer (SHO) Manphull Singh said, “Covid-19 is the deadliest disease that the humankind had faced so far. With the help of these Ramlila artistes, we are trying to create awareness among people that if they violate the curfew and come out on the streets, death awaits them.”At 56, Mohali has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Punjab. So far, two deaths have been reported and only five persons have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yumdoots-come-calling-for-curfew-violators-in-mohali/story-Nzbg3ijQrhtqM2gFxsLdsL.html
17-04-2020||City||3 Ludhiana factory workers cycle 1,100km to home in UP village||Over 200km of cycling a day for almost a week, food from generous Punjabis, and an ample dose of luck and pluck, helped three factory workers reach home in Rae Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, 1,100km away, amidst the lockdown and curfew across Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. The three men, Arjun, 26, Monu, 30, and Narendra, 35, started on March 30 and reached their villages on April 5. Arjun and Monu are from Lala ka Purwa village; Narinder is from a nearby village. They worked as tailors at a hosiery factory in Ludhiana. “We did not run away on seeing the police, but informed them about our journey and offered to be taken for medical screening. At all times, we covered our faces with a mask made out of handkerchief,” Arjun, currently isolating himself at home, told HT over phone. He added they felt it was far riskier to travel in an overcrowded truck or by hitching a ride from any other source. On the way, they were told to isolate themselves for a day at the Uttarakhand-Uttar Pradesh border at Laskar, 500km away from their destination, and at Bareilly, 325 km away. After a screening, in which their body temperature was taken, they were asked to move on. “Thanks to the generous spirit of Punjabis, we did not have to worry for food, even though we had packed 10kg of flour, utensils and raw vegetables,” Arjun adds, emphasising that they were anxious to get home and followed discipline. “We started at 4am and used to stay at a temple or dharamshala at night. We used our mobile phone only once a day to conserve battery,” he adds. Manu and Narinder have three children each, Arjun has one child. “Our families were worried. With the number of cases increasing, at one point we also felt we would never see family again. We are exhausted now, but realise that anything is possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-ludhiana-factory-workers-cycle-1-100km-to-home-in-up-village/story-CoR33940jV4PjSQFzJtGaL.html
17-04-2020||World||France says no evidence Covid-19 linked to Wuhan research lab||France said on Friday there was no evidence so far of a link between the new coronavirus and the work of the P4 research laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the current pandemic started.“We would like to make it clear that there is to this day no factual evidence corroborating the information recently circulating in the United States press that establishes a link between the origins of Covid-19 and the work of the P4 laboratory of Wuhan, China,” an official at President Emmanuel Macron’s office said.The broad scientific consensus holds that SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the coronavirus, originated in bats.In 2004, France signed an agreement with China to establish a research lab on infectious diseases of biosafety level 4, the highest level, in Wuhan, according to a French decree signed by then-foreign minister Michel Barnier.US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday his government was trying to determine whether the coronavirus emanated from a lab in Wuhan, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Beijing “needs to come clean” on what they know. General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Tuesday that US intelligence indicates that the coronavirus likely occurred naturally, as opposed to being created in a laboratory in China, but there is no certainty either way.The Washington Post said this week that national security officials in the Trump administration have long suspected research facilities in Wuhan to be the source of the novel coronavirus outbreak.As far back as February, the Chinese state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology dismissed rumours that the virus may have been artificially synthesized at one of its laboratories or perhaps escaped from such a facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-says-no-evidence-covid-19-linked-to-wuhan-research-lab/story-M0v5k5x6xOSHzkK30cI4dN.html

Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will be the first to fly on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft as part of what’s known as the Demo-2 mission.Musk, the chief executive officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., founded the company in 2002 with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets, but the company has never flown humans before.The historic flight, from launch complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, is the final test for SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon spacecraft to be certified by the space agency to conduct regular flights to the station with crew on board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-sets-date-for-first-ever-astronaut-flight-on-spacex-rocket/story-I3xtKRboitSZdv2VQGjodK.html
17-04-2020||World||New York governor says Trump ‘passing buck’ on reopening amid pandemic||New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday he needed federal government help to ramp up testing for the novel coronavirus and reopen his state’s economy, and accused President Donald Trump’s administration of failing to provide funding to states.“Is there any funding so I can do these things that you want us to do? ‘No,’“ Cuomo told a daily briefing on the coronavirus. “That is passing the buck without passing the bucks.”The broadside came one day after Trump outlined guidelines for a phased reopening of the devastated U.S. economy, an effort that is expected to require mass testing for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus.Cuomo said New York, the epicenter of the country’s crisis, would need federal funding to significantly ramp up testing capacity and to fill a $10-$15 billion budget shortfall that is hampering the state’s ability to fund such efforts on its own.“The federal government has passed three bills to address this crisis. Of those three bills the state governments have gotten precisely zero, zilch, nada in unrestricted aid,” Cuomo said.“Okay, it’s up to the states, but then don’t ask the states, don’t give them this massive undertaking that has never been done before and then not give them any resources to do it.”He said Trump should pay as much attention to the states as “your big businesses and your airlines.”Responding to criticism from Trump about state requests for federal aid, Cuomo said: “If he is sitting home watching TV maybe he should get up and go to work.”On Thursday, Cuomo extended the closure of businesses and schools in his state until at least May 15, but he has started to plan on a phased reopening that would hinge on keeping hospitalizations and other key metrics on a downward trend.Cuomo said on Friday that a total of 17,316 people were hospitalized across New York because of COVID-19, down from 17,735 a day earlier and the lowest since April 5. Intubations and admissions to intensive care units also fell, he said.Cuomo said that about 2,000 infected people were newly admitted to hospitals on Thursday, hovering at a high level, while the state recorded an additional 630 deaths, up from 606 deaths the previous day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-says-trump-passing-buck-on-reopening-amid-pandemic/story-WAkAHxwwHBfnKNDIKwr9wJ.html
17-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: After over 14,500 deaths, UK cases show ‘gradual decline’||Britain’s health officials on Friday reported a ‘gradual decline’ in the number of cases in the hotspot of London, after national figures showed the number of dead rising to 14,576 and the number of cases to 108,692.Business secretary Alok Sharma announced a new taskforce on vaccines and multi-million pound funding to several projects to accelerate the development and production of a vaccine for coronavirus. Some pre-clinical trials have begun in the University of Oxford.Chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance reported a gradual decrease in the number of people in hospital beds in London, and a flattening and decrease in some areas: “That is exactly what you’d expect from the social distancing measures that we’ve all taken beginning to feed through”.On the taskforce, Sharma said at the Downing Street briefing: “UK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people’s lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts”.“The Vaccine Taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible”.One new project led by the University of Oxford will trial an anti-malarial drug believed to have anti-inflammatory properties to determine whether it could diminish the effects of Covid-19 on people in high risk groups.Other projects include Imperial College London testing a vaccine against coronavirus that aims for the body to produce more protective antibodies; and Public Health England developing a new antibody that could offer protection against infection and disease progression of coronavirus.Health secretary Matt Hancock added: “We’re doing everything possible to save lives and beat this disease, and that includes working flat out with businesses, researchers and industry to find a vaccine as quickly as possible”.“The UK is world-leading in developing vaccines. We are the biggest contributor to the global effort - and preparing to ensure we can manufacture vaccines here at home as soon as practically possible”.Reports continued from parts of the UK of shortage of personal protection equipment for medical staff. Britain is also planning to restart tracing the contacts of people who have had coronavirus symptoms, Hancock told a parliamentary committee on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-after-over-14-500-deaths-uk-cases-show-gradual-decline/story-M0XRe5R7xEhGYhDQ7A2T1I.html
17-04-2020||World||Record one-day spike in Covid-19 deaths, Donald Trump unveils reopening guidelines||The number of deaths from the novel coronavirus spiked to a new one-day high of 4,591 on Friday, nearly double the previous record, as President Donald Trump issued guidelines for reopening the country but left it to the states to decide; some of whom announced extended restrictions instead.The 24 hours ending late Thursday the number of new fatalities went up to 4,591, overtaking by a wide margin the previous high of 2, 494 on Wednesday, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker (other tallies may be higher or lower; the previous record was put at 2,569 by one them).The US toll so far was up, thus, to 33,286, and the number of confirmed cases went up by 31,451 over the same 24-hour period to 671,493.The number of cases increased in New York state, the epicenter of the American epidemic, to 223,691 thus far; with 14,832 fatalities, most of them in New York City, at 11,477.Despite these growing numbers, public health officials have expressed optimism that the United States is past the peak in new cases — 30% of US counties had not reported new cases in the last seven days, for instance. A drop in hospitalization and flattening of the curve on other metrics are the other signs giving them hope.“We’re starting our life again,” President Trump told reporters at theWhite House daily briefing Thursday, as he unveiled the new federal guidelines citing those signs of improvement. “We’re starting rejuvenation of our economy again in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion.”States were expected to announce their own reopening plans under guidelines but there no prescriptive timelines; governors will decide. Some states, in fact, chose to extend their restrictions instead. New York, for instance, extended its shutdown to May 15; Michigan and Missouri had also extended their stay-at-home orders. Trump said there are 29 states (of the total of 50) that can start soon and some of whom can get on to it right away. The White House task force has spoken of nine states that have reported less than 1,000 coronavirus cases each, with less than 30 new cases a day. But no specifics were forthcoming once again.The guidelines provide the reopening to be spread over three phases and laid down “gatekeeping” criteria for progressing from one phase to another. A state could decide to start phase for the entire state or parts of it based on 14 days of declining confirmed cases and testing, the ability of its hospitals to be able to deal with the the load without going into crisis mode; and provide robust and full testing for health workers.In the first phase, movie theaters, gyms, restaurants, places of worship and others could open if they are able to abide by strict social distancing rules of six-feet apart at the least. Employers could bring back workers if teleworking was not working out for them, but only in batches of 20% of 25%. All non-essential travel for employees could resume. Schools will remain closed and visits to senior living facilities and homes will remain prohibited. Stay-at-home orders will remain in force for vulnerable people, the elderly and those with underlying conditions.Schools, day care centers and camps could reopen in the second phase, elective surgeries could resume. Large venues may be allowed to reopen, but with moderate social distancing. Visits to senior living facilities will remain prohibited.All restrictions on workplaces will go in the third phase, ushering in the “new normal”, as Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House task force, put it. People will be expected to continue good hygiene practices and respect some amount of social distancing as “we still have an issue with asymptomatic spread”, she added.The mitigation efforts now in force in most parts of the United States have shut down businesses causing large-scale layoff — close to 22 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the last four weeks — and brought to the country to edge of the worst slowdown in US history, comparisons are being drawn to the Great Depression of 1929.Protests have broken out across the country with marchers demanding the reopening of the country — in Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, Utah and Wyoming. And more are expected over the next few days.President Trump has been just as keen as the protestors to reopen the economy and when asked about them, he told reporters, “They all want to open. Nobody wants to stay shut but they want to open safely. So do I.”But there is growing popular disapproval of his handling of the outbreak, which has come under growing criticism for being delayed and “botched”. Majority of Americans disapprove of the president’s response, according to two new polls. A CNN poll out Wednesday showed 52% disapproved of his response, up from 48% in March. In another poll, by Monmouth University, 49% of the respondents said he was doing a bod job, compared to 46% who approved. In March, half of the respondents had said he was doing a good job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-one-day-spike-in-covid-19-deaths-donald-trump-unveils-reopening-guidelines/story-bgIToJ4ivkLAvUoI7g340N.html
17-04-2020||World||Trump kicks toughest decisions to states with his reopening plan||Days after insisting he had absolute authority to steer the country’s economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak, President Donald Trump instead handed over the keys to governors and businesses.Trump issued guidelines on Thursday for states to consider as they decide whether to relax stay-at-home orders and other social-distancing measures enacted to curb the spread of the virus. The brief document lays out a three-stage process and leaves many difficult decisions to statehouses.The president set no deadlines, demanded no particular action and offered little federal assistance. One page of the document says that states undertaking a resumption of normal life should plan to “independently” secure protective gear and medical equipment for their hospitals. Businesses are advised to come up with their own protocols for temperature checks, protective gear, sanitation and testing.“A national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution,” Trump said Thursday at his daily White House news conference. “Now that we have passed the peak in new cases, we’re starting our life again.”US equity futures climbed Friday on optimism about an economic restart. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may be heading toward the first back-to-back weekly advance since before the market turmoil began in February.Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence plans a 1 p.m. call Friday with Senate Democrats on cthe federal oronavirus response, according to the White House. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on MSNBC Friday morning that negotiations with the Trump administration for additional funds for a small business program that ran out of money Thursday are making progress.Trump said Thursday that 29 of the 50 states qualified to begin the reopening process his administration laid out or would be ready soon, naming Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming. He agreed with a questioner who suggested Hawaii.In the best case, a state could abandon all but minimal social distancing practices within a month, under the plan. Yet it’s not clear whether most governors, business owners and workers share the president’s optimism that it will soon be safe to risk easing measures that only now appear to be slowing the virus’s spread in some hot spots, while cases and deaths continue to rise across the country.In North Dakota and Wyoming, the number of cases are still rising, which may disqualify those states from attempting to reopen under Trump’s guidelines. Hawaii Governor David Ige, a Democrat, is “working with his cabinet and others to determine what specific milestones will be needed for Hawaii to begin a phased reopening,” spokeswoman Cindy McMillan said.McMillan said the state does not yet believe it meets the federal criteria.A spokesman for Montana Governor Steve Bullock, a Democrat, didn’t respond to a request for comment on Trump’s guidelines.Testing WeaknessThe overarching weakness of Trump’s plan is that the US still lacks sufficient testing capacity to know with much precision where the virus is spreading. Tests continue to be rationed for priority groups and the country does not yet have a widely available antibody test, which can identify people who were infected and recovered without experiencing symptoms.Business leaders told Trump Wednesday that widespread testing was key to reopening.“Without sufficient testing -- and they’re talking millions of tests per week -- you cannot accurately predict what the actual rate of infection is,” said Paul Meechan, a bio-risk consultant who until last September was director of the Office of Safety, Health and Environment at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“Until we get those baselines, and we can have a discussion about what it means to be going down, you’re basically opening the door for making it a wild guess,” he said. “And that’s not good public policy. It’s not good science.”Deborah Birx, the State Department immunologist who is one of Trump’s top medical advisers, said Thursday the country has enough testing capacity for people with symptoms and those who have been in contact with confirmed cases, and can conduct “surveillance” testing that is crucial to stave off future outbreaks. The administration is trying to take advantage of an “amazing array” of capacity for “a million more” tests per week, Birx said, though that may not be enough.Micha Benoliel, an entrepreneur who led the development of a contact-tracing app called Coalition that’s expected to be used in the city of Berkeley, said “there is urgency to end the total lockdown as soon as possible if we want to avoid killing the economy” but that “we need to put science first in our decision.”“Much more access to testing is needed for us to begin a progressive approach in getting back to normal economic activity,” he said.Frustrated PresidentTrump has long made plain his frustration with social distancing, the isolation behaviors that Americans adopted to protect themselves from the virus even before he endorsed them March 16. The practices have crushed the U.S. economy, which less than two months ago was the president’s strongest argument for re-election.Gallup said Thursday that Trump’s approval rating fell six percentage points since mid-March, when he reached a personal best of 49%.“The current health and economic crisis is undoubtedly the greatest challenge of his presidency so far -- and could imperil his standing in the final year of his first term as he seeks re-election,” the polling service said.Trump’s new guidelines are as deferential to governors as they are flexible. The metrics are vague, and much is left to the discretion of states.The plan, called “Opening Up America Again,” outlines three phases of recovery from the outbreak in which social distancing restrictions are lifted step-by-step. In the third and final phase, employers can “resume unrestricted staffing” of workplaces, while restaurants, theaters, stadiums and other gathering places can operate with “limited physical distancing protocols.”“A new normal,” Birx called it.To move into the first phase, and then again into subsequent phases, the plan recommends that states document a decline in cases of coronavirus and flu-like illnesses for two weeks.‘Literally Tomorrow’Some states could enter phase one and begin lifting restrictions immediately -- “literally tomorrow,” Trump said. Barring a resurgence of infections, they could reach phase three in four weeks. It isn’t clear whether any governors will seek to move that quickly, risking a political backlash if the outbreak surges.“We have large sections of the country that, right now, they can start thinking about opening,” Trump said. “I call it a beautiful puzzle -- you have 50 pieces, all very different.”Trump’s guidelines also give states -- particularly the worst-hit ones -- license to do what they were already doing.California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has joined with governors in Washington and Oregon to set common policies for an eventual reopening. He said at a news conference that Trump understood the need for extensive testing, and expressed appreciation the president wasn’t trying to impose his preferences on states.Trump recognized “the need for a phased approach, a thoughtful and judicious approach,” Newsom said.Governors in the Midwest and the Northeast have formed similar regional partnerships. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer -- a potential running mate for Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, who has faced anti-shutdown protests led by Trump surrogates -- cited her own requirements to consider reopening her state: a declining rate of new infections, testing and tracing for sick people, health care capacity, and workplace social distancing.Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who is part of the Midwest coalition with Whitmer, said in a statement on Thursday that the regional economies would not reopen until “the time is right.” The state saw a 10-day-old child diagnosed with the virus on Thursday.Corporate UneaseCompanies are also likely to be uneasy with the steps proposed by the guidance -- or unable to function even under the limited social distancing that’s still envisioned in phase three, said Scott Ream, chairman of the Association of Continuity Professionals, a 1,700-member organization of business professionals that advises companies on how to operate in a time of crisis.“Corporations in particular are going to be very challenged by this in the absence of the federal government or some entity, or maybe through some other precedents that corporations wouldn’t be held liable for someone’s death,” Ream said.Any return to normal will require extensive testing, rapid identification of cases and tracing and testing of contacts of infected people, said Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and dean of the Boston University School of Public Health.“I’m not convinced we have those resources available,” Galea said. “We need to re-emerge. And to re-emerge, we need to plan for how to mitigate the risk of every case becoming again an outbreak, and every outbreak becoming an epidemic. I don’t think we’ll be ready tomorrow.”June is likelier, he said.But the guidelines largely leave to governors and businesses the choice whether to attempt reopening -- and therefore the consequences of moving too soon.“It’s going to be very dependent on the governor,” Trump said.Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged the risk of the approach.“This is uncharted water,” he said at the White House news conference. “There may be some setbacks. We may have to pull back a little, and then go forward.But he said, “I do see us getting more towards normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-kicks-toughest-decisions-to-states-with-his-reopening-plan/story-CUDkTouzNGLU8zhI1HZBwJ.html

Andrew Cuomo, everyone must wear a mask or face covering when in a public place and unable to maintain appropriate distance from others. Children younger than 2 and people with a medical reason why they can’t tolerate a mask are exempt from the rule, which takes effect at 8 p.m.Cuomo announced Thursday that the state’s stay-at-home restrictions that have been in place since March 22 will last at least until May 15. He said the extension was made in consultation with officials from other Northeast states and will be reevaluated next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-york-extends-stay-home-order-till-may-15-face-covering-rule-on/story-Aq9352B76yx2i6ozb2CBIM.html
17-04-2020||World||China’s virus death toll revised up sharply after review||China’s official death toll from the coronavirus pandemic jumped sharply Friday as the hardest-hit city of Wuhan announced a major revision that added nearly 1,300 fatalities.The new figures resulted from an in-depth review of deaths during a response that was chaotic in the early days. They raised the official toll in Wuhan by 50% to 3,869 deaths. While China has yet to update its national totals, the revised numbers push up China’s total to 4,632 deaths from a previously reported 3,342.The higher numbers are not a surprise — it is virtually impossible to get an accurate count when health systems are overwhelmed at the height of a crisis — and they confirm suspicions that many more people died than the official figures had showed.The undercount stemmed from several factors, according to a notification issued by Wuhan’s coronavirus response headquarters and published by the official Xinhua News Agency.The reasons included the deaths of people at home because overwhelmed hospitals had no room for them, mistaken reporting by medical staff focused on saving lives, and deaths at a few medical institutions that weren’t linked to the epidemic information network, it said.“As a result, belated, missed and mistaken reporting occurred,” Xinhua quoted an unidentified official from the city’s response headquarters as saying.Deaths outside hospitals were not registered previously and some medical institutions reported cases late or not at all, the official said.A group to review the numbers was established in late March. It looked at data from multiple sources including the city’s hospital and funeral service systems and collected information from fever clinics, temporary hospitals, quarantine sites, prisons and elderly care centers.The review found 1,454 additional deaths, as well as 164 that had been double-counted or misclassified as coronavirus cases, resulting in a net increase of 1,290. The number of confirmed cases in the city of 11 million people was revised up slightly to 50,333.Questions have long swirled around the accuracy of China’s case reporting, with Wuhan in particular going several days in January without reporting new cases or deaths. That has led to accusations that Chinese officials were seeking to minimize the impact of the outbreak and could have brought it under control sooner.A group of eight medical workers, including a doctor who later died from the virus, were even reprimanded and threatened by police after they tried to alert others about the disease over social media.Chinese officials have denied covering up cases, saying their reports were accurate and timely.“The data released by Wuhan reflects openness and transparency and an attitude of seeking truth from facts,” foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Friday.The U.N.’s World Health Organization has come under criticism for defending China’s handling of the outbreak and U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended funding to WHO over what he alleges is its pro-China bias.Trump’s blaming of China came after he initially showered praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping for the country’s response, while largely dismissing the risk it posed to the U.S.At the start of the outbreak, China proceeded cautiously and largely in secret, emphasizing political stability. Experts estimate more than 3,000 people were infected before China’s government told the public about the gravity of the situation, which officials had discussed privately six days earlier.The risk of sustained human-to-human transmission was also downplayed, even while infected people entered hospitals across the country and the first case outside China was found, in Thailand.As Trump and other U.S. officials and lawmakers started blaming China for the outbreak, Chinese officials pushed back. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Zhao tweeted in March, picking up on an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-virus-death-toll-revised-up-sharply-after-review/story-Ohh5vyMrAapWj6UawUrDmI.html
17-04-2020||World||Bolsonaro fires Brazil’s health minister, calls to reopen economy||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro fired his health minister on Thursday after clashing with him over how to fight the new coronavirus, and again called for states to end stay-at-home orders that he said were hurting the economy.Few global leaders have done more than Bolsonaro to play down the pandemic, which has killed nearly 2,000 Brazilians. He has called the virus “a little flu” and criticized state governors for imposing restrictions supported by health experts and the popular outgoing minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta.In televised remarks met with pot-banging protests in several major cities, Bolsonaro said Mandetta did not fully appreciate the need to protect jobs and he called again for a resumption of business in Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy.“We need to return to normal, not as fast as possible, but we need to start having some flexibility,” Bolsonaro said. The government cannot afford emergency aid to the poor for much longer, he said.The dispute at the highest reaches of Brazilian politics coincides with several countries debating when and how life should start returning to normal after coronavirus lockdowns, which are predicted to drive the global economy into recession.Governors in the United States have formed regional coalitions to begin considering plans for reopening their economies, stoking friction with U.S. President Donald Trump, an ally of Bolsonaro’s, who wants to see lockdowns lifted faster. But while there are signs that the outbreak has peaked in the United States, medical experts agree that a peak in Brazil is still weeks away and it is too early to end social distancing.“Do not think we are past a peak in growth of the virus. The health system is still not prepared for an acceleration,” Mandetta warned in his parting comments at the ministry.NEW MINISTER PROMISES NO SUDDEN CHANGE While Bolsonaro sharply criticized the shutdowns, the Health Ministry under Mandetta provided guidance supportive of the social distancing measures. Mandetta’s daily briefings had also contradicted Bolsonaro’s praise for unproven drugs.[nL1N2BP1K0]Incoming minister Nelson Teich, asked at a news conference about the ministry’s position now that he was in charge, said there will not be any “sudden changes” in policy.However, he added: “There is a complete alignment between me and the president.”Teich, who founded an oncology group sold to United Healthcare in 2015, lacks the political experience of his predecessor, a former lawmaker who had begun to upstage Bolsonaro.Boslonaro’s popularity has slid and he faces nightly protests from Brazilians banging pots from their windows over his handling of the outbreak. In addition to the daily 8:30 p.m. protest on Thursday, people also spontaneously began striking cookware when Bolsonaro announced Mandetta’s firing.The Health Ministry’s response to the epidemic was rated “good” or “great” by 76% of Brazilians surveyed by pollster Datafolha. Just 33% of those surveyed gave Bolsonaro the same ratings. Senator Major Olimpio, Bolsonaro’s former right-hand man in Congress, praised Mandetta for sticking to scientific principles in the public health crisis and urged the new minister to defend the need for isolation measures.“Teich has defended social distancing. If he persists in this, he will have serious problems with President Bolsonaro and won’t last 30 days in office, or he will have to tear up his degree and contradict the entire global scientific community,” the right-wing senator said in a video posted on social media.The spread of the coronavirus in Brazil has accelerated to 30,425 confirmed cases, with some 200 fatalities per day bringing the death toll to 1,924 on Thursday, according to Health Ministry data, the highest in Latin America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-fires-brazil-s-health-minister-calls-to-reopen-economy/story-aaQmWl9rExttfdvHOiHoOL.html
17-04-2020||World||Kim Jong Un’s absence from anniversary event fuels speculation over health||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s absence from an important anniversary event this week rekindled speculation over his potential health problems, analysts said on Friday. North Korea on Wednesday marked the anniversary of the birthday of its national founder and Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, as a national holiday known as the Day of the Sun.Senior officials paid tribute to the embalmed body of Kim Il Sung enshrined in the Kumsusan Palace of Sun, state media KCNA said on Thursday. But did not mention Kim as part of the delegation, unlike the past. He was also absent from photos released by party mouthpiece Rodong Sinmun. His purported absence triggered speculation among experts that Kim, who is aged 36 and overweight, might be having health problems. A spokeswoman at Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which handles North Korea affairs, said on Thursday it was aware that state media has not reported on Kim’s visit but declined to provide any analysis. Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at South Korea’s Sejong Institute, said it was the first time in decades Kim’s visit to the palace on that holiday was not reported state media since he took power in late December. “He has been going there on the birthdays of his grandfather and father to flaunt his royalty to them and sacred bloodline,” Cheong said. “It is possible that there was a problem with his health or safety even if temporary, though it is difficult to assess how the situation might be.” Pyongyang fired multiple short-range missiles on Tuesday which Seoul officials said was part of the celebration. Such military events would usually be observed by Kim, but there was no KCNA report on the test at all. Kim was last publicly seen presiding over a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s politburo last Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-absence-from-anniversary-event-fuels-speculation-over-health/story-CW80hUBxKtvEXJzaOnQYSN.html
17-04-2020||World||Coronavirus vaccine may be ready for mass production by Autumn: Oxford Professor||A coronavirus vaccine trial by University of Oxford researchers aims to get efficacy results by September, and manufacturing is already underway.A team led by Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology, has recruited 500 volunteers from the ages of 18 to 55 for the early- and mid-stage randomized controlled trial. It will be extended to older adults and then to a final stage trial of 5,000 people. Gilbert said that the timing is ambitious but achievable.“We would hope to have at least some doses that are ready to be used by September,” she said in an interview. “There won’t be enough for everywhere by then, but the more manufacturing we can do starting from now, then the more doses there will be.”Volunteers to take part in the trial have been abundant, she said, and it’s no longer accepting new subjects.Gilbert, whose research on vaccines began at the University of Oxford in 1994, was awarded a 2.2 million pound ($2.8 million) grant from the U.K.’s National Institute for Health Research and U.K. Research and Innovation in March to scale up her team’s efforts to move into Covid-19 vaccine research.The group’s experimental immunization is among the first to enter clinical trials. The World Health Organization counts 70 vaccine candidates in development, with three others in human testing. They are from CanSino Biological Inc. and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology; Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.; and Moderna Inc. along with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Gilbert’s trial divides 510 participants into five groups that will be observed for about six months with the option for a follow-up visit about a year after entering the trial. One group will receive a second intramuscular shot of the vaccine four weeks after the initial immunization.The research aims to determine the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine, named ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. A vaccine against meningococcal disease will be given to participants who will be randomly chosen for control purposes.Overseas Partners?ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is a so-called recombinant viral vector vaccine. It’s made from a harmless virus that’s been altered to produce the surface spike protein of the pandemic-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus.The vaccine acts by priming the immune system to recognize and attack the coronavirus, stimulating a T-cell response. It uses the same technology as a shot Gilbert’s team previously developed for the related MERS coronavirus. That vaccine appeared to be safe in animal and early-stage human testing, giving confidence for the coronavirus version.“We’re doing safety testing,” Gilbert said, “but we’re not concerned.”Gilbert’s team has used the same technology for about 10 different vaccines, she said. The challenge that now arises is testing the vaccine even as virus infection rates vary.“It’s going to be complicated trying to determine vaccine efficacy when the virus transmission in different places is going up and then going down again,” she said. “The trial has to be set up in the right place at the right time and that’s very hard to predict. That’s why we’re planning to do multiple trials in multiple countries.”Another hurdle is money“We have some funding but we don’t have all of it yet,” she said. “You can’t just go and start manufacturing at large scale. You have to put a lot of things in place and that’s what we’re trying to do at the moment. It’s in the order of tens of millions of pounds.”The WHO is creating a forum for everyone developing Covid-19 vaccines to share their plans and initial findings, according to Gilbert.“Work is continuing at a very fast pace,” she told the Lancet medical journal, “and I am in no doubt that we will see an unprecedented spirit of collaboration and cooperation, convened by WHO, as we move towards a shared global goal of Covid-19 prevention through vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-vaccine-may-be-ready-for-mass-production-by-autumn-oxford-professor/story-yY96TJ95p1rwVBInbQMD7O.html
17-04-2020||World||Coronavirus could complicate US President Trump’s path to reelection||The coronavirus is poised to reshape the political map, pummeling battleground states and alarming Republicans who see early signs of an election that could be a referendum on President Donald Trump’s management of the crisis.The pandemic, which has killed more than 30,000 Americans and left millions out of work, has eviscerated Trump’s hope to run for reelection on a strong economy. A series of states he won in 2016 could tilt toward Democrats.In Florida, a Republican governor closely aligned with Trump has come under scrutiny for being slow to close the state. In Wisconsin, the Democratic victor in last week’s Supreme Court race captured 28 counties, up from the 12 that Hillary Clinton won four years ago. In Michigan, a Democratic governor has seen her approval rating rise against the backdrop of a fight with Trump. And in Arizona, low marks for Trump could be enough to turn the formerly Republican stronghold into a tossup.“It makes me wonder if there’s something brewing in the weaker elements of the Trump base,” said Paul Maslin, a Wisconsin-based Democratic pollster. “Is the pandemic fight the final straw that’s going to cause some of this small slice of votes he needs to win these states to back away?”Trump’s public approval rating has remained consistent nationally throughout his presidency, and some polls even suggested an uptick at the onset of the pandemic. And his unique brand of politics rooted in cultural grievances could once again overcome hurdles that would sink other presidents seeking reelection, especially if the pandemic wanes or the economy rebounds.But Trump’s campaign is concerned about losing support in several key swing states, particularly Florida and Wisconsin, according to five current and former campaign staffers who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about internal strategy. There are also growing worries about Arizona and Pennsylvania.There is no better example of the altered map confronting Trump than Michigan, which he captured in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes.The mounting deaths in heavily African American Detroit and the politically dynamic suburban counties have been the backdrop for the tiff between Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Trump. Though her handling of the virus outbreak has prompted some public protests, Whitmer’s poll numbers have gone up and her criticism of the federal response prompted Trump to obliquely dismiss the governor, telling virus task force members “Don’t call the woman in Michigan.”In a sign of enthusiasm, participation in Democrats’ March primary was up 32% over 2016 as the party rallied around its likely nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden. The Trump campaign already had a light footprint in Michigan — it does not have a single field office — and advisers privately concede it could be the toughest battleground state to hold.Many pollsters believe Wisconsin could be the tipping point this November for either candidate to reach the needed 270 electoral votes. The state has long been considered the Rust Belt prize Trump was likeliest to keep, but poignant images of mask-wearing voters lining up outside Milwaukee’s few open polling places last week signaled Democratic enthusiasm.“We are starting to see more evidence that suburban voters disapprove of the way Trump is handling the coronavirus pandemic,” said Democratic strategist Adrienne Elrod, who notes that counties outside Philadelphia and Phoenix “have a similar electorate to the suburban areas that delivered a huge win for Democrats in Wisconsin.”Although the state Supreme Court race received national attention, Republicans were quick to dismiss it since only Democrats held a competitive presidential primary, boosting that party’s turnout. Wisconsin’s spring Supreme Court contests have been a shaky predictor of presidential elections, which usually feature twice as many voters.“President Trump has been clear — through actions and words — that what matters most is the health and safety of every American. This crisis is hitting Americans — not Democrats or Republicans,” said Trump campaign spokeswoman Erin Perrine. “To try and politicize this crisis in terms of the election is ludicrous.”Although Arizona hasn’t yet seen a spike in infections, Biden’s promise of pragmatic, experienced management may play well in a state that has turned purple. A Biden victory there would build pressure on Trump to hold two of the trio of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.The pandemic has hamstrung the Trump campaign’s effort to build momentum. Though its digital outreach has ramped up, the campaign has been unable to wield its financial advantage over Biden and can’t hold its signature rallies to bolster enthusiasm and collect valuable voter data.“We can’t wait to get back out there and do things the old-fashioned way,” said Lara Trump, a senior campaign official and the president’s daughter-in-law.Employment has cratered in many of the states key to Trump’s reelection.The economy shed 22 million jobs in the past four weeks, according to requests for unemployment benefits. And while some of those jobs will return as the lockdown gets lifted, it’s unclear how quickly workers will be needed at hotels in Florida, auto plants in Michigan and stores and offices that fill Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.Both Michigan and Pennsylvania have lost more than 1 million jobs since the outbreak, which implies unemployment rates of more than 20% in both states, according to Labor Department figures. Unemployment filings suggest Florida employers have let go of roughly 6% of its jobs, but declines there could worsen as applicants have struggled to access unemployment benefits.Without Florida, Trump’s path to victory becomes nearly impossible. Its Trump-friendly governor, Ron DeSantis, took heat for allowing beaches to stay open despite the risk of spread to his state’s massive population of vulnerable senior citizens.“They thought they were going to be running for reelection with a very popular governor, but DeSantis has taken some real hits over his handling of this,” said Republican strategist Alex Conant, who worked for Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign. “The image of spring breakers spreading coronavirus is going to be replayed in October.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-could-complicate-us-president-trump-s-path-to-reelection/story-m4KXzllEGsEjIn399LrNII.html

It had earlier announced 21 charter flights from several cities.The 17 additional charter flights to London will be operated from Ahmedabad (on April 20, 22, 24 and 26), from Amritsar (on April 21, 23, 25 and 27), from Bangalore via Ahmedabad (on April 23), from Delhi (on April 21, 23, 25 and 27), from Goa (on April 20, 22 and 24) and from Mumbai (on 26 April).“People who are most vulnerable will be prioritised for seats on these flights which will bring the total number of chartered flights run by the UK government from India to 38,” said a statement from the British high commission.“Given the number of people who have already registered for a flight, the majority of seats are likely to be allocated to people who are already on waitlists…,” the statement added.The UK minister of state for South Asia, Lord Tariq Ahmad, said: “We know this is a difficult time for British travellers and there is great demand for these flights. This is a huge and logistically complex operation, and we are working tirelessly with the Indian government and state authorities to help more British travellers get home.” Jan Thompson, the acting high commissioner to India, said: “We are working around the clock to arrange additional flights from locations where we know large numbers are still stranded and are extremely grateful for the support we are receiving from the government of India and local authorities.”The 21 charter flights announced previously are operating during April 8-20 and are expected to help more than 5,000 British nationals return home.The charter flights are for UK travellers who normally reside in Britain and their direct dependants. A number of seats will be reserved for those deemed vulnerable.The charter flights are expected to cost between £537 and £591.India has so far facilitated the repatriation of some 35,000 nationals of 48 countries who were stranded in the country because of the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-to-operate-17-more-flights-for-stranded-brits-in-india/story-MekXDtvDwhTrAEMc1Q4CLN.html

17-04-2020||World||‘Coronavirus under control in Germany’: Health minister||The coronavirus pandemic in Germany is “under control” thanks to measures imposed after an early surge in cases, Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Friday.Imposing restrictions to keep people home from mid-March had been successful, Spahn told reporters in Berlin, as the country prepares to ease the measures and ramp up production of protective masks.“The infection numbers have sunk significantly, especially the relative day-by-day increase. The outbreak is today again under control.”On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that smaller shops would open from next week and schools reopen to some pupils from May 4.But other elements of the wide-ranging restrictions will remain in effect, including a ban on gatherings of more than two people in public and on large public events.On Thursday, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for disease control released data showing each disease carrier in Germany was infecting fewer than one other person -- the person-to-person rate dropping to 0.7.The figures justified a first easing of the lockdown with a review after two or three weeks, Merkel said, while warning that there was “little margin for error” and that “caution should be the watchword, not over-confidence”.As Germany prepares to allow public life to resume, Spahn said the country would produce up to 50 million masks a week from August.Some 40 million would be surgical masks and 10 million would be FFP2 masks, which offer more protection.But so far Germany has not aped neighbouring Austria by introducing a nationwide requirement for people to wear masks in public, issuing only a “strong recommendation”.Defending the decision to hold off a mask requirement, Spahn said people had been “very responsible” so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-under-control-in-germany-health-minister/story-Ab1TTwgiPWCopSf9UQmqbP.html
17-04-2020||World||US space force is arming to jam Russian, Chinese satellites||The new US Space Force is building an arsenal of as many as 48 ground-based weapons over the next seven years designed to temporarily jam Russian or Chinese communications satellite signals in the opening hours of a conflict.The first system, made by L3Harris Technologies Inc., was declared operational last month after years of development, and the Space Force has taken delivery of 16 of them. The service is also developing a new system, known as Meadowland, that’s lighter-weight, capable of adding updated software and able to jam more frequencies.Since its formation last year as the sixth branch of the US military, attention has focused on the Space Force’s defensive duty in safeguarding US satellites and on organizational questions about its budget and its relationship with the Air Force. Less has been disclosed about its offensive role, which centers on Meadowland.“Nothing else we’re doing in Space Force is offensive in nature, where we are actually going after an adversary,” said Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Brogan, a unit head in the combat systems branch of the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, which is managing development and procurement.L3Harris, based in Melbourne, Florida, is already developing four Meadowland systems projected for delivery around October 2022. By this December, the Space Force plans to open a competition for 28 more, with funding starting in fiscal 2021 and systems projected for delivery from late 2023 to early 2027.As of now, Brogan said in an interview, the jamming systems are designed to interfere with communications satellites and not those for data relay or taking photos.Weaponizing SpaceUS defense officials long spoke against turning space into a battlefield, much less fielding weapons that could demolish targets and add more hazardous space debris.The Space Force said in a statement that “China and Russia have weaponized space with the intent to hold American space capabilities at risk,” and the U.S. has the inherent right of self-defense.Russia’s test launch on Wednesday of an anti-satellite missile is “further proof of Russia’s hypocritical advocacy of outer space arms control proposals designed to restrict the capabilities of the United States while clearly having no intention of halting their counterspace weapons programs,” the Space Force said in a separate statement.The new jamming system can be used early in a conflict and won’t create “space junk” because it emits energy designed to cause temporary, “reversible” interference, Brogan said.The Air Force said in a separate statement that the jamming can prevent an adversary’s “ability to accomplish command and control, early warning and propaganda” across “multiple frequency bands.”Advocates of preserving space as a weapons-free domain say the new U.S. jamming system risks escalation, even if it’s not designed to destroy satellites.“There are going to be those -- let’s call them ‘U.S. competitors’ -- who will find the development of any explicit counterspace system to be inflammatory and provocative, whether it is reversible or not,” said Victoria Samson, the Washington director of the Secure World Foundation, which publishes an annual overview of military space activities.“Competitors who have their space assets interfered with at times of crisis don’t know if/when it will stop; it is possible that they will have to assume that it’s irreversible and go from there,” she said. “Are we signaling that we are OK with officially targeting space assets?”China, RussiaAccording to the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, China and Russia rank behind the U.S. in the number of orbiting satellites. As of late 2016, Russia had about 40 communications satellites in orbit.“Over the next several years, Russia will prioritize the modernization of its existing communications, navigation, and earth observation systems, while continuing to rebuild its electronic intelligence and early warning system constellations,” according to the DIA.China is pursuing parallel programs for military and commercial communications satellites and owns and operates about 30 of those for civil, commercial, and military satellite communications, the DIA said last year. Beijing also operates a small number of dedicated military communications satellites.The new Meadowland system has two racks of equipment instead of the 14 on the one deployed last month, saving 10,000 square feet of storage space and making the systems more compact and easier to deploy, Brogan said.Unlike the current model, Meadowland will use more open architecture software for updates that allow for a “additional capability to go after more satellites, using more techniques as they are developed,” Brogan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-space-force-is-arming-to-jam-russian-chinese-satellites/story-0HOfrVnE8Crr3r0LHZH3NJ.html
17-04-2020||World||Chinese economy takes massive Covid-19 hit, shrinks first time in decades||China’s economy shrank by 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2020, government data showed on Friday, confirming the damage done to the second largest economy in the world by the coronavirus pandemic.China’s gross domestic product stood at 20.65 trillion yuan (about $ 2.91 trillion) in the first quarter of 2020, down 6.8 percent year on year, data from the national bureau of statistics (NBS) showed Friday.Reports said it was the first time that the Chinese economy had contracted since the Cultural Revolution, which ended in 1976.State media reports said the 6.8-percent contraction translated to an economic loss of about 1.44 trillion yuan ($203.4 billion), which is equivalent to the GDP of New Zealand.The coronavirus first emerged China late last year, forcing the government to opt for an extensive countrywide shutdown of factories and businesses to contain the spread of the pathogen.The Communist Party of China (CPC)-ruled government has restarted manufacturing across provinces but the raging pandemic has severely disrupted the supply chain in the first three months, impacting demand globally.The impact of the pandemic on China’s foreign trade is expected to show in the second quarter with demand for goods from China – the world’s manufacturing hub – expected to plummet across the world.The pandemic has infected more than 2 million globally and killed more than 130,000; China has reported more than 4000 deaths although new infections have dropped significantly from their peak in February.“A breakdown of the data showed output of the service sector, which accounted for nearly 60 percent of the total GDP, dropped by 5.2 percent, while primary industry and the secondary industry saw a decline of 3.2 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively,” official news agency, Xinhua, said in a report.Liu Xuezhi, an economist at the Bank of Communications, told the tabloid Global Times on Friday that though the March figures showed signs of easing, the rebound in March was also a bit “less than expected,” mainly because of the worsened pandemic situation globally.“If the global COVID-19 situation continues to intensify, in the worst-case scenario, China’s second-quarter GDP may contract again or only show a slight increase of 1 to 2 percent,” Liu said.“We expect (China’s) GDP growth to plunge in Q1 and stay negative in Q2; Beijing’s real stimulus package may be announced soon,” Nomura, a leading Japanese financial company, said.“However, unlike previous easing cycles, when most of the new credit went to finance spending on infrastructure, property and consumer durable goods, this time we expect most of the new credit to be used on financial relief to help enterprises, banks and households survive the COVID-19 crisis,” Nomura experts said in a note, quoted by Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-economy-takes-massive-covid-19-hit-shrinks-first-time-in-decades/story-7aXs8AyEjr0sgu3IOkjZIL.html

17-04-2020||World||US-Russian space crew lands in Kazakhstan amid Covid-19 pandemic||A US -Russian space crew landed safely Friday in the steppes of Kazakhstan, greeted with extra precautions amid the coronavirus pandemic.Following a stint on the International Space Station, NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan and Russian Oleg Skripochka touched down as scheduled at 11:16 a.m. (0516 GMT) Friday. Their Soyuz landing capsule landed under a striped orange-and-white parachute about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Dzhezkazgan in central Kazakhstan.Russian officials said they took stringent measures to protect the crew amid the pandemic. The recovery team and medical personnel assigned to help the crew out of the capsule and for post-flight checks had been under close medical observation for nearly a month, including tests for the coronavirus.The space crew smiled as they talked to medical experts wearing masks. Following a quick checkup, the crew will be flown by helicopters to Baikonur, from where Skripochka will be taken to Moscow, said Vyacheslav Rogozhnikov, a Russian medical official who oversaw the crew’s return.Morgan and Meir will have to be driven from Baikonur to Kyzyl-Orda, 300 kilometers (190 miles) away, to board a flight to the US — a strenuous journey made necessary by Kazakhstan’s quarantine measures.On Thursday, the Russian government coronavirus headquarters reported the first contagion at the Star City, which serves as the main hub for pre-flight training of U.S., Russian and other international crew members of the International Space Station. The Star City also has residential quarters for cosmonauts and support staff.Roscosmos Director Dmitry Rogozin said Wednesday that the Russian space corporation had 30 coronavirus cases.The crew returned to Earth exactly 50 years after the Apollo 13 astronauts splashed down in the Pacific after an oxygen tank explosion aborted the moon-landing mission.Morgan wrapped up a 272-day mission on his first flight into space. He conducted seven space walks, four of which were to improve and extend the life of the station’s Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, which looks for evidence of dark matter in the universe.Meir and Skripochka spent 205 days in space, with Meir carrying out the first three all-women spacewalks with her crewmate Christina Koch, who returned from space in February.Speaking from the orbiting outpost before the return to Earth, the crew said that coming back to the world drastically changed by the pandemic will be challenging. Morgan said the crew has tried to keep atop the coronavirus news, but added that it’s hard to comprehend what’s really going on.“It is quite surreal for us to see this whole situation unfolding on the planet below,” said Meir. “We can tell you that the Earth still looks just as stunning as always from up here, so it’s difficult to believe all the changes that have taken place since both of us have been up here.”A new crew comprising NASA’s Chris Cassidy and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner arrived at the station on April 9. They said before blastoff that they had been under a very strict quarantine for a month before the flight and were feeling good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-russian-space-crew-lands-in-kazakhstan-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-sjq1ZMRszLMUQx90u1MSUL.html
17-04-2020||World||China’s Covid-19 death toll crosses 4,600 after adding 1,290 new fatalities from virus-epicentre Wuhan||China has revised its official count of deaths from the coronavirus, adding some 1,290 deaths in Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged last December.The addition, reported by state media on Friday, brings the nationwide death toll to 4,636, the majority coming from Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The additional deaths were all counted in Wuhan and the late reporting of deaths are due to several reasons, said the report. The first is that some patients died at home without seeing a doctor or being tested for the virus as hospitals were overwhelmed during the epidemic’s peak.Secondly, there was late and incomplete reporting due to medical workers and institutions being occupied by treating patients during epidemic. Another factor was that designated hospitals to treat patients were expanded to institutions at the municipal and district level, including private hospitals, and not all were connected to and feeding timely information to the central epidemic network, Xinhua reported.Also read: China under mounting pressure over virus originsA similar revision up in death toll occurred in New York City a few days ago, adding over 3,700 people who died at home before being tested. Still, China’s move is likely to fuel speculation about the accuracy of its data, which has been questioned by US President Donald Trump. American intelligence officials have concluded that China concealed the extent of its outbreak and under-reported number of cases and deaths.Last month, pictures of thousands of ash urns being ferried to funeral homes in Wuhan circulated on Chinese social media platforms, raising concern that the real number of deaths in the city where the virus first emerged is higher than officially acknowledged.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage China has refuted charges that it intentionally under-reported its numbers, saying that it shares what information it has transparently. But its repeated revisions of data throughout the crisis -- including a one-day addition of nearly 15,000 cases diagnosed through a different clinical method in February -- has fueled mistrust.While the revision marks a substantial surge, China’s new official death toll is still low compared to the U.S. where reported deaths have climbed past 30,000. In Italy and Spain, deaths number around 20,000 in each country.Also read: Your risk of getting sick from Covid-19 may lie in your genes||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-4-600-after-adding-1-290-new-fatalities-from-virus-epicentre-wuhan/story-oW3AMhoO6vZlfkcb2Rr8dM.html
17-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Trump announces federal guidelines for reopening US economy||President Donald Trump on Thursday announced federal guidelines for reopening the United States in a “science-based” phased manner but left it wholly to governors to determine the timeline and extent of the easing of restrictions in their states hacking out of a spiraling showdown.“We’re starting our life again. We’re starting rejuvenation of our economy again in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion,” Trump told reporters at the daily briefing of the White House task force on coronavirus.The reopening announcement came amidst growing optimism among public health officials and experts that the United States is past the peak in reported new cases and is seeing flattening of the curve on other important indices such as hospitalization even as cases and fatalities continued to grown: the number of confirmed cases went up to 667,801 and deaths to 32,917.Trump’s announcement of the new guidelines were more recommendations than rules to be followed. Unlike the lockdown in India that was ordered by the Central government and enforced by states without any discretion in the extent of the rollout and timeline, US restrictions were guidelines that were recommended by the federal government and were enforced by states partially or in full depending on their determination of the severity of the outbreak.States will announce their own reopening plans as New York did later Thursday. But there were no indications of timelines or specifics states that will follow the guidelines.Trump said there are 29 states (of the total of 50) that can start soon and some of whom can get on to it right away. The White House task force has spoken of nine states that have reported less than 1,000 coronavirus cases each, with less than 30 new cases a day. But no specifics were forthcoming once again.The guidelines are split into three phases that are recommended to kick off only after a downward slide in cases and are contingent on protecting the most vulnerable populations, the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-trump-announces-federal-guidelines-for-reopening-us-economy/story-0qyicdJ1tR4nafR7Lsqt2J.html
17-04-2020||World||This country says it’s on course to wipe out Covid-19||When historians assess how countries approached the coronavirus pandemic, New Zealand is sure to stand out.The South Pacific nation is alone among its western peers in explicitly attempting to eradicate the virus. It adopted one of the strictest lockdowns in the world before a single death was reported, and has isolated infections to keep the disease from spreading out of control.The early signs are promising. The rate of new infections has dwindled to the lowest in weeks, and the death toll -- at 11 -- is one of the lowest among developed nations. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will decide on Monday whether to start easing a quarantine that requires everyone but essential workers to stay at home.“We have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved -- elimination of the virus,” Ardern told reporters Thursday in Wellington, as she cautioned against relaxing restrictions too quickly.The island nation’s lofty goal of elimination is not without critics, who say it’s unrealistic and comes at a devastating economic cost. Even if New Zealand succeeds, its borders will have to remain closed to much of the world for a considerable period to keep the virus out. That will decimate the tourism industry, its largest source of foreign exchange earnings.Central to New Zealand’s approach is a scientific fact that most western leaders appear to have ignored, according to Michael Baker, a professor at the University of Otago’s Department of Public Health in Wellington who sits on the government’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Group. That is that the virus usually has an incubation period of five to six days, twice as long as influenza.“That means that when someone gets sick, if you isolate them quickly and round up their contacts, you can quarantine those people and interrupt that chain of transmission,” said Baker. “With influenza you can’t really do that because by the time you’ve found their contacts it’s too late, they’ve infected other people.”And yet most countries treated Covid-19 as if it were influenza, he said, trying to slow its advance rather than eradicate it. Nations including the U.K. and the U.S. opted for such mitigation and suppression efforts after they found themselves overwhelmed by cases.Changing TacticsNew Zealand’s initial response took that approach too. In the early stages of the outbreak, Ardern spoke of “flattening the curve” of the virus’s spread to ensure the health system could cope.That all changed on March 23, when she announced a four-week nationwide lockdown would commence two days later, saying modeling showed that without the measures “tens of thousands of New Zealanders could die.”Industries were shuttered, schools were closed, and the only shops allowed to stay open were supermarkets, some corner stores and pharmacies. At that stage, New Zealand had only 102 cases and no deaths. Most countries resorted to such measures only after fatalities soared. When the U.K. announced its lockdown, also on March 23, it had 6,650 Covid-19 cases and 335 people had already died.Exit StrategyThe theory is that imposing tough restrictions early halts the spread of the pathogen and eventually allows an exit strategy to crystallize. The economic hit may be worse upfront, but activity can resume sooner. The alternatives of mitigation or suppression may require restrictions to stay in place for many months, prolonging the economic pain.New Zealand’s strategy, which requires extensive testing and contact-tracing capabilities, is supported by the statistics. While total cases have risen to 1,409, it has avoided the exponential growth seen in Europe and the U.S. Just eight new infections were reported Friday, the lowest number in four weeks.The island nation, with 5 million residents, has a similar population to Ireland, which has seen more than 13,000 infections and almost 500 deaths. And while New Zealand’s 11 fatalities compare with 10 in Singapore, that Southeast Asian country is now struggling with a wave of infections from dormitories housing low-wage foreign workers.A comparison with neighboring Australia is more complicated. Australia has far more cases, at 6,468, and deaths have climbed to 63. But the infection rate comes out to 254 per million people, less than New Zealand’s 292 per million.Australia’s ApproachAustralia’s results have come despite less stringent restrictions. It has allowed more industries to continue operating, such as construction, and consumers can still get a haircut or buy a takeaway meal, keeping many workers on lower incomes employed.“Australia is doing better than New Zealand without going to that extreme,” said Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician at Canberra Hospital who advises the Australian government.Collignon questions whether New Zealand’s eradication strategy is realistic.“The reality is this virus is everywhere, it’s all around the world,” he said. “So even if you’re successful for a short period of time, how long do you do this for? Six months? Two years? Invariably, you’re going to get the virus re-introduced.”One concern is the phenomenon of asymptomatic transmission. The possibility that people can pass along the disease even though they show no symptoms underscores the challenge of containing the pandemic.‘Nirvana’ ScenarioBrendan Murphy, Australia’s chief medical officer, told a New Zealand parliamentary committee April 14 that eradicating the virus is a “nirvana” scenario.“We are pursuing a very aggressive suppression strategy,” he said. “Obviously we would like to achieve elimination (but) we’re pretty doubtful that could be maintained for the long-term given the incredible border measures you would need to have.”For Baker, there are benefits in trying to eliminate the virus, as well as evidence it can be done -- China, for example, appears to have succeeded in stopping the Wuhan epidemic and preventing wider transmission within its borders.He believes more countries, including Australia, could yet adopt elimination strategies and eventually form an “eastern hemisphere bloc” with nations like China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea within which travel will be possible.“Maybe it’s a bit optimistic, but at least we have an exit strategy and a plan,” Baker said. “That seems a lot more appealing than the mess that Europe and North America are going to be in for the foreseeable future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-country-says-it-s-on-course-to-wipe-out-covid-19/story-kmqT1wxUTKlZVcaHTUzDHI.html
17-04-2020||World||Prince Harry and Meghan hand out meals in Los Angeles||Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan handed out meals to sick people in Los Angeles, in their first known public activity since moving to California at the start of the state’s coronavirus lockdown.The pair, who have formally stepped down as senior members of the British royal family, first volunteered with Project Angel Food on Sunday, delivering food to people living with chronic illnesses.“They were here Easter Sunday, and then they surprised us on Wednesday,” said communications manager Anne-Marie Williams.“They handed out to 20 of our clients, and they rocked their worlds.”The Duke and Duchess of Sussex relocated to California last month after announcing in January that they intended to quit royal life and “work to become financially independent.”They have kept a low profile, with even their location unknown amid unconfirmed reports that the pair are living in Malibu.It emerged last week that they are planning to launch a wide-ranging non-profit organization in the United States named Archewell, focusing on mental health, education and wellbeing.They said they wanted “to do something of meaning, to do something that matters,” but have delayed releasing full details because of the pandemic and will make an announcement “when the time is right.”Los Angeles nonprofit Project Angel Food, which delivers medically tailored food to chronically ill people, appears to be the first charity publicly supported by the pair since their secretive move.“We kept the conversation very casual, all I know is that they’re very intent on being of service, and that they want to see Los Angeles through the lens of Project Angel Food and through the lens of philanthropy,” Richard Ayoub, the organization’s CEO, told AFP.The pair learnt of the charity through Meghan’s mother, who lives in Los Angeles and had heard that the organization needed extra help during the pandemic.Upon their departure from the frontline of the British monarchy, the couple agreed to relinquish their “Royal Highness” titles.“They’re very down to earth people -- very sweet and genuine and don’t stand on ceremony at all. They insisted we call them Harry and Meghan,” said Ayoub.Many of Project Angel Food’s clients are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus, and Ayoub said he hoped the couple’s attention would help drive donations to www.angelfood.org/covid19.He added: “I’m keeping my fingers crossed, hoping they’ll come back. With all this publicity, we don’t know. But we’re hoping that they do come back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-harry-and-meghan-hand-out-meals-in-los-angeles/story-MkfVozXlNXAtyS88yE17qI.html
17-04-2020||World||After WHO row, US is probing China lab link||US President Donald Trump’s administration is urging an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, saying that the US doesn’t rule out that it came from a laboratory researching bats in Wuhan. China’s foreign ministry hit back saying the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there is no evidence that the coronavirus was made in a lab.The fresh row erupted a day after Trump announced a hold on US funding for the WHO as it had failed in its duties, after which China said it would make up for the lack of American financing to the global health body.Trump, asked about the laboratory theory on Wednesday, said that “more and more, we’re hearing the story” and that the US was “doing a very thorough investigation”. Trump has repeatedly blamed China and the WHO.Beijing has said that the virus was likely transmitted to humans late last year at a Wuhan “wet market” that butchered exotic animals .But The Washington Post and Fox News quoted anonymous sources who voiced concern that SARS-CoV-2 may have come accidentally from a sensitive bioresearch centre in the metropolis.“We’re doing a full investigation of everything we can to learn how it is the case that this virus got away, got out into the world and now has created so much tragedy, so much death, here in the United States and all around the world,” US secretary of state Mike Pompeo told Fox News.He did not reject the reports and said that the US knew that the Wuhan laboratory “contained highly contagious materials”.“In countries that are open and transparent, they have the ability to control and keep them safe and they allow outside observers in to make sure all the processes and procedures are right,” Pompeo said. “I only wish that had happened in this place.”The origin of the virus is a popular topic on social media, with conspiracy theorists suggesting it is a Chinese bioweapon and a Chinese official saying US troops may have brought it to Wuhan.Neither Fox News nor The Washington Post said the virus was spread deliberately or that the laboratory was definitively determined as the source.A column by Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin said that US embassy officials visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology two years before the pandemic and warned of inadequate safety at the laboratory.Fox News said that “patient zero” may have been infected by a bat at the laboratory and gone into the population in Wuhan.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian insisted that the WHO’s officials “have said multiple times there is no evidence the new coronavirus was created in a laboratory”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-who-row-us-is-probing-china-lab-link/story-uRNpsa9EHdMR8idPntad6J.html

17-04-2020||World||‘Some states could reopen literally tomorrow’: Donald Trump gives 3-phase plan to governors||President Donald Trump gave governors a road map Thursday for recovering from the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic, laying out “a phased and deliberate approach” to restoring normal activity in places that have strong testing and are seeing a decrease in Covid-19 cases.“We’re starting our life again,” Trump said during his daily press briefing. “We’re starting rejuvenation of our economy again.”He added, “This is a gradual process.”Follow latest coronavirus updates here The new guidelines are aimed at easing restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, while holding the line in harder-hit locations. They make clear that the return to normalcy will be a far longer process than Trump initially envisioned, with federal officials warning that some social distancing measures may need to remain in place through the end of the year to prevent a new outbreak. And they largely reinforce plans already in the works by governors, who have primary responsibility for public health in their states.“You’re going to call your own shots,” Trump told the governors Thursday afternoon in a conference call, according to an audio recording obtained by The Associated Press. “We’re going to be standing alongside of you.”Places with declining infections and strong testing would begin a three-phase gradual reopening of businesses and schools.In phase one, for instance, the plan recommends strict social distancing for all people in public. Gatherings larger than 10 people are to be avoided and nonessential travel is discouraged.In phase two, people are encouraged to maximize social distancing and limit gatherings to no more than 50 people unless precautionary measures are taken. Travel could resume.Phase three envisions a return to normalcy for most Americans, with a focus on identification and isolation of any new infections.Trump said recent trends in some states were so positive that they could almost immediately begin taking the steps laid out in phase one.“They will be able to go literally tomorrow,” Trump said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The guidelines recommend that states pass checkpoints that look at new cases, testing and surveillance data over the prior 14 days before advancing from one phase to another.Governors of both parties made clear they will move at their own pace.Delaware Gov. John Carney, a Democrat, said the guidelines “seem to make sense.”“We’re days, maybe weeks away from the starting line and then you have to have 14 days of declining cases, of declining symptoms and hospital capacity that exists in case you have a rebound,” he said.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Trump ally, cautiously floated the idea of reopening parts of the state, but said testing capacity and contact tracing would need to be considerably ramped up before restrictions could be safely lifted.“All would be forgotten very quickly if we moved into a stage quicker than we should, and then we got into a situation where we had people dying like flies,” Justice told reporters.At the earliest, the guidelines suggest, some parts of the country could see a resumption in normal commerce and social gatherings after a month of evaluating whether easing up on restrictions has led to a resurgence in virus cases. In other parts of the country, or if virus cases pick up, it could be substantially longer.In briefing governors on the plan, Trump said they were going to be responsible for deciding when it is safe to lift restrictions in their states. Just days before, he had drawn swift pushback for claiming he had absolute authority to determine how and when states reopen.“We have a very large number of states that want to get going and they’re in very good shape,” Trump said. “That’s good with us, frankly.”The guidelines also include general recommendations to businesses as they plan for potential reopenings, suggesting temperature-taking, rapid Covid-19 testing and widespread disinfection efforts in workplaces.Those most susceptible to the respiratory disease are advised to remain sheltered in place until their area enters the final phase — and even then are encouraged to take precautions to avoid close contact with other people.Governors, for their part, have been moving ahead with their own plans for how to safely revive normal activity. Seven Midwestern governors announced Thursday they will coordinate on reopening their economies. Similar pacts were announced earlier in the week in the West and Northeast.Two in three Americans expressed concerns that restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus would be eased too quickly, according to a Pew Research Center survey released Thursday. More than 30,000 people in the United States have died from the virus.Trump also held conference calls Thursday with lawmakers he named to a new congressional advisory task force on reviving the economy. The economic costs were clear in new federal data showing that at least 22 million Americans have been thrown out of work in the last month. But the legislators repeatedly urged the president not to sacrifice public health by moving too quickly.“My highest priority on this task force will be to ensure the federal government’s efforts to reopen our economy are bipartisan, data-driven, and based on the expertise of public health professionals,” said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.The federal government envisions a gradual recovery from the virus, in which disruptive mitigation measures may be needed in some places at least until a vaccine is available — a milestone unlikely to be reached until sometime next year.“It’s not going to immediately be a situation where we have stadiums full of people,” said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson on Thursday. “We’re Americans. We will adapt,” he added.Trump on Thursday claimed the US has “built the most advanced and robust testing anywhere in the world.” But even people close to him warned more would be necessary.“We are struggling with testing at a large scale,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told ABC’s “The View.” “You really can’t go back to work until we have more tests.”There was also concern that the White House was taking too rosy a view on trends in the US.“I would not declare a peak almost anywhere in the US. yet,” said Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard epidemiology professor who is director of the university’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. He recommended “working to enhance surveillance and testing so if we do hit a peak, it will be possible to identify it with greater certainty.”But some of Trump’s conservative allies, like economist Stephen Moore, have encouraged him to act swiftly, warning of “a mini Great Depression if we keep the economy shut down.”“That is a catastrophic outcome for our country. Period,” Moore said he advised the president.A big testing ground for Trump’s road map could be Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has stuck close to federal guidance throughout the crisis, will lay out his reopening plan Friday. Abbott has said the process will be gradual, but he is facing pressure from conservative lawmakers to get Texas back to work.The White House proposal presented Thursday is different from what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended last week, according to a draft of the recommendation obtained by The Associated Press. The CDC talked about using more specific criteria and in many cases looking for improvement over longer periods of time before easing restrictions in high-transmission areas. Examples include wanting to see sustained reductions over 30 days in positive tests for coronavirus, and sustained reductions over 15 days in numbers of coronavirus deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-states-could-reopen-literally-tomorrow-donald-gives-trump-s-3-phase-plan-to-governors/story-QTZn6eDp8eV12uoFPWMd8M.html

There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.” The United States and Britain took a tougher line on China, where the coronavirus outbreak emerged in December.“We’ll have to ask the hard questions about how it came about and how it couldn’t have been stopped earlier,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said at a press conference Friday when asked about future relations with Beijing.Raab is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson who is recovering from Covid-19.US President Donald Trump’s administration is investigating the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, saying it does not rule out that it came from a laboratory researching bats in Wuhan, China.Chinese scientists have said the virus, which has killed more than 140,000 people worldwide, was likely transmitted to humans late last year at a Wuhan “wet market” that slaughtered exotic animals -- a longtime focus of concern for public health experts.But The Washington Post and Fox News both quoted anonymous sources who voiced concern that the virus may have come -- accidentally -- from a sensitive bioresearch centre in the city.Trump, asked about the laboratory theory at a news conference on Wednesday, said that “more and more, we’re hearing the story” and that the United States was “doing a very thorough investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-says-things-happened-we-don-t-know-about-in-china-covid-19-handling/story-2BFIXyuoluhtVWOlKEb7cP.html

This is in addition to the USD 6 billion bailout package that Islamabad signed with the IMF in July last year to stave off a balance of payment crisis.“The outbreak of Covid-19 is having a significant impact on the Pakistani economy,” said Geoffrey Okamoto, the IMF’s First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair.The domestic containment measures coupled with the global downturn are severely affecting growth and straining external financing which has created an urgent balance of payments need, he said.“As the crisis abates, the authorities’ renewed commitment to the reforms in the existing Extended Fund Facility -- in particular those related to fiscal consolidation strategy, energy sector, governance, and remaining AML/CFT deficiencies -- will be crucial to entrench resilience, boost Pakistan’s growth potential, and deliver broad based benefits for all Pakistanis,” Okamoto said.Expeditious donor support is needed to close the remaining balance of payments gap and ease the adjustment burden, he added.Okamoto said that in response to the crisis, the government of Pakistan has taken swift action to halt the community spread of the virus and introduced an economic stimulus package aimed at accommodating the spending needed to tackle the health emergency and supporting economic activity.“Crucially, the authorities are increasing public health spending and strengthening social safety net programs to provide immediate relief to the most vulnerable,” he said.“Similarly, the State Bank of Pakistan has adopted a timely set of measures, including a lowering of the policy rate and new refinancing facilities, to support liquidity and credit conditions and safeguard financial stability. In this context, the authorities’ policies should be targeted and temporary,” Okamoto said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-imf-approves-nearly-1-4-billion-to-pakistan-as-financial-aid/story-29ZloyozId3nlJu4AckLRN.html

Ministers and experts said lifting the lockdown or a return to normalcy would not be feasible until the mass availability of a vaccine for the virus.Several projects across the globe are at various stages of developing a vaccine for the coronavirus, with one in the University of Oxford promising that it could be available by September. Raab said, “Now is not the moment to give the coronavirus a second chance… We still don’t have infection rates down as much as we need to. Any change to social distancing measures now would risk a significant increase in infections.”Health minister Nadine Dorries said, “There is only one way we can exit a full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine. Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a balance between the health of the nation and our economy.”Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, who is advising the government, said some level of social distancing would need to be retained, until a vaccine is available, calling for an emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing. He called for more action at the official level, noting that more preparation had been done for Brexit than to deal with the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-remain-locked-down-for-at-least-3-more-weeks/story-IsY7ivqwictqO0WU6dkARJ.html

Nearly 22 million people have now been left jobless by the four weeks of mitigation efforts in place to combat the outbreak.“The battle continues,” Trump said at a briefing of the White House task force on coronavirus. “Data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases.”The US death toll went up by 2,494 in the last 24 hours, with the total number of fatalities nearing 33,000 and countrywide cases crossing 654,000.Meanwhile, New York governor Andrew Cuomo extended the state’s shutdown order on Thursday until May 15, citing data showing conditions were improving but insisting on the need to maintain vigilance.“I would like to see that infection rate get down even more,” Cuomo said at his daily briefing, reporting that 606 more people had died in the US Covid-19 epicentre.In a hopeful sign, Cuomo said New York state - where at least 11,586 people have died from Covid-19 and well over half a million have tested positive, this was the lowest daily toll in 10 days. “I don’t want to project beyond that period,” he said. “One month is a long time.”The announcement came on the eve of the implementation of a directive forcing New Yorkers to wear face coverings in public places where they cannot stay six feet apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-upbeat-despite-2-494-deaths-in-us-in-a-day/story-yV0GblckVyYzaRcB3gMOzL.html

17-04-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine likely by September: Oxford expert||As nearly 30 projects across the globe strive to produce a vaccine for Covid-19 soon, Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, believes that it could be available by September, calling for large-scale production facilities to be in place soon.Gilbert, who reiterated the projected availability by September on Monday, said clinical trials at the university would start “quite soon”. It is important to set in motion production processes so that it can be made available widely soon, she added.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We need to start manufacturing large amounts of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for companies to start manufacturing a new vaccine before they really know for certain it works”, she told BBC Radio on Monday morning.“No-one wants to be in a position where you have a vaccine which you have shown does work and then not have any of the vaccine to use. The sooner we start the quicker we’re going to get to the billion dose scale. That probably won’t be this year but if we don’t start we’re not going to get there next year either,” she added.The university said researchers are working “at an unprecedented rate” to make the vaccine available, pushing ahead with the process to screen 510 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 to test a new one called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The trial has been approved by UK regulators and ethical reviewers.Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, said: “The Oxford team had exceptional experience of a rapid vaccine response, such as to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. This is an even greater challenge”.“Vaccines are being designed from scratch and progressed at an unprecedented rate. The upcoming trial will be critical for assessing the feasibility of vaccination against COVID-19 and could lead to early deployment.”Gilbert told The Times last week that she is “80%” confident of its success, “based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine”. However, many industry experts believe the vaccine could take as long as 18 months to be developed and distributed globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-likely-by-september-oxford-expert/story-VlYRiSsSgyb7m2dmMm7WaI.html

The first case in Dharavi was reported on April 1, following which there has been a rapid surge in the number of positive cases, which may soon pose a grim challenge for civic authorities. Coronavirus cases are climbing steadily in the area and there are fears that the number of cases could be higher as many people with symptoms may not have been tested yet.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North Ward said. “Till date we have screened 33,000 patients and marked 34 containment zones with six red zones. We are screening almost all high risk and low risk contacts of the patients. We are working on a target basis hence the numbers of patients are increasing.”The slums in Dharavi are spread over an area of more than 240 hectares and house around 8.5 lakh residents.

The truck had a Maharashtra number and a slip pasted on the windscreen wherein it was written ‘Essential Services’.On suspicion, the policemen stopped it at barrier and asked the driver to remove the tarpaulin and, to their surprise, found 49 migrant workers seated inside, Sajwan said. The policemen then informed senior officers about the truck and the migrants.The police seized the truck and arrested the driver while the migrants were quarantined in the nearby Bhagirathpur Inter College.The police have also lodged an FIR against the owner of the truck and informed the Maharashtra police about the incident. A probe has been ordered as to how the truck moved from distant Pune to Maharajganj during the lockdown, Sajwan said.Forty-eight migrant labourers are natives of Badhara Shivnath, Jamhurakala Belwa, Gujarwaliya, Baikniha, Chapwa and Mainyahwa villages in Maharajganj district while one labourer is a resident of a village bordering Nepal.“The migrants wanted to be sent to their respective villages but the police team took them to the quarantine facility. They were served food and given medicines,” said station house officer Ram Sahay Chauhan.The migrants had left Pune for Maharajganj on April 14 night crossing Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and several districts of UP before they reached Maharajganj on Friday morning. A migrant labour named Shiv said they worked in a factory in Pune. During the lockdown period they managed to live on their meagre savings and food till April 14. When the lockdown was extended till May 3, they decided to leave for home. They contacted their factory owner, who provided the truck to transport them to their villages, he said.The migrants said around Rs 3 lakh was spent on the truck fare, fuel, food and other items that they have to pay back to the owner once they return to Pune after the lockdown, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violating-lockdown-norms-for-1-700km-49-migrants-reach-maharajganj/story-WWT8UtcF7YXKdHxIs4KmFK.html

In Delhi, over a 1,000 people - either evacuated or their contacts -- have tested positive to the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen that causes the coronavirus disease.Across the country, nearly 26,000 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts were placed under quarantine at state-run facilities when the Islamic religious sect finally allowed authorities last month to evacuate its followers.Also read: ED slaps money laundering case against Tablighi Jamaat chiefIn a letter sent to all state chief secretaries, Director Generals of Police and Delhi Police Commissioner, reviewed by HT, the MHA told the states that “Rohingya Muslims and their contacts need to be screened for Covid-19. Accordingly, necessary measures may be taken in this regard on priority”.“It has been reported that Rohingya Muslims have attended ‘ijltemas’ (largest annual Islamic congregation organized by Tablighi Jamaat – March 13 to 15) and other religious congregations of Tablighi Jamaat and there is a possibility of their contradicting Covid-19.”The ministry wants the states to trace Rohingya who attended the Tablighi Jamaat activities as well as their contacts on “priority”.“Rohingyas residing in camps in Hyderabad, Telangana had attended Tablighi Jamaat ijtema at Mewat, Haryana and had visited Nizamuddin Markaz at New Delhi.Also read: Bangladesh coast guard rescues 396 Rohingya from drifting boat; 32 deadSimilarly, Rohingyas living in Shram Vihar, Shaheen Bagh, Delhi who had gone for TJ activities, have not returned to their camps,” the home ministry communication said.It added that the “presence of Rohingya Muslims after attending Tablighi Jamaat work” has also been reported from Derabassi, Punjab and Jammu area.According to an estimate by the government, there are around 40,000 Rohingyas in camps alone across several states in India. Only about 17,500 of them are registered as refugees with the office of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).The government has repeatedly insisted that the Rohingya are illegal immigrants, even those registered with the UN refugee agency, and would be deported.India is not a signatory to the international accord on refugees.India has deported a couple of groups of Rohingya. But the Supreme Court is still hearing a petition that challenged this approach. Before the Covid-19 pandemic forced the Supreme Court to stop hearings, a UN Special Rapporteur had, in January, asked the court to let her assist the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-wants-rohingya-screened-for-covid-19-after-tablighi-jamaat-link-emerges/story-af1tHOVqd9Cf8p3QdQcjwO.html

Our modelling estimates posit that without the lockdown, India could have had up to 820,000 cases by April 15. With the lockdown, we have limited these to around 11,000 cases and have managed to contain 80 per cent of the cases to just 78 districts in India.”Explaining why this information package was being distributed at this time, she added in a letter accompanying the documents, “We are sharing our experience of how we are managing the threat in a country of 1.3 billion people with our friends and partners.”The cases that would have been recorded by April 15 without a lockdown or containment measures would have matched Italy’s progression, and containment measures alone without a lockdown may have led to 1.2 lakh cases, as per a projection taking peak growth rate before the lockdown.Interestingly, the 20-page presentation also underlines the role of super spreaders in compounding the crisis in India. One slide is named ‘Steep Rise in cases due to Tablighi Jamaat Incident’.The presentation also points out that screening and isolation of passengers started in India on January 18, 12 days prior to the first COVID-19 case being reported in the country.It also shows that India imposed a partial lockdown after 52 days and at Stage II, with 451 active cases, as against other countries like the United States and Italy, which did so mostly at Stage III, that of community outbreak. The complete lockdown came 55 days after the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/without-timely-lockdown-covid-19-cases-in-india-may-have-hit-8-lakh-consulate-in-toronto/story-HU5Iq99IBjFqLYezxhh3qO.html

In October 2019, he began to work at AIIMS Bhubaneshwar as part of the hospital’s 250-member housekeeping staff. On March 23, shortly after Odisha had gone into lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Manoj Sahoo, facility manager of Golden Hospitality Limited — the company hired to clean the hospital — gave him a new task to do. He requested Dehury to collect biomedical waste (blood, cotton swabs, beddings contaminated with blood or body fluid, needles and syringes kept in bags from the wards) and drive it to the disposal centre inside the hospital complex. Sahoo made a similar request to 18 other employees; 10 said yes initially, but in the end, only two agreed to do the work.“The other housekeeping staff got scared and said there was a possibility of getting infected. The first day I reported for duty, I became very nervous as a few friends among the housekeeping staff asked me not to come. I did not report for duty for the next two days. But on the third day I thought if I do not go then someone else would do it. So I joined duty,” said Dehury, who lives with his father and brother in a village on the outskirts of the city.Like other hospital staff, Dehury requires a lockdown pass to travel to AIIMS. Every day he travels by his two-wheeler to AIIMS.In a non-pandemic world, transportation of biomedical waste requires a great deal of care. It must never be transported directly by hand due to risk of accidental injury from incorrectly disposed sharp items, or of transmission of blood-borne diseases. Hospital wards usually possess three colour-coded bins for different categories of waste, lined by corresponding colour-coded bags that are bio-degradable, leak proof and have a monogram of biohazard symbol. In the case of coronavirus-specific waste, the precautions are stricter given what we know about the virus: that it can stay on some surfaces for long, and still remain infectious. Guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board for handling biomedical waste of Covid-19 patients state that two bags are to be used for the collection of waste to ensure adequate strength and no leaks.Each morning, Dehury dons his Personal Protective Equipment comprising a coverall, hat, gloves, goggles, N95 mask, footwears and boot cover, before he goes up to the ward. A dedicated bin, labelled ‘Covid-19’, is kept in the storage room that can only be handled by authorised staff like Dehury. Dehury then enters the highly-infectious isolation ward to pick up the soiled linen.“After loading the colour coded bags onto a battery-operated vehicle, I drive it off to the biomedical waste facility where the vehicle is first washed with sodium hypochlorite solution.” At the site, Dehury also discards his own PPE, but keeps the N-95 mask on. “While the rest of the PPE are disposed of everyday, the mask is reused after disinfection,” he said.Until recently, there were two patients in the Covid ward, including a 72-year-old man who died last week. Another 60-year-old patient from Bhubaneswar who was critical, is now stable and likely to be discharged soon as his test results have now returned negative.Additional medical superintendent of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, Pravas Tripathy said Dehury makes him proud. “Many of the housekeeping staff were scared of catching the infection and we had a hard time in making them understand that there is little risk (if they follow the precautions),” he said.Dehury earns Rs 12,000 a month and while a hospital official said that there were plans to “give a financial incentive to people like Dehury to keep them motivated,” nothing has materialised as yet. The hospital has converted one multi-storied hostel inside the campus to house all staff engaged in the Covid ward where 6-7 staff nurses and other attendants are staying. Dehury was given an offer to stay, but he chose to stay with his family.After returning home at the end of his duty hours, he dips his clothes in dettol liquid and hot water. He then takes bath in soap and warm water. After having his meal, he heads to the verandah. “We have just one room. So if I sleep in the room, my father and brother sleep outside. So at times I sleep in the verandah while they sleep inside to maintain maximum distance,” he said.In the tight quarters of his house in Suanga Nuasahi village, home to at least 300-odd people, it is difficult to maintain social distancing — one of the foremost requirements to prevent the spread of infection. Even the other residents of his village are trying to keep their distance from him and his family.Soon after he began working as a biomedical waste collector, a photo in which he wore the coverall and mask began to circulate on WhatsApp. “After some friends in the village saw the photograph, villagers pressured me to not report for duty. I simply asked them if any of them were infected by Covid-19 virus, who would look after them? The villagers agreed but asked me to not mingle with other youth in the village. My house is at one end of the village and so it does not affect me. Earlier I used to play cricket with my friends. Now I no longer do that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-a-cleaner-became-covid-19-wards-waste-collector-in-odisha/story-Yr9W17jPH2huJFVOj4y0UL.html
17-04-2020||India||In relief to small businesses, tax refunds worth Rs 5204 cr released in 10 days: CBDT||The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Friday said that income tax refunds to nearly 8.2 lakh small businesses (proprietors, firms, corporates and trusts) worth Rs 5,204 crore have been issued since April 8, 2020. The Board said these income tax refunds would help MSMEs to carry on their business activities without pay cuts of employees or layoffs in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.The CBDT said that following the Union government’s decision on April 8, the income tax department has till date issued nearly 14 lakh refunds up to Rs 5 lakh each in order to help taxpayers deal with the current situation. With its focus on providing relief to small businesses in the MSME sector, CBDT will further issue refunds to the tune of Rs 7,760 crore soon..The Board on Friday reiterated its request that in 1.74 lakh cases, responses are awaited from taxpayers regarding reconciliation with their outstanding tax demand for which a reminder email has been sent asking them to respond within 7 days so that the refund can be processed earliest. Taxpayers can respond online through the taxpayer e-filing account on www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in.After providing relief to smaller taxpayers hit by the coronavirus pandemic, the government may also extend the benefit of accelerated tax refunds to large taxpayers and companies that are also looking at fiscal incentives from the Centre to have enough liquidity to survive the current crisis. On April 8, the government had announced that it has directed the income tax department to clear all pending income tax refunds up to Rs 5 lakh immediately to benefit around 14 lakh taxpayers. It also decided to issue all pending GST and Customs refunds to provide relief to around 1 lakh business entities. The total refund to be granted under the scheme was estimated at Rs 18,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-relief-to-small-businesses-tax-refunds-worth-rs-5204-cr-released-in-10-days-cbdt/story-ossx0o5B2wGQNOdGZlbckJ.html
17-04-2020||India||Containment operations to be scaled down if no secondary Covid-19 case for 4 weeks: Govt||Containment operations will be scaled down if no secondary positive case of COVID-19 is reported from a quarantine zone for at least four weeks after the last confirmed test has been isolated and all his contacts have been followed up for 28 days, the Union Health Ministry said. According to the ministry’s “Updated containment plan for large outbreaks COVID-19”, a containment operation (large outbreak or cluster) is deemed to be over 28 days from the date the last case in that zone tests negative. The closing of the surveillance for the clusters could be independent of one another provided there is no geographic continuity between clusters. However the surveillance will continue for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI). States shall ensure that all required steps are taken to contain clusters within the large outbreak and chain of transmission is broken, it said. The document stated that in India also, clusters and large outbreaks have been noted in parts of the country and unless they are contained in time, the risk of further spread remains very high. Large number of cases has been reported from Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The Centre has declared 170 hotspots ---123 hotspot districts with large outbreaks and 47 hotspot districts with clusters. Besides, it has identified 207 non-hotspot districts with clusters. In a bid to utilize the extended lockdown period to the maximum extent to contain the spread of coronavirus, states have been asked by the ministry to classify districts witnessing higher number of cases or high growth rate as hotspots, districts where some cases have been found as non-hotspots, and those which have reported no cases as green zones. According to the Health Ministry’s document, “containment for large outbreaks through geographic quarantine strategy calls for near absolute interruption of movement of people to and from a relatively large defined area where there is single large outbreak or multiple foci of local transmission” of COVID-19. In simple terms, it is a barrier erected around the focus of infection. Geographic quarantine shall be applicable to such areas reporting large outbreak and/or multiple clusters of COVID-19 spread over multiple blocks of one or more districts that are contiguous based on the distribution of cases and contacts. According to the plan, the authorities will do extensive contact tracing and active search for cases in containment zone, test all suspect cases and high-risk contacts, isolate all suspect or confirmed cases, implement social distancing measures and intensive risk communication as part of the cluster containment strategy. For large outbreaks amenable to containment, the documents stated that the strategy will remain the same but vary in extent depending upon spread and response to be mounted to contain it. Geographic quarantine and containment strategy will include defining the area of operation, active surveillance for cases and contacts in the identified geographic zone, expanding laboratory capacity for testing all suspect cases, high risk contacts and SARI cases and operationalising surge capacities created for isolation (COVID-19 hospitals/blocks) to hospitalise and manage all suspect or confirmed cases. It will also include implementation of social distancing measures with strict perimeter control, providing chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine to all asymptomatic healthcare workers and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases and further intensification of risk communication through audio, social and visual media. “The objective of this containment plan is to stop the chain of transmission thus reducing the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19,” the ministry said. The death toll due to coronavirus rose to 420 and the number of cases in the country climbed to 13,387 on Friday, according to the Union Health Ministry. However, according to a PTI tally based on reports from the states, the total number of cases was 13,201 while 1,594 patients had recovered. The death toll stood at 444. There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the number of deaths announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/containment-operations-to-be-scaled-down-if-no-secondary-covid-19-case-for-4-weeks-govt/story-OyFXBX7dlhGFWxfpwWrfKL.html

His sister has a hilarious response||Telangana Rashtra Samithi working president and state Information Technology minister KT Rama Rao’s answer to his follower on the social media evoked hilarious responses from the Twitterati.What added to the fun was a witty comment from his sister and former Nizamabad MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha on her brother’s reply.One of KTR’s followers, Sharath Chandra posted a message on Twitter seeking to know whether the Telangana government would open barber shops after April 20, when some of the relaxations announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi would come into force.“@KTRTRS Sir a sincere query: Any thoughts on opening barber shops or salons post 20 Apr? My wife is eager to try her hand on haircut and if that happens, I have a strong feeling I’ll need to stay home even after the lockdown is lifted,” Sharath tweeted.The minister pointed out how cricketer Virat Kohli had shown the solution for such problems. “Hey, when Virat Kohli could let his wife style his hair, why don’t you?”The reply evoked a response from KTR’s followers who, too, posted funny messages. “Sir, what about singles then?” asked a follower. “Sir, every wife is not similar to Anushka Sharma,” said another.“In that case, #Modi ji should give another task to all women in India to try new haircuts on their husbands. We are eager to see the results of #Lockdown after that,” was another funny comment.However, it was KTR’s sister Kavitha who outwitted her brother and his followers. ““Annayya .. Bhabi ki kuda chance isthunnava (Brother, are you giving such chance to my sister-in-law as well)?!” she commented.Kavitha’s funny comment earned her a lot of applause. “Super Question Akka (sister),” said one of her followers.“Amid Coronavirus Pandemic, KCR’s family is giving us some hilarious moments,” commented another. “Ma’am Crazzyyyyy,” posted another follower.’And there was a suggestion, too. “Hope after this question, he might be thinking of giving approval to open barber shops now,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-haircut-query-led-to-twitter-banter-between-ktr-his-sister-kavitha/story-eouCYGDiho3VDEtRrejpjL.html

Similarly, Rohingyas living in Shram Vihar, Shaheen Bagh, Delhi who had gone for TJ activities, have not returned to their camps”.It further stated that presence of Rohingya Muslims after attending Tablighi Jamaat work has also been reported from Derabassi, Punjab and Jammu area.According to an estimate by the government, there are around 40,000 Rohingyas living in camps across several states in India while 17,500 of them are registered as refugees with the office of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).The MHA, in its notification dated April 15, asked states that “Rohingya Muslims and their contacts need to be screened for Covid-19. Accordingly, necessary measures may be taken in this regard on priority”.A senior official who didn’t wish to be named said – “Tablighi Jamaat has already been the biggest hotspot for Covid-19 in India so far and if Rohingyas who attended it living in camps across states are also affected, then it will be a bigger problem.”According to a reply by the MHA in Lok Sabha in June last year, “The MHA has held a number of meetings and video conferences at various levels and has impressed upon the state governments and other stakeholders to identify illegal migrants including Rohingyas, watch their movements and cancel any Indian documents such as PAN cards, aadhar cards, driving licenses, ration cards etc. fraudulently obtained by them.”The government has officially taken a stand, even before the Supreme Court, that Rohingyas pose a security threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-asks-states-to-trace-rohingyas-who-attended-tablighi-jamaat-meet/story-4xAgkLgyNE35aIv2ItGo1N.html

At least 10 people were discharged and the number of people under observation also came down to 78,980.The lone positive case was reported from Kozhikode district in north Kerala. Out of 395 positive cases in the state 255 have discharged and in one week more than 50,000 were taken out of the observation list, the CM’s office said.At one point the number of people under observation was around 2 lakh. In one week 32 positive cases were reported in the state but the number of people discharged was 131.“The situation is well under control now. But it doesn’t mean we have to lift restrictions. We have to continue our surveillance and vigil,” said CM Pinarayi Vijayan in a statement.Kerala was the first to report a coronavirus case in the county in January, when a China-returned medical student tested positive. But the state’s track, trace and treat method has paid it rich dividends. Currently, 140 people are in hospitals and going by the present trend their numbers will dip to 100 by next week, health officials said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-kerala-reports-one-solitary-case-78-980-under-observation/story-wynekQ5xwH58vQPwzDqhkI.html

The baby tested positive on Friday, while his other family members have tested negative,” said Dr. Chauhan. Dr. Chauhan said that the staff and the patients who came in contact with the doctor are being traced and they would be quarantined at the earliest.Dr. Anurag Agarwal, Uttarakhand’s nodal officer for Covid-19 and an employee at the Government Doon Medical College Hospital, said that the doctors are charting out a treatment plan for the infected baby.“The baby was always at high risk, as his father had earlier tested Covid-19 positive. The baby doesn’t have the immunity of an adult. We need to ensure that he isn’t exposed to any other infection and can be on the road to recovery at the earliest,” Dr Agarwal said.Earlier this week, on Tuesday, two persons from in Haridwar district, who had attended Tablighi Jamaat’s international congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi held between March 13 and 15, tested Covid-19 positive.All Covid-19 positive cases reported from Uttarakhand since April 2 are linked Jamaat attendees.

17-04-2020||India||Karnataka hints at allowing tech firms to start limited operations from Monday||The Karnataka government indicated on Friday that information technology and bio-technology companies could be allowed to start limited operations from Monday.Speaking to reporters after a meeting with representatives of companies, deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan said while the lockdown would continue, technology firms could start operations after April 20 with 50% of employees coming in on alternate days on the condition that all steps are taken to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus.His remarks came against the backdrop of Karnataka recording a substantial increase in Covid-19 cases for the third consecutive day. According to state primary and secondary education minister Suresh Kumar, 44 new cases - the largest single day jump - were reported since Thursday.Karnataka exports $40 billion in technology services, and the sector is the largest employer in the state’s organised sector.Narayan said employees of tech firms wouldn’t require special passes. “I doubt whether there would be the pass culture after April 20. Anyway, there is no public transport, no metro, no buses. Only one person can travel on two-wheelers, and there are limits on how many can travel in a car,” he said.“If the technology companies want, we can provide sanitised public transport buses.”Narayan said representatives of IT companies had assured him that hygiene norms, wearing of masks, use of sanitisers, social distancing and other government directives would be strictly implemented.“They have said they will undertake screening and testing, as well as other responsibilities,” he said, adding the economy couldn’t be permanently shut.However, chief minister BS Yediyurappa, speaking at a different media interaction, sounded a more cautious note and said the matter of allowing the technology industry to resume operations was under consideration. A decision will be made over the next couple of days based on the Centre’s guidelines, he added.Primary and secondary education minister Suresh Kumar said the 44 new Covid-19 cases had taken the state’s cumulative total to 359. This follows 38 cases on Thursday and 19 cases on Wednesday.The 359 cases include 13 deaths and 88 people who were discharged after being treated.Briefing the media, Kumar acknowledged the trend was worrisome but said Karnataka had done well when compared to the national figures.Kumar said the average number of tests had increased from 500 a day to 2,000 a day. The Centre has dispatched 12,400 rapid testing kits imported from China to the state. The state government has fixed a price of Rs 2,250 for each test by a private hospital, Kumar said.Asked about the violation of the lockdown in Kalburgi during a temple chariot pulling ceremony for which hundreds had gathered, Kumar said no decision had been made on conducting mass tests there.An expert committee of doctors advising and guiding the state government said earlier on Friday that early detection and treatment were key to ensuring public health. The panel said on an average, people were coming in for treatment four day after the first symptoms appeared. The committee appealed to people to come in earlier.The state has also sought clearance from the Indian Council of Medical Research to conduct plasma therapy, which is considered effective in treating Covid-19.In a separate development, police carried out a mild lathi charge at Savanur in Haveri district after a large number of people gathered for Friday prayers in spite of the Wakf board’s appeal not to do so.Three men drowned while swimming in Tungabhadra river in Bellary district in violation of the lockdown. A case was registered in Huvina Hadagali police station and a search was launched to retrieve their bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/k-taka-hints-at-allowing-tech-firms-to-start-limited-operations-from-monday/story-qZ00Jki64Za4nD7U829dOL.html
17-04-2020||India||Lockdown, hailstorms and insects push mango farmers in Bengal’s Malda to the brink||Come April, and all of India eagerly awaits the arrival of the first mangoes of the season. However, due to their inability to spray pesticides in a timely manner during the lockdown and hailstorms, which destroyed a sizeable part of Bengal’s annual mango yield, mango farmers in the state’s Malda district are staring at substantial losses this year. And if the lockdown is extended beyond May 3 - when harvesting is due to begin, they say their losses will spiral astronomically because they will be unable to ship their yield in time.Spread over 31,000 hectares, Malda’s orchards produce more than 250 varieties of India’s cherished fruit -half the state’s annual yield - which are shipped to Kolkata, other Bengal districts and some states like Assam. There are about 400,000 people directly or indirectly involved in the production and trade of mangoes in the district.“Initially, this appeared to be a good year for production. But because farmers couldn’t spray insecticides due to the lockdown, part of the crop has been ruined, “ said President of Malda Mango Merchants Association, Ujjal Saha.Mango farmer Jakir Mollah of Bamongola is a desolate man. “A huge quantity of our fruit dropped off the trees during recent hailstorms, and we couldn’t even collect them in time because of the lockdown. Now, we have no idea how we will sell the final harvest.”Mango merchants’ association president, Ujjal Saha, explains that this is the time of year, when thousands of labourers make wooden crates to ship the mangoes. “But since labourers could not carry out this task this year, we don’t know how we will ship the fruit. And once harvesting starts, there won’t be time to assemble the boxes,” he said. “We may be compelled to use ordinary baskets,” he added.Saha warns that the business will suffer losses to the tune of several crore rupees, if the lockdown is extended beyond May 3. “Usually the production hovers around 3.5 lakh metric tons. This year it may come down to 1.5 to 2 lakh metric tons. The business will suffer,” he said.Bengal’s mango farmers were initially enthused by reports that the postal department was helping their counterparts in another state to deliver their yield to customers.“We heard that mango farmers in Karnataka are being helped by the postal department to ship their harvest. But it appears impossible to replicate that model in Malda. We cannot depend on the usual procedures of the postal department. Being perishable items, mangoes cannot be stored for long, so shipping needs to be fast. If there is delay because of the postal department, we will suffer,” said Saha. Deputy director (in charge) of Malda’s horticulture department, Babai Das, too, dismissed the likelihood of the postal department coming to the rescue of Malda’s beleaguered farmers. “So far, we don’t have any plan to seek help from them. We are aware that our farmers have suffered because of the lockdown. We are now issuing passes to them, so that they can visit their orchards and spray insecticide.”Bengal’s chief post-master general, Gautam Bhattacharya, would still like to help. “In a similar situation about two decades ago, the postal department did help Malda’s mango farmers. And we are ready to do so again this time. However, we usually ship small quantities, so using trucks to ship on a commercial scale is always cheaper.”Bhattacharya concedes that perishable good like mangoes may suffer because the railway’s parcel vans are not temperature-controlled. “Moreover, given the the present circumstances, deliveries may be delayed. Usually products like these are shipped to other states on passenger flights. But even those are not operating right now.”Once a major exporter to the western states and foreign countries, Malda farmers say that varieties from Maharashtra, the Alphonso in particular, have taken over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-hailstorms-and-insects-push-mango-farmers-in-bengal-s-malda-to-the-brink/story-C5yiTGQSwpixUHiWjn1BxJ.html
17-04-2020||India||Imran Khan hits mute on Saarc Covid-19 pledge, India sends $1.7 mn relief||India, which had pledged $10 million to help other South Asian countries tackle the Covid-19 pandemic last month, has already delivered medicines and other relief material worth $1.7 million, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.India has used its Saarc Covid-19 Emergency Fund to send drugs, medical supplies and machines to Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka. This amount of $1.7 million does not include the transportation of the relief commodities, which has, in some sectors, translated into 2-3 times the value of the relief material as New Delhi chartered flights to quickly reach the material to their destination.Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the other regional leader to have started delivering on her $1.5 million promise, dispatched a shipload of relief material to Maldives this week.Also watch | COVID-19 | Doubling rate reduced since lockdown, growth factor down 40%: GovtPrime Minister Narendra Modi had during a video conference of heads of government of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation member countries on March 15 proposed voluntary contributions to help others in the region.PM Modi, when he proposed the fund, had committed to spend $ 10 million, followed by Sri Lanka ($5 million) and then Bangladesh ($1.5 million). In all, except Pakistan, the fund has firm commitments of $18.8 million.Imran Khan had absented himself from the video conference. Islamabad was, instead, represented by its de facto health minister Zafar Mirza.Zafar Mirza, whose performance as Pakistan’s key man to tackle the coronavirus pandemic had recently come in for sharp criticism from its Supreme Court, had also created a flutter at the March 15 Saarc conference when he raised Kashmir at this discussion.The idea of setting up the fund, as the external affairs ministry later explained, was that each country sets aside a certain amount of money that it would spend to help each other. “It is for each SAARC Member State to decide on the timing, manner and implementation of their Saarc Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund commitments,” foreign ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava, had said.Pakistan’s commitment to spend $3 million on other countries was followed by a rider that their fund should be channelled via the SAARC secretariat based in Kathmandu.Diplomats based in the SAARC secretariat in Kathmandu and other officials told Hindustan Times that they had not received information from Islamabad about a single dollar being spent towards coronavirus mitigation efforts by Pakistan.“Maybe, Islamabad is still waiting for the distribution modalities to be worked out by the SAARC secretariat,” said a senior official based in Kathmandu, a trifle derisively.The official also confirmed that “no such modalities, as sought by Pakistan for the fund had been worked out, and no such formal fund had to be created”.It is not clear why Pakistan hasn’t delivered on its pledge. But Pakistan is in a precarious financial situation due to the pandemic. Khan had put out a video appeal this week that asked the international community to give developing countries debt relief.On its part, New Delhi has supplied hydroxychloroquine tablets, paracetamol, active pharmaceutical ingredients, personal protection equipment, ventilators and masks to Saarc countries. Officials recall how PM Modi had insisted that the first countries to receive medical supplies would be Saarc countries, then Indo-Pacific countries apart from other countries that urgently needed the medicinesBangladesh, so far, is the only other Saarc country to have come to the rescue of a neighbour. On April 15, Bangladesh sent a ship carrying 100 metric tons of food and medical material to Maldives.According to available data, Bangladesh supplied 20,000 personal protection equipment, 900 goggles, 5,000 hand sanitizers and 80 tons of food items and essential medicines to Maldives.Bangladesh has also supplied 12,000 hand sanitizers to the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-spends-1-7-million-from-saarc-covid-19-fund-imran-khan-is-again-awol/story-A7zuJGOQeRb91uJphN4ESM.html
17-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Centre asks states to list all registered doctors||The Medical Council of India (MCI) has written to state councils to compile a list of doctors registered with them as part of an exercise to take stock of human resources available to treat Covid-19 patients.The letter, sent to state councils last week by MCI’s board of governors, sought an updated list of registered medical practitioners and their contact details.“The Medical Council of India has been entrusted for ensuring availability of registered medical practitioners (registered under the Indian Medical Council Act 1956/State Medical Council Acts) for tackling Covid-19 pandemic. It is requested to share the updated list of registered medical practitioners available in your medical council…,” said the directive to the state councils.Also watch | COVID-19 | Doubling rate reduced since lockdown, growth factor down 40%: GovtApart from the name and registration number of each doctor, the state councils have also been asked to provide mobile phone numbers, email IDs and contact addresses.“This information should be sent to the MCI as early as possible, in view of the prevalent situation. This information will be further shared with the government authorities for their use, when required,” the letter said.After receiving the MCI’s directive, states councils have started compiling the data. Girish Tyagi, member of the Delhi Medical Council, said: “We are working on compiling the list. Once a medical practitioner registers, the name stays for at least five years in the state register, and some of them are PG students from other states who return to their respective state after their education is over.“We need to weed out those names from the list, and with skeletal staff at our disposal right now, it might take a little longer to segregate those who are still practising in Delhi.”India has 1.1 million allopathic doctors registered with the Board of Governors, State Medical Councils, and Medical Council as of December 2019.“Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 9.26 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service,” said minister of state for health Ashwini Kumar Choubey in the Lok Sabha.For a population of 1.36 billion, this makes the doctor-population ratio 1:1,457, lower than the WHO’s recommended norm of 1:1,000.For people in rural areas completely dependent on government hospitals and clinics, the government allopathic doctor-patient ratio is 1:10,926.With Covid-19 cases rising, the government is gearing up to upgrade infrastructure and add to the human resource pool to deal with the situation.Another directive sent to all state chief secretaries by the Union health ministry last week was for using the services of ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists or postgraduate trainees for collecting samples for Covid-19 testing, as many states are facing a manpower shortage for collecting samples.“You are aware that the country is in the midst of an unprecedented outbreak of Covid-19. One of the key components of our strategy to combat this outbreak is contact tracing and collection of nose and throat swab samples of potentially infected persons. There is an urgent need of trained and qualified personnel to collect these samples and the number of such persons needs to be augmented significantly,” said the health ministry’s directive.“All States/UTs are, therefore, requested to organise collection of Covid-19 case samples by using the services of ENT specialists and residents. The services of these professionals working in all government and private medical colleges of the states may be drafted for this purpose,” the directive added.A health ministry official, on condition of anonymity, said: “While the labs are enough, there was felt a shortage of trained people to collect samples. The experts discussed the matter and thought of using ENT specialists for the purpose as they already are trained in handling diseases of the nose and throat. The states have passed on the instructions to all medical institutions in this regard, and the process of involving specialists has begun.”Experts said roping in trained people for the job will help.“It is definitely a good idea as ENTs are more skilled to do the job. The problem is bigger in remote areas, where involving them should surely help,” said NN Mathur, ENT professor and former principal of Vardhman Mahavir Medical College (Safdarjung Hospital).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-centre-asks-states-to-list-all-registered-doctors/story-KBQeMnUHOBH6wcv6Y4d1rI.html
17-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Congress asks Delhi govt to waive off power, water charges||The Congress on Friday urged Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to waive off fixed power charges and water bills for all establishments that have been closed because of the Covid-19 lockdown.In a 10-point charter of demands, the party also demanded the Delhi government shouldn’t charge school fees from students, and pay salaries to teachers in aided schools and MSME workers.Senior Congress leader Ajay Maken insisted that migrants and daily wage workers should be given incentives and the government should proactively take steps to help those in distress in Delhi because of the Covid-19 crisis.Addressing a news conference through video conference, Maken sought standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be notified for delivery workers in the national capital to stop the spread of the virus through them.All 89 quarantined people who came in contact with a pizza delivery boy, feared to be infected with the coronavirus, should be immediately tested, he said.Maken pointed out the delivery boy was sent back by several hospitals without being tested. He said testing should be ramped up in the national capital, and asked if Delhi had entered the community transmission stage since 135 people have been kept under investigation.Migrants, being the backbone of any city, should immediately be given Rs 7,500 a month to help them cope with the crisis and make them feel safe in Delhi and other towns, he added.Maken also demanded provision of free rations for two months to the poor and vulnerable, advance payment of pensions to senior citizens and widows, and risk allowance to sanitation and frontline health workers.He also sought an unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000 for the unemployed in the national capital.Maken attacked the Delhi government for giving the go-ahead to private schools to charge one month’s tuition fee and said the state should bear a major part of expenses on the salaries of teachers.“It is wrong to ask private schools to take a month’s fee. How will the parents pay the fee when there is a lockdown? The Delhi government should pay 75% of expenses borne on teachers’ salaries so that these schools get relief and waive three months’ fees,” added Maken.Earlier in the day, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia announced that no private school in the national capital could hike its fees or charge anything from parents other than one month’s tuition fee.Maken also claimed 55 health workers in Delhi had tested positive for the coronavirus so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-congress-asks-delhi-govt-to-waive-off-power-water-charges/story-r6ZBT4mfB0IM8ah0L4vN7L.html

So far, Bhubaneswar has accounted for 46 of the 60 positive cases in Odisha resulting in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare tagging Khurda district among the 170 Covid-19 hotspot districts.Also watch | COVID-19 | Doubling rate reduced since lockdown, growth factor down 40%: GovtTripathy said the testing of 5000 samples in Bhubaneswar may be one of the biggest in terms of samples per million population if compared to cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Pune. “We are trying to bring all available RT-PCR machines in the state to Bhubaneswar and increase the testing capacities of all the 6 Covid-19 laboratories in the state including 3 in Bhubaneswar. The testing will be ramped up several times over,” he said.Officials said the testing in campaign mode is in line with PM Modi’s provision of easing restrictions in areas with no Covid-19 cases from April 20. Of the 7577 samples tested in Odisha so far, Bhubaneswar alone has accounted for 1958 samples, around 38 per cent of the total samples. With 46 cases, Bhubaneswar’s positive to samples tested ratio is 2.4 per cent.Odisha has been posting encouraging results since the last 2 days with 1940 samples collected from different parts of the state testing negative. Of the 60 positive cases, 19 have been discharged.The samples to be collected through static and mobile camps would be taken by technicians wearing PPEs on a four-tier priority basis from people based on the risk level. The top priority groups would be people with SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Illness) and healthcare workers deployed at Covid-19 hotspots. Police personnel, sanitation workers and other Covid-19 workers belong to the second tier. The third priority category has senior citizens with co-morbidity conditions like diabetes and hypertension and some samples will be collected at random.“We are seeing that people in the priority group are reluctant to give samples. If anyone in Bhubaneswar is in the priority list, then they should come to camps voluntarily. Or else we may have to use force,” the chief secretary said, appealing to all RWAs and puja committee members to help in the sample collection. To carry out the increased testing, Bhubaneswar has been divided into three zones in which senior officers would be put as Covid-19 observers.The government also announced that spitting in public places would now be a compoundable offence and violators will be penalized. “While a Rs 200 fine will be collected from each violator in the first 3 times thereafter the violator will be slapped with a Rs 500 fine. The block extension officer, additional tehsildar, ASI police and municipality ward officer will be assigned to enforce the rule,” he said.In another move, officials said the Centre is planning to collect random samples from a population of 10,000 in all districts unaffected by Covid-19 to get an epidemiological estimate of the spread of the disease and ways to prevent it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-drop-red-zone-tag-bhubaneswar-begins-collecting-5000-samples-for-covid-19-tests/story-gSf4o2yjGxPIwLkuMeLucI.html
17-04-2020||India||‘Community transmission threat looms, no crowding in markets’: Bengal CM||Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, apprehending community transmission in the state, on Friday urged people to avoid crowding the markets and hinted at stricter implementation of lockdown rules to combat coronavirus. Over the last three days, 63 persons tested positive for novel coronavirus infection. The state’s cumulative figure of Covid-19 positive cases rose from 69 on April 4 to 255 on April 16, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare.“The prospect of community transmission looms large if we do not implement the lockdown strictly. I don’t want to see crowds in the markets. Armed police personnel will also be deployed in markets if necessary,” she said on Friday. Also watch | COVID-19 | Doubling rate reduced since lockdown, growth factor down 40%: GovtThe CM said that every market must have hand sanitisers for people to use before they step in. The administration has relocated most of the markets to spacious areas nearby over the past three days. There was a significant change in the chief minister’s approach. The chief minister had so long been insisting that the state would have a ‘lockdown with a humane face’ and instructed the police not to indulge in excesses.However, on Friday, she said, “Whoever breaks lockdown will face legal action. We will land in great danger if the lockdown is not strictly followed.”She also took a dig at governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, though without naming him, for seeking central paramilitary forces to enforce lockdown in Bengal. Incidentally, Dhankhar on April 15 had written in a social media post that the state should requisition central forces, a demand that was later supported by Bharatiya Janata Party national secretary Rahul Sinha, among others.On Friday, the chief minister said, “Some people are seeking central paramilitary forces for the sake of petty politics. Why should we need central forces when the state police are doing so well?”BJP leaders, however, attributed the chief minister’s toughening of stand to their effort in putting pressure on the state government. “The Centre had warned the state. The governor had raised an alarm. We have been persistently raising the issue. All these factors have led to her waking up from a slumber,” said BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh. Banerjee also flagged the issue of infiltration through the Bangladesh border and said, “People keep entering through the borders with Bangladesh in 24-Parganas. It must be ensured that no one enters through the border with Bangladesh.” The Border Security Force (BSF), however, said that the border has remained entirely sealed. “We are maintaining a strict vigil and there has been no case of infiltration from Bangladesh,” said S S Guleria, spokesperson of BSF South Bengal Frontier.She said that the situation in Howrah district “is ultra-sensitive” and that some wards in Kolkata are also ‘red zones’. “No one will be allowed to enter or move out of red zones,” said the chief minister. Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said that 81% of the state’s Covid-19 positive cases are from urban areas, especially urban Howrah and northern and central part of Kolkata.Banerjee has fixed targets for three weeks for the state and district administrations to bring back red zones into green zones.“Kolkata and Howrah, will have to come back to the orange zone within 14 days and then in another seven days to the green zone. Kolkata and Howrah are a challenge for us,” she added. She also warned the top brass of some districts which presently have very few or no cases that she would not spare them if there is any outbreak in their districts.The state, however, has allowed inter-district movement from Friday. Commenting on this, the chief minister said, “Even though there is still no inter-state movement of migrant workers, inter-district movement has started from Friday. So we have to take special care,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-transmission-threat-looms-don-t-want-people-in-markets-bengal-cm/story-cz6X3t2ohymStxH4CxQQVO.html
17-04-2020||India||How the Covid-19 crisis may be delaying 5 key cases in Supreme Court||The Covid-19 lockdown has affected the functioning of courts across the country. Most courts are only taking up extremely urgent cases (which directly and immediately impact liberty and livelihood of people) and these are heard through video conference.The Supreme Court too has been functioning in a limited way since March 23. This has led to a delay in the hearing of crucial cases such as those listed below:Citizenship (Amendment) ActOne of the most important cases before the Supreme Court that has been delayed is the challenge to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). More than 150 petitions on this issue are pending in the top court. A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant had issued notice to the central government on December 18, but refused to stay the operation of the law, a prayer the court said would be considered later.The case was last heard on February 18, when the court granted time to the central government to file its response. The Centre, in its response on March 17, said the CAA is intended to tackle religious persecution in specific countries and won’t affect the rights of any Indian citizens.Also watch | COVID-19 | Doubling rate reduced since lockdown, growth factor down 40%: GovtSenior counsel and Congress leader Kapil Sibal mentioned the matter on March 5, requesting the court to hear arguments on an interim prayer to stay the law.Bobde asked Sibal to mention the matter after the Holi vacation, which lasted from March 9 to 14. But the court didn’t function in a full-fledged manner after the vacation because of the Covid-19 crisis.The case, according to the Supreme Court’s website, is scheduled to be listed on April 21. However, this in all likelihood may not happen due to the lockdown.Article 370The challenge to the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, related to the special status of Jammu and Kashmir is another case pending in the apex court.The court is hearing at least 23 petitions challenging the Central government’s August 2019 decision to scrap Kashmir’s special status.Article 370 stated the Constitution and laws made by the Parliament can be applied to Kashmir only with the concurrence of the government of Jammu and Kashmir. After the scrapping of Article 370, Kashmir was divided into the two union territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.The hearing of the matter started on December 10 before a bench headed by justice NV Ramana and comprising justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, BR Gavai and Surya Kant.The matter was last listed on March 2, when a five-judge Constitution bench, in a 42-page judgment, declined to refer the case to a larger bench of seven judges. It hasn’t been heard after that.Rights vs Faith (Sabarimala case)Another important case, slated for hearing in March, was the legal questions on the entry of women into Sabarimala temple in Kerala and other gender-related matters in Islam and Zoroastrianism.Chief Justice Bobde said in open court on March 5 the matter would be heard by a nine-judge bench from March 16.But the court functioned only in a restricted manner in the week of March 16 and the case wasn’t taken up. Subsequently, the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24 and the court went into complete shutdown. The review petitions challenging the Supreme Court’s 2018 judgment permitting entry of women into Sabarimala temple will be decided on the basis of the outcome of the case before the nine-judge bench.Use of money bill routeThe contentious issue of the government adopting the money bill route to get laws passed in Parliament too is pending in the Supreme Court.This crucial case has to be heard by a bench of seven judges though there is no clarity on when it will be taken up.A money bill originates in Lok Sabha, and once passed there by a simple majority, is sent to the Rajya Sabha for its recommendations. These recommendations on money bills aren’t binding on the Lok Sabha, which may choose to reject it.The government, which doesn’t have a majority in Rajya Sabha, has used the money bill route on more than one occasion to pass contentious laws.In a challenge to the Finance Act 2017, passed as a money bill, a five-judge bench of the court held on November 13, 2019 that its earlier judgment in the Aadhaar case approving the money bill route needs to be reconsidered. It, therefore, referred the issue to a bench of seven judges.The decision in this case could impact several laws, including the Aadhaar Act passed by the Parliament as a money bill.Creamy layerThe “creamy layer” controversy is another case awaiting hearing by the top court.The Central government has urged the Supreme Court to reconsider its 2018 judgment in the case of Jarnail Singh, in which the court ruled the principle of creamy layer, previously applicable to Other Backward Castes (OBCs), should be applied to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for reservation in promotions.Creamy layer is the term used to describe better-off individuals among OBCs ineligible for reservations according to the Mandal Commission’s provisions. It is determined based on economic parameters.For OBCs, the creamy layer is households with an annual income in excess of Rs 8 lakh a year.The centre is against the application of this principle to SC and ST communities on the ground that they have been discriminated against for centuries and should get reservation benefits despite economic advancement.The case is slated to be listed on April 21 according to the Supreme Court’s website, though that is unlikely to happen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-covid-19-crisis-may-be-delaying-5-key-cases-in-supreme-court/story-qF2gsyFsyPNZ3NCK1NGcXP.html

He alleged landlord Hiren Dey evicted Athena Limboo, who belongs to Dikchu in Sikkim, on April 2.Limboo was suffering from “regular flu” and this was confirmed by a doctor, Bhutia said. He added there should be zero tolerance for such cases of discrimination.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageIn a statement issued after filing the police complaint, Bhutia said, “She was asked to leave her rented room in Pradhan Nagar, Siliguri, when she had fever. She was left outside her house for three to four hours with no help. The doctor, in writing, informed that it was only the regular flu.” Bhutia further alleged in the complaint that Limboo was asked to return by the landlord on April 14 but was denied entry to the rented accommodation. “She was asked to pay the rent and leave,” Bhutia alleged.Dey said, “Three women were staying together as tenants in my house. After the lockdown was announced, all of them left. One of them came back after 15 days. I asked her to return after the lockdown was over. She left but came back with some people and wanted to enter the premises forcibly. I called the police and she left with her belongings.”Limboo said she was a fan of Bhutia and decided to seek his help after getting his contact details from friends. She said she had been admitted to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH) with flu for a day.NBMCH is the main hospital for Covid-19 cases in north Bengal, and has its own sample testing facility. Biswajit Ghosal, the inspector in-charge of Pradhan Nagar police station, said, “I asked the landlord to allow the woman to return to the building. We are looking into the matter.”Limboo said she had been provided shelter at the Paharia Bhawan run by Gorkhaland Territorial Administration at Matigara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sikkim-teen-evicted-from-bengal-home-over-regular-flu-bhaichung-bhutia/story-nkxe94fV6Eeq48tM3jJNtI.html
17-04-2020||India||MHA allows collection, processing of forest produce, plantation of spices||The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has allowed the collection, harvesting, and processing of minor forest produce (MFP) and non-timber forest produce (NTFP) by Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities and forest dwellers. It has also allowed plantation of bamboo, coconut, areca nut, cocoa, and spices. Their harvest, processing, packaging, sale, and marketing have also been allowed.MFP and NTFPs include bamboo, canes, fodder, leaves, gum, wax, dyes, resins and many forms of food including nuts and wild fruits, honey, lac, and tusser. The MHA exempted these activities on Friday while exercising its powers under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which has been in force because of the ongoing nationwide lockdown till May 3 to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. But those working in tribal areas maintain that the order has come late because the MFP season is almost over.“The most important season for the sale of MFP and NTFPs is April to May when important produce like sal seeds, mahua and tendu leaves are harvested. We are getting reports that tribals stored their produce but couldn’t sell. The government will now have to facilitate procurement and sale of forest produce because forest dwellers are in dire straits because of the ongoing nationwide lockdown. They should also be compensated for their losses,” said Tushar Dash, a member of the Community Forest Rights Learning and Advocacy (CFR-LA) group.There are around 200 million tribal and forest dwellers, who come under the purview of The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, according to CFR-LA’s analysis.“Unfortunately the lockdown period has coincided with the NTFP collection period when around 10 million people in Odisha and over 200 million people across the country collect NTFPs like tendu, mahua, siali and sal leaves to sell in the local market for their basic needs. These three-four months cater to their needs up to winter and particularly during monsoon when there are no employment opportunities. They will need immediate help,” said Chitta Ranjan Pani, an Odisha-based researcher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-allows-collection-processing-of-forest-produce-plantation-of-spices/story-Aocv7r2FGfTIdQZNP3HNvK.html
17-04-2020||India||Link between spitting and disease transmission is overstated: Professor Ross Coomber||The government has banned spitting in public places and it is now a punishable offence under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, in a bid to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which transmits through respiratory droplets released from nose and mouth.Spitting has been associated with spreading disease, particularly tuberculosis (TB), for over a century. In 1896, New York City passed the first anti-spitting legislation based on public health grounds.More recently, in 2011, a councillor in London said “banning spitting (in the borough of) Enfield will help combat TB, which has been on the increase in London”. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageLately, it has been linked with the spread of HIV that causes AIDS, hepatitis B&C that cause jaundice and liver damage, or herpes, with hundreds of cases worldwide where prosecution for assault was brought, or partially so, on this basis.Several states such as Delhi, Goa, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Haryana, Nagaland and Assam, and cities like Mumbai have banned smokeless chewing tobacco like paan and gutka, and spitting in public places, with some introducing the ban to stop the spread of Covid-19.But does spitting really spread disease? Professor Ross Coomber, the head of department of sociology, social policy and criminology, University of Liverpool, the United Kingdom (UK), who has extensively studied spitting practices in Asia, including both India and China, believes that the promulgated public health risks are commonly exaggerated, relatively unproven and promote what in reality is a public nuisance but has become a public health hazard.Why do people spit? Is it a habit particular to Asia, or is it also prevalent in other regions of the world?Spitting varies in prevalence around the world, but historically it was extremely prevalent in most countries. The Asian region does appear to be where the greater levels of prevalence occur, as a region. People spit for many reasons but the normal reasons -- divorced from customs or a particular culture, sealing contracts, showing determination in sport, showing contempt, warding off evil, etc; -- would be to clear their throats/lungs in the same way that many people blow into their handkerchiefs in the West or to do so habitually. How are spitting behaviours different in India, than, say, China?In India, I observed two primary types - habitual ‘functional’ spitting by men and women, young and old who ‘just spat’ often not forcefully but just ridding of saliva but also spitting related to the widely-used chewed paan and gutka, which is a heady mix of cultural activities, fashion, need (if choosing not to swallow), and tradition.In China, it was almost exclusively functional but also louder and more forceful. Arguably, the everyday spitting in both countries is mostly accepted and largely unseen except by those that oppose it.In South Korea, it was almost exclusively combined with smoking and smokers would often draw on a cigarette, inhale and then spit.Does spitting spread disease? What do research studies say?Current research evidence shows that saliva, and thus spittle, although capable of containing viruses and other pathogens, is not considered a bodily fluid through which diseases such as HIV, hepatitis A, B and C are transmitted largely due to the low-level that pathogens are found in saliva. There is almost no evidence to show that public spitting is, in reality, a significant contributor to disease or virus spread as opposed to the assumption that it is because saliva can contain disease/or viruses.In terms of a hierarchy of risk for the transmission of TB, the disease most commonly associated with spitting, the strongest evidence for transmission, however, is elsewhere. As far as the available research suggests, direct close-range coughing or breathing; hand-to-hand touching; kissing (although even mouth-to-mouth resuscitation carries low risk); directly touching pathogen-contaminated surfaces such as handrails, doorknobs and so on; and close living and/or working with others in poorly ventilated rooms carry the most significant transmission risks.Are there any estimates for how many people spit? Has the subject been studied enough?Studies on spitting -- even epidemiological studies -- are rare/thin on the ground. Yes, more systematic studies would be helpful. There are only anecdotal estimates of people spitting and I think there is some Chinese reporting on counting from before the Olympics were held there. I would argue and the evidence suggests (in relation to TB, at least, as the size and virulence of transmittable pathogens vary between diseases) that the link between spitting and disease transmission is historically exaggerated and overstated, particularly with spitting downwards to the ground and is as much a morally/civility based concern as it is a health issue. The campaigns against spitting have a long history of being as much driven by morality as health. A zero-risk approach, of course, would suggest not spitting or sneezing or coughing or even breathing directly in the vicinity of others. The Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 is found in throat swabs and spreads through droplets. Do you believe stopping spitting will stop its spread?Social distancing and sensible all-round behaviour (washing hands etc.) are probably the most important. It seems sensible to suggest that not forcefully projecting bodily fluids into the air should be behaviour but I would suggest that spitting to the ground is not the same as spitting into the air, which happens rarely. It is probably best and sensible to stop all projectile bodily emissions in the current context, whenever possible.How difficult is it for people to change behaviours and stop after a lifetime of spitting?I would suggest it will be very difficult for some but not all. We are all being asked to change our behaviours in many ways. It might be more difficult for those that regularly or even compulsively chew paan or gutka that contain nicotine, tobacco and other addictive substances, such as stimulants. There will a desire and need to chew those substances that will be toughest to break and the spitting will then follow that continued behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/link-between-spitting-and-disease-transmission-is-overstated-professor-ross-coomber/story-kkxhiiKKdUaCBkihVb7QkM.html

There is also a countrywide lockdown in place till May 3 to halt the spread of deadly coronavirus infection.Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu continue to struggle with the rising number of coronavirus cases. These states, together with Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, account for more than 60% of total number of cases in the country.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his appeal to the nation, urged citizens to be sensitive to people who work with them in their businesses. He also advised them not to sack people working for them. Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has asked all guardian ministers to ensure smooth distribution of food grains to the poor during the covid-19 lockdown so that the government is not defamed unnecessarily.Earlier today, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a series of measures to infuse liquidity in the system and provide relief to borrowers amid the crisis.To begin with, RBI has cut the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points — from 4% to 3.75% — encouraging banks to “deploy surplus funds” and lend more, a move that will in turn result in cash in the hands of the borrower. According to a Bloomberg report, India’s economy may be heading for its first full-year contraction in more than four decades amid extended lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharastra-govt-orders-landlords-to-not-evict-tenants-delay-rent-by-3-months/story-6UvpR7PG773CeqhoaLBO8N.html

17-04-2020||India||Covid-19 crisis threatens survival of F&B industry||To ensure that there is no overcrowding, as a precaution to resist the spreading of the novel coronavirus, Section 144 was imposed in all cities of Maharashtra from Monday, March 23. This seemed to be the final blow to the already crumbling state of the restaurant industry in Mumbai. Ever since the city’s first positive case was reported, there seemed to be a decrease in the number of diners. “There was a 50% fall in demand in the initial stages of the outbreak,” says Mihir Desai, founder and owner of Corum Hospitality Pvt Ltd. Annie Bafna, owner, The Nutcracker, says initially people were taking care and staying home but were comfortable with ordering food online. “However, as the crisis has grown we can see the impact on deliveries as well, where people are opting to eat at home. We saw a fall of 50% in delivery orders in the past week,” she adds.While most restaurants opted to shut down before the announcement was made on Monday, now that entire city is on lockdown, and restaurants shut indefinitely, owners are worried about the very survival of eateries. “Hospitality can’t work from home. There are some that might not be able to reopen again. It’s going to have a much longer impact than just 2 weeks of shutting. The restaurant industry will suffer for months together,” frets Aakriti Agarwal, chief executive officer and co-owner, Thirsty City 127.Riyaaz Amlani, managing director of Impresario Entertainment & Hospitality Pvt. Ltd and former president, NRAI, feels “the very survival of the restaurant industry is being called into question not just in India, but across the world”. “.The F&B industry has not seen anything like this in recent memory. There’s no doubt that the impact is going to be extremely severe. The restaurant industry is in complete lockdown currently, which means there are no revenues coming in. If the government steps in immediately, then we can actually curtail losses in the short term.”In lieu of the thought, the NRAI has reportedly written to the Finance Minister requesting help from the government in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The association has demanded some pay to cover marginal employees working in this sector, deferment of all statutory dues at the central and state level, restoration of the input tax credit on GST and moratorium on bank loans.“What we have sought on the immediate basis are essentially the measures that can spare us cash flows to support our employees, our marginal farmers and small-time suppliers during the times of such unprecedented crisis. As we fight a grim battle for our mere survival, what we seek right now is some help from the Government to ensure that kitchen fires continue to burn in the households of our employee,” said Anurag Katriar, president of NRAI and executive director of deGustibus Hospitality.In the face of such a crisis, however, the owners haven’t forgotten the crux of the issue. Arjun Raj Kher, brand head of Hitchki and Bayroute, says, “Looking at the current scenario, what people are going through is much more serious and they need all the support. Though these are testing times for the industry, it is secondary amid the circumstances. However, we will definitely need the support from the government once everything is under control. Right now, what is more important that we fight back together and ensure that everyone in the country is safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/covid-19-crisis-threatens-survival-of-f-b-industry/story-fArzLlkdK81bbaqJqKSTMK.html
17-04-2020||India||IISc comes up with an affordable two-step method to scale up RT-PCR testing||Shanmukha Innovations, a start-up from the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Science (IISc), is in the process of validating a new two-step method for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing that can help India scale up molecular testing for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients.The RT-PCR test amplifies the virus’ genetic material (RNA) from throat swabs of the patients, converts it to DNA, amplifies it and checks it for designated markers to see whether it is SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19.The method devised by the IISc team uses two machines, which are cheaper and readily available in India, instead of one to conduct the test. A thermal-cycler is used to amplify the genetic material machine, while a fluorescence reader is used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2.India is conducting around 25,000 RT-PCR tests a day. The daily testing figures are likely to go up, as the much-awaited consignment of 500,000 rapid blood-based antibody test kits arrived from China on Thursday. India has also started manufacturing its own antibody kits.“RT-PCR is the golden standard of tests, as it can detect the presence of the virus in the body from day one. But there are very few RT-PCR machines available in the country. They are also expensive. Our method uses a thermal cycler, which is more readily available in biology laboratories,” said Arun B, director, Shanmukha Innovations.At IISc, there are about 30 RT-PCR machines, as compared to 200 thermal cyclers. There are about 186 government laboratories with the RT-PCR machines that have now been approved for Covid-19 tests.The fluorescence reader – the second machine needed for the testing -- is also available in several academic labs or can be manufactured at a lower cost.“The fluorescence readers are used to measuring the DNA in samples and are available at several academic laboratories. It can also be manufactured at an estimated cost of Rs 1 lakh as opposed to about Rs 15 or Rs 20 lakh, which an RT-PCR machine costs. We have been working with this method for other diseases such as malaria and Kala-azar, now we need to validate the workflow for Covid-19,” said Arun.Shanmukha Innovations is collaborating with the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute to test round 100 samples using the traditional RT-PCR test and their two-step method to assess whether the results are as accurate. The team already has two prototypes.“Once validated, the manufacturing can happen within six weeks,” he said.The start-up is also working on a mobile laboratory – with bio-safety level (BSL) II – that can cut down on the testing time. “We have a few vans donated to us under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) scheme. We are working on these vans. We are fitting these vans with equipment and restructuring as a BSL II lab. Currently, there is at least a three-day lag between the time a sample is collected and a patient receives his report because all the samples have to be sent to the designated laboratories. Instead, we can now take the vans to the Covid-19 hotspots and conduct the tests directly on the spot. Around 12 samples can be processed within three hours,” said Arun.Each van is likely to cost around Rs 45 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iisc-comes-up-with-an-affordable-two-step-method-to-scale-up-rt-pcr-testing/story-xBzTKyjilgEldPRouoHp6O.html

Doubling rate in 19 states and union territories are even lower than average doubling rate,” Lav Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said at the daily news briefing.ALSO READ | Covid-19 cases in India climb to 13,387, death toll at 437“The doubling rate is lower than the national level in 19 states and union territories. Kerala, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Ladakh, Puducherry, Delhi, Bihar, Odisha, TN, Andhra Pradesh, UP, Punjab, Assam, Tripura all have low doubling rates of coronavirus cases,” Aggarwal added.After the nationwide lockdown of 21 days and the subsequent extension, the doubling rate has gone from 3 to 6.2 days at the national level, according to health ministry data.“The ratio between Covid-19 patients who have recovered and deaths stands at 80:20 in the country, which is higher than that of several other countries suffering due to the health crisis,” the health ministry official said.The health ministry official said that 13.6 per cent of those infected have recovered so far from the highly contagious disease.“A total of 1,749 people have been cured, which is equal to 13.6 per cent of the total number of cases. With 1,007 fresh cases of coronavirus reported in the last 24 hours, the total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country has reached 13,835. A total of 23 new deaths have been recorded in the last 24 hours,” he added..“We have been witnessing an average growth factor of 1.2 since April 1, which stood at 2.1 (average) between March 15 to March 31. So there is a 40% decline in average growth factor as we increased our Covid-19 testing,” Aggarwal said.According to ministry officials, the decline is the result of increased testing, including that of patients suffering from severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI).India has so far reported 1,007 fresh cases of coronavirus and 23 deaths in the last 24 hours, according to Union health ministry data on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-doubling-rate-takes-a-dip-cases-now-double-in-6-2-days/story-42TcUo4kjnMuNmNJCNbS5N.html

Reports from Bengaluru said the media was barred from the area around the wedding venue, though more than three dozen cars were seen going to the site. #WATCH Karnataka: Nikhil Kumarswamy, son of former Karnataka CM HD Kumaraswamy, tied the knot with Revathi, the grand-niece of former Congress Minister for Housing M Krishnappa, today in Ramnagar. (Video source: anonymous wedding guest) pic.twitter.com/5DH9fjNshQHowever, members of the JD-S, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, contended only the “first circle of family members” from the groom and bride’s side were present at the event.A JD-S leader, who too didn’t want to be identified, told Hindustan Times: “Even party members weren’t present and it was strictly a family affair. Social distancing was practised to ensure everybody remained safe.”JD-S legislator TA Sharavana told PTI that lockdown norms weren’t flouted. “There were only eight people on the stage to perform rituals as against the claim that people crowded the venue,” he said.Public gatherings and the presence of large crowds at events such as weddings have been barred under the guidelines for the nationwide lockdown till May 3.Karnataka’s deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan told the media: “I have sought a report from Ramanagara’s deputy commissioner. I will speak to the superintendent of police. We need to take action, otherwise it will be a complete mockery of the system.”Nikhil Kumaraswamy has acted in a few movies and is also president of the Yuva Janata Dal-Secular. He contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Mandya seat but lost.Before the lockdown was imposed, the Kumaraswamy family had planned a grand wedding at a custom built mandap on the Bengaluru-Mysore highway. Nearly 500,000 people had been expected to attend the wedding at that time, primarily from Ramanagara and Chennapatna constituency, represented in the state assembly by HD Kumaraswamy and his wife Anitha.The former chief minister has indicated that, as and when the situation permits, the family could organise a public function so that constituents and well-wishers can bless the couple. Leaders from different political parties, including chief minister BS Yediyurappa, conveyed their blessings and wishes to the newly married couple.In a video message earlier this week, HD Kumaraswamy had appealed to JD-S workers, relatives and well-wishers not to visit the wedding venue. He said the marriage was planned at the family’s home but was moved to Ramanagara as social distancing norms would be a challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-karnataka-cm-kumaraswamy-s-son-marries-amid-lockdown/story-BLCgJujJHIOE15iHDO6isO.html

17-04-2020||India||Mumbai’s pay-and-use toilets will be free for users until Covid-19 lockdown||The pay-and-use toilets in Mumbai will be free for the public until the lockdown restrictions are in place till May 3 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities decided on Friday.The BMC authorities said the relief would help the stranded migrant workers in the city, who have no source of income since the initial 21-day nationwide lockdown restrictions were enforced on March 25 and further extended for another 19 days till May 3.“We have instructed all public toilet facilities not to charge any money from the users. This relief will continue till May 3 to help the stranded people in the city,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC.Mumbai has around 8,500 public toilets, which are run by BMC and charitable organisations. They charge between Rs 2 and Rs 5 for one-time use. Over one million people in the city are estimated to use these facilities. The footfall at pay-and-use toilets have come down by over 80% because of the ongoing lockdown, the BMC official said.At present, homeless migrant workers are the only users of these facilities. “I have lost my job because of the lockdown. I have only Rs 100 on me. I can’t afford to use the pay-and-use toilet for more than once a week when I pay Rs 5 to take a bath,” said a labourer from West Bengal Malda’s district, who is living in a slum in Bandra (East).Human rights activists have praised the BMC’s decision. It is the responsibility of the civic authorities to make arrangements for the basic necessities of the stranded workers amid the Covid-19 outbreak, they said.“Thousands of workers have lost their work due to the lockdown. It is a responsible act by the BMC, as it has waived off the fee for public toilets,” said Robert D’Souza, a human rights activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-s-pay-and-use-toilets-will-be-free-for-users-until-the-lockdown/story-B53XXX75bL26XLx1YzQz3K.html

The state government has decided to open Kedarnath on April 29 and Badrinath on April 30 and the priests are supposed to be present at the opening ceremony.However, it has also asked authorities concerned to nominate other priests as replacement of the chief priests in case they are not in a position to be present on the occasion. The chief priests (called rawal) of Kedarnath is in Maharashtra and that of Badrinath in Kerala.“In case of Kedarnath and Badrinath, the priests who conduct the rituals for the opening of portals are outside the state. We spoke to home ministry that these priests be allowed to come to the state. The home ministry has agreed they will be allowed to come to Uttarakhand by car. If they come, they will be quarantined for 14 days,” said Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and spokesperson of the state government.But even after their return, the rawals will have to mandatorily remain in 14-day quarantine, due to which they will have to skip the opening ceremony.Kaushik said in case of Badrinath shrine, the Tehri royal family (considered its custodians) will be empowered to change the date of the opening the portal or nominate somebody for opening the portal.Similarly, the Badrinath-Kedarnath Temple Committee has also been asked to nominate another priest as a temporary replacement for the Kedarnath rawal if he is not in a position to make it to the temple on schedule.Uttarakhand Chief Secretary Utpal Kumar Singh told news agency PTI that this has been done three or four times in the past also amid unusual circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-casts-shadow-on-opening-of-badrinath-kedarnath-uttarakhand-govt-trying-to-bring-priests-back/story-KxWrfLKqBtPKAKXcw8YoZI.html

Only symptomatic patients were to be tested under the strategy, which was amended on Thursday to include even asymptomatic people who may be carrying the virus.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“This is a huge step taken by the state government. We doctors have been banging our head against the wall for this for the last 10 days. It is because a lockdown and policing alone cannot bring desired results. We need to ramp up our tests. We need to go for random sampling. Tests, tests and more tests ae the need of the hour because we need to identify asymptomatic carriers and confine them,” said Kunal Sarkar, a cardiologist. Around 12,200 people are now under observation in 582 institutional quarantine centres run by the state. They are likely to be tested, said a top official at the state health department.“Earlier the ICMR had suggested that only symptomatic patients need to be tested. Now with ICMR coming up with new guidelines, we have also issued fresh guidelines. The state has also placed requisition for 50,000 rapid antibody testing kits. We will start the rapid test as soon as the kits arrive,” the official added.West Bengal’s Trinamool Congress government has been drawing flak for allegedly not conducting enough tests.Only 3,811 tests have been conducted in Bengal, with a population of around 100 million, compared to 56,673 tests in Maharashtra, 21,384 in Uttar Pradesh and 17,650 in Madhya Pradesh.Till date, at least 205 persons have tested positive for the virus in Bengal out of whom 10 have died. Allegations have surfaced that a few other patients who died Covid-19 hadn’t been included in the toll; the state government says that they had comorbid conditions that may have been responsible for their deaths. The state has set up a panel of doctors to look into such deaths before declaring whether they died of Covid-19 or other ailments. The latest directive, expanding testing to asymptomatic people, didn’t silence critics. the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that t was another attempt to suppress numbers.“Health minister Mamata Banerjee continues assault on Doctor’s rights, proscribes them from prescribing Covid tests! How is it that a doctor treating a Covid patient can neither decide on the test nor write reasons for death but local admin or some random committee can?” tweeted Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s information technology cell.The health department offered no immediate clarification. Repeated calls and messages to top officials in the department elicited no response .The Union government has identified Kolkata and Howrah as red zones – where the number of cases could easily double within four days. The state administration has started a house-to-house survey in high-risk containment areas to trace Covid-19 suspects who need to be quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-ramp-up-testing-people-with-no-symptoms-to-be-screened/story-yFs0s4zwaiXFcc025Q4aJP.html

17-04-2020||India||Rs 500 notes lay on Delhi street, no one touches due to coronavirus fear||About a dozen people watched from a safe distance as three Rs 500 notes lay right outside a house. For several minutes, no one dared to touch the currencies. Then someone dialled the police. The fear among many people that currency notes could be carriers of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) resulted in a peculiar situation in North Delhi’s Lawrence Road on Wednesday afternoon.It all began around 1.15pm when someone noticed three soiled notes lying outside a house. Soon, there were a host of curious onlookers and no one to claim the unattended cash.A call was made to the Keshavpuram police station at 1.27pm. A police team arrived at the spot, but they too didn’t want to take chances. “We cordoned off the street and sent the onlookers into their homes. One of us wore hand gloves to pick up the notes. We then sprayed them with sanitizer and packed them in an envelope,” said a senior police officer.The police asked around, but didn’t find anyone who would claim the cash. The residents of the house outside which the currencies were found too did not claim them. “No one had picked the money off the street. No one would claim it either. It felt like Ram Rajya,” said the officer.But the suspense over the notes ended soon after the policemen returned to the police station. “A woman, Charanjeet Kaur, visited the police station to claim that the notes belonged to her,” said Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west). Kaur, a 49-year-old teacher at a government school in nearby Shakurpur, told the police that the notes were a part of a sum of Rs 10,000 she had withdrawn from an ATM in RG City Centre, a mall in Keshavpuram. “Afraid that the notes could be carrying the virus, she had washed them with sanitizer and put them on a table in the balcony of her second floor house to dry. The wind may have blown away three of them,” said DCP Arya.Kaur had remained unaware of the drama when the police had landed outside her house. It was only when she walked out to her balcony, that she got to know of the missing notes and the drama that had unfolded. The police asked her to produce the other notes she had withdrawn. “The notes found on the street were of the same series as the other notes with her. We gave back the currencies to her,” said the DCP. Though studies indicated that the virus, transmitted through droplets, could be passed on even from dried surfaces to humans, there is not enough scientific evidence on how long it survives on currency notes.Earlier, some residents of Saharsa in Bihar had found currency notes scattered outside their homes. The currencies were accompanied by notes which said, “I have come with Corona. Accept this note, otherwise I’ll harass everyone”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-500-notes-lay-on-delhi-street-no-one-touches-due-to-coronavirus-fear/story-KnJLVHtselZnK4DbLjFK4H.html

The police had been on their trail since and located them on Friday. Additional security forces were rushed and a gunbattle ensued, a police officer said, adding details would be made available later.The attackers have been identified as local residents Ashiq Hussain, a rape accused who was released on bail from Kishtwar Central Jail three weeks ago, and Basharat Hussain. The official said the two are believed to have joined the terrorist ranks and carried out the attack to lay their hands on their weapons.This was the first terror attack in Kishtwar district this year.Kishtwar was rocked by a series of terrorist attacks in November 2018, when it saw its first terror attack in over a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-forces-surround-attackers-who-killed-spo-in-kishtwar/story-ikVtH6GJ65OYRvrFMN3YfO.html
17-04-2020||India||Covid19: UP poultry farmers stare into abyss as govt chickens out||Like other poultry farmers in Uttar Pradesh, Gurmeet Singh is grappling with the losses and disruption of business caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. But all he can think about is the pain of losing thousands of chickens he had reared.Singh, whose farm has a capacity of 4,000 broiler chickens, had never imagined his entire flock, which he bought for Rs 100,000 (Rs 25 a chick) would end up in a pit.“I had to bury them all as a majority of them died of hunger, since I had no money to feed them anymore. The things I suffered, as a poultry farmer, can’t be expressed in words,” said Singh, the lone earning member in a family of five.BANKRUPTCY, A SMALL WORDIn January, Singh decided to try his hand at poultry farming. “The poultry business was at its peak. I used my father’s and my own savings to invest in poultry farming, for which the Uttar Pradesh government offered many subsidies and other lucrative terms.“With my parents’ consent, I opened a farm at Samda village near Amausi railway station. I thought the income would help me give my family a good life and a good education to my daughter,” he said.Singh’s friends, who were already into poultry farming, played a key role in encouraging and advising him in setting up his farm. He invested Rs 100,000 and bought the initial stock of 4,000 birds.“Once the stock reached my farm, I arranged the feed. It’s a special feed that costs Rs 35 a kg. I arranged for medicines and vaccines and it was all going as per the plan,” he said.And then the Covid-19 crisis struck India, upending Singh’s life. “I still remember, it was the last week of January when I saw a flash on a news channel stating ‘Chicken ya anda khaane se bhi ho sakta hai Covid-19’ (eating chicken or eggs can give you Covid-19). I rushed to the farm and contacted a few retailers to take stock of the situation,” he said.“But I was assured that everything was normal. Generally, it takes around 40 days for the birds to mature to be sold to retailers. I was advised to wait eight more days and then sell the stock of 4,000 birds,” he added.In the initial days of the crisis, there were several reports of an unproven link between Covid-19 and eating chicken. These reports were dismissed by experts.Singh’s father Sardar Surinder Singh, who retired from the Railway Protection Force (RPF), said: “I wish he had sold his stock in January end itself. One bird costs Rs 25 and matures in 40 days. The total investment on each bird, weighing 2 kg, is around Rs 165. Hence, the cost of our stock of 4,000 birds was Rs 660,000.“But after the crisis, retail chicken prices crashed to Rs 25 to 30 a bird, following which we suffered a capital loss of Rs 130 a bird in just 40 days. We could hardly sell some birds for Rs 1 lakh and rest of the stock died of hunger.”THE LAST NAIL IN THE COFFINSingh is not the only one who suffered massive losses during the crisis. It’s the same story with many poultry farmers in the state. According to the Poultry Farmers Broilers Welfare Federation, a national group for poultry farmers, there are more than 12 lakh families engaged in poultry farming in Uttar Pradesh and their annual turnover is Rs 250,000 million.“Our industry is perhaps the most affected industry during the Covid-19 outbreak. In February, there was a rumour that consumption of chicken or eggs may cause Coronavirus infections and the industry witnessed a 70% dip in consumption of chicken,” said the federation’s convener, Arun Gulati alias Annu, who owns a breeding farm in Banthra area of Lucknow.Gulati said the situation worsened after infections were recorded in India, and consumption of chicken fell by 80% and the price was reduced to Rs 20 per kilogram.“The lockdown proved to be the last nail in the coffin as all the birds were blocked on farms. Since farmers didn’t have much to feed the birds and they began dying of starvation. Farmers didn’t have any option but to bury the hungry birds alive,” said Gulati.GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION NEEDEDGulati said the federation approached the chief minister to draw his attention to the grim prospects of poultry farmers. The government allowed grocery, fruit and vegetable shops to operate but no one gave a thought to the meat trade, which remained closed.“Meat trade is not in the Uttar Pradesh government’s priority list. Other states are selling meat during the lockdown. Here in Uttar Pradesh, those who try to open shops have to face the police baton or harassment. We have written to the chief minister to let meat shops open in order to bring the poultry industry on track,” he said.In early March, the Central government issued a statement debunking the rumours that created a scare. On March 5, a communiqué from the ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairy’s joint secretary OP Chaudhary stated, “The consumption of Indian poultry and poultry products, including eggs, is safe. General hygiene, however, should be followed.”SO WHY IS CHICKEN, MEAT, FISH BEING SOLD?In early March, the district administration issued an advisory barring the sale of meat and fish at illegal shops that sell meat in the open. In addition, the administration ordered the fogging of cowsheds. Later, district magistrate Abhishek Prakash clarified it was a general order and the administration had not banned the sale of meat. But he maintained that sales at unlicensed shops and in the open were restricted.On Thursday, divisional commissioner Mukesh Meshram said meat shops were closed as none of them had a licence from the Food Safety and Drug Administration (FSDA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-poultry-farmers-stare-into-abyss-as-govt-chickens-out/story-dXZUvfPDQuhXi9RETxZ2MJ.html

Krishnasamy Chiyamalan, another retailer in the city, died a week earlier.Kin of those afflicted are unable to be around them in their dying moments, as hospital visits are prohibited due to the likelihood of the infection spreading, adding to their anxiety and grief. London boroughs with large populations of Indian origin have a high incidence of the virus.Also counted among the nearly 14,000 dead in UK are Jitendra Kumar Rathod, a ‘greatly respected’ doctor in Wales; Pooja Sharma, a pharmacist in east Sussex, and her father Sudhir Sharma, an immigration officer at Heathrow.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab reflected concern over statistics concealing individual stories behind them during the daily briefing on virus-related developments in Downing Street on Thursday.He said: “Every time I come to this lectern, and I read out the grim toll of people who have so sadly passed away. I walk away from here, and I think about what their sons and their daughters must be going through right now”.“Their brothers and sisters. Their grandchildren. All the loved ones left with their unbearable, long-term, grief. It makes me and it makes this government focus even harder on what we must do”.Initial hospital data suggests that the minority non-white people in the UK constitute 35 per cent among those in critical care hospitals, prompting an inquiry. Most of the medical staff who died in recent days are non-white.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-indian-victims-in-uk-doctor-grocer-uber-driver/story-kvmntSuUGNYDGDJMV69WDI.html
17-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Rate of patient recovery in top coronavirus-affected states in India||The number of coronavirus cases in the country is over 13,000, however, patients recovering from the deadly contagion are also rising across the country. On Friday, nearly 13% of the total Covid-19 patients in the country were reported either cured of the virus or discharged from the hospital. The number of recoveries has gone up from last week’s 8%.Highest cases of coronavirus recoveries come from Maharashtra and Kerala. Nearly 10% of cases in Maharashtra have beaten the deadly contagion (300 patients). Maharashtra has reported more than 3,000 coronavirus cases so far.Of Delhi’s 1,640 cases, 51 have made a recovery which is around 3%. This is also because of the fact that the national capital witnessed a sudden surge in its Covid-19 cases after scores of jamaatis, who attended a religious gathering at Nizamuddin’s Markaz in March, tested positive of the virus. Delhi accounts for one of the highest coronavirus death tolls in the country after states such Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. As many as 38 people have died here. In Tamil Nadu, which has the third-highest number of coronavirus cases in the country, 180 people have recovered out of a total 1267 cases which roughly comes to 14%. The rate of recovery is low in Madhya Pradesh where just 64 of 1120 coronavirus cases have made a recovery, which nearly barely 6%. Rajasthan has around 14.5% of its total coronavirus patients recovering from the virus - 164 patients of total 1131 cases. Gujarat has reported nearly 8% of its coronavirus cases recover. 73 people of total 930 patients have defeated the contagion.When it comes to Covid-19 fatalities, just four Indian cities account for over 50% of coronavirus deaths. Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Indore are cities that have seen the maximum coronavirus-related deaths in the past week. Indore in Madhya Pradesh has emerged as one of the top Covid-19 hotspots with around 300 new cases on Thursday. The number of coronavirus cases in the country on Friday rose to 13,387. The figure includes 11,201 active cases, 1,748 cases of recoveries and 437 coronavirus fatalities.Note: Figures are from official data released by the Ministry of Health, and may differ from realtime numbers released by various state governments subject to confirmation from the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-mere-3-patients-recover-in-delhi-lowest-among-top-coronavirus-hit-states/story-iR2Cpdq7aIVQ9Z0bad4nuL.html

Of the nine-member team, he was among the two youths, both in their 20s, who had to hold the chemical sprayers and enter the room of the house in the city outskirts. Though he was provided a personal protection equipment kit the fear was palpable. Before leaving for the task, he called his mother and asked her to pray for him.At the site, Shabir had to thoroughly spray the chemical. Apart from the house, they had to disinfect the surrounding houses in the 90 yards diameter. “I was scared but what else was the option,” said Shabir.Since then he has been regularly involved in door-to-door sanitisation in different areas of the city.Around 5,000 workers of SMC have been carrying out the decontamination and sanitation of the city and spraying some 50,000 litres of the chemical mixture on a daily basis to sanitise various public places and institutions to contain the further spread of deadly coronavirus.Around 70% of these workers are not permanently employed and have been working on a daily wage or consolidated basis like Shabir earns ₹6,700 a month. While many officials and health workers involved in fighting the pandemic have been amplifying their presence through the use of social media, most of these sanitation workers have been going on silently doing their work.“We are doing a very risky job. People are in their homes and we are out in the field, fighting,” said 29-year-old Sajad Ahmad, who during normal days would collect sanitation fee for SMC.On some occasions, these workers have faced the wrath of angry people and even the police. On Wednesday, Srinagar mayor Junaid Azim Mattu alleged that the Jammu and Kashmir Police thrashed some of the sanitation workers and posted a clip on social media where policemen could be seen thrashing employees of the Srinagar municipal corporation somewhere in the city.Owing to the lockdown, there aren’t many options for the workers. When the things were normal many workers also used to work part-time jobs apart from the SMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-srinagar-sanitation-workers-unsung-heroes-in-fight-against-coronavirus/story-xT0nIJCj4np9xiYd7MfvEJ.html

But the government has hidden the letter,” Poonia said during a video conference with reporters.The collector had said in the letter, of which HT has a copy, to BSF and CRPF that to maintain law and order and ensure compliance of the curfew imposed in the wake of a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city the forces should provide one company each.The government, however, accused the BJP of misleading people and that the situation was under control in Jodhpur.Cabinet minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said that the chief minister is himself monitoring the situation. “The lockdown is being strictly imposed and adhered to. The government is working hard to ensure we succeed in this fight against Covid-19. The situation is under control and will further improve,” he said.Health minister Raghu Sharma also said that the situation is under control and the number of cases has risen because of more testing.“The BJP should appreciate the work being done by doctors, health workers, police and not demoralise them,” Sharma said.Before Jodhpur, Jaipur emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hotspot district in Rajasthan, accounting for almost one-third of the state’s total cases. And in Jaipur, Ramganj area has become a hotspot for the infection after a 45-year-old resident of Ramganj, who returned from Oman on March 12, was identifies as a super spreader. He was asked by health officials to stay in home quarantine but continued to meet people and even offered prayers at a local mosque.He tested positive on March 26 and curfew was imposed in Ramganj, a crowded neighbourhood with a population of nearly 500,000.Ramcharan Bohra, Jaipur’s MP, has written to Union home minister Amit Shah, accusing the Rajasthan government of following a policy of appeasement which he said has led to the situation going out of control.Bohra said the state government did not take stringent measures and the graph of positive cases from Ramganj kept increasing rapidly. He claimed Congress MLAs from Ramganj area were putting pressure on the administration to provide ration only to a particular community which has angered the locals.He said the government was forcing the local administration and police to relax curfew norms for a particular community which led to people moving out of Ramganj and spreading the virus to other areas in Jaipur.Rajasthan with 12 of its 33 districts features in the list of top five states in terms of the number of hot spot districts. Others are Tamil Nadu with 22 of its 37 districts in the ‘red zone’, Maharashtra with 14 of its 36, Uttar Pradesh with 13 of 75, and Andhra Pradesh with 11 of 13 districts.India reported 724 new Covid-19 cases and 23 deaths in the last 24 hours, according to the Union health ministry on Friday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-s-covid-19-cases-now-at-1169-govt-says-rise-in-numbers-due-to-more-testing/story-0IzTkJSYFQsUgbcl50gGpM.html

Apart from that 8 per cent of people are frequently visiting websites dedicated for the pandemic, with an increased interest being shown by males, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-record-20-3-crore-people-watched-pm-modi-s-address-on-lockdown-2-0-barc/story-YFYdLYW2kSS9YcbNVGb0YK.html

It also made wearing of face masks compulsory in public places and banned the sale of liquor and tobacco products in the state.These decisions were taken in the meeting of the ministers and senior officials at the residence of the Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. The meeting went on for two and a half hours on Thursday evening.Giving details of the decisions taken during the meeting, Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and spokesperson of the state government said decisions were taken in line with the guidelines issued by the Centre on Monday regarding lockdown 2.0.Kaushik said industries will be allowed to operate in the state in rural areas and industrial estates after April 20 but they will have to seek permission from the state government either online or directly and will have to abide by the guidelines issued by the Centre.He said industrial units will have to seek permission from the respective district magistrates and also inform them from where they are getting labour.Kaushik said agriculture activities will also be allowed in the state with farmers following social distancing norms. “We have set up 201 centres for procurement of wheat and set a target of buying 2 lakh metric tonnes for which payment will be made at the earliest”, he said.For marriages and last ritesKaushik said marriage ceremonies will be allowed in the state with certain conditions like the number of wedding guests should be limited to five and the ceremony has to be held inside homes. “In case of last rites, not more than 20 people will be allowed to participate. People will have to take permission for marriage ceremonies and participation in last rites from district magistrates of their respective districts”, he saidSecretariat and office of the legislative assembly Kaushik said the state secretariat and office of legislative assembly will be opened from Friday, adding that these offices will be sanitised first.

No religious, social or political gatherings will be allowed during the lockdown period”, he said.On hotspots On ‘red’ zones and hotspots declared by the Centre, Kaushik said no permissions will be given in such areas. He said in hotspots, containment zones will be demarcated by the district administrations. According to the Centre’s list of 170 districts classified as hotspots, or in the ‘red’ zone, Dehradun has been listed as hotspot district with a large outbreak, while Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar have been listed as hotspot districts with clusters. Haridwar, Almora, Pauri Garhwal have been listed under non-hotspot districts reporting casesNo leniency in lockdown Kaushik said there will be no leniency in lockdown in the districts that have not reported any positive Covid-19 case. He said Section 144 of CrPC will be in force in the entire state prohibiting assembly of more than 5 persons.Earlier, the state government had proposed to divide 13 districts into two categories - districts that have not reported a single positive Covid-19 case prior to April 14, and those that had reported positive cases preceding April 14.So far, Uttarakhand has reported 37 Covid-19 positive cases. Of these 37 cases, only two positive cases have been reported from hilly areas including Almora and Pauri Garhwal.On sheltering jamaatis Kaushik said so far 513 jamaatis have been identified who have come from other states to Uttarakhand, while those who have gone from here to attend jamaats in other states and have come back number around 910. “All these 1423 jamaatis have been identified and quarantined. After the ultimatum, 182 jamaatis have so far presented themselves before the administration for quarantine. The state government has also decided that if jamaatis who are still hiding, don’t come forward, then the state government will take action against those also sheltering them under the same charges (attempt to murder or murder)”, he said.On stranded Kedarnath and Badrinath priests The portals of Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines are scheduled to be opened on April 26, while the portals of Kedarnath shrine are set to open on April 29 and portals of Badrinath on April 30. The chief priest of Kedarnath shrine is stranded in Maharashtra due to the lockdown, while the priest of Badrinath shrine is stranded in Kerala.In case of Char Dham pilgrimages, Kaushik said for Yamunotri and Gangotri there is no issue of priests stranded outside the state. “However in case of Kedarnath and Badrinath, the priests who conduct the rituals for the opening of portals are outside the state. We spoke to the home ministry that these priests be allowed to come to the state. The home ministry has agreed they will be allowed to come to Uttarakhand by car. If they come, they will be quarantined for 14 days”, he said.Kaushik said in case of Badrinath shrine, Tehri royal family will be empowered to change the date of the opening of the portal or nominate somebody for its opening.Road construction to be allowedKaushik said road construction operations will be allowed with local labourers outside civic body limits. He said permission related to the procurement of raw materials for such constructions will be sought from the Centre in coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-govt-to-allow-industrial-and-agricultural-activities-from-april-20/story-GLyOBHJFtw4sPQDzWoh7MO.html

These steps would help our small businesses, MSMEs, farmers and the poor. It will also help all states by increasing WMA limits,” tweeted PM Modi, shortly after the RBI governor’s address.Earlier this morning, the RBI cut the reverse repo rate and announced a slew of measures including re-finance window of Rs 50,000 crore and targeted long term repo auction of similar amount to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.Das assured that the RBI will use all instruments at its disposal to deal with the challenges posed by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, depending on the evolving situation.Also Watch l RBI cuts reverse repo rate by 25 bps, expects 7.4% GDP growth in 2021-22 Governor Shaktikanta Das said there are a few slivers of brightness amidst the encircling gloom and hoped that India will stage a sharp V-shaped recovery in 2021-22 as projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The allowed non-bank financial companies to extend the date for commencement of commercial operations (DCCO) for loans given to commercial real estate by additional one year without considering it as restructuring. Currently, the RBI has permitted banks to extend the DCCO in respect of loans to commercial real estate projects delayed for reasons beyond the control of promoters by additional one year, over and above the one-year extension permitted in normal course, without treating the same as restructuring.“It has now been decided to extend a similar treatment to loans given by NBFCs to commercial real estate,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said while addressing the media via video conference. The move will provide relief to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) as well as the real estate sector, he said.Softening inflation, Das said would make available more policy space to the central bank to address risks to the growth going forward.He further said that by April 10, pre-monsoon kharif sowing had begun strongly, with acreage of paddy – the principal kharif crop – up by 37 per cent in comparison with the last season.States such as West Bengal, Telangana, Odisha, Assam, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh are leading in sowing activity despite the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-s-steps-will-improve-credit-supply-help-small-businesses-says-pm-modi/story-QfRMYEyoCXADU3H32HaOBL.html

He will return to Delhi on Friday.“It is very unfortunate that at a time when the whole world and India is fighting the menace of this pandemic, our neighbour continues to foment trouble for us,” Gen Naravane said while speaking to ANI.“While we are busy not only helping our own citizens but the rest of the world by sending medical teams and exporting medicines, on the other hand, Pakistan is only exporting terror. This doesn’t augur well,” he added.The five commandos, as well as five terrorists, were killed on April 5 when the troops prevented the group from sneaking into the Kashmir Valley from Keran sector.The army had said on April 10 that it destroyed launch pads and ammunition dumps in Kupwara’s Keran sector across the LoC in retaliation to the ceasefire violation.The army had targeted Pakistani positions with artillery guns and caused severe damage to Pakistani army posts, terror launch pads and an ammunition dump in a response to an unprovoked ceasefire violation.India has already lodged protests with Pakistan for the killing of a woman and two children in firing by Pakistani forces in Jammu and Kashmir.India in the demarche over the Kashmir violation condemned in the strongest possible terms the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians that had led to the killing of Shamima Begum, 35, and Javid Ahmad Khan, 17, residents of Reddi Chokibal and eight-year-old Zeeshan Bashir of Kupwara’s Tumna village.The demarche underlined that Pakistani forces continue to resort to unprovoked firing and ceasefire violations and asked Islamabad to probe such heinous crimes against civilians, people familiar with the developments had said.The Pakistan army has carried out more ceasefire violations during January-March this year compared to the corresponding periods of the previous two years.Pakistan violated the ceasefire 1144 times between January and March, with the highest number of violations (411) recorded last month when Covid-19 cases started peaking globally. The Pakistan army violated the ceasefire 685 times in 2019 and 627 times in 2018 for the period January to March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-fighting-covid-19-pakistan-is-only-exporting-terror-says-army-chief/story-YVINlgRrzy0zM40adQwZeN.html

And also, schools are in agreement with the payment of the fees on a monthly basis,” said SK Bhattacharya, president of The Action Committee of Private Unaided Recognised Schools in Delhi.“However, we don’t agree with the decision of not charging the annual amount because majority of the schools have fixed expenditures that cannot be met without the annual charges. We can also take the annual charges in instalments,” he said. The annual fee is a sum schools charge parents over and above the tuition fee, and generally use it for the maintenance of electricity, water and other essentials on the campus. While majority of schools charge it once a year, some take the payment half-yearly or quarterly. Soon after Sisodia’s press conference, the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) issued a notice to this effect to private schools, directing them not to charge parents any other component than the tuition fee.“No fee, except tuition fee, shall be charged from parents, till further orders. Heads of the schools shall not demand and collect tuition fees from parents on a quarterly basis. The fee shall be collected on a monthly basis,” the order said.“The schools shall, in no case, deny access to online education to any student who is unable to pay fees due to financial crises arising out of ongoing lockdown,” it said. DoE further asked schools not to revise the fee structure in the 2020-21 session till further orders.All private schools are asked not to stop the salaries of their teaching and non-teaching staff members in the name of the unavailability of funds. “Arrange the funds in case any shortfalls from the society or trust running the school,” the DoE order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-schools-in-delhi-to-not-hike-fees-during-lockdown-manish-sisodia/story-KSUQelYH25qOD1n0arNs8N.html
17-04-2020||India||‘Hounded by social stigma’: Kerala family dubbed ‘super spreader’ on Covid-19 fight||A family of non-resident Indians (NRIs) in Kerala, which contracted coronavirus disease Covid-19, has said that it was a “big mistake” on their part to not follow the advice to remain in home quarantine.The family, who lives in Italy, came to their home in Kerala’s Ranni on February 29 on a three-week leave and attended many functions before testing positive for Covid-19 a week later.“We did a big mistake. It was unintentional and borne out of ignorance. Many cursed us. Some of our family members even said we will not come alive from the hospital,” said 26-year-old Rijo Moncy, who works in Italy.They were dubbed “super spreader” after Pathanamthitta, a hilly district in central Kerala which Ranni is part of, was declared a Covid-19 hotspot. One hundred eighty two passengers who travelled with them from Qatar were also quarantined and Moncy’s 94-year-old grandfather and 88-year-old grandmother tested positive. “My father literally collapsed when he heard my grandparents were also transmitted. He needed rigorous counselling to come out of the shock and infamy,” said Moncy, narrating the initial days of isolation in Kottayam medical college hospital. More than the virus, the stigma and guilt hounded them.They were vilified and were targeted by trolls online, who wanted them to be flogged publicly. “We three were together at the hospital. After initial shock and counselling, my parents took to spirituality reading Bible throughout the day. I was allowed to use my mobile but I stopped checking social media to avoid a barrage of criticism and bad news from other parts of the world which upset me. At one point I thought it is difficult to come out,” Moncy explained. The family spent 25 days of isolation at the hospital.“At times I used to watch news on my phone. But all channels bombarded worst news on virus and that made me more nervous. The counsellors advised me to watch movie clips and hear songs. I was particular not to show my nervousness or worries before my parents because they were banking on me heavily,” he said, adding that he enjoyed comic strips most.Moncy said the family thought it will face a vindictive treatment at the hospital too, but they were mistaken.He gave full credit to the medical team of the Kottayam medical college hospital and termed it as one of the best medical care facilities in the world. “They nursed us back to life. Their mental support was very crucial. Health Minister K K Shailaja called us personally and consoled us a couple of times. Suffering from many medical complications I never expected my grandparents will be back. It is a medical wonder,” said Rijo, who works in a pharmaceutical firm in Venice. His parents have been living in Italy for the last 20 years and visit their aged parents once in two years.While treating Moncy’s grandparents, one of the nurses of the medical college hospital - Reshma Mohandas - turned positive. “They behaved like little children. We also considered them like that only. Since both of them had some hearing problem I had to be very close,” Mohandas said, adding that she was just doing her duty.“After the nurse fell ill it aggravated our concerns. But none of the medical fraternity blamed and they treated us like family members. We owe our lives to them. We have seen hospitals in Italy and many other European countries but I feel Kerala’s facilities and care were more than what is offered there,” he said, adding that his family members turned emotional while leaving the hospital.Moncy said when they left Italy in end of February, the situation was not that serious and they got tested before taking flight in Venice. He feels they might have contracted the virus either from Venice airport or on Venice-Doha flight.“The situation in Italy is really serious now. My parents are Italian citizens. We will to go back once things are settled. We are really grateful to our country and the state,” said Moncy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hounded-by-social-stigma-kerala-family-dubbed-super-spreader-on-covid-19-fight/story-GQoWKEKdIp0VPIFiQPHJ7J.html
17-04-2020||India||No Covid positive cases in 2 days, Odisha officials say curve may be flattening||Odisha hasn’t recorded any new Coronavirus infections among 1,940 samples tested in the past two days, leading officials to believe that the state’s curve for the spread of Covid-19 is beginning to flatten.The state’s six Covid-19 laboratories tested 1,197 samples on Wednesday, the highest number for a single day, and another 843 samples were tested on Thursday. The bulk of the tests were done using the Cobas 6800 machine at the Regional Medical Research Centre in Bhubaneswar.Officials said the lack of new infections among almost 2,000 samples indicated the spread of the virus was limited to a few clusters in Odisha.The director of the National Health Mission, Shalini Pandit, said that of the 1,940 samples tested, a bulk came from districts outside Khurda, which is among the 170 “red zones” in the country. Khurda alone has accounted for 46 of the 60 positive cases in Odisha.Also read: Covid-19 cases in India climb to 13,387, death toll at 437“The sample base had a good mix of tribal and non-tribal districts of the entire state. Since the samples from high-risk districts like the tribal areas have not tested positive, there is little possibility of getting more cases from there,” Pandit said.She noted there were no positive cases from tribal-dominated districts such as Malkangiri and Bolangir, where none of the 500-odd samples produced a positive result.With just 60 positive cases from 7,577 samples tested so far, Odisha has the lowest ratio (0.007) of positive cases to samples in the country. Kerala, which has recorded 394 positive cases so far, has higher ratio of 0.022.Officials, however, said the state couldn’t afford to be complacent.Also read: Nearly 13% of Covid-19 patients recover across India, up from last week’s 8%Development commissioner Suresh Mohapatra said: “Though a majority of samples tested so far are negative in the state, we should not be happy thinking that the Coronavirus is defeated. We plan to conduct 2,000 to 3,000 tests a day. We will be confident only after conducting tests on a large scale.” Odisha’s health minister Naba Das said that to scale up testing, the state will soon start “pool testing” of samples of suspected cases. Under this method, multiple swab samples are pooled together and tested.Pool testing is done in areas with low prevalence of infections (positivity rate of less than 2%). According to the Indian Council of Medical Research’s advisory on pool testing algorithm, “polymerase chain reaction” screening of a specimen pool comprising multiple samples is done. In case a pool tests positive, then each sample is individually tested. The Cobas 6800 machine, one of only two such machines in India, does real-time RT-PCR tests and can handle more than 700 samples in six hours.Meanwhile, the director of public health, Ajit Kumar Mohanty, told reporters the state has already started random tests in 21 districts that haven’t been affected by the virus.Of Odisha’s 30 districts, Covid-19 cases have been reported from only nine. Mohanty said one person in every 10,000 in each district will be tested.Epidemiologists, however, said Odisha needs to follow the Kerala model of more tests till it can safely claim to have flattened the curve.“As of now it’s very difficult to predict (about flattening the curve). Unless tested, the undetected asymptomatic cases will cause more harm as they would be spreading continuously for a long period,” said Nalini Kanta Tripathy, a community medicine specialist at PGIEMR in Chandigarh.In a separate development, chief secretary Asit Tripathy asked officials to inform people in six containment zones in Bhubaneswar – Surya Nagar, Bomikhal, Satya Nagar, Sunarpada and Kapila Prasad – about the availability of essential items.“The decision to disseminate information in the containment zones was taken after we found out people were in the dark over all that is happening around them. Also, loudspeakers should be used to update information,” said Asit Tripathy. “People with disabilities, those living alone, pregnant women and aged persons should be given priority in these clusters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-covid-positive-cases-in-2-days-odisha-officials-say-curve-may-be-flattening/story-9nnpelyABxd2eNoMuE4uHO.html

Police in Kasa detained 30 people on Friday morning though no arrest has been made so far. According to the police, the mob mistook the occupants of the Ecco van to be thieves and lynched them to death.Anandrao Kale, an assistant police inspector (API) with Kasa police station, said the van was coming from Nashik when it was stopped by the irate mob near Gadhchinchale village on Dabhadi-Khanwel road.Kale said the mob started to question the passengers and pulled them out of the van and started beating them. The driver managed to call the police and a team rushed to the spot, said Kale. “The mob was strong and we tried to save the passengers but it also targeted us and started to pelt stones while beating them and as a result, the trio succumbed to their injuries,” the API said.“We rushed them to the Kasa government hospital but were declared dead before admission,” Kale said, adding they were waiting for the post mortem report. The police official said they have registered cases under section 188 (disobedience), section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Epidemic Diseases Act,1897, against the detained people.“We will arrest them shortly,” said Kale.Three days ago, four personnel of Kasa Police, including API Kale, were injured and the SUV of a skin specialist Dr Vishwas Walwi of Thane was destroyed at Saarni village by a mob.At least 250 people had attacked them when Dr Walwi was returning home after distributing food grains and conducting a small door-to-door thermal screening of tribals. Fifteen people were arrested in connection with the incident and kept in police remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mistaken-for-thieves-3-lynched-to-death-by-200-strong-mob-in-maharashtra-s-palghar/story-k0RXVlIqPrNTLVuSDNPstM.html

17-04-2020||India||List of new activities exempted by govt from lockdown restrictions||The government on Friday exempted more services from Covid-19 lockdown, in a fresh set of guidelines released by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).These exemptions include activities in farming/plantation, construction and banking sectors.In plantation, collection, harvesting of minor forest produce, non-timber forest produce by Scheduled Tribes and forest dwellers; and harvesting, processing, packaging, sale and marketing of bamboo, coconut, arecanut, cocoa and spices plantation have been allowed.Non-banking financial institutions, housing finance and micro finance institutions with minimum staff have been allowed to function during lockdown which has been extended till May 3.Finally, construction activities in rural areas, water supply, sanitation, and laying of power, telecom lines have also been exempted from the lockdown by the MHA order.The lockdown was extended after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in hi address to the nation on April 14 - the last day pf phase 1 of lockdown - that stringent measures are needed to break the cycle of infection. He also urged people to follow social distancing norms, asked state governments to ensure lockdown is followed, announced some relaxation and warned that if rate of infection doesn’t stop, the government will be forced to withdraw these exemptions.A detailed list of exemptions was released a day after the Prime Minister’s address in which the government conditionally allowed industries in rural areas and economic enclaves to reopen next week, green-lighted work under the federal job guarantee scheme, and permitted daily wagers in some areas to return to work.The guidelines were aimed at restarting the country’s economic engine and lessen the pain of millions affected by the ongoing lockdown to combat the spread of Covid-19.The guidelines on the restart of the economy , with a sharp rural focus, was described as a giant first step by some analysts.No public transport including planes, trains, buses, metro rail and taxis will be available during the second phase of the lockdown, which will last for 19 days, although courier services have now been allowed and will likely feed into air and rail cargo services, which were also operational during the first phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/list-of-new-activities-exempted-by-govt-from-lockdown-restrictions/story-ctJkbMVJeQ38Sm6TJOhgcM.html

With GST collections to be much lower during the year and the Centre yet to clear a significant amount of the state’s pending GST arrears, things would continue to worsen in the coming months, he warned.The spokesperson said the meeting discussed several measures to mop up revenue in the prevailing situation that was likely to continue for another couple of quarters at least. The CM also urged the committee members to look at innovative measures to tackle the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/give-up-30-of-3-month-salary-punjab-government-urges-staffers-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-ihOaT0NjppADdhgsqdueuK.html

17-04-2020||India||From watching movie ‘Virus’ to studying Epidemic Act, IAS trainees gear up for Covid-19 crisis||From watching Virus, a Malayalam film on the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak, to understanding the Epidemic Diseases Act, the next batch of IAS officers graduating from the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration is gearing up to fight Covid-19. The 182 officers currently at the academy are expected to join as trainee assistant collectors in districts across the country next month, provided the government lifts the lockdown, said an official at the academy.The Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers will complete their course on May 8. The Centre for Disaster Management recalibrated its course to instruct these officers about ways to tackle the outbreak.“The online course in the academy is focusing on the legal ecosystem around Covid-19, such as extant rules [for] national disasters with a special focus on procedure,” said academy director Sanjeev Chopra. A two-hour introductory session for this was held on the academy’s e-learning platform, GYAAN, on Thursday.“The session was mostly about the National Disaster Management Act (NDMA),” a trainee officer of the Assam-Meghalaya cadre said. “It was conducted by our faculty members, some of whom have experience on the ground of having handled disasters in Tamil Nadu and other states.” The trainee officer said Covid-19 is a nascent case study, though mitigation of the disease can be similar to other natural disasters. “We are still discovering things about Covid-19 but many steps taken for mitigation of disasters like floods can help here as well,” the trainee officer added. A second trainee officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre said information about laws will help them with their work in the districts. “The DM Act, for instance, tells us about the exact responsibilities of a DM and SDM,” he said. “We learnt we could requisition helicopters for delivering rations and ask private companies to provide equipment and human resources, if needed.”The second officer added that Covid-19 has no precedent and the officers will have to “improvise” when they start work. “The provisions apply in general to disasters, we will have to see how to use them to fight Covid-19,” he said.“We learnt how to make relief camps, ensure sanitation and ensure no discrimination happens. We can extend these to tackle the present migrant worker crisis.” Another academy official said: “There are certain disasters that need an immediate response, such as floods. Others, like the pandemic, require a standardised response. These are the best practices needed to help reduce infections.”As a run-up to Thursday’s introductory session, the batch was asked to watch documentaries and films such as Virus and 93 Days, a Nigerian movie on Ebola. “The idea is to make them familiar with how countries across the world have dealt with epidemics,” the academy official said. “Sub-divisional magistrates and sub-divisional officers are generally involved in disaster management in normal times as well. The district magistrate is the disaster management authority at the district level.”The batch was provided access to documents and modules on how districts and state governments and the Central government are tackling the pandemic. “Whether it’s understanding the concept of an incident response team or making sure different departments coordinate seamlessly, they will be in a better position to administer [after] this module,” said the official. Inter-departmental coordination is being stressed. “Coronavirus has been declared a disaster by the government, so it automatically falls under the ambit of the course,” the official added. “We are also explaining coordination, such as working with police, the railway department, or others to ensure vulnerable groups and migrants don’t suffer.”A second official said disaster management was always an integral part of the course, but extra attention is being paid to it this year. “We have increased our focus on the National Disaster Management Act, State Disaster Management Act, epidemic Act and State Disaster Response Fund to help prepare the officers for their forthcoming assignment,” the second official said. “We are trying to help them understand and solve supply chain problems and ease the migrant crisis.”This official added that along with three classes a day, the trainees were asked to do book reviews on various subjects to help broaden their horizons. “Those who haven’t studied Hindi as a first language have to review a book in Hindi, others who are literature graduates have to review books on economy. The academy wants to help them expand their oeuvre.”The second official added an online concurrent assessment is being conducted on the material provided on Covid-19.The second trainee officer said while constant online assessment is being conducted, the trainees are also likely be tested on Covid-19 once the module is completed this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-watching-the-movie-virus-to-studying-the-epidemic-act-ias-trainees-gear-up-for-covid-19-crisis/story-RtPWmLFOzxWCFqrE1T8kRP.html

17-04-2020||India||Kashmiri terrorist got away 25 yrs ago, caught with ISKP chief in Afghanistan||Aijaz Ahmad Ahangar from downtown Srinagar’s Nawa Kadal had been a wanted man in Jammu and Kashmir for more than two decades. He had been arrested once for terror links, and released. This was sometime in the mid-nineties.Aijaz Ahangar aka Abu Usman Al Kashmiri disappeared soon after his release from central jail, travelling to Bangladesh from where they took a flight to Pakistan.Nearly 25 years later, he was arrested early this month by Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security (NDS) in Kandahar, some 500 km from capital Kabul. No one really paid much attention. No one knew.Was a surpriseThe NDS had been far too focussed on their prize catch, Aslam Farooqui, the chief of the Islamic State ‘Khorasan Province’ who had claimed responsibility for the 25 March Kabul Gurdwara attack that killed nearly 27 worshippers.In the early rounds of his questioning, Ahangar identified himself as Ali Mohammed from Islamabad. And it was taken at its face value.The sequence of events that blew up his carefully-crafted cover is still not clear. Counter-terror operatives in Delhi and Kabul, however, told Hindustan Times that it was only much later that they discovered that the April 4 raid had also netted Aijaz Ahmad Ahangar, the 55-year-old chief recruiter of the Islamic State Jammu & Kashmir.“It was a surprise,” acknowledged an Afghan watcher.Terror links in the FamilyAijaz Ahangar, born in Bugam on the outskirts of Srinagar city, wasn’t the only one in his extended family to pick up the gun.According to security agencies, his father-in-law Abdullah Ghazali aka Abdul Ghani Dar had been a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander and had played a role in the formation of the Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen in 1990, a group that was dominated by foreign mercenaries recruited from Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Ghazali was then 50.Aijaz Ahangar married Ghazali’s daughter Rukshsana much later.Abdullah Ghazali, now 80, was found murdered in February this year inside Jamia Masjid Ahl-e-Hadith at Maisuma near Lal Chowk, Srinagar’s business hub. His murder has been attributed to a factional clash within the local leadership of the Islamic religious movement Ahl-e-Hadith.That Aijaz Ahangar went to Pakistan via Bangladesh rather than undertake the treacherous and risky journey across the Line of Control, said one counter-terror official, reflected the family’s links with the Pakistani deep state.And the terror links continueOnce in Pakistan, Aijaz Ahangar was initially settled in Islamabad by Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence. In 2008, according to intelligence reports, he also married Aiysha, a resident of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.At some point, the Aijaz Ahangar family was relocated to Miranshah area of Waziristan near the Afghan border. After a brief association with Al Qaeda, he joined ISIS. Aijaz Ahangar later joined the Islamic State-Khorasan Province.Aijaz Ahangar’s son Abdullah Umais also joined the fighting in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar and was killed a few years ago.His son-in-law, Huzafa-al-Bakistani, a top online recruiter of ISKP and later the IS affiliate in Jammu and Kashmir, was killed in a US drone attack in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province on July 18 2019. A Kerala man, Muhammed Muhasin, was killed in the same bombing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmiri-terrorist-got-away-25-yrs-ago-caught-with-iskp-chief-in-afghanistan/story-QyTGhX6cQ4phcqw14TVbyJ.html

17-04-2020||India||Bengal BJP MP booked under Disaster Management Act, another alleges ‘house arrest’||The police in Bankura district of West Bengal has booked Bankura’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Subhas Sarkar under different sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Disaster Management Act (DMA), 2005, for allegedly spreading false alarms.Another MP, Alipurduars’ John Barla, has written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah alleging that he has been put under ‘house arrest’ by the district administration.While the administration remained tightlipped over the issue, police’s action against Sarkar comes after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s warning on April 15 that people spreading misinformation around Covid-19 would have to face legal action.Sarkar, who is a doctor, has been booked under section 54 of DMA that deals with punishment for whoever ‘makes or circulates a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic’. He has also been booked under section 505 (1) (b) of and 188 of the IPC. The case was registered at Bankura police station on April 14. Section 505 (1)(b) pertains to “Whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement, rumour or report with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public.” Section 188 deals with the ‘disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant’.Criticising the role of the administration, Sarkar said, “I raised the issue of two bodies being secretly buried. Fortunately, none of them tested positive. But the secrecy and the manner in which the burial took place itself caused panic among the people of the district.”Sarkar wrote these things on social media on April 13 and the issue was later raised by other BJP leaders, including the party’s IT cell’s national head, Amit Malviya. Meanwhile, John Barla, who wrote to Amit Shah on April 15, alleged on Thursday that a team of 40 policemen were guarding his residence to ensure he could not move out.“The administration is facilitating Trinamool Congress workers and leaders in distributing relief material but when I went out to offer relief to those in need they seized all the materials and brought me back home. This is a gross injustice,” Barla said.BJP’s Darjeeling MP Raju Singh Bista, too, issued a press statement condemning how Barla had been disallowed to move out of his residence.Another BJP MP, Arjun Singh of Barrackpore, alleged on Thursday that the police blocked his way to a place where he was going to provide relief material. “While on the way to distribution of food packets and other necessities, I have been detained by police at Amdanga under my LS constituency,” Singh alleged in a tweet on Thursday.However, the party’s Hooghly MP Locket Chatterjee distributed relief material within her constituency without facing any trouble.While the administration remained tightlipped, senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and state food minister Jyoti Priya Mallick said that BJP leaders were trying to create trouble at a time the government was focussed on strict implementation of coronavirus lockdown and ensuring that relief reached every household in need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-bengal-bjp-mp-booked-under-disaster-management-act-another-alleges-house-arrest/story-wMY8UnUIoAXao5cMJIb7dP.html

17-04-2020||India||Why India should do random testing||The testing numbers in India in relation to population have been very low by international standards, but so far the same has also been true for the total number of infections as compared to several western nations. So, the question emerges, are testing numbers accurately representing the spread of Covid-19 in the country?The number of cases in India has been rising almost consistently in proportion with the rising number of tests. This means that the more number of tests that have been conducted, the more positive cases we have found. But using purely testing numbers to study the consistency of India’s testing strategy has drawbacks. It is crucial to also look at the total number of tests performed for every confirmed case. This can show how India’s strict testing protocols may have influenced the numbers so they don’t give a clear indication of the spread of the disease and may have left swathes of people out of the testing umbrella.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-india-should-do-random-testing/story-wsabliInz3QRUxDPNOPvqN.html

In a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra said that confusion was created among business establishments after the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) in an April 10 circular, detailing the frequently asked questions (FAQs) on CSR, said contributions to CM’s relief fund or the state relief fund for Covid-19 relief do not qualify for CSR but those to the PM-CARES fund and the State Disaster Management Authority do. In the letter, which has been viewed by HT, Mitra said that the MCA had in its March 23 circular stated that “spending of CSR funds for Covid-19 is eligible CSR activity.”“May I point out that the circular no 10/2020 dtd. 23.3.20 issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, clearly stated that ‘Spending of CSR funds for Covid-19 is eligible CSR activity’. Therefore we were confident that the contributions to the Fund will qualify as CSR activity for businesses Unfortunately, a huge confusion has arisen among companies after the issuance of the FAQ,” he said.The letter added that West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee raised the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a video conference on April 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-donation-to-cm-relief-fund-part-of-csr-west-bengal-fm-amit-mitra/story-40y4IpLKWZoFWMaamkyiiO.html

On April 10, the army said it destroyed launch pads and ammunition dumps in Keran sector in retaliation to the ceasefire violation.Army spokesperson Rajesh Kalia said the army chief, who was accompanied by the Northern Army Commander, Lt Gen YK Joshi and Chinar Corps Commander, Lt Gen BS Raju, also visited formations and units in the area on Thursday. “He was briefed by the Chinar Corps Commander at Badami Bagh Cantonment on the overall situation pertaining to the Line of Control and the hinterland.’’Kalia said that while interacting with jawans, Naravane argued that it was the dawn of a new era of development, peace and prosperity in Kashmir, and applauded them for their morale and motivation. The spokesman said the army chief also reiterated the need to be prepared to meet emerging security challenges at all time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-reviews-security-situation-in-kashmir-as-loc-violations-spike/story-sglr5wRWD9Y4CtIfgcCIeO.html
17-04-2020||India||Institute claims test kit breakthrough||A Trivandrum-based research institution under the Union science and technology ministry said on Thursday that it had developed a substitute diagnostic kit for Covid-19 that was less expensive and more accurate than the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction) test to determine if a person has been infected by the virus.Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) director Dr Asha Kishore said it was the first substitute for the PCR (or RT-PCR) test and it was a path-breaking development at a time the country is struggling with mounting cases of the coronavirus disease.“Validation of our kit was done by the National Institute of Virology centre in Alappuzha, as directed by the Indian Council of Medical Research {ICMR}. It is cheaper, faster and maintains international standards. Now ICMR can include it in the list of approved tests in the country. Distinction between negative and positive graphs was superior to the standard PCR {test},” she said.SCTIMST said Dr Anoop Thekkuveettil, a senior scientist of the biomedical technology wing of the Institute and scientist-in -charge of the division of molecular medicine under the department of applied biology, and his team developed the kit in three weeks.Scientists at the Thiruvananthapuram-based institute said the testing kit, called Chitra Gene LAMP N, was highly confirmatory for the diagnosis of Covid-19 and detected the N gene of Sars- CoV 2, the virus that causes Covid-19, using the reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification of viral nucleic acid (RT-LAMP) technique.This will be one of world’s first few, if not the first, confirmatory diagnostic tests for the N gene of Sars-CoV-2 using the RT-LAMP technique, they said.The test kit, which is specific to the virus’s N gene, can detect two regions of the gene which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread. The new kit allows confirmation in one test without the need for a screening test.Dr. Kishore said in new kit takes 10 minutes for the gene detection test and the sample-to-result time is less than two hours. At least 30 samples can be tested in a single batch in a single machine and the lower waiting time will allow a large number of samples to be tested each day in a single machine in multiple shifts. The time taken for the traditional PCR or RT-PCR test is between five and six hours, said scientists.The testing facility can be set up even in the labs of district hospitals with limited facilities and trained technicians. The results can be read from the machine from a change in the fluorescence level. The new device for LAMP testing costs Rs 2.5 lakh and the test kit for two regions of the N gene( including RNA extraction) will be less than Rs 1,000; an RT-PCR machine costs. Rs 15-40 lakh and the PCR kit test between Rs 1,900 and 2500, scientists said.The institute said it will waive licence fee to encourage industry to take up its technology for mass production to meet India’s immediate needs. The Institute said it will invite expressions of interest from companies for transfer of technology to start large-scale production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/institute-claims-test-kit-breakthrough/story-CbltGn9jmOREi0OXL1KCxO.html
17-04-2020||India||Less is more: Lockdown teaches sustainable habits for survival||In the words of Paul Hawken, the renowned American environmentalist and author, the first rule of sustainability is to align with natural forces or at least not try to defy them. If only the second half of his statement had resonated sufficiently with the masses!The scare of Covid-19 has entrusted us with accountability. The lockdown, almost inadvertently, has roused our consciousness about consumption. Suddenly, urban indulgent imps have become unwilling to consume more than what’s needed. With basic options at hand and a fickle future ahead, we are always looking to save, preserve, upcycle and innovate. Is sustainability no more a lifestyle choice? Is it now a survival strategy or at least, an exercise we are willing to consider? DIY from scratch“We are living in unusual times, times we weren’t prepared for. And look how we have realised our capacity! The fact that we CAN make do with essentials is being absorbed now,” says Rhea Chhabria, eco-preneur, SuckIn. “Currently, you can’t order in a cake. Bakeries are shut so, if you want to celebrate with a cake, you have to bake one. As a result, you avoid the extra packaging, nylon ribbons and a plastic knife -- all of which would have gone into the bin the following day,” Rhea elaborates. SuckIn produces reusable, lead-free and easy-to-clean stainless steel and bamboo straws. She says the curfew has given her time to think up DIY tricks to work around junk. “A couple of sling bags were lying in my wardrobe for years. Had the malls been open, I would have donated these and bought a new bag,” she guiltily admits. Rhea threw in bright colours on her old bags to bring them back in use.Make wonders with wasteGauri Agarwal, founder, Skilled Samaritan, says values at work are no different from values at home. “Working with underprivileged rural communities in northern India has given me an edge in curtailing waste. Except for the internet and gadgets, social distancing has taken us back to the nineties. We are home and spending time with our families. The contagion and need for sanitisation make us carry personal bottles and boxes to a store. These are habits worth living by,” she says. Gauri goes on to explain how the dire situation has made mankind slow down; shops are shut, delivery services are disrupted and we can’t buy things out of fancy. We are inculcating a healthy and responsible way of life. “My team of rural women make charpoys with salvaged textile and industrial waste. They weave plastic waste into handbags and seats. Since I am home constantly and want the space to look inviting, I am redoing nooks with old products. Even when the curfew is lifted, people can use plastic containers or paint tubs as planters and grow their own vegetables,” Gauri signs off.From skin to seed, eat it allHave you walked into your kitchen in the recent past and been cautious about using items in the larder? Chef Arina Suchde, a mixologist who practises sustainable cooking, says one must be watchful. “Now, is the time to learn how to use every part of a fruit or vegetable. We can’t go out as often and hence, we are required to plan meals that stick to the zero or reduced waste policy. We tend to throw away coriander stems when the non-woody ones can be cleaned, chopped and used in some stock or dimsum sauce; they add a nice flavour. The watermelon is our go-to summer fruit, as it keeps the body hydrated. But what about the white part? The white part mimics the taste of a raw papaya or cucumber and is rich in nutrients. After peeling off the green skin, it can be cut in pieces and cooked or can be grated into salads,” she adds. As per Arina, a tenable routine should be put in place even if we are not battling tough times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/less-is-more-lockdown-teaches-sustainable-habits-for-survival/story-JrO3NcaaBzlMmHh4QGUnxL.html
17-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The celebrations can wait.This column has pointed out, more than once, that the trajectory of Covid-19 infections in India is very different from that in any other country. It’s slower; there haven’t been too many deaths; and, at least anecdotally, the proportion of patients requiring ventilator support is lower than that in many other countries.It isn’t clear why. Nor is it clear that this trend will continue (this writer’s hope is that it will).The relatively low number of cases in India — again, as this column has pointed out; when you write a column every day for 30 days, there’s bound to be a bit of repetition — can’t entirely be explained by the country’s low testing. But that stroke of fortune — till science can explain, it is just that — is no excuse not to test more.India has tested 203 people per million of its population. This is lower than even Brazil (296), it is definitely lower than the US (9,866), the UK (6,152), Italy (18,481) and Spain (19,896). A comparative chart put out by the government says that at the time India crossed 5,000 infections and then, 10,000 infections, it had carried out more tests (in absolute terms) than the US, UK, and Italy. That just means that we haven’t learnt from their mistakes. India has been a clear laggard when it comes to testing, just as it has been a leader when it comes to enforcing a lockdown, something that is certain to flatten the curve of infections and also delay the peak.Maharashtra’s aggressive testing, of those at high-risk of infections, is perhaps one reason why the state has the highest number of cases in India — minus a super-event such as the Tablighi Jamaat’s gathering in New Delhi that is responsible for 68% of the city-state’s cases. Since testing resources, like other resources, will always be scarce in India, the protocol will always be skewed towards those at high risk — which will, in turn, mean that at least in the initial phases of testing, states that test more will show more cases. Maharashtra’s testing stands at 504 per million of its population as of Thursday.India will test more in the coming weeks, though, not just in the so-called hot spots and containment zones writhing hot spots but also in what the health ministry describes as green zones -- parts of the country that have seen either no infections or an insignificant number of them. These tests will be done using rapid testing kits (RTKs) that screen for antibodies and will provide crucial information on the actual spread of Covid-19 in India.India has defined a protocol for these tests. A negative test may require a quarantine followed by another antibody test, or an immediate RT-PCR test. A positive test may require isolation and treatment. But countries such as Italy and the UK that want to use the test to decide who gets to return to work will need to do it differently. That’s because of a concept in probability called Bayes’ theorem.Tests for many diseases are defined in terms of sensitivity (probability of an infected person testing positive) and specificity (probability of an uninfected person testing negative). Assuming a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 98% (very high, but lower than ICMR’s requirement of 100% on each, or a USFDA certification), and a situation where 10% of the population is infected, it turns out that the probability of a person who tests positive being infected is (drumroll here), not 99% but only 84.61%. This is because the probability is calculated the other way around in this case — starting from a positive test.I will avoid going into the details because I don’t want to make this column any more geeky, but this is the reason why many people worry about using antibody tests as a basis of deciding who gets to be declared immune. Imagine: a person tests positive and thinks she is immune because she is infected; she is declared eligible to return to work; but according to Bayes’ theorem there is only a 84.61% channel of her being infected (and that too only if the test is very good). Many tests have sensitivity and specificity ratings in the mid-90s. The probability that someone who tests positive is actually infected falls sharply in these. I was first pointed in this direction by the erudite twitter feed of Taal Levi, an associate professor of the College of Agricultural Sciences, Oregon State University (@taaltree).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-OfYzQ3cBVDYLcVSPPd9WHL.html
17-04-2020||India||Your voice may be able to tell if you have Covid||The rush to understand, predict and head off the Covid-19 outbreak has prompted technology researchers to deploy artificial intelligence to create tools that can determine whether people are infected by analysing the sound of their cough, the way they speak or even breathe.Currently, most of these efforts are at a stage in which the researchers are gathering data – speech and coughing recordings paired with information whether someone has an infection. These are then fed to AI algorithms – specifically deep learning and machine learning programmes.“Since the voice production mechanism is so complex and dependent on cognitive abilities, any factor that affects your body or your mind will reflect in your voice. The changes can be in fractions of seconds -- what we call “micro” signatures, that are not audible to the untrained listener, but nevertheless present,” said Rita Singh, a computer sciences research professor at the Carnegie Mellon University, whose team created the Covid Voice Detector.The changes, added Singh in a video-call, carry “a surprising amount of information that can be linked to physiological factors”. “Any condition affecting the lungs or the respiratory system – as has been established in the cases of Covid-19 infections -- has a palpable effect on voice. Moreover, the cough of a Covid patient is also distinct from a healthy person’s,” she added.“The tool is basically a self-learning system that is now trying to learn signatures of a Covid infection that shows up in voice, not just in cough,” Singh said, adding that more data it is fed, the more it understands the signatures.At the core of the tool is a computer programme patented by Singh and used extensively in voice profiling work by law enforcement in United States, according to a homeland security research agency.A similar effort has been launched by researchers at the University of Cambridge. The Covid-19 Sounds app, available as a Chrome or Firefox plugin for now, is at present building a crowdsourced data set.“Having spoken to doctors, one of the most common things they have noticed about patients with the virus is the way they catch their breath when they’re speaking, as well as a dry cough, and the intervals of their breathing patterns,” said professor Cecilia Mascolo from Cambridge’s department of computer science and technology in an article published by the university.A third such initiative is being carried out by Mumbai-based Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Launched on April 7, Wadhwani’s Cough Against Covid mobile application asks users to record the sound of their coughing and share an image of a test result if they are positive.For such efforts to work, the quality and the accuracy of data is crucial. “Such a system needs to be thoroughly vetted by the medical community and thoroughly tested. It must have near-zero false positives and zero false negatives. This is impossible to achieve in a short run, so our goal is tempered down to being able to return more conservative factoids from voice that may still be helpful to everyone,” Singh said.As the disease brings much of the planet to a halt, scientists and health experts have called for technology to play a bigger part in tackling the pandemic – which has grown too quickly for conventional containment tools to have an effect.Software giants such as Apple and Google are working on a mobile phone-based contact tracing tool, a technology that several nations – including India with the Aarogya Setu app – have already deployed on their own.Apart from AI and proximity-estimating tools meant to trace contacts, researchers are also looking at internet-of-things (IOT) devices such as smart thermometers. “A company called Kinsa comes up with heat maps of fever prevalence. Such tools can be useful in identifying large outbreaks that health authorities can respond to and direct testing and containment resources if need be,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, the head of biostatistics at the University of Michigan.The efforts also present a challenge for privacy, since connected device data, personal audio recordings, location histories and health records need to be protected from profiteering and surveillance.India’s Aarogya Setu app has been criticised by privacy advocates for collecting too much data, the use of which is governed by privacy policies that, they say, lacks transparency and accountability. The developers and the government of India have rejected the concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/your-voice-may-be-able-to-tell-if-you-have-covid/story-wmPxMjWsxDTAobUwMQwk3K.html
17-04-2020||India||Band Swaarag has released a fun song on Covid-19 to reduce the stress||Indo-Western fusion band Swaraag has decided to use this time of lockdown productively. They have come up with a fun song to reduce the stress that has been bothering people due to the outbreak of Covid-19. The song titled Ja Ja Re Corona Virus has a Rajasthani folk touch to it and the video of the song has been shot at home.The lyrics of the song which say haath dhote dhote haath laal hogaye hai, corona se bachao is a fun take on the corona scare. “We have been listening to the news and instructions that say wash your hands regularly, don’t be part of large groups, etc. Now, we are artistes and we are used to being in large groups and practising, and our songs represent Indian culture, so until we make a mahaul, we don’t find peace. Therefore, when we were given such restrictions it was difficult to get used to them, so this song came out of those discussions and that pain which we have represented in a fun way in our song,” says Asif Khan, lead singer of Swaarag.4 members of the otherwise seven-piece band have made this song and shot it in their home with whatever limited resources were available to them. “Since there were no professional videographers available due to the lockdown, we thought let’s shoot the video of this song on our phones since everything is possible on phones nowadays. We did face problems like lighting and quality of production but it turned out fine. We made a little space in our small room and shot whatever best we could. The audience has liked it but the video could have been shot better,” adds Mohammad Seif Ali, who plays the tabla in the band.On their routine during the lockdown, Asif says, “Of course, we have been asked to stay at home and we should, but since we are not used to this, bore toh ho hi jaate hai. Everyday, we brothers take music lessons from our dad, we go live on social media, we have dedicated some time to yoga, meditation, some time to riyaaz and we spend some time with family as well. So that’s the routine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/band-swaarag-has-released-a-fun-song-on-covid-19-to-reduce-the-stress/story-NPf5EZpWdlrekUC6E0tJZL.html
17-04-2020||India||Rapid kits finally arrive to test Covid-19 immunity||The much-awaited Rapid Testing Kits, or RTKs, which use antibody-based blood tests for Covid-19, arrived in New Delhi at 11.30am on Thursday after missing their third deadline by a day, and will likely be used to test for coronavirus disease in areas with no or few cases -- the health ministry’s green zones -- according to an official at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The kits will be used to test people with fever, cough, and shortness of breath in 325 districts that are currently unaffected, starting with those that are in states with a high number of Covid-19 cases, explained the official, who asked not to be named. This will be the first mass testing exercise in these districts.“Many states have started dedicated fever clinics; and the samples for rapid testing could either be lifted of people visiting those clinics or cases our front-line workers identify after screening,” added this person.The move will significantly widen testing for Covid-19 in the country, which currently tests around 203 people per million, with most tests restricted to health care workers treating Covid-19 patients, travellers who may have visited countries with a significant number of infections, and people who may have come in contact, directly or indirectly, with an infected person. Much of the testing is also happening in so-called containment areas which are themselves within hot spot districts with either outbreaks or clusters (called red zones by the health ministry) or districts that are not hot spots but with clusters. There are 170 hot spot districts and 207 other districts with clusters. According to the health ministry, all other districts are in the green zone. There are around 730 districts in India.ICMR guidelines say antibody test should be run after seven days of illness, as it takes at least five to seven days for antibodies to develop after contracting an infection.“An antibody test is not suited for diagnostic purposes but it is a useful surveillance tool for epidemiological studies,” said the ICMR official. Put otherwise, it is a quick and easy way to understand the extent to which the disease has spread.“These kits are not for early diagnosis as their sensitivity and specificity is lower than RT-PCR tests; it can be used for surveillance purposes, to periodically spot disease trends; to collect data on whether there is an old infection in a section of population or if it is a recent infection. whether the spread is increasing or being successfully contained in places that are termed as hot spots etc,” Dr RR Gangakhedkar, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR, said at a news briefing on Thursday.And since it is cheaper than RT-PCR, it can easily be deployed for mass testing, if required.The consignment has 500,000 antibody testing kits and 100,000 RNA extraction kits. Of the 500,000, 300,000 are from Guangzhou Wondfo and another 200,000 from Zhuhai Livzon. The RNA extraction kits are supplied by MGI Shenzhen.The flight carrying the supplies finally landed in Delhi at around 11.30am on Thursday.After clearing customs, the kits have been moved to ICMR’s main depot at the National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) in Dwarka, which is one of the two main ICMR depots where the orders placed with different suppliers are being received and stored in the cold container unit.“We have created 16 depots across the country for the storage of these kits, from where the supply is distributed regionally. We have just received the kits and the logistics are being worked out at the moment. We can make use of flights and also transport them by road to nearby places,” said the ICMR official.The stock is being initially distributed to 6 regional depots in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Dibrugarh, Bhopal, and Hyderabad, and later to other 10 depots. The supplies are likely to depart Delhi by Friday.According to people familiar with the mater who asked not to be named, India pulled diplomatic strings after the Chinese suppliers missed three deadlines. Demand for the RTKs, which some countries hope to be able to use to decide who is immune and can therefore return to work, has soared. And the Chinese government has tightened its export policies after a large number of kits failing quality tests in other countries, causing some amount of embarrassment to Beijing.“We have been emphasising on having the National Medical Product Administration, China, approval for all items being imported from China. It’s a sort of quality assurance certificate from the Chinese government, and we are rejecting anything that is not certified ,” a second ICMR official said on condition of anonymity.The Indian embassy in Beijing tweeted that “it is important to ensure product quality as well as reasonable and stable prices”. It called on China’s National Medical Products Administration to expedite registration of Chinese firms, especially those with export orders and already licenced by Indian regulatory bodies.The external affairs ministry is also working to obtain testing kits from other countries. “Firm quotations have been obtained from companies in Canada, France, Malaysia, the UK and the US. We have also obtained leads from companies in Germany and Japan,” an official familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.Experts say that India’s decision to introduce antibody testing kits could be a game-changer in its fight against Covid-19.“Rapid testing needs to be ramped up for the country to be able to get back to normalcy. If we want to cover maximum people who have symptoms to know the disease burden, then rapid testing is the solution as it is quicker and cheaper, and helps in achieving the ultimate goal of public health care testing,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.“However, the quality of kits plays a crucial role. It is also a good way of picking infections when we know most of those infected will not show symptoms or depict mild symptoms,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-kits-finally-arrive-to-test-covid-19-immunity/story-ksBNFO4OtunByDP8ceZ2PJ.html
17-04-2020||India||A majority of Jaipur’s Covid-19 cases have links to Ramganj superspreader: Collector||Jaipur has emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hotspot district in Rajasthan, accounting for almost one-third of the state’s total cases. The district administration has devised a new strategy of containment. In an interview to Hindustan Times, District Collector Joga Ram elaborates on the interventions and talks about the superspreader. Here are a few excerpts from the interview:Q: As Covid-19 cases in Jaipur continue to rise, the obvious question is – how many have been caused by the Ramganj superspreader?A: Mohd Mubarak from Ramganj is responsible for at least 232 cases, directly and indirectly. His two friends, Hanif and Iqbal, who were infected by him, spread it further. According to our records, Mubarak’s direct contacts gave way to 94 cases and the remaining spread through Hanif and Iqbal. Mubarak was discharged from SMS Hospital on April 2 and shifted to RUHS [Rajasthan University of Health Sciences] for quarantine. Some of his relatives are also with him there.Q: Why has the famous Bhilwara model of containment failed in Jaipur?A: Bhilwara and Jaipur are two different worlds. Just for an understanding, Jaipur’s population is 20 times that of Bhilwara’s population. In Jaipur, there are around 8,00,000 people in the walled city area alone. In Jaipur, one issue was quantum and density of population and the second issue was sociological – we faced resistance from people during sampling and when we tried to put them in government quarantine facilities.Q: What did you do to overcome this resistance?A: We distributed around 1,00,000 pamphlets with information about why testing was important and how it is done. Then we engaged religious leaders and clerics to record video messages and circulated them on WhatsApp groups. The religious leaders also made announcements on loudspeakers that people should cooperate with medical teams. Local representatives and officers of a particular faith also convinced people. After that we started aggressive testing and the high number of cases could be because of mass testing which was done.Q: Is it also true that people from the walled city were reluctant to go to government quarantine centres?A: Yes, there was resistance over that, too. But gradually people understood that isolation was for their own good. As of Wednesday evening, there are 1,500 people under home isolation and 980 in institutional quarantine.Q: How many samples have you tested?A: We have tested about 8,000 samples so far, which is the highest in the state. Testing happened at three levels: one was of symptomatic cases; second was at health centres where suspected cases voluntarily came forward; and the third was for academic purpose where we picked 30 samples each from 30 clusters. From Wednesday, we have also started random sampling outside the walled city area. 10 teams are on the move, picking up samples from all parts of the city, and 10 are static.Q: What is the latest containment strategy?A: We have identified an area of 1km by 1km in the walled city which is responsible for most of Jaipur’s cases. Mubarak’s house is also in this area. By 1pm on April 15, this area accounted for 395 cases. (The total in Jaipur is 468). This is the area that needs to be managed. On Wednesday, we sealed this area completely – no movement, no exemptions. We will get everything delivered to people’s doorstep but no one will be allowed to move in or move out. There are narrow and congested lanes that have been barricaded. The entire area has been divided into 13 clusters. Q: Will the people in this area not be allowed to go out even for ration?A: No. There’s a complete shutdown. There are around 8,000 households in this area and we have given each of them two kits of dry ration free of cost. Each kit contains 5 kg wheat flour, 1kg rice, 1 kg daal, 1 kg salt, half litre cooking oil, 500 grams each of chilli powder and turmeric powder, one soap, one 180 ml bottle of sanitiser and masks for each member of the family. With two kits, people won’t need to step out. For vegetables and milk, we will organise home delivery on e-rickshaws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-majority-of-jaipur-s-covid-19-cases-have-links-to-ramganj-superspreader-collector/story-sBZ74GNKc0R1R75Tgax1KK.html

After taking due permissions from the district administration, Sharma had travelled to Bhubaneswar with his wife and two sons. However, they were denied entry by the house owner Laxmidhar Bhuyan, a serving colonel in Indian Army as the Sharmas were travelling from Bhubaneswar, a Covid-19 hotspot with over 30 cases.“My parents and my two brothers (37-year-old and 25-year-old) were not allowed entry inside the rented house as the house owner said they should spend 14 days in quarantine before entering. My father needs special meals every hour, yet he had to skip his meals and had to sit outside the rented home between 12.30 pm and 8 pm today. The house owner was stubborn not to allow him and my family members entry,” said Asha Sharma, daughter of the cancer patient.The district administration led by Balasore additional district magistrate Sambit Kumar Nayak arrived at the spot to reason with the house owner to let him enter, but he did not see reason till the deputy Superintendent of police Manoj Rout spoke to him over phone. “The house owner agreed to let Sharma and his wife enter the house, but did not allow his two sons. He has asked the two sons to be on quarantine for 14 days,” said Rout.The incident came three days after people in Sundargarh district did not allow cremation of a 50-year-old tribal woman who had died of tuberculosis suspecting her death due to coronavirus. On the morning of April 13, Shanti Tanti (50) of Kumarmunda in Sundargarh district succumbed to tuberculosis at VSS Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR) in western Odisha district of Sambalpur. As her daily wager husband Suresh Tanti did not have enough cash to hire an ambulance to take the body to native place, three young doctors of the hospital - senior resident doctor Shankar Ramchandani and post graduate students Tushar Behera and Rajesh Meher – came forward and crowd-funded Rs 4,600 for the ambulance charge.However when the body of the woman reached Kumarmunda after travelling 220 km, villagers refused to allow the body to enter the village limits alleging that the tribal woman had died of Coronavirus and her body could be source of infection. The man returned with the body of her wife, but still could not cremate the body at public crematorium as he did not Aadhaar card of the deceased.“The man was already in the throes of the biggest tragedy of his life and then people were further stigmatising him. No one was willing to understand that when government medical college has allowed a body to be cremated in village, the death is surely not due to Covid-19. As doctors, we could not sit silent and went to crematorium. In our presence, the body was cremated,” said Dr. Ramchandani.In a similar incident, the body of a pregnant woman of Mayurbhanj district who died soon after delivering a boy was not allowed entry by villagers who suspected her to be have died of Coronavirus. Sunita Baske, a tribal woman from Mayurbhanj working as treasury officer was admitted to a nursing home in Soro block of Balasore after she underwent labour pains on Wednesday. Baske however died in the nursing home soon after giving birth to a baby boy.However, when Ramchandra Hansdah, the husband of the deceased was planning to take the body back to Mayurbhanj, the villagers asked him not to come alleging that she has died of Coronavirus. “The villagers threatened me with social ostracisation if I came there with my wife’s body. As there was no other way, I cremated my wife’s body at Soro with the help of local lawyers’ association,” said Hansdah.Lst week, an ambulance driver of Kalahandi district who had driven a Covid19 patient from the district to Cuttack was not allowed entry by people in his village. The ambulance was sanitised and then Sethi had worn the necessary personal protective equipments, yet the villagers were insistent of not allowing him entry. He is now staying ina government quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cancer-patient-refused-entry-in-the-house-by-landlord-due-to-covid-19-scare/story-OZxT5BX7JSy7nRo2PleXqM.html
17-04-2020||India||MP pollution control board asks Reliance firm to pay Rs 10 cr for dyke breach||The Madhya Pradesh pollution control board on Thursday sought interim relief of Rs 10 crore from Reliance’s Sasan Power Limited, holding it responsible for the April 10 breach in its fly ash dyke resulting in the death of five people in the state’s Singrauli, 780 kms north-east of Bhopal. The money, the board said, should be deposited within a fortnight and asked the company to start remedial and restoration work within 14 days.In a letter written on April 13, the board warned that if the measures as directed by it are not taken up within the stipulated timeframe “the industry shall be closed down” and shall not restart production till further orders.The board also warned that in case of non-compliance of the order “the concerned authorities shall disconnect the water supply, electricity supply and other facilities available to the industry with immediate effect”.Six people including a woman and her two children, and a man and his son went missing and two women sustained injuries after a fly ash dyke of the Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project developed a breach on April 10 evening.According to district collector of Singrauli, KVS Chaudhary, bodies of five of the six people have been recovered so far.Chaudhary said on Thursday, “Rs 10 lakh each was paid to the next of kin of the dead apart from compensation for the houses damaged. The company has also offered jobs to the next of kin of the deceased. Survey of agricultural land damaged due to fly ash has also been done. The money will be deposited in the bank accounts of the farmers from tomorrow.”The MPPCB in its April 13 letter said, “…Whereas industry started filling the low lying area with fly ash in the slurry form which was found to be a violation of the conditions of permissions and therefore a show cause notice was given to the industry vide letter dated March 30, 2019 indicating the violation being done by the industry along with suitable warning.”The board said, “…due to the above violations done by the industry and due to indiscriminate and uncontrolled discharge of ash slurry against the conditions of the permission of low lying area filling and against the condition of consent, the breakage of illegally constructed bund wall took place resulting in the overflow of fly ash slurry which has caused damage to the environment, agriculture, property, and lives of human and cattle. A large quantity of fly ash is suspected to have reached the Govind Vallabh Pant reservoir thereby affecting the water quality, tank capacity, and the life of aquatic flora and fauna is also at stake.”The board has asked the company inter alia to take up repair and restoration work immediately; and to depute an institute of national repute to assess the quantum of environmental damage. It has also told the company to submit a time bound action plan and to assess the design and structural safety of the ash dyke of the industry situated near village Harrhawa.Environment expert and advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey said, “The board’s letter has corroborated my charges that it was the company which was responsible for the incident and loss of life. It was the third such incident in the region within a year but unfortunately the government and its agencies don’t take exemplary action to deter others from being involved in such negligence.” When contacted AK Singh, chief executive officer of Sasan Power Ltd, said, “We have got 15 days time. There is an entire team involved. We are discussing it. We will take advice of technical experts too and then we will decide how to go ahead.” Earlier, in its response when the incident had taken place the company had said, “We are deeply anguished by the incident involving the break in the ash dump yard wall at our Sasan Power Plant. The break in ash dump yard wall pushed the water leading to break in the boundary wall affecting some thatched houses and minor land parcel. We are investigating the reasons underlying the incident. Power Plant operations continue as the relief and restoration work is not affected by the same. We are closely working with locals and the district administration in relief and restoration work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-pollution-control-board-asks-reliance-firm-to-pay-rs-10-cr-for-dyke-breach/story-W4ujhRrcjuegnGkIZ8ZvqK.html
17-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Maharashtra becomes first state with more than 3,000 infections||With around a fourth of the total cases in the country, Maharashtra on Thursday has become the first state to cross 3,000 Covid-19 cases. The number of infected people in Mumbai rose over 2,000 with 177 new cases. The state government has claimed that there was a drop in the rate of doubling of the cases and increase in recovery of Covid-19 patients. The state government has also started planning to relax the lockdown restrictions in about half of its districts from next week by allowing the industrial operations and within district movements.A total of 286people tested positive on Thursday taking Maharashtra’s tally to 3,202, while deaths of seven more patients took the number of casualties to 194. Among those who died, four were from Mumbai while three were from Pune. Four of them were above 60 years of age while the others were above 40. Six had underlying ailments including diabetes, heart ailment, asthma and high blood pressure, the state health department said in a statement.The number of positive cases reached 2,063 in Mumbai which remains the most affected city in India. The health department said it has conducted 56,673 tests at various public and private facilities till date. Of them 52,762 people tested negative. Maharashtra currently has 297 active containment zones. A total of 5,664 survey teams comprising doctors and assisting staff have screened more than 20.50 lakh people. Three hundred patients have been discharged from the hospitals after their recovery from the infection, 71,076 people in the state are home quarantined, while 6,108 are under institutional quarantine.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the rate of the doubling of cases has improved to 5.5 days from 2 and 3.5 days a few days ago. “We expect to improve it further. It is true that the mortality rate in the state is high at 7%, but it is due to the co-morbidity among the patients. 83% deaths are related to underlying ailments such diabetes, and ailments related to heart and kidney. We have also formed a task force of experts to suggest measures to minimize death rate and clinical management of Covid-19 patients who are critically ill,” he said.He added that the percentage of the patients being discharged after the successful recovery from the Covid-19 infection has increased. “Our focus on expediting the recovery has been reaping fruits as the rate of discharging patients has increased. 300 patients have been discharged so far,” he said. The minister said six more labs are expected to be added in the existing count of 36 laboratories for testing samples for coronavirus. “We are expecting the approval from the ICMR to our proposal of pool testing rapid testing,” he said. He said that all 1400 people from Maharashtra, who had attended international congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi, have been traced, quarantined and tested.“Only 50 of them are Covid-19 positive, the rest are kept in quarantine facilities,” he said.The state government is also planning to relax the lockdown restriction in the state from April 20. The relaxation will, however, be in the non-affected areas and limited only to the essential services, industries and agriculture sector by strict following of the lockdown norms. Tope clarified that no public gathering will be allowed or educational institutions such as school and colleges will be allowed to function.The state government is also planning to increase the workforce in government offices to 33%. In a video conference on Thursday, top level officials held discussion on the guidelines by the central government. “Based on the notification issued by the Centre, we have already included a few auxiliary sectors in exempted essential activities. The districts with no Covid-19 patients or less than 15 patients can have more relaxation from the lockdown restrictions,” said an official on condition of anonymity.There are seven districts with no positive patients and four other districts whose rural parts are unaffected. These districts will get maximum relief though all the activities will be released within the district boundaries which have been sealed. The districts with less than 15 patients are expected to get relief in the unaffected areas. However the most affected areas, mostly governed by municipal corporation will continue with the lockdown with its strict implementation, said the official.Industries minister Subhash Desai said that the state government was considering allowing industrial operations in at least 20 districts which have either no case or very few cases from April 20. “Following the Centre’s guidelines for the second phase of lockdown and by using our own powers we are preparing a proposal to begin industrial operations in some districts. The industrial units following the standard operating procedures (SOP) and making arrangements for their employees would be allowed to begin operations,” he said. The minister said that the industrial units will have to make arrangements for the shelter and transportation of the workers. According to officials, the state government has planned to begin operations of at least 60% MSMEs by month end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-maharashtra-becomes-first-state-with-more-than-3-000-infections/story-uIiQ7jUHdtWKWJPr7E858N.html
17-04-2020||India||Covid-19 stimulus package to revive economy could be 2%-4% of GDP: Official||Expectations for a relief and stimulus package for individuals and businesses rose after Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed on Thursday, in a meeting with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the impact on the Indian economy of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the ongoing national lockdown aimed at limiting its spread. HT learns that chief economic adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian is putting together the package. People familiar with the matter said that the stimulus would be announced shortly, but none of the officials HT spoke to could give an exact date.The meeting between the PM and the finance minister comes against the backdrop of demands by industry bodies of a package anywhere between Rs 14 lakh crore and Rs 16 lakh crore to revive the economy. There’s been little economic activity since the lockdown was declared on March 25. There has been some easing of restrictions since, and more will be eased on April 20, especially for manufacturing facilities in economic enclaves and businesses focused on rural India, but the lockdown is to continue till May 3. Two people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that the package will cover the farm sector, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and large businesses. There could also be something in it for individual taxpayers, said a third person, adding that the size of the package could be anything between 2% and 4% of the GDP. That will work out between Rs 5 lakh crore and Rs 7.5 lakh crore. None of the three wished to be identified. It is almost ready, the third person said, but given that the situation is “dynamic”, bits are being added to it all the time. There is complete recognition of the need for “big relief”, this person added , a sort of “new deal”, a reference to the US plan to exit the Great Depression.The first person said there will be complementary monetary measures by the Reserve Bank of India to help companies. Late last month, RBI infused an additional Rs 3.74 lakh crore of liquidity into the system and said it would do “whatever it takes” to handle the crisis. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package under the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana on March 26 that included food security and cash payments to the vulnerable sections of society. But there’s been no announcement of a larger package. “Government needs to announce a large fiscal package for affected industries and sectors which are at high and medium risk,” State Bank of India (SBI) said in its research report Ecowrap. Experts say that economic activity in India will decline by at least 50% in the 40 days of the lockdown (till May 3) -- a loss of around $137 billion. With supply chains broken, even the lifting will not help things return to normal, they added. The International Monetary Fund has said India will grow by 1.9% in 2020 (calendar year), a number that looks positively cheerful when compared with Barclay’s assessment of 0% and Nomura’s that it will shrink by 0.5%. According to Niranjan Hiranandani, president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry, companies want government to expeditiously clear its dues to them -- Rs 2.2 lakh crore is owed to fertiliser companies alone, he explained -- and temporarily cut GST on all products by half to boost demand. The government is working towards clearing all vendor dues, two of the three people said. The first official said RBI could lower policy rates by another 100 basis points to infuse liquidity and some moratorium from repayments for both personal and corporate loans. “There is a demand for further easing of monetary policy from stakeholders. Inflationary pressure is also lower. Theoretically, there is a possibility, but a decision on this matter will only be taken by the central bank,” he said. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. RBI last month advanced its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting to help the country’s financial system tide over the coronavirus disease pandemic and on March 27 sharply reduced the policy rate by 75 basis points to 4.4%. One of the immediate issues is to provide relief to daily wagers, the first person said. “But that is expected to be resolved to a large extent with agricultural and industrial activities (outside the municipal limits) will start from April 21. But, farmers will require faster procurement, and small industries that employee workers in large number would require financial support to restart their business. A fund can be created to support them.”On April 9, HT reported that the government was considering creating a fund with a corpus between Rs 50,000 crore and Rs 75,000 crore to help small industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-fm-meet-with-stimulus-in-pipeline/story-g8gSET8RkzCwAjPnuJnAgP.html
17-04-2020||India||Hyderabad art auction raises Rs 5 lakh for Covid fight||An art gallery in Hyderabad raised Rs 5 lakh for relief work related to the coronavirus epidemic that has already infected over 13,000 persons across the country. At 8am on Tuesday, a charity auction involving 35 original artworks of 27 Hyderabad-based artists went live on Kalakriti gallery’s website. Titled Art in Isolation, the auction is expected to close on April 17, following which the amount may undergo further revision. While online auctions and art sales, and even online viewing of art works is not a new phenomenon, this is the first time that the gallery has sold any work of art online, promoter Rekha Lahoti said. All proceeds of the auction will go to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. As on Thursday evening, 20 works had been sold and at least 40 art lovers had bid on works made by a range of artists working across media, including Thota Vaikuntam, Fawad Tamkanat, Laxman Aelay and Nirmala Biluka, among others.While Vaikuntam, a National Award winner, is known for his paintings that depict the Telangana rural idiom, Tamkanat, the son of famous Urdu poet Shaz Tamkanat, is also renowned as a printmaker. Aelay was already a well known book illustrator in the Telugu literary circles before he trained professionally as an artist, while Biluka is a professor of art as well as a curator.“In all, 35 paintings of different sizes with a base price range of Rs 10,000 to Rs 380,000, had been put up in the virtual gallery for the art enthusiasts to go through and participate in the auction,” Lahoti said.Shivarama Chary’s chrome plated fiberglass sculptures were also put up for auction.After the online tour — designed as though the viewer were standing inside a white cube and seeing the works on a wall — the buyer could click on a work, enter personal information, and place a bid. The estimate included the base (or minimum) price as well as the market price of the work. For instance, A Rajeshwara Rao’s Kohinoor Hai Kya, an 36”x30” acrylic on canvas has a base price of Rs 120,000 and a market price of Rs 225,000. His work, a riff on courtly miniatures but in a larger format and with a more modern female subject, sold for Rs 125,000 in the auction.“All the sale proceedings of the e-auction will go to the Telangana chief minister’s relief fund. The buyers can issue cheques directly to the fund. Neither the artist nor the gallery will charge anything,” Aelay, one of the artists whose work is in the auction, said.The gallery has also chosen to eschew the buyer’s premium, Lahoti said. The buyer’s premium is a percentage of the hammer (or final) price that a winning bidder additionally pays in an auction.“It is a good initiative by the Telangana artists to contribute their might for a noble cause by auctioning their paintings. They have shown that artists, too, have a responsibility towards society,” Hanumantha Rao Devulapalli, another popular artist from Hyderabad, who conducted exhibitions in Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi.The artworks will be sent to the eventual owners once the lockdown is lifted.(With inputs from Dhamini Ratnam)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyd-art-auction-raises-5-lakh-for-covid-fight/story-hxHrefuxGTf0qi2NMpjqCP.html
17-04-2020||India||17 arrested for sending migrant labourers to UP and Bihar in ambulance||At midnight, Wednesday, two ambulances stopped at the police picket at Vatika Chowk in Gurugram’s Sohna road.There were five people in each; one of the five was on a stretcher, and an IV drip was attached to his hand; the other four said they were with the sick person; the same hospital had issued documents to both patients who, to close the loop, were suffering from the same aliment. And that’s how the Gurugram police unearthed a racket that has been ferrying migrant workers to their homes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in ambulances in violation of the ongoing national lockdown. The operation was the brainchild of Suresh Kumar from Adampur in Hisar district, who also goes by the sobriquet Doctor, although, as can be expected, he isn’t one. The 10 people being ferried in the two ambulances were migrant workers; they had paid Rs 9000 each (half in advance) to go home to Khandsa in Champaran, Bihar, almost 1200 km from Gurugram. The policemen manning the picket tried calling the numbers of the hospital as mentioned in the documents but found out that these weren’t in use. “We brought all of them to the police station and questioned them individually. They revealed that they contacted a doctor in a private hospital who demanded Rs 9,000 from each person to send them home in an ambulance,” said Mukesh Kumar, station house officer, Badshahpur police stationPreet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the interrogation led the police to Suresh KumarIt turns out that the 10 men worked in different export houses and were all tailors. The national lockdown, declared on March 25 to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease , and extended by 19 days to May 3 on Tuesday, had forced their units to close. Jobless, the men waited it out during the first phase of the lockdown and then decided to escape home. Kumar was working in a hospital in Sector 10 A for the last three years -- as manager, not a doctor. He was arrested on Thursday. He confessed that he used a network of ambulances to send labourers home -- after figuring out that this was a good way to make money during the lockdown. “Suresh Kumar has already sent a few ambulances to Lucknow, Agra, Bhagalpur, Gopalganj and Champaran in the last 20 days. He and the ambulance owners used to split the money,” said SHO Mukesh Kumar.The police have recovered medical prescription pads, a rubber stamp of a hospital identified as Halson hospital, which closed a few months ago (it was on Basai Road in Old Gurugram) according to Kumar.Sixteen suspects -- four ambulance drivers, 10 migrants and two contractors -- were produced before the duty magistrate and were sent to 14-day judicial custody. Suresh Kumar will be produced in court on Friday, the police said.Sangwan said the police are questioning Kumar because they suspect his involvement in a drugs racket that stretched from Gurugram to Bihar. Police commissioner Muhammad Akil said ambulances attached to the mortuary in Gurugram are under the scanner and all the ambulances crossing borders will be thoroughly checked and calls made to hospitals concerned. “Anyone found involved in any illegal activity will be booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code,” he said.A case under sections 120 B(conspiracy), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 420 (cheating), 467 (Forgery of valuable security), 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged document) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Badshahpur police station on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-arrested-for-sending-migrant-labourers-to-up-and-bihar-in-ambulance/story-aAdhfaV3yCPFQdqzQwqPjM.html
17-04-2020||India||Airlines told to give full refund for tickets booked during lockdown till May 3||The Centre on Thursday ordered domestic and foreign airlines to refund passengers in full for bookings on flights that have been suspended during the extended coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown until May 3 . An advisory by the government sent to the airlines said the refunds were for meant for passengers who had booked flights until May 3 during the first phase of the lockdown, from March 25 until April 14. Senior civil aviation ministry officials said the order does not apply to passengers who had booked flights prior to the lockdown. “There were several distress cases that we got {to know} of passengers who had booked flights from April 15 onward thinking the lockdown would be lifted and our priority was to address those cases. The second issue was of passengers who had booked in the first lockdown during the same period,” a senior ministry official said requesting anonymity.“For example, there were several cases where airlines were still taking bookings despite India’s lockdown orders, . which we said will not be allowed and they will have to pay the passengers back in full,” the official added.The advisory issued by the ministry of civil aviation (MOCA) said airlines have to refund the full amount collected from passengers without levying any cancellation charge.“Substantial number of travelers eager to move from the places where they were have booked tickets for the travel after the end of the lockdown period ie from April 15 onward. Currently, the Government has further extended the lockdown period up to May 3, 2020, with the ban continuing on operation of all domestic and international flights,” the advisory said. “MOCA acknowledges the unusual situation that has arisen due to the lockdown being imposed to contain the further spread of COVID-19 and its consequential effect on the air passengers and airlines.,” it added. Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) was instructed to monitor the airlines’ compliance with the order. “A circular has been issued by the ministry of civil aviation for guidance and strict compliance of domestic and foreign airline operators engaged in domestic and international air travel in India,” DGCA said. The advisory came after a meeting was chaired by the civil aviation minister with CEOs of private airlines Wednesday to discuss the issue of refunds for flights cancelled during the lockdown period. “Airlines have reiterated that advance bookings for flights will not be stopped,” another senior official said. IndiGo, India’s largest airline by passengers carried, on April 14 announced it will resume flight operations from May 4 in a phased manner. “We will begin operations for domestic only and then gradually ramp it up further, to commence operations on some international routes as well. Our singular focus will be on ensuring the health of our customers and our employees,” Ronojoy Dutta, chief executive officer of IndiGo, said. Meanwhile, Indian Railways cancelled advance booking for all trains. The transporter said no advance reservation of train tickets, including e-tickets, will be allowed until further orders although the facility of online cancellations will remain functional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airlines-told-to-give-full-refund-for-tickets/story-Tskj5gqx1MGQ7X77YXjXrN.html
17-04-2020||India||Covid crisis temporary brake, it will improve: Prakash Javadekar||The coronavirus crisis will be just a temporary “brake”, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar, said, explaining that the government is trying to save lives even as it keeps an eye on the economy. From April 20, many sectors will open up, providing livelihoods to many, he added in an interview to Hindustan Times. Edited excerpts: The world is in the grip of the coronavirus disease. Lives and livelihoods are at stake. How do you view the situation?This is a global crisis of which no one had an inkling. So the world was caught unawares. Many countries fumbled on imposing a lockdown . Now, not just WHO [World Health Organization] but the entire world acknowledges that India imposed a strict lockdown and also effectively communicated -- what is social distancing, washing hands and wearing of masks. We have also worked to ensure that livelihoods are not lost. From April 20, there will again be work opportunities. Some people have carried out negative propaganda. Facts were twisted to create rumours -- that there was a hospital with separation of patients on religious basis or other such. We have worked to quash those rumoursYou mentioned fake news. How do you view the problem of fake news, especially on platforms such as WhatsApp? A lot of misinformation is carried on these platforms. We are a democratic country. These platforms, WhatsApp and others, work independently and are encrypted. We only have the Information Technology law of 2000 regarding these platforms. Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad deals with this sector. In such cases, we have also referred instances to them for appropriate action. We will follow up and see what they do. One of the problems which has flared up again (after the extension of the lockdown) is that of migrant workers. They came in search of livelihoods but are stuck in other states. Many of them want to return.I actually don’t want to comment on this, but people must understand the size of the problem.If two to four crore people travel from one state to another that what would be the state of affairs? If there is even one infected person in a train or a bus, who will guarantee the safety of the others? Now, from April 20, work is also starting in many sectors. So, (it is) better to go back to work and earn. The district administrations are also helping them.As the Prime Minister has said that we need Jaan [life]and Jahan [world]. We need life and also work. If we don’t have life then what is work, and if there is no work then life will be difficult. Therefore, from April 20 you will see many major industries restart…in rural areas; work related to highways, agriculture, food processing will begin. I have full faith that daily wagers who could not work for 20-21 days because of the lockdown will see a different situation.In Mumbai’s Bandra, a crowd of migrants gathered especially at a time when the focus is on social distancing. The incident also saw an FIR against a journalist for a report that allegedly caused this. As I&B minister, how do you see this situation?First of all what happened in Bandra, where so many people who were not even carrying bags, gathered. Was it because someone had promised food or someone had incited them? Nineteen (other) people have even been arrested. There will be investigation and the facts will be known. The media, especially the print media, has been hit hard because of the lockdown -- in terms of both advertising revenue but also circulation. As I&B minister, what are your views on this?I am also worried, I have submitted a note to my party about the situation. The issue is because of some superstitions, blind faith or some WhatsApp message, people have stopped buying newspapers. They think it will give them the virus and the distribution chain has got affected. I think that is the situation. All of us have to come together to dispel such doubts. There is a problem. The media’s job is to create awareness on this. Government is also very proactive on this. But any industry or business factors in profits and losses. I am sure there will not be any retrenchment, not only in media, but in any sector. Because people will be required when India rises again.As the heavy industries minister, are you planning any steps that may boost the industry?We have readied a mechanism to push e-vehicles, frame one and frame two. I reviewed it yesterday and planning something. The working of the auto sector is related to another ministries but we also work keeping it in mind. Overall, I believe this is a temporary brake. Things will improve. The country that manages to save its people will move ahead. There are concerns that the fight against Covid-19 is getting polarized, especially over the Nizamuudin congregation incident.I don’t think that people are divided. People are united and I don’t think they are viewing it from a religious prism. There was an incident of negligence and the country has seen the consequences. That is also a reality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-crisis-temporary-brake-it-will-improve-prakash-javadekar/story-nqsMaQ4DdLcpjOQIQiQHjK.html
17-04-2020||India||In containment zones, WhatsApp groups are the new lifelines||A 10-metre lane, barricaded on both ends and crammed with buildings populated by nearly 160 families, in east Delhi’s Kishan Kunj, is a coronavirus containment zone. And a WhatsApp group – ‘GALI no. 4’ – is its lifeline.On Thursday, a police head constable, seated close to one of the barricades, could be seen diligently going through his WhatsApp messages and scribbling on his notepad.“WhatsApp has turned out to be a useful resource in these containment zones, in terms of ensuring delivery of essentials to residents,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday after a review meeting on containment zones in the city.Delhi currently has 60 such no-go zones.HT visited the permissible peripheries of four containment zones on Thursday and found that the same WhatsApp-enabled system was being followed in all four areas. Messaging groups have been created and one member from each family make up the members. The administrators are police officers, officials from the subdivisional magistrate’s office, and at least one office-bearer of the local residents’ welfare association (RWA).Throughout the day, the containment zones witness a slew of measures being taken under a drafted protocol. They include periodic sanitisation drives, police patrolling, door-to-door health checks and test sample collections for individuals with cold or flu-like symptoms. Amid all that, residents keep making lists of essential items – food, fruits, milk, vegetables, and groceries – as and when they remember it. They then post these on the groups, an official said.This leads to Step 2: A police personnel or government official makes a note of the lists and alerts vendors on how much provisions to bring. Then, a group of vendors, who have been assigned certain time slots by officials, arrive at the barricades with their carts. Through the same WhatsApp groups, residents are asked to come to the barricades in groups of two or three, in order to ensure social distancing, and collect the essentials after making payment. The barricades define the limits of life in a lockdown-- no one is allowed to physically cross them.“Earlier, we were receiving a lot of complaints about people in containment zones not being able to get essentials. A containment zone should not be perceived as a punishment zone. It is for people’s own safety. That is why a standard operating procedure (SOP) regarding WhatsApp groups and how they are to be administered was floated through the subdivisional magistrates earlier this week,” a senior government official said.He further said complaints have reduced and in several containment zones, no fresh case has been reported since they were sealed. Containment zones in Kishan Kunj, Vasundhara Enclave, Dilshad Garden and Khichripur have emerged as model zones under the Delhi government’s operation SHIELD.“SHIELD” is an acronym for “Sealing, Home Quarantine, Isolation and Tracking, Essential Supply, Local Sanitisation and Door-To-Door Checking”.“The instructions were clear. One cannot enforce containment without ensuring that residents get all essentials regularly. We are doing our best,” Arun Mishra, district magistrate, east Delhi, said.South district follows a slightly different protocol. Retailers have also been included in the WhatsApp groups so that officials do not have to make notes. The retailers drop the order at the collection point. But there is an added responsibility --- municipal workers and government officials have to ensure 100% doorstep delivery beyond that point and collect the money in case of cash payments.“This strategy is to ensure nobody comes out of their homes at any cost. Not even till the barricades. WhatsApp groups have made our task much easier,” B M Mishra, district magistrate, south Delhi, said.Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, called it a good strategy. “Isolation and social distancing are must under the current circumstances and they have to be strictly followed in the containment zones to prevent any possible spread of the virus. These are vulnerable areas which demand innovative ways to make lives easier for residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-containment-zones-whatsapp-groups-are-the-new-lifelines/story-gHBGTnqN1ySQLsAxEB8IWJ.html
17-04-2020||India||Virus spread will decelerate due to lockdown: Niti Aayog member||The rate of spread of Sars-Cov-2, the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease, has slowed sharply in the past month and will decelerate further as a result of the nationwide lockdown, according to Dr Vinod Paul, a member of the government policy think tank NITI Aayog, who heads the empowered group overseeing the Covid-19 medical emergency management plan. The number of infections is now doubling every week, compared to 3.5. days in the second week of March, said Dr. Paul, who predicted that it will soon reach 10 days.“We are seeing a flattening of the curve and let us hope it stays that way,’’ he told Hindustan Times, “From infection rates being similar to Italy’s around March 13, it is now moving towards doubling every 10 days.”The first death of a Covid-19 patient in India was reported on March 12 and the number of infections were 74 at the time.According to Dr. Paul, who along with home secretary Ajay Bhalla has been part of the task force to decide the lockdown period and how to emerge from it, that’s when measures such as social distancing were announced, some states shut down selected areas and educational institutions started closing.“We see the impact of this with an inflection point on March 23,’’ said Dr. Paul. `”From doubling every 3.5 days, it then improved to doubling every five days by March 29.’’In the next few days, India’s infection rate again quickened.”That’s because of the entire Tablighi Jamaat incident which gave us a scare for the next few days,’’ he said. Hundreds of Covid-19 positive cases started emerging from among people who participated in the Tablighi Jamaat’s mid-March congregation at the Islamic missionary group’s Markaz headquarters in Nizamuddin , which has since emerged as India’s biggest coronavirus hotspot,By March 29, India had 1,013 Covid-19 cases, but the daily increase over the next couple of days rose. Dr Paul said it was back on a positive downward curve by April 4 when the doubling rate of infections started easing towards the current seven days.“The good news is that we are yet to see the full impact of the lockdown and the extended lockdown so we should be seeing the situation improve much, much more. Let’s hope it stays that way,’’ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virus-spread-will-decelerate-due-to-lockdown-niti-aayog-member/story-5d1glxqk3SaAz2OF5MFBIN.html
17-04-2020||India||Zoom ‘not a safe platform’: MHA in new guidelines||The ministry of home affairs issued an advisory on Thursday stating that videoconferencing application, Zoom, is “not a safe platform” for users and issued a set of guidelines for private individuals if they wish to continue using the app.The MHA advisory comes after the national cyber security agency, Computer Emergency Response Team of India (CERT-in), cautioned that the app, which has become a popular medium of communication amid the ongoing lockdown, was vulnerable to cyber attacks.The government has advised private individuals to prevent unauthorized entry in the conference room and guard against DoS (Denial-of-Service) attack by restricting user entry through passwords and access grant.“Most of the settings can be done by login into users zoom account at website, or installed application at PC/Laptop/Phone and also during conduct of conference. However certain settings are possible through certain mode/channel only. For example, lock meeting can be enabled by administrator only when the meeting has started,” the advisory states.In its earlier advisories on March 30 and April 6, CERT-in had stated that an unguarded usage of the application will make one vulnerable to information leak.“Insecure usage of the platform may allow cyber criminals to access sensitive information such as meeting details and conversation,” it had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zoom-not-a-safe-platform-mha-in-new-guidelines/story-7ixrg1yIYtCzh7xK5bKV7J.html
17-04-2020||India||One-third of India lives in red zones, Tamil Nadu leads the list||The 170 districts identified as coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hot spots across the country are home to about 37% of India’s population, with Tamil Nadu accounting for the most “red zones” – 22 of its 37 districts – among the states, according to the government’s data.On Wednesday, the Union health ministry declared 170 districts in 20 states and five Union Territories (UTs) as hot spots – areas where the numbers of Covid-19 infections are high. The Centre told the states that there was no hot spot district in 11 states and UTs..The Covid-19 hot spots account for about 23% of the 730-odd districts in India and are spread across 29% of the geographical area of the country, an analysis based on Census 2011 data showed.Going by official data, nearly 453 million of India’s 1.21 billion citizens live in the hot spots, where life has come to a standstill, with authorities imposing stringent curbs and allowing inward and outward movement for essential personnel alone.Ten of Delhi’s 11 districts and 14 of Maharashtra’s 36 districts feature in the list sent to the district authorities by Union health secretary Preeti Sudan. While 87% (or about 14.5 million people) of Delhi’s population reside in its hot spot districts, the corresponding number for Maharashtra stands at 60% (or about 66.9 million).Both districts in Mumbai (Mumbai and Mumbai Suburban) and the neighbouring Thane district have been classified as hot spots. Over 20 million people live in these three districts.The conditional relaxations India has announced with a sharp focus on the rural sector and daily wage labourers to kick-start sections of the economy during the lockdown will not be applicable to these hot spot districts.Among all states – other than Chandigarh, whose only district is a hot spot – Andhra Pradesh has the highest share of population living in such districts – nearly 90% (or about 44.3 million). The 11 hot spot districts in Andhra Pradesh (out of total 13) comprise 92% of the state’s geographical area.Apart from Tamil Nadu, other states that feature in the list of top five states in terms of the number of hot spot districts are Maharashtra (14 of its total 36), Uttar Pradesh (13 of 75), Rajasthan (12 of 33) and Andhra Pradesh (11 of 13).Overall, there are 10 states and UTs where a majority of the population lives in hot spot districts. These are Chandigarh (100%), Andhra Pradesh (90%), Delhi (87%), Tamil Nadu (80%), Telangana (66%), Andaman and Nicobar (63%), Maharashtra (60%), Himachal Pradesh (53%), Jammu and Kashmir (53%) and Ladakh (51%).In Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam and Madhya Pradesh, less than 20% of the population live in hot spot districts.On the other hand, there is no hot spot district in eight states (Goa and all states of northeast India, other than Assam) and three Union Territories (Puducherry, Lakshadweep, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu).The health ministry letter says containment measures in the hot spot districts will be considered over and these areas will become green zones (free from Covid-19) if they do not report any case for 28 days since the last negative result. A review of the hot spot list will be held every Monday. That means the next assessment will take place on April 20, the day the relaxations come to place.The government defines hot spot districts as “high caseload districts” where the number of cases doubles in four days or less. The Centre has further segregated the 170 hot spots into two parts – those with large outbreaks (123) and those with clusters (47). In addition to the 170 red zones, India has 207 non-hot spot districts with clusters of casesAccording to the government’s plan, a hot spot will be split into zones: a quarantine or containment zone (broadly, the epicentre of an infection and an area around it) and a buffer zone (an area around the containment zone). Guidelines for red zones are stricter than those governing areas outside them during the lockdown.Subhash Salunkhe, a public health expert in Maharashtra, says the measures taken by the government for hot spots areas are an important intervention to contain the coronavirus spread.“The whole idea is to contain the spread and that’s how measures are planned…If not today, people will be able to see the results in the coming days wherever they (the government’s guidelines) are followed effectively,” Salunke, the head of a state government panel for the prevention of communicable diseases, says.(with inputs from HTC in Mumbai)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-third-of-india-lives-in-red-zones-tn-leads-the-list/story-9Fu7VrMHlzd9s50wXsr8SP.html
17-04-2020||India||DRDO to test PPE at Delhi facility now||The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has shifted a key testing facility for carrying out quality checks on personal protective equipment (PPE) from Gwalior to New Delhi to cut down delays and ensure faster delivery of the safety gear to healthcare workers battling Covid-19, the defence ministry said in a statement on Thursday.At a time when the country is facing a shortage of PPE kits, the testing facility has been shifted from Gwalior-based Defence Research Development Establishment (DRDE) to the Delhi-based Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS). “The facility at INMAS is fully operational for testing and evaluation of body suits and masks. More than 50 batches of these items have already been tested at the laboratory,” the ministry said.The DRDE specialises in developing detection and protection technologies against biological and chemical agents. The statement said the Gwalior laboratory will now test only masks received by HLL Healthcare Limited from foreign countries before they are distributed to various agencies.PPE kits are sent to DRDO for testing by HLL Lifecare, which is the government’s nodal agency for medical procurement. The kits are distributed to various agencies only after they pass stringent quality tests. A PPE kit contains a full-body suit, masks, goggles, gloves, and shoe covers.Conducting tests on PPE kits is a challenging task and there can be no room for error as it’s about the safety of healthcare workers, said a senior official familiar with the DRDO’s testing procedures.“Our procedure is quite elaborate and includes synthetic blood penetration test and pressure testing at various levels to ensure that the suits can provide protection to the wearers. In testing, we look for the weakest link which is usually the seams. The safety of healthcare workers is crucial in the fight against coronavirus,” he said. Pressure testing of PPE suits is done at six different levels.Another official said that the DRDO does not certify samples received from HLL Lifecare for testing as “passed” or “failed”. “We only list out the technical parameters of the PPE kits and send it back to HLL Lifecare Limited. After that, it is for them to decide,” he said. The DRDO is among the several government agencies that have been at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus disease. It has developed several products to combat the pandemic including ventilators, PPE kits, large area sanitization solutions and Covid-19 sample collection kiosks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-to-test-ppe-at-delhi-facility-now/story-dViPqLx4yNGgak8scyDBcK.html
17-04-2020||India||Firms rush to meet new PPE norms||The Bureau of Indian Standards’ newly-released list of national specifications for coveralls or body-suits worn by Covid-19 healthcare workers has left some government approved manufacturers scrambling for material that would pass the new tests, even as government-approved laboratories rejected thousands of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits that were donated by China.Recently, thousands of PPE items among the 170,000 donated by China — world’s main supplier — failed the safety tests at the government-approved laboratories, two high-ranking officials confirmed to the Hindustan Times.“Yes, some of the samples of PPE kits from the imported lot did fail the safety tests,” an official from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in Gwalior said. The kits, which arrived in India on April 5, were sent there for stipulated quality check.“About a week ago, China realized after complaints that some of their PPE kits were faulty. So they listed 4-5 firms that were making quality kits. We are now ordering only from them. The number of dodgy kits were not too significant,” an official of the empowered group on imports confirmed.PPE kits include coveralls or full body suits, gloves, masks, head-cover respirators, goggles or face shields, and foot covers, among other elements. According to SITRA, India domestically produces 50,000 PPE kits (coveralls) daily, at present. However, till the beginning of this week, India faced a shortage of 15 million units, according to union textile ministry officials. It is unclear how the BIS guidelines will impact the shortage.In an effort to standardise the quality of PPE kits, the BIS on April 14 released a specification document that said that the material used for coveralls must be fluid-resistant as well as virus-resistant. So far, the manufacturers have been making coveralls that are only fluid-resistant as per the guidelines laid down by the union health ministry in an 11-page document on March 24. However, on Thursday, the list was taken down from the website of the BIS leading to speculation on whether the guidelines would undergo further revision.“We were initially about to start our production with fluid-resistant materials, but we stopped even before we began because there were talks of viral-barrier suits. Now the challenge is availability of the raw material and the taping machines,” said Dr GSK Velu, chairman and managing director, Trivitron Group, one of the 81 manufacturers approved by SITRA.“India does not have materials to make viral barrier suits. Instead, most companies are now laminating the coverall material and looking at sealing the seams to make the suits fluid and viral resistant. However, this is like wearing a raincoat in a non-AC ward, you can imagine the discomfort,” said Dr Ghanshyam Das Agarwal, chief managing director of G Surgiwear, a company that is looking to make products that are of certification level.“The higher standard specifications released by the BIS are in a developing stage. Our feedback has already been sent through the official channels, so I cannot comment. But, it is likely that the specifications will be changed,” said Vijaya Shankara from Shree Hari Healthcare, an approved manufacturer.According to Velu, while his company has been able to source material for viral-barrier body suits, and the manufacturing has begun, it will take at least a week for the kits to reach the market as the product will need to undergo certification.Rajiv Nath, founder and forum coordinator of the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD) said that rather than import PPE kits, the government should import raw material, and other such critical material that’s missing in manufacturers’ supply chains.“It is better to import critical missing raw material fabric for PPE that’s breathable and yet is fluid and viral resistant, rather than importing plane loads of PPE Kits,” Nath said. “Breathability should be a bigger concern. Government should instead allow suits made of GSM 50 non-woven material, which will not pass the current test but are breathable and can provide 95 to 98% protection,” Agarwal added.“It is good that there is a national standard now, we have been procuring the PPE kits locally and there are several that do not match the health ministry standards. If all the kits already come certified from the government then we will not have to worry about the quality,” a doctor treating Covid-19 patients in New Delhi’s Lok Nayak hospital, who did not wish to divulge his identity, said.The issue of sub-standard PPE kits has been raised in multiple states. On Thursday, for instance, the director general of medical education (DGME) in Uttar Pradesh wrote a letter to medical colleges warning them against using substandard kits, after several complaints emerged from different Covid-19 hospitals. The kits were supplied by the Uttar Pradesh Medical Supply Corporation Limited. “If you receive any sub-standard PPE kit or other medical items, do not use them. Return them straight away. Purchase good quality items from other sources and inform the DGME office about it,” Dr KK Gupta’s letter stated.There are at least seven government designated private and public laboratories to check different items of PPE kits, including the DRDO and Coimbatore-based South India Textile Research Association (SITRA).SITRA conducts checks for synthetic blood penetration (if blood will seep through the fabric), moisture vapour transmission (whether the fabric will allow moisture to pass between layers), weight test (grams per sq metre or GSM of the fabric), seam test and fabric strength.A SITRA official told Hindustan Times that their laboratory also has the capacity to conduct dry and wet virus resistant tests on the fabric, but it was not carrying them out because there were no such directives from the government till now.Other government approved testing laboratories include Trustin Analytical Solutions in Chennai that tests gloves, Chennai-based SGS India Private Limited that tests gloves, plastic-based products, protective clothing and respirators, the Rubber Research Institute of India, which tests rubber-based materials, and the Heavy Vehicles factory, and the Small Arms factory.(With inputs from Amrita Madhukalya and Gaurav Saigal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/firms-rush-to-meet-new-ppe-norms/story-reb7yr2XuepWeUXF4DJBNI.html
17-04-2020||India||Centre has no plans to bring back Indians abroad now||The Indian government currently has no plans to repatriate thousands of citizens stranded around the world because of Covid-19-related restrictions, and people familiar with developments reiterated the administration’s advice that they should “stay put” where they are.The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a total of 3,336 Indians had tested positive for Covid-19 in 53 countries, while 25 Indians had died of the disease. No further details were immediately available.There are no official figures for Indian citizens stranded in different countries but several estimates have put the number in the thousands. There have been reports of scores of Indians stranded in airports in countries such as Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Even before the government imposed a lockdown in March, the external affairs ministry had advised Indians around the world, including thousands of students, to stay put till travel restrictions are withdrawn. The nationwide lockdown has been extended till May 3.“Our advice has always been that you stay put, times are difficult. It’s a matter of having patience. They should contact the Indian missions wherever they are, and seek their help, support and guidance,” one of the people cited above said.“To the extent possible, our missions have reached out to a large number of people and are trying to solve their problems. These are difficult times, we need the understanding of our people that this too will pass,” the person added.In several countries, the people said, the Indian missions have taken the support of non-resident Indians (NRIs) and OCI card-holders to provide support to the stranded Indians. This support has included providing meals and rations to the Indians.The people also ruled out the possibility of bringing back the Indians who had tested positive for Covid-19, saying their movement increased the risk of spreading the coronavirus.“We have to very careful dealing with such cases as the nature of the virus is such that it spreads very fast. For that reason, we’ve been advising those who tested positive should stay put, get all the support they can get locally, including medical support,” said one of the people cited above.“If they start moving to another country or coming back to India, there are chances of spreading the virus. Fortunately, the recovery rate has been good in countries where the Indians tested positive,” the person added.More than 250 Indians, a majority of them pilgrims from Kashmir, had tested positive in the holy city of Qom in Iran last month. They are currently being treated in special facilities created in Qom.Indian envoys have reached out to the sick Indians and worked with local governments to ensure they get the best possible care, the people said.“We hope once they recover, they will hopefully be able to come back and join their loved ones,” a second person said.Indian authorities have also facilitated the evacuation of some 35,000 nationals of 48 countries who were stranded in India, the people said. This included the citizens of Australia, France, Germany, Israel, Russia, the US, and the UK.The repatriation of 186 Pakistanis is also being facilitated following a request from the Pakistani mission in New Delhi. Forty-one Pakistanis, who came to India as pilgrims or for medical care and were stranded in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, returned via the Wagah-Attari border crossing on Thursday.The external affairs ministry’s 24x7 Covid-19 control room has also fielded 18,000 emails and 5,000 phone calls and addressed 2,000 public grievances, the people cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-has-no-plans-to-bring-back-indians-abroad-now/story-lvT0fpRF8eQGeoqUIqTXAI.html
17-04-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh tally crosses 1000, 226 new cases||Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday blamed the state’s previous Congress government, which lost power last month, for leaving Madhya Pradesh ill-equipped to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and for as many as 94 health department officials and employees contracting the disease.“The previous government did not make any preparations for fighting Covid-19. It seems the health department staff was also not given any training. That is why the health department staff got infected. I have ordered an inquiry and action will be taken,” he said.The state reported 226 new Covid-19 cases since Wednesday, which took the tally of such patients in Madhya Pradesh to 1,164. The state has reported 55 fatalities while 65 people have recovered, according to the state health department.Four Indian Administrative officers are among the 94 health department employees tested positive for Covid-19.Chouhan said the testing capacity has been enhanced significantly. “We are looking for each and every positive case and treating them. There may be many more patients in Bhopal and Indore but the good news is that many people are recovering fast.”Indore accounted for 707 of the 1,164 cases and 39 deaths. Bhopal has reported 196 cases while Khandwa 33.Police in Indore were planning using geofencing, a location-based app, to keep a track of the people under quarantine. Officials said restricting people to the quarantine centres was a major challenge for the administration and the police.On Wednesday night, eight people, including five Covid-19 patients, fed from a quarantine centre. Three of them were traced later. Inspector general of police (Indore) Vivek Sharma said three major Covid-19 hotspots have emerged in Indore and police were keeping a close watch on these areas with the help of control rooms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-tally-crosses-1k-226-new-cases/story-jmnkbi6ooytKUZoSqiJnRN.html
17-04-2020||India||India begins controlled trials of plasma therapy||Trials using the antibody-rich blood of patients cured of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have begun, with doctors turning to a pool of 1,600 people in India who have recovered from the infection to test their antibodies as a potential cure for those fighting the disease.Convalescent plasma therapy uses a blood component called plasma -- which contains the virus-fighting antibodies – from people who have recovered from the infection to treat those who are severely ill with Covid-19.Apart from the Indian Council of Medical Research – India’s apex health research body – at least two hospitals have applied to test the effectiveness of the therapy in Delhi, the protocols for which have been established . The Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, an autonomous Delhi government hospital, has already received approval to conduct the trials. The private Max Hospital is awaiting approval to launch the trials.“As the same product will be tested across the centres, the approvals are being given to hospitals that conform with the ICMR protocols so that uniform and comparable data is generated from across centres,” said an official from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), the apex drug regulator.When the virus enters the human body, the immune system creates an antibody to fight it. This antibody remains in a person even after the virus has cleared out of their system. In the absence of other drugs, experts say that using these antibodies from recovered patients can offer a reprieve to severely ill Covid-19 patients.“Now, there are over 1,000 people who have recovered from Covid-19 in the country and their blood plasma can be used to treat those who are critical. The antibodies from the recovered person will theoretically help the critical patients in fighting the infection. This is done for other viral illnesses as well,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary SciencesThe therapy would be given only to patients in a critical condition -- those with a respiratory rate higher than 30 breaths per minute (the normal is 18-20 breaths per minute), have oxygen saturation of less than 90% (normal is 95 to 100%), or have infiltrates like pus in the lungs. As for donors, only health individuals – with no comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease and less than 60 years of age – who have recovered from the infection would be selected.“There are anecdotal evidences to say that Covid-19 patients on plasma therapy have recovered in other countries. However, we need to ensure that the therapy is given to people who are at high risk before they are on a ventilator. This is because the antibodies can prevent the progression of the disease by reducing the viral load, it cannot heal the lungs and the other organs. So, if a person already has lung damage and is in multi-organ failure then the therapy will not be useful,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.For the treatment, a plasmapheresis machine is used to derive plasma from the blood, which is then administered to the patients with severe infection. This method is, however, not new and is used for the treatment of several other diseases.And experts feel that not giving the treatment to half the patients under randomised control trial is unethical. “Plasma therapy is already being used for three categories of ailments – one is viral infection such as hepatitis or even chicken pox that can be severe in immuno-compromised patients; two, it is done for autoimmune disorders, and three, conditions like haemophilia in which the people receive proteins other than antibodies – like factor 8 in this case – through plasma therapy,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.“When it is an already established procedure, why should it not be administered to all the patients who are very sick?. Not giving it to half the patients in need is actually an ethical problem, I feel,” he said.In a randomised control trial, which is suggested by the ICMR, half the patients receive the plasma and the other half receive a placebo. This helps the doctors in determining whether people on therapy do better than those not on it.A recently published report on a trial in China showed an improvement in the clinical conditions of 10 people who received the therapy. “All symptoms in the 10 patients, especially fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain, disappeared or largely improved within 1 day to 3 day upon Convalescent Plasma transfusion,” the study published in PNAS Journal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-begins-controlled-trials-of-plasma-therapy/story-DGzgsCMku7BRqWmy9stlLP.html

His family members were put under quarantine in Amroha district hospital. They were allowed to go home on Wednesday after the error was confirmed.Dr Umar Farooq, the in-charge of Nauganva’s Public Health Centre, said the man was referred to Moradabad district hospital, where he was admitted on April 6, since he had fever apart from sore throat and cold. He added the man’s blood sample was sent for testing to the Aligarh Medical College, where all samples related to Covid-19 are being tested.“When the test report came, we were told by medical officials in Moradabad that the man was Civid-19 positive,” Farooq said. He added it was then that rushed the ambulances. “We screened all eight family members but found them negative on Tuesday.”Farooq said when they sought confirmation from Moradabad’s chief medical officer, Dr M C Garg, on Wednesday, they were told the man’s name had been wrongly been added to the list of Covid-19 patients.“The earlier report had, by mistake, mentioned that the patient was Covid-19 positive,” said Garg. He added it was because of a misprint by the lab in Aligarh. Amroha CMO Megh Singh said the man was confirmed Covid-19 negative and he along with all his family members were discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/typing-error-makes-man-covid-in-up-s-amroha/story-zkMFl08sdksUS9tiQAVufP.html
17-04-2020||India||Bengal HC hears plea for testing data||A division bench of Calcutta high court chief justice T B N Radhakrishnan and justice Arijit Banerjee on Thursday heard a petition that seeks data from the West Bengal government on the number of people tested for Covid-19 and the number of fatalities. The bench, before which the state government submitted a report, will hear both sides on Friday.The petition was filed on April 6 by Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Fuad Halim, who is a practising doctor.“The main contention of the petition is that the West Bengal government is not following the guidelines of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) of the government of India on testing, data sharing and safety precautions,” Halim’s lawyer and former Kolkata mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said. The hearing was held through video conferencing in keeping with safety norms during the lockdown. Bharatiya Janata Party state secretary Ritesh Tiwari and a doctor ,who wrote separate letters to the chief justice, demanding the court’s intervention and seeking the same data, were also made parties to the hearing.“In my petition, I raised several issues, including the unclear status of the Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata which the state government earlier said would be turned into the country’s biggest hospital for Covid-19 cases with more than 3,000 beds. The government is not saying what happened after that announcement,” Halim told HT.Some wards at Medical College and Hospital are shut down at present. Two days ago, a woman who recently gave birth and was admitted in the maternity ward, tested positive for Covid-19. The other patients in the maternity ward were shifted and sent to quarantine along with some doctors and medical staff. “The court has asked the government to declare the status on tests being down on people, the number of people who tested positive and those who died. The court also wants to know whether medical staff are being provided with personal protection equipment {PPE} etc,” said Halim.The Bengal government has come under criticism in recent weeks as, unlike other states in India, it is against outright linking deaths of people with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, heart ailments and kidney disease to Covid-19 even if they have been infected by the virus. According to experts, such conditions make the disease deadlier. Such deaths are being treated as results of co-morbidity in which a person suffers from one or more conditions in addition to the infection.Last week, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said, “We have formed a committee of five doctors who will decide the actual cause of death. They are the experts, I am not. We do not want to create panic among people. Please trust the doctors.”Referring to the other conditions listed by the government, Banerjee said, “People suffering from some chronic diseases are infected easily (by Covid-19).”HT earlier reported that the government issued an order on April 5, in which doctors signing death certificates have been asked to fill a form which is being reviewed by the panel of five doctors before a death is attributed to Covid-19. There are 24 test reports, including those for scrub typhus, CT scan of the thorax, and dengue, malaria, urea, creatinine, blood, urine, CPK (enzymes in blood to diagnose a heart attack) and procalcitonin (substance in blood produced by bacterial infection) that doctors signing death certificates have been asked to attach.Meanwhile, the state government said three more deaths caused by Covid-19 had been confirmed taking the toll to 10, while 24 new cases were detected . Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said Kolkata and Howrah figured in the ‘red zone’ earmarked by the Union health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-hc-hears-plea-for-testing-data/story-LsgGA6866wDHjCipfq5sWK.html
17-04-2020||India||State hospitals await approval to conduct plasma treatment||Hospitals across the country are preparing for and awaiting necessary permissions for conducting convalescent plasma therapy to treat Covid-19 patients that will involve drawing of antibody-rich blood of the disease survivors to treat the sick. The therapy has shown promise in treating Covid-19 patients, American journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported last week.“A person in Delhi has been removed from ventilator support after the plasma therapy,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, referring to the improvement in the condition of a man after the therapy at a Delhi hospital. “It is good news from first such experiment.” Kejriwal said the success of the experiment will be known after he is fully cured.In Mumbai, BYL Nair Hospital dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal said they have collected blood from a patient, who has recovered from coronavirus even as protocol for the therapy is to be finalised with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s help.Kerala was among the first states to announce the treatment through the therapy and is waiting the permissions. Sree Chithira Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) has been named as the nodal agency for harvesting plasma from cured patients in the state. “We have done our work and are waiting for hospitals to carry out clinical tests. Usually, the therapy is done in cases of severely affected patients. In Kerala, we have no such patients. This may be one of the reasons for the delay besides the customary permissions,” said SCTIMST director Dr Asha Kishore. Officials in West Bengal, which announced the use of the therapy last week, said the state government was seeking approvals for setting up a plasma bank to store blood of cured Covid-19 patients. “We are exploring options on how to introduce this concept at the earliest. In China, they have got some results and in the USA, too, tests are going on...,” said Abhijit Chowdhury, a public health specialist and convenor of an eight-member advisory board formed by CM Mamata Banerjee.In Telangana, the state government-run Gandhi Hospital (Hyderabad) said it was making infrastructural arrangements for experimenting with the therapy. Dr Sravan Kumar, the hospital superintendent, said the state has given consent to the doctors for taking up the therapy. “First, we need to take up clinical trials and see how they work. Only after they prove successful, we can take up the exercise. It will take another two weeks for the doctors at the hospital to do the clinical trials,” Kumar said. Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University (KGMU) has sent a proposal to the ICMR volunteering to be made the nodal centre for the therapy. “We have a majority of patients admitted to and have treated them too. Since the protocols of plasma therapy are already being followed in other procedures, we can be the nodal centre for plasma therapy,” said Prof Tuliak Chandra, the head of transfusion medicine department at the KGMU. She said one of the patients treated for coronavirus at the KGMU three weeks back could be the first volunteer for plasma collection.Officials of Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh governments and Chandigarh said they have begun the work for seeking nod for conducting the therapy. “...A trial is being considered in Kerala first and trials will be done across the country. As and when trials are permitted, we will definitely implement the same as we have a large number of patients who have been treated successfully,” said a Karnataka official who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-hospitals-await-approval-to-conduct-plasma-treatment/story-drboPJnfxyFc2qfJkMMZuI.html
17-04-2020||India||Experts warn of ‘profound’ mental health toll||Covid-19 will have a profound impact on the mental health of vulnerable groups such as front-line healthcare workers, persons with existing mental illnesses and patients of the lethal viral disease, according to a paper authored by 24 experts and published by the journal, Lancet Psychiatry.About half of zoonotic virus epidemics (diseases that are transferred from animals to humans) are caused by neurotropic viruses, which are capable of infecting nerve cells and tend to invade the central nervous system, according to the paper published on April 15. Both the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that broke out in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) of 2012 are neurotropic and neurotoxic, causing mental and neurological disorders, it said.Not much evidence exists on what kind of neurological impact SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, will have, but researchers found that it has a receptor binding domain structure similar to SARS-CoV and probably also shares the latter’s neurotropism and neurotoxicity.The paper, authored by a panel of scientists convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity MQ Mental Health, quoted a study of 214 patients in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the original epicentre of Covid-19, of whom 36% had nervous system problems. A sub-group within them with severe respiratory disease experienced an increased frequency of nervous problems, including dizziness, headache, loss of smell or anosmia, loss of taste or ageusia, muscle pain and weakness and cerebrovascular complications.The panel also flagged stress among healthcare workers and the need for screening them. They come in close contact with the virus, death and dying at close quarters while making challenging decisions. Surveys conducted by researchers in the UK also found that the fear of contracting Covid-19 ranked lower than social isolation and loneliness associated with anxiety, depression and suicide. In India, the Bengaluru-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS) launched a mental health helpline for Covid 19 suspects/patients on March 29. Data from the calls it received is still being compiled, but Dr BN Gangadhar, director of NIMHANS, said there had been many distress calls by people who wanted to know how they could avoid contracting the disease.Many have also called in with very practical problems that NIMANS is not the right authority to address, Dr. Gangadhar said.“The calls ranged from ‘my son has a mental health issue, how can I continue his treatment?’ [to] ‘I have no work, how do I spend time?’ [to] ‘We have lots of farm produce what do I do with it?’ [to] ‘Is there a train I can catch to go back home?’ Etc. We did address the behavioural issues-related queries but people had practical queries too,” he said over the phone.On the neurotoxic effects of Covid 19, Dr. Gangadhar said: “It can have an influence on the central nervous system but it is too early to predict of what nature, We have to study more patients.”Gangadhar recommended that those with existing mental health issues connect with NIMHANS or doctors trained by the institute over a helpline or social media, Front-line health workers should also call on the same helpline (080-46110007); they can also access a yoga programme run by NIMHANS through a weblink at 9 am and 11 am.NIMHANS is getting in touch with its 2,500 patients due for follow-up consultations by calling them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-warn-of-profound-mental-health-toll/story-7iDs6q9WtD3nUOQwG8Di0J.html
17-04-2020||India||Hydroxychloroquine to be supplied to 55 nations||The Indian government has so far approved the supply of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, either as commercial sales or as grants, to 55 countries as part of the efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, people familiar with the development said on Thursday.India, the largest producer of hydroxychloroquine, initially banned exports of the drug on March 25 and further tightened rules on April 4 to bar exports from special economic zones (SEZs), where such bans don’t apply. The rules were partially eased to allow the export of hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol after meeting domestic requirements.“Supplies to 55 countries have been approved so far, including commercial sales to 21 countries, while the rest will get small quantities as grants,” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.“India has come to be recognised as a reliable global supplier of medicines during this humanitarian crisis, and we have reached out to many countries,” the person said.Several countries in India’s immediate and extended neighbourhood, such as the Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles, have been provided the drug as part of grants. Several of these countries are dependent on India’s pharmaceutical industry to meet their needs.The exports were allowed only after a stock-taking by an empowered committee comprising representatives of the department of pharmaceuticals, the health and external affairs ministries, Indian Council of Medical Research, and the drug controller.“We have to meet domestic requirements, create a buffer over and above that and the surplus can be exported,” a second person said.There were 13 countries, including the US, Brazil and Israel, in the first list of nations for which exports were approved and most of the supplies had been despatched. Supplies are currently being sent to countries that were on a second list, the people said.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) was on a third list of countries that was approved on Wednesday and the West Asian state is currently completing the paperwork for the exports, the people added.More requests for hydroxychloroquine are expected and will be put up to the empowered committee. “It is now more or less a well-oiled system that is able to take decisions fairly quickly after assessing domestic requirements,” the second person said.Among the 55 countries for which exports have been approved are neighbouring states such as Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, African countries such as Zimbabwe, Kenya, Zambia, Niger, Mali and the Republic of Congo, and European nations such as France, the Netherlands and the UK.Other countries for which exports have been cleared are Armenia, Kazakhstan, Ecuador, Jamaica, Syria, Ukraine, Oman, Colombia and the Bahamas.Meanwhile, India supplied half-a-million hydroxychloroquine tablets and 12 tonnes of life-saving medicines to Mauritius late on Wednesday.This was the first consignment of Covid-19-related medical supplies provided to Mauritius, whose vice prime minister, Leela Devi Dookun-Luchoomun, received the consignment ferried by a special Air India cargo flight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hydroxychloroquine-to-be-supplied-to-55-nations/story-yTrsGIQze9iPns7GDbMnOP.html

The lockdown was extended until May 3 on April 14. Gauba, the country’s top civil servant, asked all state chief secretaries on Thursday to ensure adequate arrangements are made for the migrants, mainly daily-wage labourers left without work after the lockdown came into force last month. He asked states to appoint district collectors as nodal officers responsible for coordinating arrangements for the migrant workers. “Each camp (for migrants) should be put [under the] charge of a senior officer,” Gauba said in a directive to state governments.The Supreme Court last week ordered that adequate medical facilities and proper arrangements for food, clean drinking water and sanitation be ensured for migrant workers at relief camps across the country. Following this directive, the home ministry asked all states to implement welfare measures for migrant workers.In Bhopal, an official of the government’s public relations department said the state government had deposited Rs 1,000 each in the bank accounts of these workers and distributed essential items to them.Last week, the government said it would give Rs 1,000 each to about 7,000 migrants from 22 states who are stranded in MP..Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has appointed seven Indian Administrative Service officers to ensure help to migrants from Madhya Pradesh who are stranded in other states, an official statement said. The CM asked MPs and MLAs to prepare a list of stranded workers from their areas and submit the lists to the government, the statement said.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday said migrant workers who stay back in relief camps until the lockdown period would be given financial assistance of Rs 2,000 each when they leave after completing their quarantine.The amount would be useful to the migrant workers to reach home after the quarantine. “This will encourage the migrant workers to stay put in the quarantine camps till the lockdown is lifted,” an official familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity .In several parts of the state, people who have been put in the quarantine camps have been leaving to try and reach their towns and villages, frustrated by the extension of lockdown. Government officials informed the CM that an amount of Rs 850 had been spent on each person put up at quarantine centres, including Rs 500on food, a bed and blanket, Rs 50 on sanitation and Rs 300 on transport. The measures were announced as Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday warned of social unrest unless the government acts quickly to provide relief to migrant workers. “It is important to have a strategy to deal with this crisis. The government needs to act on it quickly otherwise there will be social unrest in the country. You have to respond quickly and be compassionate while addressing the issue. I have told Congress chief ministers that they need to handle this situation with extreme care and gentleness,” Gandhi told a press conference in New Delhi.A senior government official, who didn’t wish to be named, said once some manufacturing plans restart and other business activities resume after April 20, some migrant labourers who were heading home may stay back and join work.The federal home ministry said it was monitoring on a daily basis violation of lockdown measures including congregations of people and opening of shops and commercial establishments. State police forces have been asked to take action against the violators under the Disaster Management Act, MHA officials said.Incidents of violence against health workers engaged in surveillance and enforcement of quarantine measures are also being ascertained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-food-safety-shelter-to-migrants-centre-to-states/story-r2T7LFMAVE4jvrWk0t6pvO.html
17-04-2020||India||Patients start infection spread before symptoms set in: Study||People with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) start infecting others two to three days before they develop symptoms of fever and cough, according to a study from China which suggests effective outbreak containment must include contact tracing of people who have been exposed to positive cases two to three days before their symptoms first appeared.Infectiousness declined significantly eight days after symptoms appear, but 44% people got infected by people with no visible signs of illness, according to a study from Hong Kong published in Nature Medicine on April 15.Earlier studies have found presymptomatic transmission at a higher 48% in Singapore and 62% in Tianjin, China, which led epidemiologists to focus on undetected cases with mild or no symptoms who are not screened or tested for Covid-19.The new study from China found contagiousness started 2.3 days before symptoms began and peaked 0.7 days before symptoms appeared. Virus production was the highest at the start of the symptoms and started slowly declining after one week.“Since India’s testing is primarily based on symptomatic positive cases, it is imperative now to widen the criteria for testing by systematic sampling in clusters and hotspots. Tracking the disease will be a huge challenge if half the population of confirmed cases has transmitted in the pre-symptomatic phase,” said Dr Ramana Dhara, professor of public health, Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad.The most common signs and symptoms of Covid-19 are cough, fever or chills, and shortness of breath, with around one in four people developing gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, the study found.Contact tracing must include pre-symptomatic contacts. “For a reproductive number of 2.5, contact tracing and isolation alone are less likely to be successful if more than 30% of transmission occurred before symptom onset, unless more than 90% of the contacts can be traced. This is more likely to be achievable if the definition of contacts covers two to three days prior to symptom onset of the index case, as has been done in Hong Kong and mainland China since late February,” said study lead author, Eric HY Lau, from the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.Covid-19 is highly infectious, with a basic reproductive number of 2.2 to 2.5. Patients produce thousands to millions of viruses in their noses and throats, about 1,000 times as much virus as produced in Sars patients, till eight days after infection. Even people who don’t develop symptoms can produce enough virus to infect others, according to a small study from Germany published last month in medRxiv, which prints yet to be peer-reviewed studies.A modelling study done using clinical data from 26,000 lab-confirmed cases in Wuhan, China, said there were 37,400 undetected infections in the province, with most of these unreported cases being people with mild or no symptoms but who were contagious. The study, done in China and the US, was published in medRxiv in early March.“An increasing number of infected people cannot be linked to known Covid-19 cases or travel to hotspots, which indicates asymptomatic transmission. Presymptomatic transmission reduces the effectiveness of control measures, such as isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, which is why we need hand hygiene, use of face masks by everyone, social isolation and lockdowns to stop the spread,” said a union ministry of health and family welfare official, requesting anonymity.But lockdowns are not enough. “In India, housing is also an important factor because of the challenge in maintaining physical distance. Mask use is mandatory in Telangana, for example, but I have seen many people not wearing it or maintaining distance in streets, markets etc,” said Dr Dhara.Countries with active case finding have a higher proportion of presymptomatic transmission because even asymptomatic people are tested and the positive cases and their contacts are quickly isolated and quarantined, which helps prevent spread.While Covid-19 infectiousness declines significantly after eight days of the symptom appearing, the virus can be detected for a median of 20 days in some patients, and up to 37 days among survivors. “The results support our findings that the infectiousness profile may more closely resemble that of influenza than of Sars,” said the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patients-start-infection-spread-before-symptoms-set-in-study/story-zocsrH61PeyVLT8vxPYEwN.html
17-04-2020||India||Calls for free ration grow as migrants fight hunger||letters@hindustantimes.comNew Delhi: The Union government has allowed charities and states to buy extra stocks of federally held foodgrains at a reserve but cheaper-than-market price as several migrant workers battle a food crisis.The federally run Food Corporation of India has reserved a price of ₹20 and ₹22 per kg of wheat and rice for stock sale outside the public distribution system (PDS), while the regular market prices ranges between ₹32-₹40 a kg and ₹40-45 a kg for common varieties of wheat and rice. Sales outside the PDS network were earlier available to only registered bulk purchasers and states through online bidding under a federal provision called the ‘open-market-sales scheme’. Now states as well as NGOs can buy grains and offer them for free or at no profit-no-loss basis to the poor, especially those outside the PDS system. For instance, charities can use the grains to run community kitchens during the lockdown. Activists are, however, campaigning for universal free ration for everyone who needs it, pointing to growing distress for several internal migrants, especially in cities, who are virtually outside the country’s public (grains) distribution network. Several migrant workers were stranded after a 21-day countrywide lockdown was imposed from March 25, and has been extended till May 3, to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Subsidised grains are only available to beneficiaries who have eligible ration cards. “Most migrants in cities either don’t have it or have it with their families back in their home states,” said Deepa Sinha, who teaches in Delhi’s Ambedkar University. Under the Pradhan Mantri Gharib Kalyan Yojana, a relief package announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on March 26, eligible beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act would get 5kg of free grains per person, beyond their usual monthly ration quota of a similar quantity. Two-thirds of the population is officially covered under the scheme. India’s state-held food stocks stood at nearly 75 million tonnes on April 1, while the requirement of emergency stocks, which vary seasonally, is an average 22 million tonnes. The FCI has shipped out a record 3.74 Million Metric Tonnes of food grains stocks from the surplus states during the current lockdown period at an average of 170000 Metric Tonnes a day, an official said. This is more than double the normal average movement of stocks. “Yet, millions don’t have a ration card. How would it feel if the weakest members of a family starve despite the household’s granary being full?” asked economist Jean Drèze, a long-time advocate of right to food, pointing to surplus food stocks. Drèze has urged for universalizing access to cheap grains. Surveys by Drèze shows Jharkhand had 700,000 pending ration card applications. A survey by the National Council of Applied Economic Research conducted during April 3-6 showed about 29.3% households were affected by shortages in supplies of food. Income cuts were most severe for daily wage workers, it added.Behind the crisis, there is a public-expenditure burden that few want to be saddled with. The federally run FCI’s new reserves will naturally increase food budgets, so states are focusing on withdrawing regular and the additional free quota of 5kg ration per beneficiary, a federal official overseeing supplies said, asking not to be named. Some states, however, announced in-kind and cash support. Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, two states with large migrant populations, have said they would provide instant ration cards and Rs 1,000 per labourer.Many large states have not factored in extra supplies for undocumented labourers. “Our government has told the Centre that since for April and May regular foodgrain quota is being distributed to beneficiaries, we will distribute additional free foodgrains of two months, totaling 10kg, in May,” Jharkhand public distribution director Sanjay Kumar said.A senior food department official from Karnataka, HR Vijay Kumar, said the state had distributed the total foodgrains due for April and May in April from its own quota. In May, the state would be distributing foodgrains due for May and June from the federal quota. “In some states, migrant workers are being forced to live in shelters that have no civic amenities. We have asked the finance ministry to pay at least Rs 5,000 to each labourer’s family immediately,” said K. Saji Narayanan, president of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a labour union.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday tweeted asking the government to provide for emergency ration cards. Helplines run by political parties have been also flooded with calls from labourers in distress. “Taking care of migrant workers is the responsibility of each state. We not only need to take the responsibility for providing them food and shelter, but also need to show them empathy,” said P. Muralidhar Rao, general secretary of the BJP.A labour ministry official said small enterprises had sent several proposals to ameliorate distress among workers, such as utilising surpluses from the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC). The ESIC’s revenue income stood at Rs 27, 312 crore on April 2019 while its expenses for the last financial year stood at Rs 11,085 crore. This surplus could be used for temporary benefits to the small and medium enterprise workers, one proposal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calls-for-free-ration-grow-as-migrants-fight-hunger/story-PGYIUFYtkQpSHqnpf8dC2I.html
17-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Nearly 60 million of India’s poor most vulnerable, says Oxford study||Using a multidimensional poverty index (MPI) developed with the UN Development Programme, researchers at the University of Oxford said on Thursday that nearly 60 million poor in India are at ‘high risk’ from the coronavirus pandemic.A briefing from the Oxford Poverty and Human development Initiative (OPHI) says that India tops the list of 10 countries most vulnerable to the virus; others include the most poor in China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Indonesia, Uganda and Afghanistan.The team used existing poverty data to analyse the vulnerability of populations on the basis of three indicators: lack of access to clean drinking water, under-nutrition and a lack of clean cooking fuel. The deprivations have long been associated with weakened immune systems and respiratory systems.Co-author Christian Oldiges said that for India, data relied on the National Family Health Survey 2015/16, and the population total is based on the UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ 2017 revision.Oldiges said: “Out of the 1.3 billion people in India, 974 million (or 72%) are at risk to COVID-19 as they suffer from one of the three following indicators: malnourishment, no access to clean water, no clean cooking fuel”. “62.5 million (or 5%) are at high risk, suffering from all three indicators at the same time. 371 million (or 28%) are at risk and are multidimensionally poor (according to the global MPI; i.e. they are deprived in more than one third of the 10 weighted MPI indicators)”. “58 million (or 4.3%) are at high risk and are MPI poor (highest number globally in absolute number of population)”, he added.Led by Sabina Alkire, the OPHI team said that globally, around 3.5 billion people live with at least one deprivation. Nearly 472 million people live with all three. Over 5% in South Asia are simultaneously deprived in nutrition, water and cooking fuel.Alkire added: “We are analysing poverty data productively to inform both the Covid-19 emergency and post-emergency response. As the year unfolds, we will continue to work with our creative and committed colleagues in poverty reduction around the world as we track the long-term profound effects of Covid-19 on global poverty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-nearly-60-million-of-india-s-poor-most-vulnerable-says-oxford-study/story-amcFwj1TbltwtDzTel1g7L.html

17-04-2020||India||Amid lockdown, army chief to visit Kashmir for security review||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane will visit Kashmir on Thursday for a security review, amid the national lockdown and an unusual spike in cease-fire violations by Pakistan army along the Line of Control, a senior officer said on Wednesday on condition of anonymity.This will be the army chief’s first visit to a forward area after the lockdown was imposed to halt the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), he said, adding that the chief will be accompanied by minimum staff. He will return to Delhi on Friday.As reported by Hindustan Times on April 8, there has been an unusual spike in cease-fire violations by the Pakistan army on the LoC this year to help infiltrators sneak into Jammu and Kashmir compared to border violations in the previous years.The neighbouring army has carried out more ceasefire violations during January-March this year compared to the corresponding periods of the previous two years.Pakistan violated the ceasefire 1,144 times between January and March), with the highest number of violations (411) being recorded last month when Covid-19 cases started peaking globally. The Pakistan army violated the cease-fire 685 times in 2019 and 627 times in 2018 for the period January to March.Last Friday, the Indian Army targeted Pakistani positions facing Kupwara’s Keran sector across the LoC with artillery guns and caused severe damage to Pakistani army posts, terror launch pads and an ammunition dump.The fire assault was the Indian Army’s response to an unprovoked ceasefire violation by the neighbouring army.Five commandos belonging to an elite army Special Forces (SF) unit were killed in action along the LoC in the same sector in Kashmir on April 5 during an intense close-quarters battle with an equal number of terrorist infiltrators who were all eliminated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-lockdown-army-chief-to-visit-kashmir-for-security-review/story-byxXsc1AF0rB9BOo3yGM4H.html
17-04-2020||Today's||India will overcome Covid-19, but will need a ‘New Deal’ | Opinion||After extending the lockdown until 3 May, the government has decided to gradually open up some areas after 20 April, with an exhaustive list of do’s and don’ts. This step has been welcomed by not only all the major political parties but also by the business community at large. As the rabi harvesting season is at its peak, the government needed to commence the foodgrain procurement operations without any further delay so that no hardship is caused to farmers who are hoping to harvest a bumper rabi crop.Opening of agriculture produce marketing mandis, permitting trading in food grain and their transportation to warehouses and godowns of the Food Corporation of India had become imperative to enable the farmers to sell their surplus produce at the support prices fixed by the government. This will, to some extent, absorb the rural labourers and also provide them means of livelihood. Similarly, the removal of restrictions on the industries located in rural areas, unhindered movement of trucks and allowing the roadside eating joints to operate will certainly help absorb a huge number of workers. Likewise, letting a select group of industries open up will help augment the supply chain. In the coming weeks, based on the spread of the coronavirus disease, the government is likely to ease the restrictions further to bring the economy back on rails.Another important area that must be uppermost in the minds of decision makers is the critical education sector. Due to this virus, most of the state governments ordered the closure of all the schools, colleges, universities in the second week of March. As things stand, there is absolutely no possibility of reopening them over the next few months. Fortunately, almost all the state governments had allowed the board examinations to be completed so there is nothing to worry about on that account. The state governments and respective state boards and the CBSE have already taken the decision to promote all the 9th and 11th grade students. That was a wise decision in the interest of students.It seems the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) could not complete the examination process and still has to conduct tests in a few subjects. This can be accomplished in a short span of time when the situation normalises. Naturally, universities across the country have to go through the examination process too - which as per present indications - cannot begin before the end of May. So, the most-likely scenario appears to be that the university exams can only be conducted in the month of July.We, as a nation, have the experience to handle these kinds of unforeseen situations in the past. The early seventies were the JP movement days when strikes in colleges and universities were the norm. During those years, our universities used to normally remain closed for two to three months in a year and students used to protest against the annual examinations scheduled for April-May. As a result, the university used to hold the exams in July. Consequently, the academic session used to get delayed by a couple of months.To the credit of the teaching community back then, we never suffered academically in any way.The time has come for our teaching community to rise to the occasion and handle the situation to the best of their ability, which they undoubtedly have in abundance. Any talk of holding the exam online, or suggesting such innovations to the detriment of the student community, should not be deliberated. Let us wait and watch as things unfold and plan to schedule the examinations in the month of July. The university admissions process should be accordingly planned in the best interest of students.Similarly, several entrance examinations such as the Joint Entrance Examination had to be postponed. Now, there is a possibility that the prestigious Civil Services Examination conducted by Union Public Service Commission will also have to be rescheduled. These examinations have, for one reason or the other, been postponed several times in the past and there is no need to worry on that account. We, as a country, have the experience to deal with these minor hiccups once in a while.During the 1930’s, the United States of America went through the “Great Depression”, their economy was shattered, millions lost their jobs, poverty levels skyrocketed and businesses and banks went bankrupt. Franklin D Roosevelt became the President in 1933. He came out with a nation-building programme called the “New Deal” and built thousands of hospitals, schools, parks, roads, bridges and the famous social security scheme. The USA, as a country, changed transformationally. India has been waiting for decades for its own “New Deal”. The coronavirus has created India’s “Great Depression”; the government has to respond with its “Deal”.(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer.

17-04-2020||Editorials||The central bank steps in||‘Eventually, we shall cure, and we shall endure,’ Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das said, announcing the second set of monetary and credit measures to help India cope with the coronavirus pandemic, and the ongoing lockdown to combat it that has curtailed economic activity. The first set of measures were announced on March 27. RBI’s Friday announcements will benefit states, banks and finance companies, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and the agricultural sector. The markets reacted positively, with bank stocks leading the march. That’s because banks now have 180 days (up from 90) to declare an account a non-performing asset for borrowers that avail the three-month repayment moratorium announced on March 27. They have also been given 90 more days (from the current 210) for the resolution of so-called stressed assets. Both will ensure that lenders aren’t weighed down by bad loans. RBI’s move to announce targeted operations that will direct credit to finance companies, agriculture and MSMEs is an acknowledgement of the fact that similar operations announced on March 27 have largely benefited State-owned companies and large corporations. And its decision to cut the reverse repo rate (the interest it pays on money banks keep with it) is a signal to banks to go out and lend more. That this wasn’t happening is evident according to data shared by Mr Das. On April 15, the amount under the reverse repo window of RBI was Rs 6.91 lakh crore. Finally, the central bank’s enhancement of the ways and means advances (WMA) provision to states by 60% over the limit on March 31 means that states will be able to borrow more short-term funds to tide over their expenses, especially those related to combating the coronavirus disease, at a time when their revenue has seen a precipitous drop. This facility is open to them till September 30. Mr Das pointed out that RBI has, between February 6 and March 27 (including the measures announced that day), infused liquidity equal to 3.2% of GDP. Today’s announcements will take that number further up. He suggested that there could be more measures. RBI is clearly doing its bit. The onus is now on the government to unveil a larger relief and stimulus package that can help both individuals and businesses, cope with the crisis. Industry has demanded a package of between Rs 14 lakh crore and Rs 16 lakh crore. It is time to deliver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-central-bank-steps-in/story-GjkXqSJMJi4r6mLEyJdnOL.html
