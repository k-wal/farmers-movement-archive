Solidarity and cooperation are the most powerful weapons against the disease. The ferocity of this highly infectious, fast-spreading pandemic has rarely been seen in the past. Facing this unprecedented challenge, no country has the perfect solution. Countries are striving to explore the most effective measures based on their national situations. What is needed most in this process is mutual respect, understanding and cooperation.China was the first to report the outbreak and stand up to this challenge. We established a centralised and efficient command system, undertook comprehensive and thorough control and lockdown measures, and tried our best to prevent the epidemic from spreading. Medical and community workers, volunteers and others made great sacrifices in the fight against the epidemic. China has been releasing information and sharing the viral genome sequences. Since the outbreak, we have updated information daily and held nearly 200 press conferences to disseminate information about the government’s efforts.Meanwhile, China offered proposals for global cooperation to overcome the challenge. At the extraordinary G20 leaders’ summit on Covid-19, President Xi Jinping set out four proposals for a global war against the virus, forging a collective response for control and treatment, supporting international organisations in playing active roles, and strengthening macroeconomic policy coordination.China has provided support to the international community, working closely with the United Nations, the World Health Organization and other organisations. We have had 83 medical experts on video conferences with 153 countries, and sent 14 medical teams to 12 countries that were facing a difficult situation. We have also provided over 140 countries and international organisations with medical supplies, and signed commercial procurement contracts with more than 60 countries and organisations. What we have done is based on the belief of building a community with a shared future for humankind in keeping with China’s tradition of reciprocation.China and India have maintained communication and cooperation on epidemic prevention and control. Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a letter of condolence to President Xi. The leaders attended the G20 summit on Covid-19. State councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had conversations with external affairs minister S Jaishankar twice, exchanging views on anti-epidemic cooperation.This reminds me of the touching stories of Dr DS Kotnis, who went to China to support the war of resistance against Japanese aggression and died there. This year marks the 110th birth anniversary of Dr Kotnis. We must carry forward his spirit of internationalism and cooperate in fighting the epidemic. At a critical moment in China’s battle against the pandemic, the Indian government provided medical supplies to China. Indians have shown their support in various ways.Since the outbreak in India, China shared its experiences in epidemic prevention, control and treatment with India through video conferences. As sister provinces and cities, Guangdong Province and Chongqing city have, respectively, donated medical materials to Gujarat and Chennai. Alibaba, Fosun and other Chinese enterprises and charities have assisted India with medical supplies such as protective masks, suits, medical gloves and ventilators. China has provided India with assistance for its commercial procurement in China. The civil aviation administration of China has opened a “green channel” and approved 35 new Indian cargo flights to deliver medical supplies.Viruses respect no borders, and epidemics do not distinguish between races. Only by working together can we win this battle. Finger-pointing or scapegoating is not the way. Such moves will divide the international community, lead to prejudice against specific ethnic groups and hurt the shared interests of the world. We must reject all ideological biases and attempts at labelling the virus, politicising the response, and stigmatising any specific country.India is fighting the pandemic under the leadership of PM Modi. The Indian government has taken a series of decisive and strict prevention and control measures which have delivered positive outcomes. India’s victory in this is of great significance to the global fight against Covid-19.As a friend, neighbour and partner, we sincerely wish India success. China and India are ancient civilisations with populations accounting for nearly 40% of the world. China is willing to work together with India to win this battle, safeguard global and regional public health security, and contribute to greater care for our common homeland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/viruses-don-t-respect-borders-come-together/story-dVVMKCOhnXnZtP38JfbB9I.html
30-04-2020||News||A knockout punch to the economy, writes Kapil Sibal||Any number of Sonny Liston punches will not knock out the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It is here to stay. Nineteen deaths in one day and 67 in a week in Ahmedabad do not augur well. Health care workers around the country, in the absence of personal protective equipment, have been infected. Doctors, without protective gear, having risked their lives to protect people, have succumbed. Over time, the curve will flatten. Infection will increase with herd immunity setting in. By then, familiar with the precautionary measures, India will be ready to deal with those infected. The ultimate remedy is a vaccine which is at least a year-and-a-half away.But the knockout punch to the Indian economy has serious long-term consequences. The 40-day economic freeze will take several quarters to revive. A global recession may well be round the corner. The estimated loss caused to the global economy is about $11 trillion. The United States (US) economy will have a negative rate of growth. India’s, too, will witness a negative growth rate this year. The fact that this virus originated in Wuhan, China, has geopolitical implications. In these changing global equations, the developed world will want China to lose its primacy as a global supplier of goods. Factories may have to relocate from the country. India may not be the most attractive destination for such relocations. Our tortuous regulations, illiberal mindset and a divisive environment, coupled with the lack of quality infrastructure and human resources, are serious impediments to attracting investments for manufacturing.Our service sector may find it difficult to exploit global opportunities given the mood in the US to reduce its global dependence on goods and services. The nature of the labour market will change. The impact on modes of production will need rebooting. The self-reliance that Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi talks of is easier said than done. Any shift away from globalisation, which is likely, will impact us.The government’s policy response to the pandemic has been wanting. North Block must realise that any advisory issued cannot be uniformly applied across the country. The lockdown has dealt a lethal blow to our economic revival. Had this been thoughtfully planned — and there was time enough to do that between January 28 and March 24 — India would not be facing an economic crisis of this magnitude. Migrant workers, stuck at shelter homes with inadequate food, water, sanitation and other essentials, are not willing to go back to work. They have unduly suffered during this period.The directions issued to industry to start operations do not take into account realities on the ground. A seamless manufacturing unit cannot operate at 25% capacity. The cost of running the unit will not be economical. In the absence of demand, and an already full unsold inventory, there is no logic in running a unit. This applies to the automobile, steel, and some other sectors. The textile industry, which survives on exports, has been badly singed. The Chinese are willing to fill the vacuum. Buyers in Europe and the US, if not serviced, will move to other suppliers. The real estate sector needs special attention and a separate package. Its revival creates demand for steel, cement and sanitaryware. Besides, this sector generates employment. Micro, small and medium enterprises, the hardest hit, need immediate financial support to stave off massive closures and bankruptcy. This pandemic is unique for it disrupts our economy both on the supply and demand side. The demand side sectors bearing the brunt include trade, transport, travel and tourism, hotels, sports and entertainment. Financial services are also badly hit. On the supply side, India is witnessing supply chain breakdowns in respect of both imports and exports, with China, South Korea, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the US. The pandemic has dealt a devastating blow to the economies of these countries affecting India’s global trade as well.Domestically, with subdued revenue collections, India will have to rely on expanded borrowings and non-tax revenue sources. Postpone adhering to fiscal deficit targets and work out a substantial stimulus package to kickstart demand. States, apart from scaling up health care facilities and ensuring food security, must also provide income support to those who have been deprived of their means of livelihood. Along with falling Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shares, the excise earnings of states from the sale of alcohol and fuel have also dried up. With the near shutdown of industrial and commercial activity, the demand for electricity has fallen. Real estate transactions are also frozen. All this has put the finances of the states under real strain. The Union still owes about Rs 34,000 crore to states as GST compensation for December 2019 and January 2020. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, which limits state borrowing, will further hamper state governments in their attempts to revive the economy.The frequent, often confusing, advisories issued by North Block are evidence of the government’s inept handling of the pandemic. The directive to employers to bear the burden of paying employees’ salaries during the lockdown, apart from being illegal, is blind to their differential financial capacities. We need plans of action, mandatory under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005. Decisions should be taken after consultations with stakeholder representatives. We need coordination between the Union, state and district authorities allowing for monitoring. Different sectors of the economy need separate bailouts.The road to economic revival is to create demand to whet the appetite of supply chains. Demand can only be created by putting money in the hands of the 800 million poor whose capacity to earn has been impacted. This daunting challenge requires a national response. The government must display both transparency and the willingness to make decisions based on ground realities. The sensitivities of each section of society in formulating a policy framework must be considered. That alone will help us get back on track.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-knock-out-punch-to-the-economy-writes-kapil-sibal/story-95lHayXMJDgP0Ew7AITZTM.html
30-04-2020||News||A road map for India’s exit from the lockdown | HT Analysis||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi is in an unenviable position. Many state governments and most commentators want the lockdown to continue as new cases mount, including in areas hitherto free from the coronavirus pandemic. Mathematically, even with the rate of doubling going up to over 11 days, because of the large numbers, or base effect in statistics, new cases will continue to increase substantially. At the same time, there is the issue of the livelihoods of over 400 million persons; many above the poverty line are liable to slip back due to the income shock of lost earnings.Approximately 65% of the Indian economy is in the unorganised sector. What makes the situation worse is that over 90% of the workforce is informal with limited welfare entitlements. In fact, but for the Jan Dhan Yojana (cash transfer measures that have benefitted around 350 million people, including farmers, rural workers, poor pensioners, construction workers, low-income widows) and Ayushman Bharat (free medical cover up to Rs 500,000 for 40% of the population), India would have been facing a catastrophic situation. However, in the absence of a universal basic income or unemployment benefits, the economy, which is now operating at around 40%, must be restarted to provide income for the vulnerable population, and prevent millions of others from falling between the cracks.The key question that PM Modi faces is how to unwind the lockdown without endangering the lives of millions of Indians. One of the co-authors of this piece (Maurice Kugler), along with a colleague, developed six options for the United States (US), and we attempt to apply these to India.The surest way of controlling the pandemic is to keep the shutdown going till a vaccine is developed and the entire population immunised. The second option is for it to be eased off gradually, and as the curve flattens, its health and economic trade-offs both fall in the mid-range. The third option is a more aggressive version of the second, allowing for greater opening, but retaining the possibility of reintroducing a complete lockdown if the infection rate picks up. Under the fourth option, antibody tests are to be carried out and those who are immune can be allowed to move around freely. Under the fifth option, the entire population is to be tested once every two weeks. The sixth option requires contact tracing and widespread testing where cases are detected.The first is not an option that India can afford as it would likely take 12-18 months for the vaccine to be available. Similarly, the fourth and fifth options can be ruled out for financial and logistical reasons and non-availability of enough test kits.The trouble with the third option is that while its health costs are probably lower than the second, economic recovery would be more uncertain and distant. The outcomes could be volatile. It could leave policymakers with little room to manoeuvre and lessen their credibility with the people.The only viable route for India would be to roll out a modified second option, allowing for greater opening faster, but with strict protection measures, along with the sixth option. Since the virus has a demographic preference (infants and the aged), an alternative is to keep these age-groups locked down. This is not possible in the Indian context, and the best way is to use geography as a determinant. This approach has already started in India with the identification of hotspot localities — the district is too large a geographical area to be a viable unit of disaggregation and would unnecessarily penalise millions.The other is contact tracing backed by mass testing, if any positive case is identified. In reality, hotspots, as a concept, have limitations and we should be looking for “hot” persons. Therefore, the use of Aarogya Setu, and the procurement of adequate testing kits, personal protective equipment, and ventilators (including from domestic sources) has to be stepped up by an order of magnitude. Contact tracing is not going to be easy with even Singapore failing to get 20% of its population enrolled. But India has no option.However, India’s imminent emergence from the lockdown will only be meaningful if the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) adopt extraordinary and unorthodox policies. India should not worry about a one-time large fiscal deficit, and instead, carry out structural reforms in agriculture (open up markets, bring in forward trading) and industry (make acquiring land easier, encourage hiring, simplify taxation systems).Similarly, despite the RBI loosening up monetary policy, banks will not be able to step up lending because of existing high-levels of non-performing assets. Learning from the US Federal Reserve, which is directly buying below-investment level corporate bonds, the RBI, with the government, should create a public sector entity that can pick up part of the equity of micro, small and medium enterprises that are otherwise sound, deploying their capital to reduce their term loans. Once companies recover, the equity held can be sold and costs recovered, where feasible.The joint roll-out of the second and sixth options and the adoption of aggressive fiscal and monetary policies should enable India to ride out the worst of the pandemic, setting the stage for economic recovery later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-road-map-for-india-s-exit-from-the-lockdown-ht-analysis/story-tzGHsHFChVbcscjqtEBkhO.html
30-04-2020||City||Confusion over timings prevails on Day 1 of relaxation in Ludhiana||A day after chief minister Amarinder Singh announced a four-hour relaxation in the state, shops selling essential commodities in the city opened on Thursday amid confusion over the timings. As the decision on timings (7am to 11am) was taken late in the evening on Wednesday, most shopkeepers remained clueless about it and brought their shutters down before 11am for fear of action by authorities. Residents, on the other hand, were seen openly flouting the curfew norms by turning up in their vehicles even as the administration had only permitted them to walk to their nearby shops. However, in a relief to the administration, most residents stayed home as essential supplies, including groceries and medicines, are readily available at doorsteps.Deepak Chawla, a grocery shop owner, said, he opened the shop on Thursday morning but closed it before 11 am as there was confusion about the time till which counter sales are allowed.President of the Punjab Chapter of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), Harkesh Mittal said kirana wholesalers are facing harassment at the hands of administration due to the confusion over timings. “There is no proper communication from the administration due to which many wholesalers reached their shops on Thursday morning only to be asked by the police to return.”Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal said that residents were seen moving on city roads even after 11 am on Thursday but from now on, strict would be taken against such violators. Agrawal said that shops selling essential commodities, the owners of which have already got passes for home delivery, have been allowed to do counter sales from 7am and 11am. Residents can commute only on foot during the relaxation period (7am to11am).Shopkeepers can carry out doorstep delivery from 11am to 7pm and wholesale shops can also open after 11 am and operate till 7pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/confusion-over-timings-prevails-on-day-1-of-relaxation-in-ludhiana/story-gLQvagswZ2r9Gm0K4AJB4J.html
30-04-2020||Lucknow||Norms relaxed, sanitisers to be available at general stores too||The Uttar Pradesh Food Safety and Drug Administration department has relaxed the norms for manufacture and availability of sanitisers, allowing general stores to sell them as well. The demand for sanitisers has shot up since the coronavirus pandemic outbreak.On the request of the state’s excise department, principal secretary, food safety and drug administration, Anita Singh issued an order relaxing the norms for sale of sanitisers.“Earlier only medical centres with drug licences were authorised to sell sanitisers. So, technically only pharmacists were able to do that. But given the sharp increase in its demand and it having become a requirement, we had appealed to the drug administration department to relax the norms for its availability. So now sanitisers would be available at all shops and general stores,” principal secretary, excise, Sanjay Bhoosreddy said.“The general stores would, however, be subjected to regular inspection that would be required to see if they are conforming to norms,” he added.Some general stores have already begun selling sanitisers but Bhoosreddy said it was only after the order that they are legally permitted to sell it. “The retail price of hand sanitisers for the general public shall not be more than Rs 100 per 200 ml pack,” he said.He also said pricing for a larger pack of hand sanitisers shall be decided proportionately.“Any violation of this order shall be punishable under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, the Essential Commodities Order, 2020 and other relevant rules in this regard,” he added.“I would urge people to ask for a bill while buying sanitisers so that those overcharging could be booked,” he said. As per a notification of the ministry of food, consumer affairs and public distribution, the centre, in its order of March 19, declared raw material used in the manufacture of hand sanitisers as an essential commodity. “The state government has issued licences at a rapid pace to sugar mills, distilleries and drug licence units to manufacture hand sanitisers. So far, 27 sugar mills-cum- distillery units have been licensed to obtain distilled alcohol for manufacturing sanitisers. Four pharmacies are also manufacturing sanitisers,” he said.“To regulate the production, quality, distribution, pricing and other aspects it has been mandated that without the consent of the central government, the price of alcohol used in the manufacture of hand sanitisers should not exceed the price that was prevailing before March 5. On March 21, the ministry of food, consumer affairs and public distribution issued an order stating that the retail price of 200 ml pack of hand sanitisers should not exceed Rs 100,” Bhoosreddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/norms-relaxed-sanitisers-to-be-available-at-general-stores-too/story-QhrdsPYd4SpEerpSvVbgKJ.html
30-04-2020||Mumbai||State relaxes restrictions for intra-state travelling for stranded people||On the lines of the notification issued by the Centre on Wednesday, the state government in a notification on Thursday relaxed some lockdown norms and permitted stranded students, migrants, tourists, pilgrims and other citizens for inter-district and inter-state travel. The permissions will, however, come into effect from Saturday.“Stranded migrants, students, pilgrims and other people will be allowed to travel inter-district by seeking written permission in due format,” said home minister Anil Deshmukh.The notification has given powers to district collectors and the director of disaster management unit to grant permissions to all those stranded in the state to travel outside the respective districts where they are currently stranded by following the guidelines related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Several migrants have been left in the lurch since March in cities such as Mumbai, Thane and Pune, after the nation-wide lockdown came into effect. Kishoreraje Nimbalkar, secretary, relief and rehabilitation, said that permissions will be granted by collectors if any individual or family approaches or writes to him/her, only if he/she finds the reasons stated satisfactory.The notification will also pave way for the travelling of more than 5.7 lakh migrant workers who have been staying in the shelters camps across the state. “We will give them the permissions, but the responsibility of arranging the transportation will not be taken,” said an official from the state government. Those travelling back home from Maharashtra will however, have to go through a health check-up, follow the sanitisation guidelines and undergo a 14-day quarantine if required.Meanwhile, there are also around a few thousand workers from Maharashtra who are stranded in Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, while more than 500 students from the state are stranded in Delhi. Meanwhile, the state has already sent 72 state transport buses to bring around 1,800 students stuck in Kota in Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-relaxes-restrictions-for-intra-state-travelling-for-stranded-people/story-u4Tx97vpckG8yYWLal6YMI.html
30-04-2020||Mumbai||City’s Covid detection rate rises to 7% after more tests in containment areas||The percentage of novel coronavirus cases, compared to samples tested, in the state has increased to 7% from 4% in the last 15 days due to change in testing protocol that is targeting containment zones, which have a higher proportion of cases. Due to the better detection of cases, the number of false reporting of Covid-19 cases have also decreased.Maharashtra’s Covid-19 cases now stand at 10,498, the highest in the country. This is because of better detection rate with a change in testing protocol and an increase in the number of testing centres to 50 in the state.“As we have narrowed the testing protocol, we are able to focus more on symptomatic patients and close contact high-risk patients with comorbid health issues. This has helped us to detect more number of positive cases. Along with this, we have also boosted up our per day testing capacity. With more testing, more number of cases are being detected,” said Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner (family welfare) and director of National Health Mission, Maharashtra.Till April 12, per 100 tests, four samples used to turn positive of the virus which has now increased to seven samples. As per the data provided by the state health department, till Wednesday, as many as 1,35,694 samples have been tested in the state. Out of this 6.87% of them have tested positive for Covid-19. However, the detection rate was much lower until April 12. Out of the total 39,725 samples tested, only 4% (1,761) came positive of Covid-19. This is in the backdrop that more number of symptomatic patients are getting diagnosed with Covid within the containment zones, due to change in testing protocols.Following the protocol of the Indian Council of Medical Research, since April 12, the state health department has instructed all government and private laboratories not to collect samples from persons not showing any symptoms.This circular made it mandatory to test only symptomatic persons (who have cough, fever), people over 60 years of age who are high-risk contacts of Covid-19 positive patients whether they are showing symptoms or not, healthcare workers, pregnant women, patients on dialysis and chemotherapy. While asymptomatic high-risk contacts of positive patients can get if they develop symptoms, or after careful observation between 5 and 14 days of contact with an infected person. They are referred for home quarantine.On March 9, when Maharashtra witnessed the first three cases of Covid-19, the state was having a capacity of 100 tests per day but today, the testing capacity of the state along with private labs has been increased to 10,000 tests per day.“Earlier, we had noticed that despite coming negative in tests, people were turned positive after a few days. As we are testing more numbers of symptomatic patients, the cases of false reporting of positive have also plunged down,” Yadav said.The total number of novel coronavirus cases in Maharashtra on Wednesday rose to 9, 915 after recording 597 fresh cases, according to the state public health department. Active patients in the state now stand at 7,890 while 1,593 patients have been discharged or cured of the highly contagious disease.Public health experts have also praised the change in the testing pattern of the state government which has brought down the mortality rate closer to the actual average. “More number of symptomatic patients are getting detected at an early stage which has helped to provide treatment on time. Even countries like China and Italy had followed a similar protocol. With better detection rate, the epidemic curve will rise drastically but as they start recovering and containment of the spread of the virus, the graph will also fall down,” said Sanjay Pattiwar, independent public health consultant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-s-covid-detection-rate-rises-to-7-after-more-tests-in-containment-areas/story-euKpt4VOXQXGFqZgJC58PL.html
30-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body conducts lottery for CBSE, ICSE schools; broadcasts it live for parents||The education department of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) conducted a lottery for admissions to its newly opened Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) schools on Thursday morning. The lottery was conducted only with a select few officials from the department and was broadcasted online for parents. There were a total of 332 applications for the 308 seats in Woollen Mills Municipal School in Mahim, which is set to be affiliated to ICSE board. While lottery was carried out for junior KG to Class 1, all students who had applied for Classes 2 to 6 got in. For Poonam Nagar Municipal School in Jogeshwari (East), which is set to be affiliated with the CBSE board, there were over 2,000 applications for 308 seats. Of the total application 1,510 were found valid after scrutiny. Lottery for both of these schools was conducted simultaneously on Thursday. In both of these schools, each class has a capacity of 38 students. In the first year, these schools would run pre-primary to Class 6 under the new board. Students who have made it to the schools would get a text message on their parent’s phones. In the coming days, parents have to fill out a form to confirm admission. While the academic year for both these schools is set to begin in June, a decision with respect to the dates would be taken depending on the situation in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, students would be given some online learning resources to keep them engaged. “This is a first-of-its-kind initiative for students under BMC, and we are happy that it is materialising,” said Sainath Durge, member of the BMC’s education committee. Admissions in both these schools would be free. Students who are admitted in these schools would have to study Marathi as a compulsory third language. A number of teachers, who are already teaching in BMC schools, have been selected through a rigorous process to become a part of the board. The move hopes to bring in more students to municipal schools, which over the years have been struggling to get students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-conducts-lottery-for-cbse-icse-schools-broadcasts-it-live-for-parents/story-0XE85YKvV2erxtGnLsS3eK.html
30-04-2020||Lucknow||90-year-old woman tests positive at private hospital in Lucknow||A 90-year-old woman, who was receiving treatment at a private hospital, tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday.The woman, a medical practitioner’s mother, is the oldest Covid-19 patient in Uttar Pradesh till now. She has now been shifted to Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) in Lucknow.The woman was earlier admitted to Nishat Hospital on Wednesday morning after she complained of breathlessness. After the test report was received, the health department was informed about the development. Thereafter, health department officials directed the hospital administration to ask the staff who came in contact with the woman to go into quarantine.“The hospital is running only an emergency OPD for patients with non-Covid illness as our hospital has been listed for isolation facility with the health department. Our doctors and staff attended the patient with complete protective gear, including PPE kits, and we followed all the protocols strictly,” said Dr Tauseef Ahmad of the Nishat Hospital.After informing the health department about the positive case, the hospital first got the area sanitised on its own and then by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) staff.About a dozen medical staff of the hospital came in contact, seven of them directly, with the woman“They have been asked to stay in quarantine in the hospital,” said Dr Ahmad.“Each patient coming for admission is treated considering them to be coronavirus positive, until their test report turns out to be negative. This protocol ensures the medical staff remains safe,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, association of international doctors (AID).The patient was ill for the past few days and was brought to hospital when her problem aggravated. The health department is now looking into the contact history of the medical staff. The samples of the staff members and their families shall be taken. Besides, health teams will visit their homes and check them for symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/90-year-old-woman-tests-positive-at-private-hospital-in-lucknow/story-2kt6ojFqHpxJHcaX8qLNOI.html
30-04-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana cabinet gives nod to hike in bus fares||In a decision that is likely to draw public criticism during the ongoing health crisis, the Haryana cabinet, on Thursday, approved a 15-20 paisa per kilometre increase in bus fares for ordinary Haryana Roadways buses.The passenger fare for HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioned) buses would be increased to ₹1.50/km. The fare for intrastate luxury Volvo/Mercedes AC buses would be increased to ₹1.75/km.For the super-luxury Volvo/Mercedes AC buses operating on Chandigarh-Delhi-Gurugram route, the fare would be increased to ₹2.50/km. An official spokesperson said that there is a 40% increase in cost of operation of the Haryana Roadways. As a result of the increased costs, they are facing heavy losses. Losses in the ongoing financial year by January 2020 are pegged at Rs 726.21 crore.The spokesperson said that the minimum chargeable standard bus fare (including passenger tax) will be Rs 5. Freight for personal luggage will be half of the standard/ordinary bus fare per kilometre per 40kg. No freight will be charged for personal luggage up to 40kg weight. Fare for different stages of bus routes will be rounded off to the nearest rupee.As per the decision, the bus fare for ordinary buses in state will be increased from 85 paisa/km to Rs 1/km up to a distance of 100km and Rs 1.05/km for travel of more than 100km.The spokesperson said that bus fare in Haryana was last revised on June 30, 2016 when the gross standard fare was increased from 75 paisa/km to 85 paisa/km.Since the last revision, the operational expenditure has increased substantially, especially on account of expenditure towards staff, diesel, spare parts, tyre-tubes, lubricants, bus chassis, fabrication cost and insurance, he said.The expenditure per kilometre has gone up from Rs.37.48 in June 2015 to Rs 52.23 in December 2019. Also, 41 categories of citizens are travelling on a free and concessional basis resulting in around Rs 375 crore loss to the Roadways. The state Roadways has a fleet of around 4,294 buses, including 485 buses of kilometre scheme.ONLY BUSES, EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLES TO BE BOUGHT IN THIS FISCALKeeping in view the financial crunch due to dwindling tax receipts during the lockdown, the cabinet has banned purchase of new official vehicles. Only public transport buses and emergency response vehicles including ambulances, fire tenders will be purchased in this fiscal. The cabinet also decided that in case of urgent requirement of new car or jeep, outsourcing or hiring of vehicles should be done.1% MARKET FEE, HRDF LEVIED ON SALE OF FRUITS, VEGGIESIn another decision, the cabinet has levied 1% market fee and 1% Haryana Rural Development Fund (HRDF) on sales of fruits and vegetables at mandis. The levying of both was abolished in February 2014 by the then Congress government. The state government expects to earn about Rs 100 crore from imposition of two levies. The decision is being criticised by the Opposition.ALLOTS 18 ACRE IN FARIDABAD TO JC BOSE VARSITYThe cabinet approved the proposal to allot 18 acre Faridabad MC land to JC Bose University of Science and Technology (YMCA), at present collector rates of Rs 3 crore per acre. Development charge at Rs 120 per square yards, yielding the MC about Rs. 56 crore will also be levied.NOD TO BUYING DEBT-RIDDEN MEDICAL INSTITUTEThe cabinet has also accorded ex-post facto approval to purchase of the Gold Field Institute of Medical Sciences and Research in Faridabad.

30-04-2020||City||Maharashtra constitutional crisis nearing end?||A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray rang up Prime Minister Narendra Modi and sought his intervention to end the impasse in the state over the former’s election to state legislature, a new option has opened up.Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Thursday requested the Election Commission of India to hold elections for nine seats to the state legislative Council at the earliest, with a view to end the political uncertainty in the state. A little before that, three ruling parties in the state, the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress wrote to the EC seeking elections to the nine council seats that are to be elected by members of the state Assembly. The impending constitutional crisis in Maharashtra may get resolved if the EC accepts Koshyari’s and MVA’s request. It also means Koshyari is not keen on Thackeray’s election to the Council as Governor’s nominee.Thackeray was not a member of the state legislature when he took oath as the chief minister on November 28. As per the provisions under the Constitution, he was supposed to get elected to the state legislative Assembly or Council within six months, which is by May 27. If it doesn’t happen, he will have to resign as the chief minister.Thackeray had planned to contest the election to the Council, as nine members were retiring on April 24. However the election was postponed by the EC due to the Covid-19 outbreak. On April 9, the state cabinet recommended Governor to nominate Thackeray on the legislative council as two out of 12 seats to the council that are nominated by Governor were lying vacant. However, Koshyari is avoiding the same since the seats are nominated from among the achievers in art, social service, literature and other fields and he doesn’t want to nominate politicians, according to a Raj Bhavan official. Further, there are norms that Governor nominated members should not become ministers.Koshyari had also indicated that he would seek the Centre’s opinion on the issue as the state cabinet had advised him to nominate Thackeray as a special case considering the current health crisis in the state.It was then that Thackeray chose to talk directly to Prime Minister Modi. Following communication between a close aide of Thackeray and an official from PMO, Thackeray dialled Modi on Wednesday requesting his intervention. “The option (for council election) came up after the two leaders spoke,” said a senior Sena leader, seeking anonymity.On Thursday afternoon, two Sena leaders, party secretary Milind Narvekar, who was Thackeray’s intermediary with Koshyari, and urban development minister Eknath Shinde met the Governor and handed him letters written to the EC by the three parties and also a letter by Thackeray requesting Governor to recommend the EC to hold elections to council. Koshyari then immediately wrote to the EC requesting early election for nine seats to the council, according to information available.The ball is now in the EC’s court. The election authority is likely to seek union home ministry’s opinion before deciding on the request. “The Governor has made the request to the Election Commission to fill the 9 seats in the legislative council, that have been lying vacant from 24th April, with a view to end the current uncertainty in the State,”said a release issued by Raj Bhavan on Thursday evening.In his letter, Koshyari has stated that the Central Government has announced many relaxation measures regarding the enforcement of lockdown in the country. As such the elections to the council seats can be held with certain guidelines. In their letters, the three ruling parties said that on account of “peculiar extraordinary unforeseen facts and circumstances” Thackeray has not been able to get himself elected to the legislative council.They have also assured the EC that they would follow social distancing and other precautions that are required under the current circumstances.BJP leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis indicated that things might be sorted out in cooperation with the Centre. “We welcome Hon Governor @BSKoshyari ji’s decision to recommend the ECI to conduct the election of the 9 vacant seats of Maharashtra Legislative Council expeditiously. We are sure that the ECI, in consultation with Ministry of Home Affairs will take decision to take election ASAP,”he tweeted. “This will prevent Maharashtra from going into instability in the testing times of #CoronaOutbreak &will also uphold the values of our Constitution....This also underlines that in a democratic system, dialogue is of utmost importance,” he said. A Sena minister said it is likely that the election would be held unopposed once the EC clears it. “The developments have happened in less than a day after Thackeray spoke to PM Modi. If the election to the Council is held now, it would be clearly following the intervention by Modi. In that case, it is likely that the four parties--three ruling parties and BJP-- would informally decide on fielding nine candidates between them so that the entire exercise of getting 288 members of assembly to Mumbai for voting in the middle of Covid-19 outbreak can be avoided,” he said. He also said that the party is prepared to explore other options as well. It includes approaching the Supreme Court, seeking directives to the Governor. He said the Sena is hopeful that it need not execute MVA’s last option which is Thackeray’s resignation. “It would not come to that (Thackeray’s resignation as CM),” the leader said. If Thackeray resigns, he could be re-elected as the leader of the MVA coalition and form the government again amid the ongoing battle against the coronavirus outbreak in Maharashtra.Most MVA leaders however were sceptical about Koshyari’s move. “We would wait to see whether the EC holds election,”said a senior NCP leader. Two Sena ministers HT spoke to also expressed apprehensions. “Today’s developments mean Governor Koshyari is not accepting state cabinet’s recommendation to nominate Thackeray to council. If the Election Commission holds election for council, the issue would be resolved, but what if it doesn’t? Or what if it is legally challenged. The possibility of a crisis is not yet over,”said political commentator Pratap Asbe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-constitutional-crisis-nearing-end/story-cWfGKQyDbBWX7aLIHLszNP.html
30-04-2020||Mumbai||Hospitals can’t refuse patients without examination: Maharashtra government||After a number of complaints of hospitals denying admission to patients or delaying treatment, the Maharashtra government on Thursday issued an order that no hospital can turn away any patient without examination and required intervention under any circumstances. The order will come into effect from May 2.All private and government hospitals in the state have also been directed to check any patient who is entering the hospital premises, and shift or admit him, depending on the patient’s medical condition.Following the guidelines issued by the Centre, the state has also ordered shifting of all asymptomatic patients without co-morbid conditions to Covid Care Centres, whereas private hospitals can send such patients for home quarantine, but after proper counselling, states the order issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Thursday. The hospitals have been warned of action in case directives are not followed scrupulously. “Any patient entering the hospital premises for any treatment of Covid-19 or non Covid-19 ailment should be immediately checked in to casualty or screening clinic. After triage, the patient may be shifted or admitted. Depending upon the site condition, the staging area may be created for screening and triage of patients in isolation so that infections are not transmitted. No patient is to be turned away without examination and required intervention under any circumstances,” the order reads.The government has asked the directors of health services to prepare the standard operating procedure (SOP) for screening, transferring, admitting and discharging of patients. “Each patient needing hospital admission will be assigned a unique ID by the round-the-clock onsite team of the disaster management department (DMD) of the local body such as the BMC, without which admission cannot be granted. DMD should use this as a more accurate and efficient bed management in all hospitals,” it further states. “This will help in better calculation of beds in hospitals. So if any one calls helpline numbers, it will be easier to get details faster,” said a state health official.“For this, the state government has given them two days and hence the order will come into force from May 2,” said a senior official, wishing not to be named.“In order to decongest hospitals, all asymptomatic positive patients without comorbidity should be shifted to appropriate Covid Care Centres (CCC) immediately. All Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 hospitals are also directed to ensure that no admission is granted to asymptomatic positive patients without co-morbidity. Similar patients in private hospitals should be stamped and sent away for home quarantine after proper counselling, according to the Government of India guidelines,” it adds.The hospitals are also directed to collect swabs of all suspected Covid-19 patients admitted on top priority and ensure that reports are collected within 12 hours and ensure the patients are diagnosed as per clinical conditions and shifted to CCC, Dedicated Covid Health Centers (DCHC) for patients with mild symptoms and Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) for serious patients. In case of death of a Covid-19 positive patient, the hospital administrations are also directed to ensure that the body is shifted from the ward within 30 minutes and disposed of within 12 hours for which necessary processes have to be defined keeping in view the prevalent regulations.“In Mumbai, the mobilisation of the ambulances should be controlled centrally by the Disaster Management Department of the BMC,” states the order. This is being done to ensure ambulances can be made available to the patients without any delay, said the senior official.Health experts have welcomed the move. “Patients run from pillar to post seeking treatment, but due to the lack of a proper guideline, they are being refused treatment. Doctors and staff are clueless how to manage patients. This will be helpful, but there is also a need for its proper implementation,” said Dr Ravikant Singh, a health activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hospitals-can-t-refuse-patients-without-examination-maharashtra-government/story-k2Z4Oza5wEEv7xh5NkDj7H.html

Both Harsimrat and Singla have claimed that Amritsar will be connected with the expressway by a 65-km stretch of ‘Access Controlled Highway’ from Kartarpur town near Jalandhar. The ministry’s website does not have the city’s name. “This stretch was announced separately many years ago. It will not provide any extra advantage, as it will be laid along existing NH-1. Changing the plan by excluding the Amritsar district is a big fraud on residents, which will not be tolerated. I am ready to make any kind of sacrifice for this sacred city ,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-amritsar-in-expressway-a-fraud-on-residents-punjab-mp-aujla/story-yG0ySQqKhOhOnwl4RjSUcJ.html
30-04-2020||Mumbai||Allow liquor sale, open up realty sector to revive state economy, expert panel recommends||An expert panel, set up by the state government earlier this month, has suggested that sale of alcohol be permitted, and real estate and construction sector be opened, among other recommendations to revive the economy hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. The panel’s report, with recommendations to get the state economy back on track, is likely to be submitted to the government this week, said additional chief secretary, finance, Manoj Saunik. The panel, led by 11 retired and serving bureaucrats, was set up by the state cabinet to suggest ways to restart economic activity.“The panel has recommended that excise revenue should be tapped and hence sale of alcohol be permitted. Similarly, it has also called for opening up of the real estate sector and consider reducing the stamp duty to spur demand in this sector,’’ said a member of the committee, on condition of anonymity.The sale of liquor has been banned since the lockdown was implemented on March 25. The state government earns around Rs 17,000 to 18,000 crore annually from excise duty on liquor and an estimated Rs 26,000 crore annually from stamp duty and registrations. In this year’s budget, the state has already cut stamp duty levied on realty transactions by one per cent.The Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown had brought the state economy and industry to a halt. With recent relaxations on April 20, industrial units are slowly re-starting their businesses.The state exchequer has lost an estimated Rs 40,500 crore revenue in March and April.“The committee has emphasised on maintaining safety protocols and containment strategies even as it has recommended seamless logistics and movement of goods, safe transport of labour required for industry, increased reliance on digitisation in the functioning of businesses and prepping for an effective kharif season,’’ said a former bureaucrat and a member of the panel.Focusing on the agriculture sector, the panel has recommended setting up of state and district control rooms to oversee kharif season preparations to ensure farmers get all inputs from seeds to credit/loans. It has also asked the state government to ensure that all Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees are kept open while following safety norms and suggested that the state seeks financing assistance from National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) for its co-operative banks.The panel stated that a whole new class of businesses has emerged and will continue to do well post the outbreak, and the government must recognise these new players and encourage them.“There could be a resurgence of the IT sector as they will be called on to provide back end services besides health, hygiene, pharma and a myriad of online players from food delivery apps to education technology. These are the companies, which will help to reignite the economy in the coming months,’’ added the former bureaucrat. The report will be considered by a ministerial committee, led by finance minister and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, which will also take a final call on implementing these recommendations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/allow-liquor-sale-open-up-realty-sector-to-revive-state-economy-expert-panel-recommends/story-un7g1QAVqcbSPLt87OnCMM.html

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has finalised Mahalaxmi Racecourse for setting up of a 200-bed isolation facility to treat Covid-19 patients. The parking lot at the Racecourse is being looked at to set up the treatment centre. The Lower Parel Railway ground will also be turned into a 100-200-bed isolation facility.A senior civic official confirmed that the Mahalaxmi isolation facility will have lightweight cardboard beds which can support a weight of more than 200kg and are cheaper. “The ground of the racecourse has been ruled out for the isolation facility since it has several infrastructural challenges of its own. Each of the beds will have oxygen support. There will be two-three intensive care units (ICUs) set up there,” said the official.Former MLA and Shiv Sena leader Sachin Ahir said, “We are looking at other options at Bandra-Kurla Complex, Mulund, and Goregaon to find set up more isolation facilities. A lab testing unit will be set up at the National Sports Club of India (NSCI) facility” At the NSCI facility, a negative pressure technology – an isolation technique to prevent cross-contamination from room to room – is being set up to ensure the safety of staff. The BMC is also planning to set up Safest Booths – phone booth-like setups to conduct swab testings safely – across the city. The booths are designed to help health workers stay safe as they do not come in direct contact with the patients.State cabinet minister and Worli MLA Aaditya Thackeray told HT, “We even started X-ray and pulse oxymeter checks along with screening of maximum people through fever clinics. Safest Booths are ideal designs for quick testing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-plans-isolation-facilities-at-mahalaxmi-racecourse-lower-parel/story-SEtl7yyaN4bLXkEofxRSdO.html

Bhiwandi, a powerloom town, is 30km away from Mumbai, and has 6 lakh migrant labourers. The lockdown has affected the funds of various social organisations, who have stopped food parcels at many places.“Earlier, around 80 social organisations had been providing food parcels to labourers and daily wagers daily in Bhiwandi. After the second lockdown, some of them stopped distribution and so more labourers come for meals to the community kitchen. Although the state government started community kitchens, they are not able to feed so many labourers,” said Sudhir Sonawane, social worker, Bhiwandi.Santosh Shetty, local corporator of Bhiwandi Nizampur Municipal Corporation, said they have appealed to the government to provide more food grains.“The supplies for meals are given daily taking into account the number of people to be fed. However, with fewer social organisations providing food, the number of labourers coming to the community kitchen is increasing each day,” he said.“We count the number of people to be fed a day before, but we cannot refuse if more turn up,” said Shetty.Some labourers had only leftover dal on Wednesday. “We hardly get one proper meal a day. It is an everyday struggle to get food,” said Ramesh Gaud, 34, a labourer from Uttar Pradesh who works in a power mill in Bhiwandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/community-kitchen-in-bhiwandi-struggles-to-provide-food-to-6-000-labourers/story-qkzNWvbOuJQw93QEUR3cDN.html

The joint front conveners also rejected the state government’s appeal to employees to take voluntary cut of up to 30% in salaries for three months, stating that they had not got pay revision as per the 6th State Pay Commission and their two previous DA instalments were also pending. They also criticised the central government’s decision to freeze the dearness allowance of its employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-unions-flay-task-force-for-misleading-government-on-employee-wages/story-gTxbKUn8UzLbhLFNfkQsaP.html

However, the health department said that the woman’s death was not due to Covid-19 and attributed her death to cardiac arrest. She was a resident of Pratap Vihar.A woman councillor from Vasundhara, a man from Khoda and a Delhi traffic police head constable also tested positive on Thursday. Officials said that the total tally of Covid-19 positive patients stood at 66 on Thursday.“The 60-year-old woman had been admitted to a private hospital in Nehru Nagar two days ago and her sample was taken for testing on April 29. The report came back positive on Thursday. But her cause of death is cardiac arrest. She was also a diabetes patient and had high blood pressure as well. We will not consider this a case of death due to Coronavirus. She had comorbid conditions, though,” Ghaziabad’s chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta, said.Similarly, a young man from Loni had died of a kidney ailment at a hospital in Delhi on April 8; he was suspected to be infected by Covid-19. The health department maintains that his reports are yet to be received from Delhi.Meanwhile, the residents’ welfare association (RWA) office bearers of a high-rise in Vaishali Sector 4 alleged that there was laxity and a delay in providing ambulances to two police personnel who tested positive for Covid-19—a sub-inspector of the Delhi Police had tested positive on Wednesday, while the traffic police head constable tested positive on Thursday. Both are residents of Park Avenue Society in Vaishali Sector 4.“I tried to call the number of the Ghaziabad health department for about one-and-a-half hours, but there was no response. After they finally picked up, they assured me that an ambulance would reach soon but it did not arrive till 9pm on Thursday. I got myself tested after one of my neighbours, a 57-year-old sub-inspector with the Delhi Police, tested positive on Wednesday. I live with my wife and daughter and have been staying in isolation in one room while waiting for the ambulance,” the 42-year-old head constable said.“When I got in touch with the officials, they said that an ambulance will take me to ESI Hospital in Sahibabad,” he added.The Ghaziabad health department officials said that the 57-year-old sub-inspector was not added to the tally of positive cases in Ghaziabad as he was admitted to a hospital in Delhi, but the case of 42-year-old head constable would be added.AK Chaubey, the president of the Park Avenue RWA also alleged a delay in the provision of ambulances for the two Delhi Police personnel after they tested positive for Covid-19.“The SI of Delhi Police waited for over three-and-a-half hours on Wednesday but the Ghaziabad health department did not send an ambulance. His son had to drive him to a hospital in Delhi. There has been utter negligence and laxity on part of the health department as it seems that they are not serious about patients and are dealing with this in a very casual manner,” he said.“We will inquire if there was any delay in sending ambulances. However, in both cases, I personally arranged ambulances for the Delhi police personnel. However, any delay would not have created problems as they both were confined to their homes. The case of 42-year-old head constable of Delhi police will be added to our tally on Friday. Our ambulance will shift him to ESI Hospital in Sahibabad,” Dr Gupta added.Meanwhile, a 45-year-old Bharatiya Janata Party woman municipal councillor from Ward 74 in Vasundhara also tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday.“She had been social distancing and following precautions during the lockdown. But she developed a fever and cough after which we got her tested. We don’t know from where she picked up the infection. Many women from the nearby Prahladgarhi village have been coming to our house to seek food and ration. I suspect that my wife came in contact with someone who was infected. The health department should check these women as well,” the councillor’s husband said.Dr Gupta said that the third patient who was added to the tally of Covid-19 positive patients is a man from Khoda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-60-year-old-woman-tests-positive-for-covid-19-dies-the-same-day/story-CSuCc8BCyihTNwXGCJYTwI.html
30-04-2020||City||Namesake of Covid +ve man admitted to hospital, discharged after 1 hour in Tarn Taran||In a major goof-up, health and police officials on Thursday forcibly ferried a 27-year-old man of Chhichrewal village in an ambulance and got him admitted to the Tarn Taran civil hospital as a Covid-19 patient in a case of “mistaken identity”.The man, who was discharged from the hospital an hour later, was the namesake of another man of Sursingh village in the district who had tested positive for coronavirus after returning from Huzur Sahib, Nanded. The Chhichrewal man, who works as a nurse in a private hospital in Amritsar, said the officials forcibly pushed him into an ambulance even as he pleaded that he was not the person they were looking for. Immediately after taking him to the hospital, police had also sealed his house.On Thursday, the district reported seven new cases of Covid-19 — all Nanded-returnees. Two of the seven cases were reported from Sursingh village, which has already been declared as containment zone as five cases were reported from the village on Tuesday.“At around 9 am, the officials came to my house to take me to hospital. I told them that I am not the person they were looking for, but they forcibly threw me in the ambulance in which a positive patient was already present. The same ambulance dropped me at my home when I was discharged from the hospital. I am afraid I might have got infection,” he said while taking to HT over phone.Police said the mix-up took place as the Chhihrewal youth had also returned from Hazur Sahib and his samples were also taken for the testing.“I came back from Hazur Sahib 14 days ago and my samples were taken on Wednesday and the report is awaited. I am healthy and my 14-day quarantine period has been completed. Now, though my report will come in the coming days, I will have to get my re-testing done,” said the victim. Chabhal police station SHO Prabhjit Singh, said, “His name was mismatched by the doctors. We just followed their instructions. Besides dropping him at his home, we have now lifted the barricading outside his house.” Deputy commissioner (DC) Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal said: “The man was hospitalised due to mistaken identity. Now the right person has been admitted to the hospital.”TESTED +VE 2 DAYS AGO, WOMAN FOUND HEALTHY IN FRESH TEST Meanwhile, two days after a 24-year-old woman, who delivered a baby boy at the government hospital in the district on Saturday, was tested positive for coronavirus, the report of her fresh test came negative on Thursday.Tarn Taran civil surgeon Dr Anoop Kumar said the report of her newly born child has also come negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/namesake-of-covid-ve-man-admitted-to-hospital-discharged-after-1-hour-in-tarn-taran/story-GzPa5uH8rqYjmP4cny4RHO.html

30-04-2020||Chandigarh||Preparing for the worst, Punjab to set up Covid care centres with 20,000 beds||The Punjab government is setting up Covid-19 care centres with 20,000 beds across the state, in what officials described as preparations for the “worse case” scenario.A Covid-19 care centre is a makeshift facility for persons who have been clinically diagnosed as mild cases. As per the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, every centre is to be mapped to one or more dedicated Covid hospitals for referral purposes. Each centre will also have a dedicated basic life support ambulance equipped with sufficient oxygen support on a 24x7 basis.These isolation centres are being established in hostels of meritorious schools, colleges, and universities, both government and private, across the state.In the first phase, 28 such centres with a total of 12,000 beds are being readied in all 22 districts to prepare for a large Covid-19 outbreak, if and when it happens, in the state. The care centres or isolation wards will be in addition to around 5,000 beds, including 922 intensive care units (ICU) beds, to become available in 54 government Covid-19 hospitals in the next two months.STATE OF READINESSRajat Agarwal, the member convener of the Covid care committee, said these centres are being set up in phases as part of preparations for the worst-case scenario so that we are not caught unaware if there is a large breakout. “Then, these 5,000 hospital beds will not suffice and patients with mild symptoms will be kept in these makeshift hospitals for immediate medical care. The centres will be kept in a state of readiness but operationalised only when required,” he said. The first care centres will be started on a trial basis in about a week in Ludhiana followed by Amritsar, Jalandhar and Mohali.The spread of Covid-19 in Punjab, which has been under curfew since March 23, is presently much slower than as observed in several other states with 380 positive cases as on April 29 and a doubling rate of 13 days. The state’s count saw a spike of 105 on Thursday as several of the 4,000-odd pilgrims, who were stranded at Gurdwara Hazur Sahib in Nanded (Maharashtra) for weeks and been brought back in the past three days, tested positive, setting alarm bells ringing in official circles.SPIKE IN COUNT OMINOUSSimilarly, 3,500 students and workers are returning to Punjab from Kota and Jaisalmer (Rajasthan) and fresh information has been received about another 2,900 workers stranded in different areas of the state. At the same time, the state government has, while extending the curfew for two weeks, decided to allow the easing of lockdown restrictions for shops, industrial units and construction activities in non-containment zones with strict adherence to Covid-19 safety protocols. The lockdown exit, even if calibrated and phased, poses its serious challenges as there are apprehensions that it may fuel the virus spread and lead to more positive cases. Though only 356 beds are occupied presently with not a single patient in the ICU, the ministry of health and family welfare, as mentioned in the expert panel’s report on lockdown exit, has projected that by May 24, the total cases will jump to 2,400 in the state against the availability of 5,860 beds. As per Niti Ayog’s projections, the state will have a higher load of Covid-19 positive cases by May 31 and not enough beds in hospitals to cope with the projected number.CARE CENTRES TO HOUSE RETURNEESThe health department has decided to thrown open the Covid-19 care centres for Punjabis who are returning from other states and are required to be quarantined in designated quarantine centres set up in most districts due to the sudden surge in their numbers. “In case the dedicated quarantine facilities fall short for the persons to be quarantined, the district administration may use 50% of the capacities of these centres for quarantine of these people,” according to an order issued on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/preparing-for-the-worst-punjab-to-set-up-covid-care-centres-with-20-000-beds/story-qBHHfjMDa6xCLKHRHmaV5H.html

30-04-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 lockdown: Stubble burning returns to haunt Punjab region||Stubble burning has once again returned to haunt the region and authorities are finding it tough to put a check on farm fires amid the lockdown.For official agencies, it is difficult to move as well as get assistance from the police force which is largely engaged in maintaining the lockdown orders pan Haryana. As per the information from the Haryana pollution control board, 228 active fire locations have been detected in the state so far since the monitoring began on April 15. The figure during the corresponding period in 2019 was 713, top officials say.Since April 15, maximum cases of stubble burning, 63, have been reported in Sirsa district, followed by 32 in Jhajjar, 24 in Palwal, 20 in Hisar, 17 in Fatehabad, 14 in Sonepat, nine each in Bhiwani and Gurugram, seven each in Karnal and Rohtak, six each in Jind and Charkhi Dadri, four in Panipat, three in Nuh, two each in Rewari and Yamunanagar and one each in Ambala, Faridabad and Kaithal.With the wheat harvesting on its peak in the state, the number of cases was also been increasing with each passing day as 85 such fires were reported on April 29 as compared to 35 the previous day.SPECIAL AWARENESS DRIVEOfficials in the Haryana state pollution control board claimed that a special campaign has been launched in the state to make the farmers aware of the bad impacts of stubble burning on human health and soil and this helped in reducing the number of stubble burning cases to 203 from 582 witnessed in the corresponding period last year.Member secretary of Haryana pollution control body S Narayanan said, “The actual wheat stubble burnings are yet to be confirmed by field verification staff, who have been advised to do the same regularly. A special awareness drive through advertisements and hoardings has also been launched and we are hopeful of much reduced stubble burning this season.”On being asked whether the farmers were taking advantage of the lockdown, he said, “It is not just punishments that will put a check on stubble burning. Most of the farmers are now aware of the issues and we have been educating them vigorously for the last couple of years.” “Of course, officers of district committees are engaged in duties related to Covid-19 and might not be able to spare more time for field inspections, but still, we are hopeful of the cooperation from farmers and that is why the cases are far less this year,” he added.However, ground-level functionaries of the state agriculture department said they have deputed officials for regular monitoring of stubble burning and a fine of Rs 2,500 per acre is being imposed on the violators. “Out of the six sites in Karnal, two have been confirmed as of stubble burning while the remaining ones were accidental fires,” said Karnal deputy director agriculture Aditya Dabas.On the maximum cases being reported in Sirsa, deputy commissioner Ramesh Chander Bidhan said, “No one is allowed to burn wheat stubble. We have urged farmers not to get involved in stubble burning. The local administration will deal strictly with those who are burning stubble after reaping the crop.”He said the subdivisional magistrates were keeping strict vigil in their areas and if they were found not doing their duty properly, the higher authorities will take departmental action against them too.(With inputs from Bhaskar Mukherjee)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stubble-burning-returns-to-haunt-punjab-region/story-WeovtNaOMW2YfYNXR7aQ0J.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||High Court may turn to fans in effort to control Covid-19 spread||The Delhi High Court is considering switching off the centralised air conditioning system in its premises and instead procure sufficient number of pedestal and wall fans this summer. This would be to reduce chances of infection by the Sars-CoV-2 virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic.A senior offcial of the Delhi High Court, who did not wish to be quoted, said that the matter is open for discussion and the decision is yet to be made in this regard.In a meeting held on April 28, a committee of four judges of the high court, headed by Justice Hima Kohli, officials from public works department (PWD) informed that if an infected person entered the area having central air-conditioning, there was a likelihood that the virus, exhaled by them, may remain airborne and may, in turn, infect others.The committee was told that even if the court installed ultra violet germicide irradiation devices, it could not completely reduce chances of infection.They also said that even the Supreme Court had switched off its centralised air conditioning system.They suggested that the court procure sufficient quantity of pedestal or wall fans and to install them at appropriate places in all the blocks.“Since the windows and doors of court building may be required to be left open for proper circulation of air during the working hours, PWD shall ensure that all such windows have proper net/mesh so that no insects/mosquitoes etc. enter inside the court building,” the committee said while also directing the PWD to conduct a survey and submit a proposal regarding the required quantity of all such types of fans in every block.The committee was also informed that one sanitisation machine, which takes body temperature and also dispenses sanitiser liquid, is likely to be received. “Committee also resolves that besides the two handitrons already ordered…,two cart-type moveable devices, stated to be of around ₹4.5 lakh each, be procured. These, as per PWD, would he very handy for disinfecting the files, books, walls and other surfaces. PWD shall procure these devices subject to fulfillment of formalities and shall take steps for obtaining administrative approval and expenditure sanction at the earliest,” the minutes of the meeting read.It also directed the Registrar General to get in touch with the Director General of Health Services and Chief Medical Officer and to apprise this Committee about the possibility of conducting of pool-testing for COVID-19 for staff and visitors of the courts.The committee also said that every District & Sessions Judge, in coordination with the local Bar, would create facility for video conferencing in their respective District or court complex, if not already in place. This would cater to those advocates and litigants whose matters have been listed for hearing but who are not in a position to handle video conferencing from their respective homes or offices.The committee also resolved that all those advocates, who visit this court or courts subordinate to it for ‘video-conferencing hearing’ need not wear coats, bands and ties. However, they shall adhere to the remaining dress code as prescribed under Advocates Act, 1961. Similarly, wearing of coats and ties is dispensed with for Registry officials of this court till further orders.On April 24, a plea was filed by advocate KC Mittal, chairman of Bar Council of Delhi, seeking alternate arrangement plea which had sought an alternative arrangement for the use of centrally air conditioned buildings in the national capital in wake of the corona epidemic. He had also sought arrangements in the court so that the virus does not spread further and further the regular work is also not hampered.Following this, the Centre has filed its reply highlighting the detailed guidelines issued by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) in accordance with the report of ISHRAE, which has worked on the issue of centrally air conditioning alternatives to stop the spread of corona. The matter would be heard on May 1 where the HC report would also be taken into consideration.The HC committee also said that since the lockdown has been made effective in the courts, no hearings had taken place in the Family Courts and hence hearing should start in these courts through video conferencing. It said that cases, in which arguments have already been heard and the order/ judgment has been reserved, shall be given priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/high-court-may-turn-to-fans-in-effort-to-control-covid-19-spread/story-aqZvMaEv86lDmBAWaqjVgK.html

30-04-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Punjab CM orders village-level quarantine of returnees||Amid grave concerns expressed by various deputy commissioners (DCs) over several Covid-19-infected persons coming in from outside the state in recent days, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday ordered village-level quarantine in designated buildings, while issuing strict instructions for compulsory institutional quarantine of all those coming from other states.During a video conference with DCs and police chiefs of all districts, he made it clear that no one coming from outside should be allowed to go home without completing the 21-day quarantine period. “Where possible, those found positive and negative should be segregated in different buildings altogether,” he suggested.The CM directed the officials to work with sarpanches to identify schools and other buildings for quarantine purpose in villages. He also appealed to sarpanches and panchayats to increase village-level surveillance to check further spread of the disease. As many as 3,525 pilgrims from Nanded (Maharashtra), and 153 students from Kota (Rajasthan) returned to Punjab in the past four days, in addition to 3,085 labourers received at the Fazilka-Rajasthan border.Of those who had returned from Nanded, test reports had been received for 577 persons, of whom 20% were found positive. Of the 105 fresh cases reported in the state on Thursday, 98 are from outside.Ruling out any relaxation at the state borders, which continue to remain strictly sealed, Amarinder said there was no question of allowing any buses to enter Punjab without permit/approval from the respective states which are sending vehicles to pick up their people. He directed the officers to ensure strict enforcement of the sealing at the borders.The Ludhiana DC called for permission to industries not located in focal points and industrial estates to also open up, in designated areas as per the master plan. The CM agreed, pointing out that with 95% of the state’s industry in Ludhiana, it was important for them to start operating in order to revive the economy of Punjab.Describing the prevailing situation as unprecedented, of the kind he had not seen even in the 1965 and 1971 wars, Amarinder warned that the problem was likely to get aggravated in the coming days, going by the global trends of the spread of the disease. India had been fortunate to keep the cases under control so far, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cm-orders-village-level-quarantine-of-returnees/story-GCf55aqfKOX8pZSOZLsSgP.html

30-04-2020||City||Cotton sowing starts, Punjab plans to increase area by 37%||Amid covid-19 outbreak, the state agriculture department has set a new target to bring 5.5 lakh hectare under cotton cultivation, almost 37% more than last year’s 4 lakh hectare. Sowing in South Malwa districts, the cotton belt of the state, started this week, with a delay of seven days and it is expected to peak from the next week. Wheat crop has been bumper and is at the last leg of harvesting. Canal water in key districts of Bathinda, Mansa and Muktsar was released on April 27. Fazilka chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said, “Cleaning of minor canals of Malooka and Arniwala is being done and water will in these channels is expected to be reached by Saturday. Cotton has been sown in about 500 hectares and the estimated area of 1.25 lakh will be covered by May 20,” he said. A progressive cotton grower from Bathinda’s Bajak village Baldev Singh said the farming community hoped for support from state agencies for easy availability of seeds and canal water supply during the lockdown. “As the state is boosting crop diversification, the agencies should also ensure that farmers will get a fair price for their cotton produce,” he said.State agriculture director Sutantar Kumar Airi told HT that cotton sowing in Punjab will complete by May 20. The state authorities have coordinated to arrange 27 lakh packets of cotton for the targeted 5.5 lakh hectare land.“Earlier, the department had set a target to cover 5 lakh hectare under cotton but now we are trying to make it to 5.5 lakh in the state. Our teams have been motivating farmers for the last several months to shift from paddy to cotton,” said Airi. In Bathinda, the cotton area will be stepped up from 1.40 lakh hectare in 2019 to 2 lakh hectare. In Fazilka, the department has planned to increase procurement from 92,000 hectare to 1.25 lakh hectare this year, said Airi. In Mansa, the department has aimed to increase the area by 1 lakh hectare, an increase of 20,000 hectare. Muktsar is expected to see an increase from 72,000 hectare to 1.05 lakh hectare.The official said the department planned to more than double the area under cotton cultivation in Barnala, Sangrur, Faridkot and Moga from the previous season of 4,000, 10,000, 3,000 and 122 hectares, respectively. “Time of sowing cotton is suitable till May 31 and farmers need not worry. Delay in sowing is insignificant as it happened due to prolonged picking of bumper cotton last year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cotton-sowing-starts-punjab-plans-to-increase-area-by-37/story-QBC2ySku3Msj4Ecw4ztPZK.html
30-04-2020||City||Covid crept up on ‘healthy’ Nanded-returnees in Mohali||A 2,200-km bus ride filled with hope and optimism ended in despair for many pilgrims from Takht Hazur Sahib, Nanded, Maharashtra, two days after they reached Mohali. We had full faith in almighty and never thought we would catch the infection, they said, after 15 of them tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), bringing to the fore the risks and dangers of transporting people in such situations.In the past two days, 57 pilgrims have arrived in Mohali, out of which 60% are women. Most of these are from villages including Premgarh near Aerocity, Manakmajra, Amrala, Badana, Raipur Khurd and Sainimajra. All 15 who tested positive have been kept at the Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur for 14 days. The district case tally now stands at 84.Speaking to HT, a 58-year-old man from Premgarh, who tested positive, said, “Seventeen members of our family, including those from other villages, had also accompanied us on the religious tour, and 13 of them have tested positive. We had no symptoms as all of us were hale and hearty. I have yet to believe that I am a Covid patient and could have passed on the infection to others in the bus.”Another among the patients, a 55-year-old woman from Amrala village in Dera Bassi, said, “We left for Hazur Sahib on March 18 and were happy to visit the holy shrine. Stranded in Maharashtra due to the nationwide lockdown, we had no problem at all, but coming all the way to Mohali and being told that we have been infected has shattered us. I was excited to meet my family members, but now again I have to stay away from them for 14 days.”A 54-year-old patient from Premgarh said, “Not even a single person in the bus had any health problem, not even a mild headache. We travelled for more than 2,200km, all fine, but fail to understand how reports have come out positive. There must be something wrong with the reports.”Meanwhile, Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said, “Most of the patients tested positive are asymptomatic and all are responding well to the treatment. We have to quarantine them to stop further spread of the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-crept-up-on-healthy-nanded-returnees-in-mohali/story-0FX6FSeejUMdSISEuDhUJM.html
30-04-2020||Chandigarh||Stubble burning a new worry in Punjab, 28 cases reported in two days||With 28 cases of wheat stubble burning reported over Wednesday and Thursday, a first for this season, the state government has warned farmers of strict action if they continued doing so. The pollution due to stubble burning will impact lungs of residents, already a concern, as covid-19 also attacks the same body organ. The Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PSRC) that monitors stubble fires said six cases were reported on Thursday, with 22 on Wednesday (April 29). In 2018 and 2019, the number of cases on April 29 was 307 and 58, respectively. According to data that Punjab Pollution Control Board has released, six cases were reported in Bathinda, four in Kapurthala, two each in Mansa and Muktsar, and one each in Barnala, Faridkot, Ferozpur, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, and Moga on Wednesday. The location for Thursday’s cases had been released yet. “As you all know, we are in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic which attacks our lungs and could even lead to death. Smoke erupting from the farms on burning of stubble negatively impacts lungs, so let us decide to completely refrain from burning stubble this season,” said Punjab agriculture secretary Kahan Singh Pannu, in an appeal to farmers. He added farmers who defied the law would be proceeded against under Section 144 of the CrPC. Officials added cases of stubble burning are likely to increase in May, as procurement has been delayed by 15 days. “We fear the number of cases will pick up in May,” said Krunesh Garg, member secretary PPCB, adding that despite staff crunch surveillance has been increased. “Rabi season is comparatively cooler than the kharif for stubble burning, however, this time due to late wheat harvest and the shortened window for making nursery for paddy transplantation, there are concerns,” said PRSC director, Brijendra Pateria.Satnam Singh Pannu, president of a Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) faction said, “The government has to provide us an incentive of Rs 100 per quintal for not burning stubble.” PROCUREMENT CROSSES HALFWAY MARK With wheat arrivals touching 75 lakh tonne, almost half of the 135 lakh tonne expected to arrive has reached 4,100 mandis of the state. Of this, 73.1 lakh tonne has been purchased. Last year, the arrivals had crossed 80 lakh tonne on the corresponding day. “We are satisfied. At this rate, we hope to wind up the entire operation within ten days,” said director, food and civil supplies, Punjab, Anindita Mitra. She added procurement had almost ended in Ferozpur, Patiala, Khanna, Fatehgarh Sahib and Mohali districts. The Centre has relaxed procurement norms for shrivelling and lustre loss, but with value cut. For shrivelling, the norm has been stretched up to 16% from previous 6%, but with a value cut on MSP per quintal of between Rs 4.81 and Rs 24.06, depending on the actual extent of shriveling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stubble-burning-a-new-worry-28-cases-reported-in-two-days/story-kVfIHN7T0nd9TiLwgpikAK.html

30-04-2020||Chandigarh||Bains writes to cooperation minister, accuses Verka of looting dairy farmers, public||Accusing the Verka milk plant authorities of looting dairy farmers and general public on purchase and sale of milk, Lok Insaaf Party chief-cum- MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains on Thursday wrote a letter to Punjab cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa demanding an inquiry into the same.In the letter addressed to Randhawa, Bains alleged that Verka authorities have reduced the rate on which the plant purchases milk from the farmers by Rs 6. However, the plant is still selling the milk on same rates to the public. This way the plant management is looting around Rs 2 crore on daily basis, he stated in the letter.Bains alleged that before the lockdown, Verka used to purchase milk (4.50% fat) at Rs 36 per litre, but after the lockdown the rate has been reduced to Rs 30. “The dairy farming sector is already reeling under losses amid lockdown and the plant management has further increased their problems by reducing the price of purchasing the milk,” he said.Demanding that the state government should mark an inquiry in the matter, Bains said that the plant management should either increase the rates on which the milk is purchased or it should reduce the price of milk which is sold to the common man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bains-writes-to-cooperation-minister-accuses-verka-of-looting-dairy-farmers-public/story-c51BbdRxiGoRlAO6vtmFXI.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Vegetables may get costlier as sealing of borders chokes supply||Delhi’s wholesale markets are dealing with a gradual disruption in the supply of fruits and vegetables, which is set to send retail prices soaring, as neighbouring states have sealed borders with the Capital.Even as the nation heads towards possible conditional and phased relaxation of lockdown curbs after May 3, Haryana’s Faridabad sealed its borders on Wednesday while Gurugram will close up from Friday morning. Uttar Pradesh’s Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad had sealed their borders last week.According to the data shared by the agriculture produce market committee (APMC), the three major markets in Delhi — Azadpur, Ghazipur and Okhla — have recorded a 25-40% drop in fresh stocks of fruits and vegetables, including bottle gourd, ridged gourd, brinjal, okra, coriander leaves, cucumber, musk melon and water melon, at a point that is considered the start of the season.As many as 15 traders in Delhi’s Azadpur market test Covid-19 positive on Thursday and 43 contacts have been quarantined. Test results of over 100 persons associated with the market are awaited, while over 500 have been screened. Two medical teams have been deployed to round-the-clock monitoring.The market has around 2,800 registered traders and around 12,000 individuals are engaged in various roles, such as accountants, porters, daily wage labourers engaged in loading and unloading of goods, etc. The Azadpur market is Delhi’s lifeline for fruit and vegetable supply.Many traders have shut shop, demanding that the market be spread across 100-odd acres and shifted in parts to other locations. The current area should be sealed, as supply to the market has dipped.Adil Khan, the chairperson of the Azadpur APMC, said that on Wednesday, the market received 5,000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables, a fall from the 7,500 tonnes, which is the average during the lockdown. Supply improved slightly on Thursday, as the movement of essential vehicles was allowed across borders, with the market having received 6,000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables.“At the wholesale level, we are taking all possible measures to ensure that prices of fruits and vegetables do not shoot up. Other than that, the market is being sanitised more frequently now, every few hours,” Khan said.Anil Malhotra, elected member of the committee that regulates the Azadpur market said that such fluctuation in arrivals within such a short span hardly depicts any improvement in supply. “The crisis is visible as more than 200 traders have refused to open their shops. People are scared,” he said.In regular times, at least 3,300 trucks supply at the Azadpur market every day, while the other two major agriculture produce markets in the city, at Ghazipur and Okhla, receive around 400 and 200 trucks a day, respectively, APMC office-bearers said.The Ghazipur market, according to data shared by APMC officials, has witnessed around a 25% dip in supply over the last three days, compared to the lockdown average.Haji Yamin, a trader at Okhla agriculture market, which majorly caters to south and southeast Delhi areas, said that most of the vegetables at the wholesale market are supplied from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, but with the sealing of the Haryana border at Badarpur, supply has taken a hit.He said that usually, around 200 trucks and small vehicles ferrying fruits and vegetables visit the market, but this has dipped by 35-40% after the sealing. This will eventually hit the retail supply and prices are likely to go up soon, he said. “Seasonal vegetables and fruits, such as bottle gourd, ridged gourd, brinjal, okra, coriander leaves, cucumber, and fruits, such as musk melon and water melon come to the Okhla wholesale market from neighbouring towns in Haryana, via the Faridabad border. On an average, the market witnessed the arrival of around 1,500-1,800 tonnes of vegetable and fruits per day earlier this week,” Yamin said.Another trader at the Okhla market, Qutumsher Ali, said that at present, green vegetables are being supplied only from neighbouring towns of Noida, Jewar, Hathras and Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, besides local farmers cultivating on the Yamuna floodplains and bordering villages. “Even the supply of potato, water melon and musk melon from Agra and Mathura via Faridabad border is also affected. If the situation continues, the wholesale prices of vegetables may witness a hike,” Ali said.The ripple effects of a broken supply chain are already visible at retail vegetable and fruit markets. Traders at Mehrauli vegetable market said that the supply of seasonal vegetables was already hit due to lockdown and the sealing of borders has made things worse.Prakash Singh, a vegetable trader at Mehrauli market, said that vegetable supply to south Delhi markets is majorly from the Okhla market. “Vegetables and fruits coming from UP and Haryana via Faridabad border are not reaching the market. So, traders of small-scale markets are not able to get proper supply. If this continues, vegetables and fruits are set to get dearer,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-vegetables-may-get-costlier-as-sealing-of-borders-chokes-supply/story-808jjC5JKaEmTNHjERw8SP.html
30-04-2020||Lucknow||UP preps to evacuate lakh of migrants from Gujarat, U’khand and Rajasthan||The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday said it will launch a massive evacuation drive to bring back migrant workers from Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan in the next few days even as those from Madhya Pradesh have started to arrive.Students of UP, enrolled in educational institutions or coaching centres in Delhi, Noida and Aligarh, who wish to return home will be transported by Uttar Pradesh roadways buses to their respective home districts.Addressing a press conference, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed senior officers to prepare a plan to evacuate migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan who have been stranded due to the lockdown.The state government has received guidelines from the Centre on the transportation of migrants, he said. The arrival of migrants from Madhya Pradesh started on Thursday. One hundred buses of Madhya Pradesh government are bringing 3,000 migrants to UP and in turn the UP government is sending migrants of MP in 40 UPSRTC buses.The UP government plans to bring back 10 lakh migrants from various states, Awasthi said.“The state government has already transported three lakh migrants from the Delhi border, over 12,000 migrants from Haryana and evacuated 10,500 students from Kota in Rajasthan and sent home 15,000 students from Prayagraj to various districts,” he said.“The Chief Minister has expressed concern over the migrants wayfaring or riding bicycles to reach home in UP. He called upon the migrants to have patience and wait for a few days as the state government was committed to bring them back home. Those walking home might face problems as the border is sealed and police personnel have been directed not to permit entry of people from other states,” Awasthi said.The migrants have to report to quarantine centres in the districts they are staying, get themselves registered and the officers managing the centres will prepare a list and conduct their medical tests.The chief secretary and home department is in regular touch with officers of other states to bring back the migrants. Students of other states in UP will also be sent to their respective states, Awasthi said.All migrants will be brought to UP after screening and medical tests.The UP government has established quarantine centres across the state to house seven lakh migrants and the chief minister has directed officers to increase the centres’ capacity for 10 lakh.The UP government is also collecting details of migrant workers -- name, address, mobile numbers, Aadhaar number etc -- to prepare a database of such workers who migrate to other states in search of employment, he said.After completing 14 days in quarantine centres, the workers will be sent home and will have to undergo another 14-day home quarantine.The district magistrates of all districts have been directed to hand over a food-kit to the migrants when they leave the centre for home after completing 14 days quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-preps-to-evacuate-lakh-of-migrants-from-gujarat-u-khand-and-rajasthan/story-YHZfx8rqgL4RUzLpAQFl0J.html
30-04-2020||City||Pilgrims were screened regularly, says Takht Hazur Sahib management||The Takht Hazur Sahib Management Board and the management of another gurdwara in Nanded, Maharashtra, from where pilgrims have returned to Punjab have said that they had ensured that the pilgrims stayed safe, and followed all mandates of social distancing, as long as they stayed in their accommodation. With some of these pilgrims testing positive for covid-19, adverse and negative remarks have been made, on social media, against the pilgrims and these holy places. Takht Hazur Sahib is one of the five Sikh temporal seats. Calling such remarks unfortunate, Takht Hazur Sahib Management Board president Bhupinder Singh Minhas told HT over phone, “We followed all guidelines of the government to prevent the spread of covid-19. We adjusted 332 persons in 200 rooms of our serais. We did not allow them to come out of the room. Even for partaking of langar, we allowed them to move out only in groups of 20, with social distancing. We also had their general medical checkup conducted twice.”He added, “Linking the spread of the virus to the holy gurdwara is not fair. Had the governments evacuated these pilgrims faster, such a scenario will not have arisen. Neither pilgrims nor gurdwaras are responsible. This issue should not be given a communal angle.”Baba Balwinder Singh Kar Sewa Wale, who manages Gurdwara Langar Sahib in Nanded, said, “We got all pilgrims screened thrice. Before leaving for Punjab, all were screened and found fit. We don’t know what happened on the way back that caused infection.” Most pilgrims were staying at the serai of this historic gurdwara, in the vicinity of the Takht Hazur Sahib. “The sangat wanted to return, but had no option. It took one-and-a-half month for the governments to approve their going home,” Baba Balwinder added.Quarantine Nanded pilgrims in gurdwara serais, instead of deras: Longowal to govt After some groups of pilgrims returning from Nanded were quarantined in area-level Dera Radha Soami congregation centres in Majha, the Shiromani Gurdwara ParbandhakCommittee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal on Thursday urged the Punjab government to quarantine them in serais of gurdwaras instead of deras. “The SGPC is with the administration and no need will be left unfulfilled. The administration has quarantined Nanded-returnees at gurdwaras of Patiala, Mukatsar, Sangrur and Sultanpur Lodhi. It should do it at other places as well,” Longowal added. “Efforts to bring back pilgrims, who were stranded at Nanded, due to the lockdown, are welcome. It is unfortunate that some people are making negative comments on pilgrims, which makes them feel alienated,” the SGPC chief added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pilgrims-were-screened-regularly-says-takht-hazur-sahib-management/story-MZ7O36Nx6dH13DWj1KOXKM.html

The officials said that they recovered about 135 cartons of liquor along with two SUVs, a car and a truck from the possession of the suspects.Liquor shops have been banned during the country-wide lockdown in force to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease Covid-19.The suspects were identified as Muzaffarnagar constable Rohit Baisla and his other five accomplices – Narendra Yadav, SatishYadav, Mukesh Ahirwar, Rajkumar Sareen and Saleem. They added that mastermind, Har Vir, is yet to be arrested.“The constable is currently on duty in Ghaziabad. We got information that some vehicles were carrying smuggled liquor and we raided a godown in Kavi Nagar area from where about 135 cartons of liquor was seized. The constable is believed to have planned and executed the smuggling. He would sit inside the cars in uniform so that vehicles could easily pass police checkpoints,” said Avnish Kumar, circle officer (CO – city 2)The cops seized a Jeep Compass, a Tata Safari, a Swift and a truck from the possession of the suspects.“Our teams are trying to track Har Vir who is absconding. Once he gets arrested he would be able to tell from where the liquor was procured and where it was to be supplied during the lockdown. Investigation is on in the case,” CO added.The suspects were booked in an FIR which was lodged under the provisions of the Excise Act and the Disaster Management Act at Kavi Nagar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-cop-among-six-held-for-liquor-smuggling/story-QJuu0ER6dc1W9E9K3E0heK.html
30-04-2020||Noida||24-year-old woman kills herself in Noida’s Phase 2||A 24-year-old woman allegedly killed herself at her house on Sunday in an area that comes under the Phase 2 police jurisdiction. The police said her body was found Monday morning and no note was recovered from the spot.The incident was reported from a village where the woman lived with her husband and younger sister, 20, in a rented house. According to police officers, the family is from Bareilly and the husband had gone there before the lockdown and was unable to come back to Noida.The sisters, who earlier worked for a private company nearby, were stuck at home in Noida due to the lockdown.“The two sisters were sleeping on the terrace on Sunday night. When the younger sister woke up in the morning and came downstairs, she found the woman hanging from a fan in a room. The sister immediately called the police helpline,” said Farmood Ali Pundir, station house officer, Phase 2 police station.The police said a team was rushed to the spot and the woman’s body was sent for an autopsy. “The reason behind the suicide remains unclear. Even the sister could not think of anything that was troubling the woman. She said that there was no history of any mental health disorder and that everything seemed fine. The autopsy report will ascertain the cause of death,” said the SHO.However, police officers said the family is economically weaker, and three had lost their factory jobs amid the lockdown. The financial hardships and the husband’s absence may have led the woman to take the extreme step, though the reason behind the extreme step will be clear only after a thorough investigation, they added.The woman’s family has been informed about the incident and her body will be handed over to the family after the autopsy. No criminal complaint has been filed in the case so far, police said.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/24-year-old-woman-kills-herself-in-noida-s-phase-2/story-iUWOf9GdwP1lvVuXv6HimM.html
30-04-2020||Chandigarh||Amarinder wants Centre to arrange special trains to send back migrants||After the Centre allowed the return of stranded migrants and others to home states, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to arrange for point-to-point special trains to send them back.The chief minister’s request to the Prime Minister is significant as the state has over 10 lakh migrant labourers, mostly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, with 7 lakh in the Industrial hub of Ludhiana alone. A majority of them have been without any work or income from the time the Punjab government imposed curfew on March 23 to check the Covid-19 spread, bringing all economic activities to a half.Amarinder, in his letter to PM, said estimates indicated that nearly one million workers would need transport to go back to their states and the only feasible option in the circumstances was to arrange special trains. “Given the large number of workers stuck due to the lockdown, use of buses for their transportation will not work,” the CM wrote to the PM, citing the Union home ministry’s instructions of April 29 regarding the movement of migrant workers, pilgrims, tourist and other persons.If these figures on migrant workers longing to return home are correct, the exodus will not only be a serious setback for the state’s efforts to restart industrial units, which have been lying shut for over one month, but also add to the worries of farmers who are preparing their paddy sowing after harvesting wheat under the shadow of Covid-19. Of the 2.52 lakh registered industrial units in the state, only 3,600, or say 1.4%, have started operations will lower capacities despite repeated appeals and assurances of the state government.Industries director C Sibin said factories were already facing a shortage of labour due to Covid-19-related fear psychosis and their return to their home states would further aggravate the problem. “There is no clarity on when they will return to work,” he said.Similarly, the farmers are also headed for a tough time in the upcoming paddy transplantation starting from June 20. Owing to curfew, many labourers have not come back after Holi festival, and those who are here are planning to leave. As per the estimates of the state agriculture department, 12.5 lakh labourers are required to transplant paddy over 75 lakh acres in 30 days. “The upcoming situation is worrying, but we still have 50 days for transplantation. We have started efforts to deal with the situation,” said agriculture secretary KS Pannu. Amarinder, who also had a video conference with the district chief of civil administration and police, directed all deputy commissioners to prepare state-wise data of migrant labourers to coordinate their movement. “Though data is still being collated, approximately 70% of them hail from Bihar. The movement of such large numbers is possible only through trains, with proper screening to be done at the time of departure,” he said.The CM said a large number of migrant workers who had come from Bihar, UP, and Jharkhand intended to return to their respective states because most of them either lost their jobs or could not find work due to curfew.Also, a decision has been taken to assign one officer to each state to coordinate their return. In response to concerns expressed over shortage of food packets in some districts, Amarinder directed the food department to increase the quota of rations to be distributed to migrants and non-smart card holders.MIGRANTS’ JOURNEY TO START FROM MAY 5The Punjab government on Thursday said the outward movement of stranded persons in Punjab will start from May 5.The state government has issued standard operating procedures for outward movement of those stranded in the state. “As per the SOPs, within 48 hours of receipt of this letter each DC shall get filled pro forma from each willing person who wants to go out,” according to an official spokesperson. The pro forma is available online.He said once a person has filed the pro forma on link for his family/group, he/she will be given a system generated unique ID for the full family/group. By 9am of May 3, all the districts should get complete information filled online by all the interested persons.The spokesperson said access to backend of the link will be provided to all DCs by Dr Sumit Jarangal, member, state COVID control room in a couple of days. “When the process of data collection is on, the DCs should simultaneously prepare for setting up an adequate number of health check-up camps to cater to such persons who are desirous of moving out. The screening should be completed by May 4 night at all cost,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amarinder-wants-centre-to-arrange-special-trains-to-send-back-migrants/story-An5MD9gCwM2urH2LDf5W5K.html
30-04-2020||Noida||UP govt asks officials to prepare plan to take migrant workers home||The Uttar Pradesh government has directed the Gautam Budh Nagar officials to chalk out a plan to ferry migrant workers to their respective home towns. The move comes after the government realised that in spite the restrictions in place on account of the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19, many migrant workers are walking to their villages, thereby putting theirs and their family’s lives at risk. The Gautam Budh Nagar administration and police are chalking out a strategy to take them home. The UP government has been told to follow instructions from the ministry of home affairs about transporting migrant workers, who want to return home as they are jobless and are facing uncertain future.“Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath is concerned about the welfare of migrant workers, who are either in Noida or other cities of the state. As we have received the guidelines from the ministry of home affairs, the officials in Lucknow and all districts have been tasked to chalk out a strategy to take migrants home while following social distancing rules,” Satish Mahana, industries minister, Uttar Pradesh, said. He said all top officials including district magistrates, police brass and senior officials, who are in charge of districts are preparing the data on migrant workers.“All migrant labourers will be kept in 14-day quarantine before being send to their homes. Our government has developed adequate quarantine facilities in all districts so that they are kept in isolation. There will be adequate provision of food, maintenance of hygiene and adequate beds in these centres,” Mahana said. In Noida, there are at least 1.5 lakh migrant workers and in Greater Noida there are at least 70,000 migrant labourers, who are being sustained by government’s bodies, including the Noida authority, Greater Noida authority, police and the administration. The police and the district administration officials need to make a list of who all will go home in the first phase. “Those who want to go home should arrange their own transport facilities as many are ready to walk back to their villages,” a police officer, requesting anonymity, said. The Greater Noida authority chief executive officer Narendra Bhooshan, who is nodal officer from the UP government to look after migrant workers from the state who are stuck in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, said in the first phase, the state wants students to be transported to their home towns.“The UP government has written to all state governments, where workers are stuck to know the exact number of such people. Once we get the list, we will coordinate and provide them help. We hope to get the list as soon as possible,” Bhooshan said. The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration, meanwhile, is busy on data collection of students and other workers.“We are doing the job of data collection on migrant workers and students, who may want to go home. As soon as we get the state government’s specific guidelines on this, we will do the needful. We will soon be ready with data on this,” Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.Many migrant workers are seeking the help of others to understand when they will get buses or cabs to reach their homes.“We are jobless for the last one and half months. We are not getting regular food for our families living at a Sector 135 construction site. We stare at uncertainty because we are not sure what will happen to us. We want to go home to our village in Chhatarpur, Madhya Pradesh. If the government will not help, then we will start walking home,” Kamta Anuragi, a woman construction worker, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-govt-asks-officials-to-prepare-plan-to-take-migrant-workers-home/story-wzTgr8iGdzYTsGglU1W2PP.html
30-04-2020||Noida||Nine-month pregnant woman found positive for Covid-19; admitted to GIMS||A nine-month pregnant woman has been found positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Gautam Budh Nagar. The 27-year-old patient is from the Cleo County Society in Sector 121 of Noida and was admitted at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences(GIMS) in Greater Noida on late Wednesday night.The husband of the patient on Thursday morning tweeted that his pregnant wife is facing problems at the GIMS, because of common toilets and the presence of other male patients in the ward. The MLA of Jewar Dhirendra Singh took note of the tweet and contacted the director of GIMS to ensure that the woman doesn’t face any problems. After this intervention by Singh, the woman was shifted to another ward meant for female Covid-19 patients. “She was admitted to the hospital on late Wednesday night, and after keeping her in the observation, she was shifted to the women’s ward. So far as toilets are concerned, there is no issue. Currently, there are four Covid-19 patients and five toilets are available. They are separate for men and women. She must have entered the wrong toilet by mistake,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS.“I had spoken to the director to ensure that the pregnant woman doesn’t face any problem. He assured that she will be taken care of,” said Dhirendra Singh, MLA, Jewar. The sample of the husband has also been taken for testing.According to the senior health officials, the woman was admitted to GIMS as the hospital has appropriate facilities to tackle Covid-related pregnancy cases. On April 20, a 33-year-old Covid-19 positive woman from the Tech Zone-4 area of Greater Noida gave birth to a baby boy at GIMS, Greater Noida. The woman’s husband was a doctor with Jaypee hospital and officials think that he must have been the carrier.On Thursday, district administration also faced criticism after an ambulance dropped off a middle-aged man Rajender Kumar on the roads near the community health centre in Dadri after getting discharged from GIMS.According to the chief medical officer(CMO) of GB Nagar, Kumar was admitted at GIMS on April 20 as a Covid-19 suspect. He was also a tuberculosis patient. His reports came negative for Covid-19 and he was discharged on Thursday. “He was allegedly dropped off by an ambulance in Dadri, where he was found alongside the road. As soon as the local health officials and police came to know about the man, he was again admitted at GIMS,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, CMO.Officials have said that they are not aware of the ambulance which dropped off the man on the Dadri road. “We are trying to ascertain the details of the ambulance responsible for this insensitive action. The district magistrate has ordered an enquiry by an additional district magistrate in the matter and has directed to take strict action against the ambulance personnel and other officials responsible for such an irresponsible action,” added Ohri in his statement.The GIMS director said, “The person has been readmitted but not in the Covid-19 ward as he is negative. He is a TB patient. We are not sure if the ambulance was of GIMS or a private one. We are trying to identify the ambulance in question,” said Gupta.By Thursday night, the health department had notified 2,161 travellers. Officials have collected a total of 3,592 samples. A total of 145 cases have been reported positive by late Thursday night . Seven new cases included the pregnant woman and two more persons from the JJ Colony of Sector 8 in Noida. Details of other patients are not available.88 patients have been discharged.Presently, there are 56 active Covid-19 cases in the district. Around 736 persons are under institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/nine-month-pregnant-woman-found-positive-for-covid-19-admitted-to-gims/story-qtBFLwrsRNrvCnjwSsnpQJ.html

30-04-2020||City||Vaishali and Indirapuram emerge as hot spots in Ghaziabad; residents, officials concerned||Vaishali and Indirapuram have emerged as two biggest Covid-19 hot spots in the city, with a majority of cases in these areas contracted in hospitals or health care centres, despite the district administration taking steps to restrict movement between Ghaziabad and Delhi. This has led to demands from residents that the administration take urgent steps to minimise the spread of the contagious disease to and from patients and health care workers, in Ghaziabad as well as the national capital.According to officials of the health department, Vaishali has so far recorded eight Covid-19 cases, which are ‘medically-acquired infections’, that were transmitted to non-Covid patients or health care staff at health centres or hospitals. Apart from hospitals in Ghaziabad, several of these patients visit hospitals in Meerut or Delhi for treatment.According to officials, Vaishali has six epicentres and only one of them, Sector 6, has been categorised a ‘green zone’, after no further positive case was reported in the area over the past 28 days. Two cases surfaced in the area on Wednesday, and the patients were admitted to ESI Hospital and Meerut Medical College for treatment.According to official statistics of the health department, the epicentre areas in Vaishali are parts of Sector 6 (now categorised as green zone), one area in Sector 1, three areas in Sector 5 and one area in Neelpadam Kunj.Indirapuram has six epicentres as well and two of them — Shipra Sun City and Gyan Khand 1 — have been moved to the orange zone, after no cases emerged in the past 14 days. The others are still categorised as red zones and are in parts of Niho Scottish Garden, ATS Advantage, Exotica Elegance and Express Garden.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey told HT that he has sought a report from the health department nodal officer sent to Ghaziabad by the Uttar Pradesh government.“I have sought his response over the issue of medically acquired infections. RWAs and residents should also send us a list of health care persons who reside their high-rises,” Pandey said.“A majority of the cases in Vaishali are due to medically acquired infections and the district administration should intervene so that such contamination is curbed. Recently, we issued an advisory in our high-rise asking health care workers to use of separate lifts, as they come from work from hospitals and other facilities. But there was a lot of opposition to this,” said Arun Singh, general secretary of Express Green in Vaishali Sector 1.“We are taking up sanitisation on our own and have hired plumbers and technicians so that no person has to come into the society from outside. Lifts are also used alternatively and even timing for services like door-to-door garbage collection and supply of vegetables, etc, have been fixed. No outsiders are allowed in and vehicles that travel out are properly sanitised when they come back in,” he added.The administration had previously sealed the city’s borders with Delhi and restricted the movement of commuters, in the wake of an increasing number of medically acquired infections after residents travelled to Delhi.However, officials have expressed concern over the uptick in cases despite the curbs.“Vaishali and Indirapuram are major causes of concern, besides the increasing number of cases coming from nearby Khoda, which is a densely populated area. A majority of the cases that have surfaced are due to medically acquired infections, as several residents visit local hospitals, as well as health care facilities in east Delhi on a regular basis. Conversely, several health care workers also live in Ghaziabad,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).“We are working on a plan to deal with such hot spots, and will speak to the district administration about measures that can be taken to check the number of medically acquired infections. Since there are new cases emerging in these areas regularly, Vaishali and Indirapuram will take time to move out of the hot spot,” he added.Officials said government doctors and staff in Ghaziabad, dealing with Covid-19 cases, will remain in active quarantine for 14 days and move to hotels/hostels, and other lodgings, after finishing their daily duties. Once the first team completes 14 days at work, they will move to passive quarantine. At this point, a second team will take over to attend patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-cases-from-health-care-centres-rise-residents-of-2-ghaziabad-hot-spots-ask-admin-to-restrict-movement-from-delhi/story-8pXerMxhVJpxdvdCebhASM.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||Police ask Tablighi Jamaat head Maulana Saad to submit copy of Covid test report||The crime branch of Delhi Police — which is probing allegations of negligence by Tablighi Jamaat members that led Nizamuddin area to turn into a Covid-19 hotspot — has sent a notice to the religious sect’s head, Maulana Saad Kandhalvi, seeking a copy of his medical records where he tested negative for Covid-19. The area around Nizamuddin Basti in south east Delhi continues to remain a Covid-19 containment zone.Maulana Saad has not joined the probe after an FIR was registered against him by the Delhi police for organising a religious gathering in March this year despite restrictions to combat the coronavirus spread.Senior Delhi Police officers, authorised to speak to the media, did not comment on the investigation. But crime branch officers, on condition of anonymity, said that Saad has been asked to submit a copy of medical tests from two different hospitals, showing he had tested negative for Covid-19. In the same notice, police have also asked Saad to get the test done from a government approved facility. Maulana Saad, head of Tablighi Jamaat religious sect, had gone into self quarantine after a massive evacuation drive of his followers from inside the sect’s headquarters in Nizamuddin Basti by health department and police between March 29 and March 31 . While hundreds of Tablighi Jamaat members, who showed symptoms of Covid-19, were removed and taken to different quarantine centres in Delhi, the Maulana had left the building before the evacuation. His lawyers had then said that the Maulana was in home quarantine.An investigating officer, who did not wish to be named, said, police are building a case against Saad, and he might be arrested soon. “We have already seized the documents related to the congregation at the Markaz, which led to the spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases. We have also taken the statements of the crucial important documents linked to the case, “ the officer said. HT has learnt from many mid-level police officers that Saad is in Delhi and police teams are keeping a watch on him. “The investigating officers are gradually closing in on him. There is strong evidence against him on how he flouted regulations and did not ensure social distancing norms inside the Markaz,” the official said. The official added that the investigating officer in the case is yet to get a nod from their superiors to summon Saad and question him. “Maybe our seniors are waiting for members of Tablighi Jammat to be discharged from quarantine centres. Many of them are lodged in different parts of the city are still creating problems for doctors at the centres. Arresting Saad may prove to be more trouble for government officers at these centres. A lookout notice has already been issued against him, so that he cannot escape the country. We are still waiting for a nod from our bosses before moving in on him, “ an officer had told HT last week. Police have filed a criminal case against Saad and six other top jamaat members on March 31 for defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings, issued to contain the spread of the virus in Delhi.Saad’s lawyer could not be contacted for a comment.On March, police and health department officials evacuated more than 2,300 persons from inside the Markaz building, headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat, where they had gathered for a religious congregation . The meetings continued despite orders by the Delhi government banning all religious events (March 13), restricting gatherings to 200 people (March 16), and then putting a four-person limit ( March 21) on all gatherings. Nizamuddin was also declared a containment zone after the evacuation. At least 21 evacuated persons had then tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-ask-tablighi-jamaat-head-maulana-saad-to-submit-copy-of-covid-test-report/story-YRvKjlQqarIGaWXeQzlofK.html
30-04-2020||Noida||Provide ration or send us home, migrants stranded in Noida plead with govt||With the community kitchen meals proving to be insufficient to feed the many people from different states stranded in the city due to the lockdown, there is palpable tension of the ground with them demanding that either the government find a way to send them back home or provide ration for sustenance.The union home ministry had recently allowed states to return migrant workers to their homes. In Shahdara village in Noida’s sector 141, the residents come from different states -- Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra and West Bengal, among others -- but they have the same trouble: no money and often go to sleep hungry.“All our savings are over and we don’t know what to do. We have children to feed and the food being served at the village through community kitchen is not enough. We have no work and thus no earnings since the past two months, and soon we won’t be able to afford both ration for the family and milk for children. We request that either government send us ration or make some arrangements to send back home,” said Jyoti Sahu, who hails from Damoh district in Madhya Pradesh and works as domestic help in the neighbouring highrises in Sector 137. She lives with her in-laws – a large family of 25 people comprising 12 children. They had all come to Noida in search of work, now they wished to return.The Sahu family, along with their neighbours and other migrants stranded in Shahdara village also claimed that despite holding a Jan Dhan Account, they did not receive government funds either. In April, the Union government had promised to transfer ₹1,500 to these accounts held by women.“The family I worked for helped me a lot, they even provided ration but how long can they feed us? We would need help from the government. We also did not receive money in our account, while some back in our village in Madhya Pradesh did,” says Maya Rani Sahu and Anita Sahu, who also work as domestic help at the neighbouring highrises.Their landlord understood their predicament and did not ask for rent. “Some 20 days back during the first lockdown, out of hundreds living here only 10 families received ration packets that had two kilo rice and atta and one kilo channa dal. There was no oil, vegetables, salt or spices. Many families who are my tenants approached me for help, so I dialled the helpline number at 0120-2425025, seeking ration but no help followed,” said Ashok Sharma, the landlord who has rented rooms to more than ten such migrant families in the village.Laxmi Devi, a domestic help who migrated from Siwan district, Bihar was another marred by the lockdown.“Before Holi, my husband went to Bhopal for work and got stuck there. I work as a domestic help here and have a seven-month-old baby girl. I don’t have enough money to sustain longer and baby food is expensive. If only we can go back home, most of our problems would be solved,” says Laxmi.Suman Bhartiyal, migrant from Champawat district in Uttarakhand was another sufferer with a toddler to feed and limited ration to sustain.“My baby is not even a year old, so I cannot walk back home. If only we get chance or government arranges a bus, we all want to go home,”” says BhartiyalShanti Haldar, another migrant who hails from Malda in West Bengal and worked here at a construction site had similar story of no support from government and a sustenance that runs on credit.According to the officials however, the ration distribution will begin soon. Officials said that while the administration has already given orders to initiate the distribution of ration on priority basis to the ration card holders, a separate database is being worked upon to recognise the needy families without a ration card.“We have over 1,85,000 families with ration card in the district of which 7,897 are Antyodaya card holder and remaining are PHH (person house hold ) card holder. The distribution is set to begin in two phase from May 1 to 12 and May 15 to 26. But these benefits are for the card holders from within the state. For the migrants, who don’t have ration card or are the families in need, separate arrangements are being made. A database is being developed to recognise those in need and they will get a package that contains nine items including rice, pulses, atta, spices, salt, oil and vegetables,” said RN Yadav, district supply officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/provide-ration-or-send-us-home-migrants-stranded-in-noida-plead-with-govt/story-USNzHjZmxQg9ZbZxQ9QhdI.html

30-04-2020||Bangalore||Covid-19 lockdown: K’taka govt allows one-time movement of stranded people||The Karnataka government on Thursday decided to allow migrant workers, tourists, students and others stranded in different parts of the state due to the ongoing lockdown to return to their native places, a day after the Centre issued guidelines for the process.This will be a one-time movement and the government would arrange buses for those in need but they should bear the expenses, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J C Madhuswamy said.

30-04-2020||Delhi||Five of Lok Sabha staffer’s family of 12 test positive, family says delayed test reports led to spread||Five of a family of 12, living in a two-bedroom government quarters near Central Delhi’s Gole Market, have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since April 20, with the family blaming delayed reports for the disease spreading to so many members of the family within a span of nine days.The head of the family, a 58-year-old Lok Sabha housekeeping staff member, was the first to test positive on April 20. He lives with his wife, daughter, three sons, two daughters-in-law and four grandchildren in a two-bedroom house with a covered balcony functioning as an additional room.“My father had complained of chest pain on April 11, after which I took him to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital. Three days later, he had fever and I took him for a Covid test to RML again. On April 20, he test results came positive for Covid-19. The ambulance did not come for hours to take him to the hospital. Since beds were full at RML, we had to call up several people to get him admitted to Safdarjung,” the man’s son told HT over the phone. On April 21, the whole family got their Covid tests done at the RML. Reports came on April 23 and the staffer’s daughter tested positive. She was shifted to the YMCA/YWCA quarantine facility of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) the same day. All others tested negative at the time. However, one of the daughters-in-law’s report did not come. The staffer’s son said, “After my sister tested positive, I had requested the medical staff at RML to help shift us to an isolation facility, as we have young children at home. But they told us that since none of us had symptoms, we should stay in home quarantine,” he said. He added that days later when he checked with the authorities about his sister-in-law’s report, he was told that it may have been misplaced and they will get her sample collected and tested again, which didn’t happen, he alleged. “Our house is small and all members of the family have to use the same bathroom,” he said. ” When my mother and brother got fever and sore throat, all three of us again got our Covid tests done on April 25. Mine as well as my mother’s report came on April 29 (Wednesday) evening. We again waited for almost two hours for the ambulance to arrive. My brother’s report had not come even then. He had to isolate himself in the balcony to keep away from children,” the staffer’s son said.The son and the staffer’s wife’s were shifted late Wednesday to the YMCA/YWCA quarantine facility. The other son’s report came a day later, on Thursday evening. The others in the neighbourhood Thursday said that they will write to the local authorities to shift the family to a quarantine facility, as social distancing was not possible in the small house and more members might end up getting infected. Rebat Ram Dobhal, president of the local RWA said the family had a hard time even getting to the hospital. “I had to call up the local authorities to help send ambulances. We plan to write to them to move the family to a safer quarantine facility, as they may infect each other. Also, it poses a risk to others in the building,”Dobhal said. Four civil defence volunteers have been deployed to supply essentials to the sealed building that houses 15 flats. All the staffer’s son wants now is that the rest of his family’s samples are collected from home and they do not have to go out again to a hospital. “Initially when I took my father for his heart check-up on April 11, the hospital staff was not taking adequate measures to keep the non-Covid patients separated from Covid patients. My father was made to sit on the same bench where a Covid patient had sat minutes ago. He contracted the infection from there. Now I just pray that our children remain safe,” he said. New Delhi district health officials said in designated hospitals, it usually takes two days for the reports to arrive. “There could be a slight delay on account of medical facilities being burdened with tests from containment zones. We have already asked them to speed up test results,” a senior government official, who did not wish to be named, said. A senior official from the RML hospital, on condition of anonymity, said, “There is no delay in reports. It varies from case to case.

We had full faith in almighty and never thought we would catch the infection, they said, after 15 of them tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), bringing to the fore the risks and dangers of transporting people in such situations.In the past two days, 57 pilgrims have arrived in Mohali, out of which 60% are women. Most of these are from villages, including Premgarh near Aerocity, Manakmajra, Amrala, Badana, Raipur Khurd and Sainimajra. All 15 who tested positive have been admitted to the Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur for 14 days. The district case tally now stands at 84.Speaking to HT, a 58-year-old man from Premgarh, who tested positive, said, “Seventeen members of our family, including those from other villages, had also accompanied us on the religious tour, and 13 of them have tested positive. We had no symptoms as all of us were hale and hearty. I have yet to believe that I am a Covid patient and could have passed on the infection to others in the bus.”Another among the patients, a 55-year-old woman from Amrala village in Dera Bassi, said, “We left for Hazur Sahib on March 18 and were happy to visit the holy shrine. Stranded in Maharashtra due to the nationwide lockdown, we had no problem at all, but coming all the way to Mohali and being told that we have been infected has shattered us. I was excited to meet my family members, but now again I have to stay away from them for 14 days.”A 54-year-old patient from Premgarh said, “Not even a single person in the bus had any health problem, not even a mild headache. We travelled for more than 2,200km, all fine, but fail to understand how reports have come out positive. There must be something wrong with the reports.”Meanwhile, Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said, “Most of the patients tested positive are asymptomatic and all are responding well to the treatment. We have to quarantine them to stop further spread of the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-crept-up-on-healthy-nanded-returnees-in-mohali/story-2luf5v7OodzqgVDYm0BPuM.html

For the past four days they have started coming back from Punjab and Himachal Pradesh,” said Kathua district senior superintendent of police (SSP) Shailendra Kumar Mishra.“Around 9,000 labourers have come back so far and the process is continuing. As we speak there are around 3,000 more at Lakhanpur undergoing various checks and screening as per guidelines,” added Mishra.Currently Himachal Pradesh and Punjab are the two states being prioritised.“Once these residents enter Lakhanpur (the entry point into J&K) they are sent to their native districts for administrative quarantine for 14 days. A database is being maintained,” the SSP said.Lakhanpur control room (01922-285329) attendant Taramani said a number of people were calling from across the states and within the UT to enquire about the process to enter J&K.“We are telling them that before reaching Lakhanpur they must have valid permission from the administration. Once they reach us we scrutinise their pass, screen them and send them to Kathua from where health officials either send them to home quarantine under an undertaking or to administrative quarantine depending on their status,” he said.J&K so far has recorded 581 confirmed cases of Covid 19, of which 192 have recovered and eight have died.

What has compounded the problem is that the source of the infection is not known so far.Earlier this week, an 80-year-old woman of Batpora hamlet in the interiors of Dal Lake near Jogi Lankar tested positive for the disease and died at Chest Diseases Hospital in Srinagar on Tuesday. Twelve of her close contacts were immediately quarantined, of which one family member tested positive on Thursday.Though the officials immediately declared the hamlet and its road-connecting areas like Jogi Lankar and Lamb Mohalla as red zones, people have been moving freely in the Batpora area during the lockdown.Srinagar deputy commissioner Shahid Iqbal Chaudhary said that they have sealed areas such as Jogi Lankar and Rainawari keeping only one entry-exit functional. “We also sent a team to the lakeside and a police team is also patrolling to keep a vigil,” he said.Dal Lake is a microcosm of Srinagar city. Even in the strictest of curfews or a shutdown, Dal Lake remains unaffected as people mostly use boats for transport. Since the nationwide lockdown was enforced to contain Covid-19 pandemic, life for those staying in human settlements within and along the Dal Lake has been going on with farmers growing vegetables and selling them daily at the floating market.“There have been no restrictions but people have been maintaining social distancing,” said Bashir Ahmad Bhat, who daily rows 5km on his boat to the floating market to buy vegetables in bulk and then deliver in the city.Spread over an area of 24 km including the settlements and vast expanse of the lake, some 50,000 people live in small hamlets and houseboats on Dal Lake.DC said that imposing restrictions in Dal Lake is a challenge. “We have activated Anaganwari workers, BLOs and health workers to ensure that there is less movement,” he said.What has been more worrying is the unknown source of infection of two of the 88 cases in Srinagar including a vegetable seller of Nishat and the 80-year-old woman.“The woman was reported to be suffering from various ailments. She neither had any travel history nor had contact with any known positive patient. We are identifying the sources of infection,” Choudhary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dal-lake-s-first-covid-19-case-proves-to-be-a-challenge-for-j-k-administration/story-0kybYaf7z4sqAi0Beug6HM.html

The administration is now making efforts to provide relaxation in some parts of the city in the coming days.In the coming days, these instructions could be extended in other districts of the Valley. Currently, Covid-19 cases have been reported from all 10 districts of Kashmir, with Bandipore topping the list with 129 cases.Srinagar deputy commissioner Shahid Choudhary said that it shall be mandatory to wear a face mask at all public places from May 1. “We will ensure to make masks available to everyone. Do remember that the use of masks is just one of various precautions needed.’’He said the district administration shall make available for the public use 15 lakh masks produced.Dr Suhail Naik, president of Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) said that Covid-19 is a long drawn battle for 2021. “Masks are now part of our clothing. Social distancing should be strictly maintained and we should make handwashing a habit.”In fact, many health experts here have been advocating for the use of masks especially when people venture out of their homes.“Wearing masks would help in preventing transmission of the infection to some extent if other norms like social distancing and hand washing are not followed properly,’’ said Dr Salim Khan from Government Medical College Srinagar.“Many NGOs are distributing masks made of two layers of cloth that could be reused after washing and ironing,’’ said Dr Amjid Ali, a doctor at Government Medical College Baramulla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/people-must-wear-masks-follow-social-distancing-norms-j-k-health-experts/story-GD3UeqLsIc3179x8eCZ5gL.html
30-04-2020||Chandigarh||CPI man booked for instigating 112 labourers being quarantined to flee||A man who instigated more than a 100 persons to flee from a quarantine centre in Fazilka late on Wednesday night has been booked by the police.About 112 labourers who were among 1,105 men stranded in Rajasthan and brought back to Abohar could not be accommodated for mandatory quarantining at a centre there because of lack of space.They were being moved by the civil authorities to another quarantine centre at Fazilka in three buses, which got caught in a storm midway. It was then that the men started protesting against the allegedly unsatisfactory quarantine arrangements at Fazilka and fled from the bus.Subeg Singh, a member of the block samiti, who reportedly belongs to the Communist Party of India (CPI), allegedly instigated the men to flee from the bus and they managed to take cover in the darkness and escape to their homes. “He not only provoked them to protest against the government, but also misguided them to leave the quarantine centre (at Abohar),” said Harjeet Singh, senior superintendent of police, Fazilka. The labourers were to be kept at the centre as the Punjab government had ordered mandatory quarantining for anyone entering the state before they were allowed to go home. “All the labourers under the cover of darkness and the storm succeeded in fleeing and going back to their homes,” the SSP added.After a marathon exercise, all the men were traced at their homes later and sent to the Fazilka centre.It was also reported that three centres in the subdivisions of Fazilka, including Fazilka itself and Abohar and Jalalabad were informed that 1,100 persons would be taken there from Rajasthan, but later, chaos ensued when 1,400 men reached the centres and authorities scrambled to accommodate them.Meanwhile, a case under section 269,267 and 188 of the IPC besides section 51 of the Disaster Management Act was registered against Subeg Singh.Despite repeated attempts deputy commissioner, Fazilka, could not be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cpi-man-booked-for-instigating-112-labourers-being-quarantined-to-flee/story-0thbiD25tLedeenqaqkm5I.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||SC seeks CBI reply on parole plea by 1984 anti-Sikh riot convict Khokhar||The Supreme Court on Thursday sought CBI’s response on a plea of former Congress councillor Balwan Khokhar, serving life term in an 1984 anti-Sikh riot case, seeking grant of either interim bail or parole for eight weeks in view of COVID-19 pandemic. Khokhar and former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar are serving life imprisonment in Tihar jail in the case after the Delhi High Court convicted them on December 17, 2018.A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justice Aniruddha Bose took note of the submissions made by Khokhar’s counsel that prisons need to be decongested to contain the pandemic as has been suggested by courts as also the government. The bench, hearing the plea via video conferencing, then asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the CBI, to file the response. Khokhar was earlier granted 4-week parole on January 15 by the top court following the death of his father.Senior advocate H S Phoolka, who represented riot victims and was in his native village in Punjab, opposed the bail plea.“That the Applicant is constrained to approach this court for enforcement of his rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution in order to save his life. Applicant who is a senior citizen around 65 years of age suffering from various ailments like diabetes, hypertension and severe joint pains and is languishing in jail for more than six years. “The applicant has been denied parole which has been liberally granted to hundreds of prisons in the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic putting his life in jeopardy,” the convict said in his plea.It said that in March, when COVID-19 had started gripping the country, a statement was made by Delhi government in the high court that in order to contain the spread of the contagion, it would amend the Prisons Rules to give an option of parole to convicts and under trial prisoners. The convict sought parole under amended Prison Rules 1211 and said that he was suffering from various ailments which made him vulnerable to the virus, it said.The parole was denied to the convict under the Rule which prohibited such a relief in cases where investigations have been conducted by the CBI. “That rejection of applicant’s prayer for parole on this very ground is apparently unjustifiable and unconstitutional being violative of Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India,” it said.Earlier, the top court had said that it would hear the bail plea of other convict Sajjan Kumar in the case during summer vacation. Khokhar’s life sentence was upheld by the Delhi High Court in 2018, while it had reversed the acquittal of Kumar by the trial court in 2013, in a case related to the killings of five Sikhs in the Raj Nagar Part-I area in Palam Colony in southwest Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.The anti-Sikh riots had broken out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards.The high court had also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by the trial court to the other five -- Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and former MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar.It had also convicted them for criminal conspiracy to burn down residences of Sikh families and a gurdwara in the area during the riots.The trial court in 2013 had awarded life term to Balwan Khokhar, Bhagmal and Lal, and a three-year jail term to Yadav and Kishan Khokhar.Following the high court verdict, life term of Balwan Khokhar, Bhagmal and Lal has been upheld and the sentence of Yadav and Kishan Khokar has been enhanced to 10 years in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sc-seeks-cbi-reply-on-parole-plea-by-1984-anti-sikh-riot-convict-khokhar/story-y0MPTiZF4bWtitfLQrRtCN.html

30-04-2020||City||People who have returned from other states must inform authorities or face action: Himachal DGP||People who have returned to Himachal Pradesh from other states must inform the authorities or stern action will be taken against them, said director general of police (DGP) Sita Ram Mardi on Thursday.“If found Covid-19 positive, they will be booked under the toughest sections,” said the state police chief, exhorting people to tip off authorities if someone in their neighbourhood had returned from outside and is concealing the information. He also said that those coming from outside the state must obtain the e-pass of the district they want to go to. “Entering a district on e-pass pass of another district will be tantamount to concealment of information,” he said.As per government records around 23,000 people have entered Himachal this week, since the government opened the borders to facilitate return of those stuck outside the state. Over 3 lakh people had applied for e-passes to return to state. Authorities have issued as many as 90,000 passes and the process of issuing passes has now been put on hold till further orders. Mardi said that some people were jumping quarantine which also warrants action against the offenders. “As per the health ministry guidelines, those, who are under home quarantine should use mask; use separate utensils and avoid contact with the elders,” said Mardi.He expressed disappointment that some people did not understand the purpose of lockdown. “A man fled from a quarantine centre at Parwanoo. Strict action is being taken against him. Similarly, a man was booked in Mandi town for spitting in hospital premises while three shops were sealed in Hamirpur for not following the social distancing norms,” said Mardi.The DGP also said that the police had busted a gang in Paonta Sahib for issuing fake e-passes. They even possessed the official seal of the sub-divisional magistrate.He said that if someone has some fake news, they may post it on faeknews.hp.gov.in portal and government will clarify the matter. People may also inform the government about fake news on 98163-23469, said the DGP.He also advised the people to be on the alert against scamsters who were duping people in the name of online tutorials.“Children may also play games on Google Doodle, as these are not harmful. They or even adults may read WHO’s children stories which provide information about Covid-19,” said the DGP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/people-who-have-returned-from-other-states-must-inform-authorities-or-face-action-dgp/story-gF0q3O6L3IXzH3zVolDOcM.html

However, with the supply chain in disarray, the prices of vegetables have drastically dropped as the local markets have surplus vegetables.The farmers, particularly, those growing, pea, cauliflower and cabbage are suffering huge losses as the rates for these vegetables have plummeted. Theog, Mashobra and Chail sell their produce the fruit and vegetable market in Dhalli. While, the farmers in Shimla’s surrounding areas such as Dhamun panchayats also sell vegetables in Shimla.The prices of peas, cauliflower and cabbage have dropped drastically in the last three days. “It is due to the plumetting prices that we have started feeding the produce to animals. Farmers will not be able to pay off the loans raised for sowing of crops,” said a farmer, Rajendra Thakur, of Thraia village.In the first week of April, pea was being sold for ₹25 per kg. However, the rate has dropped to ₹15.“Despite, toiling day and night, farmers have failed to procure minimum price for their produce. Consequently, they are feeding the produce to their cattle,” said Surender Thakur.“The pea is rotting in fields as when the government allotted permission for transportation, the prices dropped due to glutting of vegetables in the local market,” said Jitender singh, who demanded a loan waiver for farmers.President, Arhti Association Harish Thakur in Dhalli Sabzi Mandi says most of vegetables producedin Himachal have markets in Mumbai and Delhi. “However, due to the lockdown they are unable to supply vegetables to the big cities.” HP Fruit Vegetables and Flowers association president Harish Chauhan said due to the coronavirus, the supply chain of seasonal vegetables had been badly affected causing huge losses to farmers as well as fruit marketers.“Most big fruit markets of the country have been shutdown due to the coronavirus and there are limited buyers and sellers in the state. We request the government to compensate farmers who have suffered losses,” he said.Agriculture is an important source of the state’s income. Around 12.73% of the total gross state domestic produce comes from agriculture and its allied sectors. Off the total area of state, which is 55.67 lakh hectares, the area under operational holding is around 9.55 lakh hectares.

30-04-2020||City||Stop virtual classes: Request emails to flood CM’s inbox on May 1||If the teachers have their way, the email account of chief minister Yogi Adityanath is likely to go low on storage on May 1.Reason: Thousands of teachers from across Uttar Pradesh are likely to shoot an email with a request to revoke the decision for holding online or virtual classes in UP Board schools.To make the exercise effective, the emails will be shot exactly at noon on May 1, said a teacher.The unanimous decision in this regard was taken by members of Uttar Pradesh Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh (UPMSS) (Thakurai faction) at a telephonic meet held on Wednesday.According to state general secretary of the teachers’ organization, Lal Mani Diwedi, more than half of the students registered in over 27,000 schools affiliated to the Board could not afford facilities for attending online classes while nearly one fourth did not even have a Smartphone at their disposal.“I am a teacher at Kesar Vidyapeeth in Prayagraj. Out of a total of 36 students in class 8, only 11 could be registered in the WhatsApp group of which only four responded to my teaching in past 10 days. It is literally not possible. Unlike other educational board, parents of students studying in UP Board institutions are not so well educated that they would assist their kids in attending online classes,” he said.As per Diwedi, thousands of teachers would press the button sending request on email of UP chief minister for intervening in the matter and stopping virtual classes in UP Board schools as the measure was making mockery of the present state of schools and back ground of parents studying in these schools.Meanwhile, state general secretary of Rajkiya Shikshak Sangh Ravi Bhushan said that at a time when most of the government high school and inter colleges affiliated to UP Board were without a computer teacher, how would the teachers of different subjects not having knowledge of computers or virtual classes plan out curriculum for online classes and conduct the same.Reports revealed, out of over 27,000 schools affiliated to UP Board, 2294 government schools did not have even one computer teacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stop-virtual-classes-request-emails-to-flood-cm-s-inbox-on-may-1/story-HPn3xKhV7dL3Nm3HtFOHoL.html

30-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police remove over 600 misleading social media posts on Covid-19, share tips to spot fake news||The Mumbai Police have pulled down more than 600 objectionable posts related to the coronavirus pandemic from social media platforms, officials said on Thursday. The posts include video and audio clips, communal posts, photos and fake news.Five FIRs have also been registered in this regard and 155 accused arrested so far, said Harish Baijal, deputy inspector general of Mumbai Police’s cyber wing.A senior police officer told Hindustan Times that the Social Media Lab (SML) of Special Branch-1, the intelligence wing of Mumbai Police, has pulled down objectionable posts during the lockdown period. “These posts were highly misleading, baseless and had potential to trigger panic among people and also communal tension in the city,” the officer said.The officer further added that the messages circulating initially on the social media platforms had misinformation regarding Covid-19, but later, messages on the Tablighi Jamaat incident of Delhi spread like wildfire.“We keep close eye on trends and patterns and analyse them to identify the platforms or groups which are regularly spreading such inflammatory videos or posts. Then appropriate legal action is taken against such elements,” another officer said.A team of 30 highly trained, technologically sound, multilingual officers keep an eagle’s eye on the suspicious activities on various social media platforms. These officers work in three shifts so that the monitoring continues for 24 hours, 7 days a week.They look for objectionable content on popular platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Telegram etc with the help of advanced filter tools. Once objectionable content is discovered, it is immediately blocked or removed with the help of the service providers. Members of this team are regularly given training by Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), anti-terror agencies and other government agencies about the new tools, filters and softwares that can be used to trace troublemakers operating online.How it’s done:Whenever a ‘problematic’ content is identified on internet by the Social Media Lab (SML) officials, it is sent to an Additional Commissioner of Police (ACP) or Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) of Special Branch. After senior officials find it fit for further action, they approve the same for sending it to the cyber wing, which is the nodal authority of Mumbai Police for such action. While sending out instructions, the senior officials also keep in mind that freedom of speech or artistic or creative liberty is not curbed.The cyber police then writes email to concerned service provider under Section 91 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and request them to remove the content.“The service providers do not accept the police’s request everytime as they adhere to their local laws and are not bound by our laws. But, in cases related to terrorism or any other emergency they usually accept our request and promptly remove the content from their platform. They also follow a verification process before taking down the content,” a DCP rank officer said, who once headed the cyber police decision, told Hindustan Times.The police officers also shared tips on how to spot fake news:• Fake news often goes viral: Even if a message, post or video is shared multiple times and you receive it from multiple sources, consider the fact that a matter being shared multiple times does not make it true.• Look for mistakes and errors in messages: Most fake messages are full of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.• Check the ‘unbelievable’ information: On receiving information that seems a little far-fetched, check on internet, official websites to determine whether it is true or not.• Photos, videos can be edited: Always understand that it is not difficult to edit photos and videos. Even if a photo is real, it is not a tough task to spin a story around it. Always look online to see where the photo came from.• Check links as well: Sometimes links look like they are too well-known websites but there are often spelling mistakes and unusual characters present in them.• Don’t share if your are unsure: If you are unaware of the source or are unsure about the information, then avoid sharing such matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-remove-over-600-misleading-social-media-posts-on-covid-19-share-tips-to-spot-fake-news/story-kxU4yCbSzntwj8C1uFV7GK.html

30-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh lags behind Panchkula, Mohali in Covid-19 testing||Despite high number of cases, Chandigarh’s testing has not been vigorous, so much so that it couldn’t match even Panchkula and Mohali.Chandigarh has reported 68 cases and tested only 1,013 people, while Mohali with 73 infections tested 1,411. Panchkula has only 18 cases but has tested 1,525 persons, highest in the tricity. Chandigarh has an estimated population of 14 lakh, Panchkula 6.6 lakh and Mohali 10 lakh.The very first case in the tricity was reported in Chandigarh on March 18.UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said there was no criteria to gauge “how many are enough when it comes to testing”. “We have to follow the guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for testing. More testing in disregard of the guidelines is not an achievement,” he said.In Chandigarh, testing is mainly being done at three centres. Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), which has a daily testing capacity of 200 people, and administration’s exclusive health facility GMCH-32 has a capacity to conduct 100 tests and Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH) can do 50 tests daily. Panchkula and Mohali did not have their own testing facility and samples taken there are being sent for to PGIMER and IMTECH. These two institutes are meant for the tests of samples sent by the UT as well. Nodal officer for Covid-19, Mohali, and civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh, said right from day one, the administration had gone for extensive sampling. “It has helped us in finding affected persons. It has proved fruitful, we will be more aggressive in future,” he added.Former president of Chandigarh’s Indian Medical Association Dr RS Bedi said, “We (in Chandigarh) are at a stage where we have to chase the virus now. Chandigarh is not a big city and we can easily go for aggressive testing. We should go for random sampling even beyond the affected zones.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-lags-behind-panchkula-mohali-in-covid-19-testing/story-bBGM3EUfjWYHjrlE6cUhVM.html
30-04-2020||Chandigarh||How Bapu Dham Colony became Chandigarh’s first major hotspot||With 23 Covid positive cases and counting, Bapu Dham, a rehabilitated slum colony with high population density, has emerged as the city’s first major hotspot registering almost one-third of the total positive cases to date.Named after Mahatma Gandhi, the colony came up in the mid-70s to rehabilitate a former slum of Sector 26. Later, small plots, not bigger than one-and-a-half marlas, were allotted to the residents in three different phases.Dalip Sharma, the MC councillor representing Bapu Dham, said that more than 50,000 people lived here in close proximity in nearly 2,500 multi-storeyed small houses. And this is what makes it susceptible to the spread of a highly contagious disease like the Covid-19.TRACING PATIENT 1It all started on April 24 after an operation theatre attendant at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Narender Kumar, of house number 533 here, was found to be infected.Kumar went on to infect five members of his family, and over a dozen people in the nearby house number 535, besides multiple people in house numbers 528, 539 and 585—all primary and secondary contacts of Kumar.Authorities believe that many of those infected were part of his marriage anniversary party. The UT administration had hoped the virus doesn’t spread further, but every new case has started a chain reaction of it’s own. Of the three fresh Covid cases reported in the colony on Wednesday, two are labourers living in a single room. They have four other persons as roommates and 26 community contacts. All of them live in the same building.The third person who tested positive on Wednesday lives in a separate room, in a different house. He is a plumber and has three family and 72 community contacts living in the same building. All are under observation for symptoms.100 HOUSES SEALEDApproximately 100 houses (numbers 517 to 614) have been completely sealed while movement has been restricted in the remaining part of the colony that is under strict vigil of both the police and the paramilitary staff.Kavita Kumari, a resident of house number 555, said no essential commodities had been supplied in the last two days, but her concern is the fate of the poor in the locality: “There are migrant labourers who have absolutely no ration or food available, and no way to get it either.”Rani, a resident of house number 520, said her primary concern was that the police should speak politely with the residents. She said there were many houses in the sealed locality struggling to get essentials like flour and oil. “We were snubbed for asking for ration. We do understand that the situation is difficult, but surviving is difficult without essentials especially when most families have small kids.”BAPU DHAM POLICE POST IN-CHARGE TRANSFERREDThe Chandigarh Police on Wednesday ordered the transfer of sub-inspector (SI) Gurmeet Singh, the former police post in-charge at Bapu Dham Colony, for lapses in duty.In an order issued by superintendent of police (SP) Manoj Kumar Meena, the SI was transferred to the Police Lines and sub-inspector Rohitash Kumar Yadav was made the new in-charge of the post with immediate effect.The reshuffle comes after it came to light that Patient 1 Narender Kumar had organised a rooftop party at his house in the colony and invited many people. However, the Sector 26 station house officer (SHO), police post in-charge and beat officials had said they were completely unaware of the event.A written explanation has been sought from Sector 26 SHO Narinder Patial. If found guilty, sources said he could be transferred, too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/how-bapu-dham-colony-became-chandigarh-s-first-major-hotspot/story-NKWgbe5Vgk4hJ3OdvmQPjM.html
30-04-2020||Chandigarh||Priest in Haryana watched mother’s funeral online, weeks later church webcasts his burial for kin in Tamil Nadu||The lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus has not only transformed the way people live, but the way they die as well.A month back when a 46-year-old catholic priest was saying the prayers online at St Antony’s Church in Habri village of Kaithal district, Haryana, more than 2,600 km away somewhere in Tamil Nadu his 75-year-old long-time ailing mother passed away.The hapless priest had to contend with watching his mother’s funeral online, unable to get a glimpse of her for the last time.On Tuesday late evening, however, a cardiac arrest snatched away the life of the priest. And this time, his father and brother, sitting in Vallavilai village of Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu, had no choice but to watch the priest’s funeral online that took place at 1pm on Wednesday at the Sector 25 cemetery in the presence of eight catholic priests.Father Michael Boniface of the Simla-Chandigarh Diocese, who was the in-charge of St Antony’s Church, suffered a cardiac arrest on Tuesday evening and was declared brought dead on reaching a private hospital in Kurukshetra.The priest had lost his mother on March 31; she had been bedridden for almost a year after suffering a paralytic attack. Watching her funeral online, the priest had been unaware that his journey, too, will be witnessed by the remaining family in a similar way.Speaking to the Hindustan Times, the priest’s brother Simon Boniface, who is in Tamil Nadu, said it was a huge irony: “My brother was completely shattered by the death of our mother, but always put on a brave face. Due to the lockdown, we could not even attend his final journey and had to watch it online. It was painful.”In his obituary message, Bishop of Simla-Chandigarh Diocese reverend Ignatius Mascarenhas said, “His demise is a great loss for the Diocese. Such a young and vibrant priest is gone to eternity. The Diocese is grateful to the family members, especially to his younger brother, who is at home and who cannot come due to the Covid-19 lockdown in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/priest-in-haryana-watched-mother-s-funeral-online-weeks-later-church-webcasts-his-burial-for-kin-in-tamil-nadu/story-ndfxKKyTXZ3zvWq6sH5wUI.html

30-04-2020||Lucknow||54,000 abandoned cows adopted in UP under the CM Destitute Cow Participation Scheme||Around 54,000 abandoned cows were lucky enough to get new homes in Uttar Pradesh with more than 26,500 farmers having come forward to adopt them under the Chief Minister Destitute Cow Participation Scheme during the last financial year that ended on March 31.Male bovines were not that lucky. As there were few takers for them, they were forced to make do with the government-run (some of them poorly managed) cow shelters where nearly 5 lakh abandoned cattle have been housed all over the state for around a year and a half.“As many as 26,586 farmers adopted 53,606 abandoned cows from the makeshift cattle shelters set up in all 75 districts in the state till March 31,” said principal secretary, animal husbandry, Bhuvnesh Kumar, adding, “The government provides a finance assistance of Rs 900 per cattle per month to all such farmers under the Chief Minister Destitute Cow Participation Scheme.”According to Kumar, each such cattlehead was ear-tagged before being given for adoption for subsequent follow-up and monitoring.The district-wise data on adoption shows that cows were adopted in all 75 districts, though in varying numbers. Lalitpur, where 4,747 cows were adopted by 1,686 farmers topped the chart followed by Hamirpur where 2,875 cows were adopted by 1,477 farmers. Hardoi and Lucknow came third and fourth with adoption of 2,850 and 2,537 cows respectively.Rampur district figured at the bottom with adoption of merely 11 cows by six farmers. Gorakhpur and JP Nagar where 98 and 103 cows were adopted by 42 and 66 farmers respectively were on the second and third position from the bottom respectively.However, farmers mostly picked only female bovines for adoption and they were further selective about their choice. “Farmers mostly pick heifers (young cows that have not yet had a calf), milch cows or pregnant cows,” said director, animal husbandry, UB Singh.Pointing out the reason why the target of adoption of one lakh cattle could achieve only the halfway mark, Singh said, “The number of male bovines at the cow shelters far exceeded the female bovines on the one hand and farmers were selective in choosing.” After the cow shelters started overflowing, the Yogi Adityanath government launched the Chief Minister Destitute Cows Participation Scheme in August last year offering willing farmers to take stray of their choice against an affidavit that they would look after them properly at home.The government ordered catching of stray cattle and putting them in cow shelters early in 2019 after the ban on illegal slaughter houses spiked the population of stray cattle that started destroying crops in villages and causing accidents in cities, leading to a public resentment and agitations in various parts of the state. Singh said adoption of cows was a big service. “We appeal to people to volunteer to take cattle from the cow shelters and take care of them at home. The government already gives Rs 30 per animal per day for fodder,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/54-000-abandoned-cows-adopted-in-up-under-the-cm-destitute-cow-participation-scheme/story-zzdWRJvV3Or3vs9bwQL0UM.html
30-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 doubling rate in Mumbai rises to 10 days; mortality rate dips to 3.9%||Amid the increasing number of coronavirus cases in the city, Mumbaiites have something to cheer about. A data by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday has revealed that the doubling rate of the coronavirus outbreak in the city has increased to 10 days from the 8.3 days recorded last week. The doubling rate is the amount of time or the number of days required for the coronavirus cases to double. The city’s Covid-19 fatality rate too has decreased to 3.9% on April 26 from the earlier 6.3% recorded on April 11. This means that there are now four deaths recorded for every 100 cases, as opposed to the earlier six deaths for the same number of cases. The corporation has claimed that the fatality rate in the city has now inched closer to the national average of 3.1% and is better than that of the state, which is at 4.3%.However, there are nine wards in the city that have shown a faster the doubling rate. These wards are R Central ward (Borivli), R North ward (Dahisar), F South ward (Parel), M East ward (Mankhurd), T ward (Mulund), C ward (Kalbadevi and Marine Lines), H East ward (Bandra and Khar), D ward (Malabar Hill and Walkeshwar) and M West ward (Chembur and Tilak Nagar).Despite the decrease in the doubling time, majority of these wards until Wednesday have reported fewer cases as compared to the remaining 15 wards in the city. The civic body also said that 26 coronavirus deaths were reported in the city on Wednesday, even as 475 new cases were confirmed. Mumbai now has 6,644 confirmed cases of coronavirus, while the death toll has escalated to 270. Of the 26 deaths reported on Wednesday, 16 patients had co-morbidities. Thirteen patients who died were above 60 years , while 12 were between 40 and 60 years, and one was an 80-year-old. According to BMC, 193 patients have been recovered and discharged on Wednesday. Of these 475, 170 had been tested in private labs. The G North ward, which is among the worst-hit in the city, reported new cases on Wednesday. With 14 cases registered on Wednesday, Dharavi now has 344 coronavirus patients, while the death toll in the area is now at 18. Mahim reported three new cases, taking the total number of cases in the area to 33. Dadar did not report any new case on Wednesday. Mayor visits Covid-19 hospitalsMeanwhile, mayor Kishori Pednekar on Wednesday visited Cooper and Seven Hills Hospitals, where coronavirus patients are being treated, to review the work carried out by civic officials.BMC official dies of coronavirusAn an inspector from BMC’s assessment department, Madhukar Hariyan, who was working at a coronavirus hotspot in Dharavi died on Wednesday. The BMC posted a tweet on its official Twitter handle, “Our very own, Shri Madhukar Hariyan (Inspector, Assessment Dept, BMC) passed away today. He had devoted himself in the service of Mumbaikars & the needy. May his soul rest in peace. Our thoughts & prayers are with the Hariyan family. He had tested Covid-19 positive.” Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of G North ward, took to social media on Wednesday night to convey his condolences. “Now how to motivate the team @mybmcWardGN for #MissionDharavi? RIP #CoronaWarrior Madhur Hariyan. Sacrifice will not be forgotten. We pledge to work further, “ his tweet read.According to a senior civic official, Hariyan was among the officials deployed in Dharavi to distribute food packets to residents at containment zones. The official said, “He developed symptoms on April 23 but never got admitted to any hospital and did not even complain about the symptoms. He kept taking medicines from a local practitioner. On Wednesday, he died on the way while he was being taken to the Kasturba hospital.” 3 more BEST employees test positiveMeanwhile, three more Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) bus drivers and one conductor were tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases in the undertaking to 17. The BEST administration on Wednesday had issued a set of directives to around 750 of its staffers who are above 55 years and suffer from comorbidities such as high blood pressure and diabetes and asked them not to resume duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/doubling-rate-in-mumbai-rises-to-10-days-mortality-rate-dips-to-3-9/story-RlGzwW99RqjUnDhknwDdKJ.html
30-04-2020||Mumbai||‘Mission Dharavi tough, not impossible’||From the first case on April 1 to 344 cases 29 days later, Dharavi, India’s largest slum, has emerged as a major hotspot of Covid-19 in the city, with cases rising daily. In such a grim situation, how do you contain the spread, given the space constraint, stigma and lack of awareness, sanitation and even essentials? The civic body’s answer – Mission Dharavi, a daily fight involving 2,500 health care and sanitation workers. Although the mission is still on, and at a crucial stage considering the rise, the civic body is confident of a positive outcome.THE NUMBERSThe Dharavi slum is spread over 2.4 sqkm, has 850,000 residents and a population density of 354,167 per square kilometre, making it one of the more cramped spaces in Mumbai, itself the world’s fifth most densely populated city. It is characterised by difficult-to-manage makeshift shanties, or double-storey standalone tin and concrete shanties. There are only a few multi-storey slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) buildings, which are gated. There are 225 public community toilets in this slum, used by thousands of people daily, through the day. Residents are daily wage workers, or run small businesses from their homes.Dharavi jumped to 330 positive cases in a span of 28 days since the first case and first death were reported on April 1. Since then, it took 17 days for this slum pocket to record the first 100 cases, six days to record the next 100, and only five days to record 100 more. On April 17, Dharavi recorded a total of 101 Covid-19 positive cases. This figure doubled by April 23, when Dharavi recorded 214 cases. On April 28, the figure of total Covid-19 positive cases touched 330. Its first patient was cured and discharged on April 11.WHAT IS BEING DONEKiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of Dadar West ward in south Mumbai, BMC’s administrative unit which covers Dharavi, launched the mission on April 18, the day after the slum pocket recorded its first 100 cases. It included running fever camps in containment zones, providing door-to-door groceries, and even cooked food to residents, so they had no reason to leave their homes. Those using community toilets were moved to institutional quarantine centres. The BMC’s newly started toll-free helpline for requesting food, shelter, and transport during the lockdown due to Covid-19: 1800221292, too, is headquartered at the G/North ward. Following requests to this helpline from Dharavi, the BMC also delivered milk, medicines, and biscuits on demand to keep people indoors.Even earlier, on April 9, when Dharavi had 17 positive cases, Dighavkar had issued a circular stopping sale of fruits and vegetables on footpaths of nine roads in Dharavi, where these cases were found. This was later expanded to all containment zones in Dharavi.HOW IT IS BEING MANAGEDThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has sent 125,000 people in over 48 containment zones, screened over 62,500 people via door-to-door surveys, fever camps, and medical clinics of private doctors. It has conducted 1,530 tests so far. Community toilets are being sanitized daily.Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said, “The most challenging aspect for Dharavi is delivering food packets home, as the population is very large. Community toilets, small homes and high population density are major challenges.”Dighavkar said, “The most challenging aspect of containing the outbreak in Dharavi is dialogue with residents. It is proving difficult due to the sheer number of people we have to communicate with. Moreover, a small room admeasuring 10x15 sqft is occupied by 8-9 people. Social distancing is impossible. Challenge is to quarantine maximum number of people. Convincing them to move to quarantine zones is yet another challenge. Chances of infection increase with community toilets.”The high-risk contacts of index patients such as his family members and immediate neighbours are moved to institutional quarantine facilities. More than 1,850 high-risk contacts have been institutionally quarantined so far. There are 2300 beds available in and around Dharavi area alone to quarantine high-risk contacts. Municipal schools have been converted into quarantine facilities, as has the Rajeev Gandhi sports complex, spread over 12,000 sq m.Dighavkar said BMC delivers over 19,000 food packets daily, with the help of its staff and police personnel, since many residents of Dharavi are hand-to-mouth earners. This food is funded by NGOs and charity trusts, and handed over to BMC for distribution.Dighavkar said, “We are on the right track, even though the number 330 looks overwhelming. Of the 330 cases, 61% are among people the BMC has already quarantined, or screened.”Dadar West ward’s data shows out of the 330 cases recorded as of April 28, 104 were from persons already in institutional quarantine, and 98 were discovered from among people screened by the civic body, totaling 61.2%. The remaining 128 cases have directly reported themselves. Moreover, Dharavi’s percentage positivity (number of positive persons emerging from the total number of tested persons) stands at 21.5% as of Tuesday, much higher than Mumbai’s positivity ratio, which fluctuates between 7% and 8%.The BMC has also permitted opening up the 350 private clinics that operate from Dharavi for early detection of cases.The civic body claimed that around 60% of its cases are from five red zones: Kalyanwadi, Mukund Nagar, Social Nagar, Muslim Nagar and Madina Nagar. Identified and flagged as red zones on April 10, when the total positive cases in Dharavi stood at 28. This was also when BMC started door-to-door screening of patients, and deployed 10 teams of 4-5 people each, to do so.RESIDENTS’ SUPPORTThe first case in Dharavi, discovered on April 1, was also the first death. The 56-year-old male who had no travel or contact history had developed symptoms on March 23 and had visited his local doctor. He was prescribed medicines for cough and sent home. Six days later he developed difficulty in breathing and was admitted to Sion hospital, where his swab was collected for testing. His positive result was finalised on April 1, but he died soon after the same day. The second and third case was reported on April 2, who were a doctor from a nearby private hospital living in Dharavi, and a civic sanitation worker living in Worli, who cleaned in Dharavi. Incidentally, Worli falls in the administrative ward with the most number of cases recorded in Mumbai. The fourth case was recorded on April 4, and the fifth on April 5. While April 6 and April 11 recorded no new cases, the days right after these ones brought new challenges for the local administration, giving then no time to prepare. Everyday since, cases multiplied rapidly.In Mumbai the wards with the lowest number of cases such as Mulund in the eastern suburbs, Marine Lines in the island city and Borivli in the western suburbs had many days in between the positive cases reported in their area, and hence had more time on their hands to put containment and quarantine measures in place, isolate index patients and break the chain of spread of the virus.However, what is working for Dharavi is self-discipline of its residents. Pardeshi said, “Residents of Dharavi are strictly following all lockdown rules. No one is leaving their homes. We took the drone over Dharavi and saw the images. All streets were empty, no one was walking around. This is unlike some other areas in Mumbai, such as the E ward (Byculla in south Mumbai), where people venture out of their homes despite the situation. This must be very difficult for them as their homes are small. But they are aware of the consequences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mission-dharavi-tough-not-impossible/story-5VoHZ2IWQ2XlzDPsGeG93K.html
30-04-2020||Mumbai||Maha sees worst 24-hour toll of 32; tally now 9,915||The state on Wednesday recorded 597 new Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 9,915, even as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) projected that cases in Maharashtra’s five districts —Mumbai city, Mumbai suburban, Pune, Palghar and Thane — could collectively cross 37,000 by May 15. Of the new infections, Mumbai recorded 475 of them, taking its tally to 6,644. The state recorded its highest single-day toll with 32 deaths, including 26 in Mumbai, taking the total fatalities to 432. The state also recorded its highest number of recoveries in a day with 205 discharged on Wednesday, the health department said.The rising number of cases would strain the healthcare infrastructure, including ventilators, beds with oxygen, and ICU beds in the state. The Centre has also projected that Mumbai could fall short of isolation beds with oxygen supply, while Pune and Mumbai could fall short of ventilators by May 11.Mumbai, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) that includes Palghar and Thane districts, and Pune have the maximum number of cases in Maharashtra. Thane and Palghar districts have 757 and 294 cases respectively. Pune district, meanwhile, has recorded 1,192 coronavirus cases.According to the projection of the ministry, Covid-19 cases in Mumbai (city and suburban districts) will reach 28,859 by May 15, while Pune, Thane and Palghar will touch 3,949, 4,181 and 295, respectively. The doubling rate for Mumbai’s projection, taken as the input value for the mathematical model, was 7.7 days. While for Pune, it was 9.7 days, for Thane it was 7.4 days and for Palghar, it was 20 days.Mumbai, which has the highest number of Covid-19 patients, could fall short of isolation beds with oxygen supply by May 11, the projection said. With the spike in cases, Mumbai would be short of 421 ventilators and Pune will be short of 40 ventilators by May 11. Besides, Mumbai will be short of 20,462 isolation beds with oxygen.The state health department, however, dismissed the projection and said that multiple mathematical models have given various projections and said that it is basing its plans on a “realistic” assessment.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state may plan to shift asymptomatic patients in Mumbai into home quarantine as per the revised guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “It is being said that beds aren’t available in Mumbai; there have been such complaints. As per the new guidelines of the ICMR, asymptomatic patients can be kept in home quarantine. In Mumbai, 83% of patients are asymptomatic; it may be possible to shift some of them who are not that severe into home quarantine. That way, beds would be made available.He added that the doubling rate in Mumbai has improved from seven days to 10 days now. “The doubling rate in Mumbai has gone to 10 days, which is better than India’s doubling rate that stands at 9 days now. The mortality rate has also reduced. Everybody is focused on Mumbai,” he said.Tope said that institutional quarantine is being ramped up in Mumbai. He assured that the state health department and the civic body is prepared for any level of spike. “We have taken the decision to use big grounds to set up beds for institutional quarantine. Oxygen line will be kept beside the beds. No matter how big the spike in Mumbai, we are preparing accordingly…As we say, hope for the best and prepare the worst,” he said.“There are many projection models and no model is perfect. We are making sufficient arrangements based on our analytical assessment. We have adequate infrastructure available with us in various districts to deal with the cases. We are planning on a realistic level. We are seeing the growth rate of the cases in Mumbai and Pune and planning in accordance,” said Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner (family welfare) and director, National Health Mission, Maharashtra.The Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday said stranded migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students will be allowed to move with conditions during lockdown. The Maharashtra government is preparing guidelines to transport the stranded migrants and other people in the state.Nodal authorities will be appointed to register the stranded persons. Since the transfer of people will be done by road, the state transport department has kept around 10,000 ST buses ready for the transfer, an official said. Around 20 to 22 people can be seated in one bus, keeping social distancing norms in mind. Around 1.5 lakh people can be transported through the ST buses. The state is also in talks with private bus operators to provide buses.Meanwhile, Tope took stock of the measures taken in Malegaon in Nashik district as the cases in the area have soared in the past few days, making it another hotspot in the state. According to Tope, the 171 Covid-19 patients in Malegaon are asymptomatic and none of them are critical. “The situation is Malegaon is in control. The spread is in a cluster. We have appointed 100 people, including doctors, nurses and paramedical staff for the city. The close contacts will be given hydroxychloroquine as per the guidelines of the ICMR,” Tope said. The state home department deployed the State Reserve Police Force in Satranjipur of Nagpur city, which alone has recorded 84 Covid-19 cases.Maharashtra so far has tested 1,37,159 samples, of which 1,26,376 were negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-worst-24-hour-toll-of-32-tally-now-9-915/story-l8MEIr7n4YRTMu8IHn4LBO.html
30-04-2020||Lucknow||Muslims take out Hindu man’s funeral procession in Meerut||Muslims set an example of communal harmony in Shahpeer Gate area of old Meerut when they carried out the funeral procession of their Hindu neighbour who died of a prolonged illness on Tuesday. Ramesh Mathur, 65, a caretaker of ‘Kayasth Dharamshala’ (lodge) in Shahpeer Gate area died of a disease he was suffering from a long time. Ramesh’s eldest son Komal Mathur was stuck up in Delhi due to lockdown while he lived in lodge with his other son Chandramouli Mathur. Ramesh’s relatives could not come due to lockdown and that’s when his Muslim neighbours stepped in. “None of Ramesh’s relatives could come due to lockdown. His elder son was stuck up in Delhi and his younger son, Chandramouli, couldn’t carry out the funeral arrangements and procession alone. Since we have been neighbours for long we decided to help arrange for final rites,” said Hifazzur Rehman, Ramesh’s neighbor. The Muslim neighbours first helped the son of the deceased prepare the bier and later took part in the funeral procession while maintaining social distancing.“Here we are living and helping each other since many years. Even our ancestors were living here with unity and harmony since 100 years,” said another neighbour Kriti Bhushan. “Muslim men brought mortal remains of a Hindu for cremation and made sure that last rites were performed as per Hindu traditions,” said Ramesh Sharma, the priest at Surajkund cremation ground. This is the second occasion when Muslims took out the funeral procession of a Hindu man after his relatives failed to reach for the last rites. On March 28 after the death of Ravi Shankar, 40, who died due to cancer in Anand Vihar colony of Bulandshahr, Muslims came forward and helped family with last rites. In fact, they not only participated in the funeral procession but also chanted ‘Ram Naam Satya Hai’ (Lord’s name is eternal) in keeping with the Hindu tradition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/muslims-take-out-hindu-man-s-funeral-procession-in-meerut/story-hLPqL3aDrbD1cvfT4AkWJM.html

30-04-2020||Lucknow||Agra records above 400 cases in a month’s time||The Taj city has registered an alarming increase in COVID-19 cases in about a month’s time. The city which had only 12 positive tested COVID-19 cases by March end, had reported 425 cases till Wednesday. Of these 425, 11 patients admitted in isolation ward of the city hospital have died, officials said.“The number of COVID-19 positive tested cases as on Wednesday is 425. We are in control as most of these cases are from hotspot areas already under our vigil and sealed from rest of city. Beside 13 more were discharged after getting well and in all 69 of those who tested positive have been cured and discharged from isolation wards,” said district magistrate of Agra Prabhu N Singh.Agra is ranked 11th among most affected districts nationally. Agra had five positive cases on March 2. Back then administration took it as challenge and adopted a proactive approach. It reached 1.96 lakh houses and all suspects were screened.The numbers rose in March when 12 positive tested cases were reported but 8 were discharged.However, the numbers increased sharply after the Tablighi Jamaat members were spotted. The positive contacts at a city hospital in April too contributed in a big way. “The list of 425 positive cases at present includes doctors, health workers, cops, vegetable vendors, pregnant women, pharma dealers,” officials said. The UP government has appointed Alok Kumar as nodal officer in Agra to look after measures taken to control the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/agra-records-above-400-cases-in-a-month-s-time/story-1959dGgHtpi7NOEDd8gizJ.html
30-04-2020||City||Maharashtra health minister says Mumbai’s first plasma therapy experiment successful||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday has said that the first plasma therapy experiment in the city conducted at Lilavati Hospital has been successful. With the experiment’s success on Wednesday, the state hopes that the therapy will prove useful in treating coronavirus patients by strengthening their immune system.“Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi has informed me about the successful experiment at Lilavati. Another such experiment is being conducted at BYL Nair Hospital, which is a specialised hospital for Covid-19 patients. We are confident that the trial at Nair Hospital too, would be successful,” state health minister Rajesh Tope said.The health minister had added that if all the guidelines pertaining to the donor and recipient are followed and approved by the ethics committee, the success rate of the treatment is very satisfactory. Tope also said that the state government has been planning to use the therapy effectively in Pune, where the number of patients is very high. After the Centre’s nod, the state has begun the plasma therapy experiments at government as well as private hospitals. The Union health ministry and the state health department had earlier made an appeal to recovered Covid-19 patients to come forward and donate their blood for collection of convalescent plasma for transfusion into other positive patients. The convalescent plasma therapy uses antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to treat others. This could also help in immunising the front-line workers, including doctors, family members of the patients and their high-risk contacts to restrict the spread. The Union health ministry had also however, on Tuesday stated that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has not given a clearance for its usage as a prescribed treatment for the infection. The ministry also said that the therapy is at an experimental stage and is only one of the many ways of treatment. Though the state has been conducting experiments, the plasma therapy trials require the Drug Controller of India and ICMR’s nod, said state officials. “The tests are being conducted at municipal and governmental levels as well as by private hospitals and the results are varying. Though it can prove beneficial to some patients, it has some shortcomings too,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-health-minister-says-mumbai-s-first-plasma-therapy-experiment-successful/story-vuX3JAqBgTGERkVMa2gkBO.html
30-04-2020||Lucknow||Health workers, police attacked in Kanpur; CM for invoking NSA||A group of 20-30 people attacked health workers and policemen, pelting them with stones on Nala Road in Kanpur’s Bajaria locality, a Covid-19 hotspot, on Wednesday when nine members of a family who had been in close contact with a coronavirus positive patient were being taken to a quarantine facility, the police said.The incident led to chief minister Yogi Adityanath asking the police to invoke provisions of the Gangsters Act and the National Security Act (NSA) besides the Indian Penal Code, the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act against the attackers.Kanpur’s senior superintendent of police Anant Deo also said the police would invoke NSA. Kanpur’s superintendent of police, West, Anil Kumar said five people were arrested and 10 others detained. The police were ascertaining their roles in attacking the corona warriors and damaging public property, Kumar said.“Security has been beefed up with additional deployment of police personnel and Provincial Armed Constabulary. The situation is under control,” said district magistrate Brahmdeo Ram Tiwari.For his part, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, “I want to make it clear to the police to identify those who attacked the police and medical teams in Kanpur. Besides acting against them under provisions of the Epidemic Act, Disaster Management Act and IPC, the Gangster Act and the National Security Act should also be invoked because these people are working as coronavirus carriers and disturbing order in the society. We cannot tolerate this.”“A handful of people are trying to disturb order when health workers, sanitation staff and doorstep delivery personnel are striving to protect 23 crore people of the state. We have given clear orders and there should be no hesitation in acting against those responsible for doing so,” he said.(WITH PTI INPUTS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/health-workers-police-attacked-in-kanpur-cm-for-invoking-nsa/story-jXfKMLnVspX5zv6T9f4i4M.html
30-04-2020||Lucknow||Routine immunisation programme set for a launch in UP||Even as Sars-Cov-2 continues to spread its tentacles in the state, the Uttar Pradesh health and family welfare department has decided to launch routine immunization programme to protect children and mothers from various diseases.Due to the nationwide lockdown announced on March 25 to fight the pandemic, the routine immunization programme across the state came to a standstill. The health department staff, including doctors, paramedics and frontline workers- accredited social health activist (ASHA) and auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) --were deputed in the drive launched by the state government to check the spread of coronavirus, said a health department officer.Each year the health department also launches immunization drive in rural and urban areas of the 38 districts in eastern UP and terai region under the Dastak programme to vaccinate children against Japanese Encephalitis and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome.The health department launched the first phase of the immunization drive for protection from Japanese Encephalitis and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome in February, before the onset of the pandemic, said secretary health and family welfare, V Hekali Zhimomi. Under the intensive vaccination programme organized in 38 districts, the department had vaccinated 1.14 crore children, she said.The second round of the immunization and awareness programme is organized in June – July before during the monsoon when JE/ AES outbreak is reported in the 38 districts. The health department would prepare a work plan for immunization of the left over children as well awareness before the onset of the monsoon, she said. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said the health department had decided to launch home based new borne care (HBNC) and village health nutrition day (VHND) programme to check maternal and infant mortality rate in the state. The department had directed all the district magistrates and chief medical officers (CMOs) to launch the HBNC and VHND programme in districts from next week, he said.The health department has divided the 75 districts into three categories. The programme will remain suspended in 18 districts in which 20 or more than 20 Covid positive cases have been reported. In 40 districts in which less than 20 cases have been reported, the immunization programme will not be organized in the localities and villages in which positive cases have been detected. The programme would be organized in the remaining areas of the districts, he said.The immunization programme will be organized across the 17 districts in which no case has been reported since the spread of the Covid pandemic in the state. If any case was reported in the district, then the CMO would revise the immunization drive according to the guideline issued by the department, he said.During the immunization programme, the accredited social health activist (ASHA) will follow the guidelines for protection from Covid. If during the immunization programme she detected symptom in the child or mother she would immediately alert the CMO, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/routine-immunisation-programme-set-for-a-launch-in-up/story-RKRseAbrSIzh215mlO1FxI.html
30-04-2020||Lucknow||To protect corona warriors, UP set to bring ‘stricter’ ordinance||The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday decided to bring an ordinance with provisions stricter than the central law to protect corona warriors against attacks or misbehavior.The new law -- Uttar Pradesh Epidemic Disease Control Ordinance-2020 – has a broad scope of coverage and strict provisions to protect corona warriors, including medical officers, health workers, para-medical staff, policemen, sanitation workers etc, said a senior government officer, who did not want to be named.Speaking on the issue, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said: “Besides health teams and sanitation workers, government employees and representatives of various organisations are fighting against Covid-19. However, some people are working as corona carriers and attacking the medical teams and security personnel.This is a serious crime and cannot be tolerated. Keeping this in view, we have decided to make major amendments to the Epidemic Act-1897. The union government has recently amended the Epidemic Act-1897 to provide for imprisonment and penalty against attack on or misbehavior with medical and health teams. Besides this, we are also making provision for up to seven years’ imprisonment and up to Rs 5 lakh penalty for any attack on security personnel, sanitation workers and corona warriors.”The ordinance will provide zero tolerance towards crime against corona warriors and stringent punishment to those breaking lockdown, running away from quarantine centres or isolation wards or spitting to spread coronavirus, he said.Besides imprisonment of up to seven years, the new law is likely to provide for penalty of up to Rs 5 lakh on the offenders.“We are finalising the provisions to be incorporated in the draft ordinance to be placed before the state cabinet for approval soon. The ordinance will have stricter provisions,” the officer said when asked about how the state’s law would be different from the ordinance promulgated by the President.The union government’s new law was brought by amending the Epidemic Act-1897 and focuses on protecting doctors and health workers.The chief minister gave his nod for the ordinance after holding discussions with his ministers and senior officers at a meeting of Team-11 to review the lockdown here on Wednesday.Yogi also asked his team to increase the capacity of dedicated Covid-19 hospitals’ beds (L-1, L-2, and L-3) to 52,000. He said a capacity of 1 lakh beds should be created on a war footing within a month and added that safety protocol for protection against infection should be followed in all Covid-19 hospitals.The chief minister said corona testing should be increased and pool testing encouraged. He said availability of essential commodities to people must be ensured during the lockdown and action should be taken against those indulging in black marketing, hoarding and under-weighing.Yogi said services of volunteers of Yuvak Mangal Dal, Nehru Yuva Kendra, NCC and NSS should be taken for community surveillance work. He also said self-help groups (SHGs) should be involved in providing food to those lodged in quarantine centres and shelter homes. The chief minister said efforts should be made to convert ‘red’ zones into ‘orange’ and ‘orange’ zones into ‘green’ and that a work plan was being prepared to restart industrial activity in ‘orange’ and ‘green’ zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/to-protect-corona-warriors-up-set-to-bring-stricter-ordinance/story-HDOvmFBojvUH6L6WWETZ8M.html

As the period for custody ended, the CBI produced them before the special CBI court on Wednesday seeking extension of their custody for further investigation.The agency said they only got one day after their arrest to interrogate them on the various aspects of loans and debentures obtained from Yes Bank during the tenure of Rana Kapoor, co-founder and CEO of Yes Bank. The prosecution also claimed the accused have not cooperated in the questioning, hence the probing agency needs more time to unearth the conspiracy.The plea was objected by defence lawyers, Amit Desai and Subodh Desai, who submitted that the custodial interrogation of the two is not required. It was argued that the case is based on banking transaction and money trails, documents of which are available with the agency. They also submitted that everything is available in the form of record and argues that the accused need not be sent to CBI custody in times of Covid-19 pandemic.The court, after considering the arguments from both sides, extended the CBI custody of the two brothers for two more days till May 1.According to the CBI FIR, between April and June, 2018, Yes Bank invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures of DHFL, which is till date not redeemed. It is further alleged that Yes Bank had sanctioned loans to RKW Developers, where Dheeraj is a director, and that the whole amount was siphoned off by Kapil. CBI has alleged that in return, Wadhawans allegedly “paid kickback of ₹600 crore” to Kapoor and his family members in the form of loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-special-court-extends-cbi-custody-of-kapil-and-dheeraj-wadhawan-till-may-1/story-LqS9XEmBJSG29iihcvIxpL.html

30-04-2020||Gurugram||Faridabad closes border to Delhi, Gurugram likely to follow suit||Faridabad sealed the five entry (and exit) points from (to) Delhi on Wednesday, prohibiting the entry of all commuters, including essential workers, until May 3, while Gurugram is likely to follow suit, as Haryana sought to insulate itself from the wave of coronavirus disease cases in the capital. Gurugram’s chief coordinator for Covid-19 activities, VS Kundu, said that the Delhi-Gurugram borders are also likely to be sealed by Friday and the passes for inter-state movement had been put on hold. “Maybe from Thursday night or Friday morning, (Gurugram) borders will be sealed,” said Kundu, adding that a notification from the state government is awaited for the same.People who entered Delhi from Faridabad on Wednesday were informed that they would not be allowed to return. At least 5,000 police personnel were deployed across Faridabad to ensure the orders were complied with. Ambulances and vehicles ferrying essential items are exempt from the order, said officials.On Tuesday night, Faridabad deputy commissioner (DC), Yashpal Yadav, imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in the district, in view of the Covid-19 outbreak. Doctors, paramedical staff, police personnel and bank employees were allowed to move, after showing their IDs, but only until noon on Wednesday.“Those working in Delhi will have to make arrangements to live near their workplaces and will not be allowed to move in and out of the district,” Yadav explained.The DC’s order stated, “The district has tightened restrictions over the movement of government employees and regular people from other states and districts as the number of cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) rose in the district after people travelled to Faridabad and the virus was spread.”However, there is no bar on movement between Faridabad and the adjoining districts of Palwal and Gurugram, albeit, with requisite permissions. Barricades were set up at all traffic junctions and residential areas of Faridabad. The police deployed 5,000 personnel at 103 checkpoints and at least 35 each at nine locations that border Delhi, Palwal and Gurugram.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, Faridabad, said: “The recent Covid-19 cases are of those who had visited Delhi. So we are taking precautionary measures to ensure that the infection does not spread. For newspapers, the vehicles will be allowed to deliver the paper till the border and the distributors can pick them up from the borders.” So far, 50 positive cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in Faridabad. Haryana has a total of 311 and Delhi, 3,439. Panic-stricken residents criticised the order and called it ”insensitive” .Sanjeev Khurana, who owns a factory in Faridabad and resides in Sector 63, and travels frequently to Delhi to get raw materials, said that staying with acquaintances and friends in Delhi is not an option, as there is apprehension over the virus . “After this new order, we are stuck. What if the lockdown does not lift for another month? How will our families manage here? The officials are not ready to understand the circumstances that if we do not attend office, we might end up losing our jobs,” he said.Yadav said that vehicles transporting essential items and ambulances will be allowed to enter the district. “The movement passes issued by the district administration and police will be recognised but anyone found violating the rules and regulations will be penalised under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” he said.Factories in Faridabad which reopened on April 20, can make arrangements for their workers to stay on the factory premises or elsewhere within the city, said Yadav.Sanjeev Khemka, director, KCL Limited, which has a factory in Sector 24, said his company has “arranged rooms and food” for some workers and that others are locals. . However, a few factory owners said supervising staff, who live in Delhi, won’t be able to make it to work.Meanwhile, the Gurugram administration said that the borders with Delhi were not sealed, but that it has increased surveillance at all interstate and interdistrict borders.Amit Khatri, DC, Gurugram, said, “The borders connecting Delhi will not be sealed. We will monitor the situation and changes will be made after the cases are under control. Unregulated movement at the Gurugram-Delhi borders will not be allowed. We will strictly enforce a restriction on vehicular movement to prevent infection from spreading. The effort is to increase the screening in the cross movement.”At the Sirhaul border on Wednesday morning, traffic congestion and long queues were witnessed due to the checks.Mohammad Akil, the commissioner of police, Gurugram, said his teams are checking each vehicle entering in the city. “All the vehicles carrying vegetables and essential items will also be checked to ensure no smuggling of illicit liquor and illicit drugs,” he said.Haryana home affairs minister Anil Vij on Tuesday said that at least 15 people who tested positive for the coronavirus disease in Haryana recently, contracted the disease in Delhi. Vij said that his government has asked the Delhi government to provide accommodation to Haryana residents who work in the Capital so that they are not required to travel back into the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/faridabad-closes-border-to-delhi-gurugram-likely-to-follow-suit/story-pmDbv4eV45I8bKeyiuC5FM.html
30-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Factories in the lurch as inter-state travel curbs hit supply chain, availability of labour||With Haryana increasing restrictions on interstate travel to and from Delhi, industry owners in the district are uncertain as to when production activities in Manesar, Udyog Vihar, Daulatabad and Basai will resume. While they were hopeful that the period after April 20 would allow for the resumption of factories, at least at a reduced capacity, sealing of the state’s borders have left them in the lurch again, said industry owners.Gurugram is the centre of manufacturing and business in North India; yet it looks like the restrictions, especially regarding the inter-state movement to and from Delhi, will create problems in return to normalcy.Faridabad, also a factory hub, sealed all five of its borders with Delhi on Wednesday, imposing a ban on the entry of all commuters, including essential workers. In Gurugram, curbs on non-essential travel to and from Delhi started Tuesday, while the issuance of interstate travel passes was also put on hold.VS Kundu, chief coordinator for Covid-19 in Gurugram, said that an official notification to seal the Gurugram’s borders also is expected by Thursday. “Interstate movement with Delhi would likely to be put on hold, maybe from Thursday night or Friday morning,” he said.In a message to the press on Wednesday, Amit Khatri, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said, “If anyone needs to come from Delhi to Gurugram for work, we would advise them to make arrangements to remain here.”Transporters have been refusing to accept bookings for ferrying goods and raw materials to and from Gurugram due to the curbs, said factory owners. “We are not able to procure either raw materials from Delhi, nor are we able to get rid of the old stock by sending it outside the district,” said Animesh Saxena, general secretary of the Garment Export and Manufacturing Association.“Not just Delhi, the news has created panic and truckers are refusing to provide services to other states also,” Saxena said.Gurugram shares 11 borders with Delhi and three of them — Kapashera, Sirhaul and MG Road — are vital business lifelines. There are 2,200 manufacturing units in IMT Manesar, up to 1,000 in Udyog Vihar, 500 in Sector 37, besides a few in Daulatabad and Basai, according to the Gurugram Industrial Association.About half of them are involved in automobiles, component manufacturing for automobiles and allied industries, followed by garment manufacturers, packaging and consumer goods, and pharmaceuticals, all of which are now uncertain about when production will resume.Explaining that many micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) rely on wholesale markets in Delhi to procure raw materials, Sunil Panwar of the IMT Industrial Association said, “If they shut the borders with Delhi, a lot of raw material will simply not reach us. This will adversely affect those mainly working in garments and plastics, not so much automobiles, which have a more elaborate and global supply chain.”Umesh Dwivedi, an MSME proprietor in Daulatabad, said, “Even if, through some dedicated effort, raw materials do reach us, finished goods will not be allowed to renter Delhi.”Additionally, the presence of factory owners and managerial staff residing in Delhi is needed to ensure that social distancing norms and guidelines for the safety of labour are followed. “If they cannot come to work and supervise, how will things continue? The workers cannot operate on their own,” Dwivedi said.According to industry owners, the ministry of home affairs’ guidelines on the resumption of industries are better suited to MSMEs, which employ fewer people and operate with smaller capacities. While automobile manufacturers have been given permission to resume their work, many smaller unit owners are still awaiting permission. However, MSMEs, which are dependent on less-complicated supply chains, would have been able to resume activities and enforce social distancing much faster, proprietors said.Panwar said, “Automobile manufacturers will take at least another 20 days to take stock of materials all along their supply chain, which is more complex and spread across the globe. MSMEs could easily have enforced social distancing and continued work, but permissions for many of them have not been granted yet. It will be hard to resume work if Delhi borders are sealed.”An industry owner estimated that if the lockdown is lifted after May 3, it will take at least three months for production to gain momentum. Ashok Kohli, president, Chamber of Industries, Udyog Vihar, said, “Even after lockdown is relaxed, the normalcy in the industry sector will return in at least three months, or not before September. By then, summer will be over and products manufactured for sale in summer will lose their value. The supply chain has been disrupted and workers, in large numbers, have left. The fear of the virus will remain until we find a cure. The industry has been set back by three years in terms of production and to compensate for the loss, it may take as much time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-factories-in-the-lurch-as-inter-state-travel-curbs-hit-supply-chain-availability-of-labour/story-xkWKrZoC6jhWbpjbQdJ5lO.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||After Faridabad border sealing, essential service providers appeal for help||The sealing of the Delhi-Haryana border at Faridabad could hit essential services, senior government officials warned on Wednesday and assured that the administration, police and civic agencies were making alternative arrangements to ensure their frontline workers were able to come to work every day.The Faridabad district administration on Wednesday afternoon completely sealed its border with Delhi to insulate itself from Covid cases from across the border in Delhi. People were earlier allowed to enter or leave Faridabad by showing curfew passes or heir identity cards if they came under essential services listed by the government. Many employees of Delhi’s three civic bodies, Delhi Police and those from crucial departments such as health, Delhi Jal Board and District Disaster Management Authority come to Delhi for work every day from different parts of Faridabad and its adjoining areas. Apart from government employees, there are many who cross the border daily and come to south and south-east Delhi to work at milk shops, grocery stores and pharmacies . HT has learnt from senior government’s officials that Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal has directed chief secretary Vijay Dev and police commissioner SN Shrivastava to devise a plan to provide local accommodation to health workers and essential service providers so that they do not have to travel daily.“The plan is not yet ready. It will be in place in a day or two,” said a senior government officialDelhi Police is already providing accommodation to around 675 of its junior personnel at different hotels and guest houses in the city. Senior officials said the Delhi government had already commenced talks with its Haryana counterparts to ensure that at least some essential service workers were able to travel. For health workers directly working in designated Covid-19 hospitals and quarantine centres, the Delhi government has booked hotels and guest houses.Home Minister Satyendar Jain confirmed the state government had started talks with Haryana. “We are in touch with the Haryana and UP governments. We hope they allow the movement of those catering to essential services, especially health workers,” Jain said.The Uttar Pradesh government, has till now, not sealed its borders with Delhi completely and is allowing movement on the basis of curfew passes and identity cards.Delhi Police officials said that on Wednesday they contacted the management of different colleges and told them to try and accommodate some of its personnel at their hostels. A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that a few hostels have offered to house the policemen. Over 5,000 policemen come to Delhi from Faridabad every day.From managing containment zones, security on the roads, feeding the homeless and ensuring social distancing across the city -- police are at the forefront in this fight against Covid-19. “Most of our junior staff — constables, head constables, assistant sub-inspectors — come from Faridabad or adjoining areas.. There will be some problems but we are prepared. We have hotels and guest houses for now but will need more space. We are rationing our workforce in order to maintain social distancing. Many police stations are working with 66-70% strength. Many who come from that side of Haryana are already on leave,” said the Delhi Police official. Government officials said this was the first time since the anti-Sikh riots that the border had been completely sealed.The border closure hampered services in Delhi hospitals, with healthcare workers unable to report for duty. At Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, the duty rosters had to be changed on Wednesday because of thin attendance.“Around 25 to 30% of the hospital staff come from outside the state. We have had to change the duty rosters, but it is a temporary measure. People finishing their shifts are being asked to stay on and help. But this cannot be sustained,” said a doctor from the hospital.Apart from those working in Covid wards, the hospital has been unable to organise any lodging accommodation for the others.“There were a few people who had come for duty and hen got stuck in Delhi. They have been accommodated in the hostel, but that cannot be done for too many people. People on Covid-19 duty have already been provided hotel accommodation. It is not possible or feasible to do so for all hospital staff,” said the doctor.Private hospitals nears border areas like Apollo and Fortis (Escorts, Vasant Kunj, and Gurugram) will face problems if healthcare professionals are not allowed to cross the border. “Yes, we are facing problems due to this. We are hopeful the Delhi and Haryana governments will resolve the issue. This will help our staff in rendering patient care to all,” said an official spokesperson from Indraprastha Apollo Hospital.At least 400 staff in two Fortis hospitals -- one in Delhi, one in Gurugram -- live across the borders“This is like drawing resources away. As it is there is a shortage of staff in the hospitals,” said Dr PK Bharadwaj, secretary, Delhi Voluntary Hospitals Forum.A 39-year-old Auxiliary Nursing Midwife (ANM) at a dispensary in central Delhi, who did not wish to be named, said she couldn’t go to the dispensary on Wednesday due to restrictions on the Delhi-Haryana border near Sonipat following the Haryana government’s decision.“Due to the lockdown, we were somehow managing to report to duty. But after the Haryana government’s recent decision, it has become impossible to cross the border. What if they completely seal this border too? This is for the first time I am working from home. Since morning I’m coordinating with Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers regarding the door-to-door survey. But it is not possible to work like this,” she said.The 39-year-old has been working as with the Delhi government dispensary for the past 13 years.The Union of Delhi’s contractual healthcare workers (National Health Mission-Reproductive Child Health Contractual Employees Welfare Society—Delhi) has also written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, BJP MLA from Badarpur , which lies in south-east Delhi and shares border with Faridabad, said that a lot of essential services provides couldn’t make it to work on Wednesday.“I’m getting complaints and requests regarding water supply and shortage of ration from some centres. The people who could have addressed the problem couldn’t make it to work on Wednesday . The Haryana government has taken the right decision as it wants to protect its people. The Delhi government too should either make arrangement for their (people from Faridabad) stay here or talk to Haryana government and make special arrangements,” said Bidhuri.Bidhuri said hundreds of sanitation workers, mostly posted in the south-east and south districts, live in Faridabad, Ballabhgarh and residential neighbourhoods near the Delhi-Faridabad border. “There are so many sanitation workers who live just near the Delhi-Faridabad border and were majorly hit because of the restrictions,” he added.The three civic bodies of Delhi said they are ready to open their primary schools and community centres if such sanitation workers needed a place to stay in Delhi. Until Wednesday night, they were yet to issue an order.In areas of south-east Delhi, such as Sarita Vihar and Kalkaji, many shopkeepers said that their delivery boys and employees had not reported for work because of the ban . “Two of my employees are residents of Ballabhgarh. They would help me deliver milk, grocery at DDA flats in Sarita Vihar. They couldn’t come today. I will now have to either stop home delivery or shut shop,” said Rajen Krishna, who runs a department store.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-faridabad-border-sealing-essential-service-providers-appeal-for-help/story-BaReKOgIWPb6TlPBKL6wzK.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||In times of Covid-19, mohalla clinics, small hospitals take lead in treating other illnesses||With major hospitals focusing on treating patients with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), secondary care hospitals, dispensaries and mohalla clinics have taken the lead in providing health care services to patients with health problems other than Covid-19.At the 100-bed Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital in East Delhi’s Khichripur area, doctors still treat around 1,200 patients daily in out-patient clinics. “Earlier, we used to get cases only from neighbouring areas; now people from all over Delhi are coming to our clinics. There is a lot of rush in the out-patient clinics, which should have reduced during the lockdown. We try to tell people to maintain one-metre distance, but it is becoming very challenging,” a senior doctor at the hospital said on condition of anonymity.At the mohalla clinics, doctors over the age of 60 years have been given the option of not working, as older people are at a higher risk of developing the infections. Yet, many continue to work.Around 360 of the 450 clinics across the city are still operational .“Around 180 to 200 patients are still coming to my clinic—a little more than the number I get usually—most of them from far off places. The bigger hospitals in the area have either closed their OPDs or curtailed them; those patients are also coming to me,” a doctor from a mohalla clinic in East Delhi said on condition of anonymity. The doctor said he dons a mask and gloves and uses sanitiser constantly. To maintain social distancing among patients, he asks them to queue one metre apart from each other outside the portacabin.“Most private clinics across the city are still shut because doctors find it difficult to take adequate measures to prevent infections. The fear set in after some of the doctors from clinics started testing positive. Now, many provide telephonic consultation or patients go to the emergency departments of hospitals,” Dr Girish Tyagi, president-elect of Delhi Medical Association, said.In Shahdara district, the government is still operating more than 40 mohalla clinics despite the district having seven containment zones, including Dilshad Garden—one of the first 10 Covid-19 hotspots in the country.“Of the 45 mohalla clinics, 42 are operational and we see close to 100 patients in each clinic. The mohalla clinic in Babarpur, where the doctor tested positive, is also operating. We provide all the necessary equipment, including face shields, to our doctors and staff and advised them to ensure social distancing at the clinics,” a district medical officer said on condition of anonymity. In another West Delhi clinic, a doctor has been interacting with residents of a nearby slum to explain to them what “social distancing” is and why it is important.“People do not understand why they should not step out of their houses, they do not understand why they shouldn’t talk to their neighbours. I have spoken to several people in the locality to try and explain the infection to them. Now, at least, they make it a point to cover their faces and sit at a distance even when they step out of their homes in the evening,” the doctor said, asking not to be identifiedBut all is not well at the mohalla clinics. The clinics are facing issues in getting medicines on time and testing people. “There have been some issues in getting the medicines to the clinics—logistical issues because of the lockdown,” the district medical officer said. “All tests have stopped since the lockdown in March because the technician who collected the samples is unable to do so. We are yet to get reports of the samples collected in March,” a second doctor who asked not to be named said. A third doctor added: “Even if they could come, it is impossible to maintain a one-metre distance while taking samples and the technicians do not have personal protective gear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-times-of-covid-19-mohalla-clinics-small-hospitals-take-lead-in-treating-other-illnesses/story-vdjilQYPfZcSEpAoxRIDDO.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||Patparganj hospital closed for 3 days after TB specialist doctor tests positive||One of the public hospitals for respiratory diseases in east Delhi, Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Chest Hospital in Patparganj, had to be shut for three days on Tuesday following a 63-year-old doctor here testing positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The doctor was a Tuberculosis specialist and is said to have attended to dozens of patients in the last two weeks. He is now admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital in Tahirpur.“He suffers from hyper-anxiety. This is the only pre-existing medical condition we know of. Currently, we are not sure how he got infected, but we are helping the district administration trace his contacts,” said Arun Kumar, spokesperson of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, which runs this hospital.At least 55 other doctors, nurses and lower staff, who work here and have interacted with him in the last few days, have been quarantined at home for three days to check if they develop any symptoms. “The names of two staff members who worked closely with him—an X-Ray technician and a ward boy—have been sent for Covid tests,” said a doctor who works here but declined to give his name.The hospital complex—which includes a maternity centre, an Ayurveda centre and a Homeopathy centre—is being sanitised thoroughly. It is a 48-bed hospital that provides essential services to poor patients for respiratory diseases like sputum AFB microscopy test, bronchoscopy and CB Net. At least 150 patients come here daily. “We hope to reopen it by Friday,” Kumar said.Meanwhile, a 26-year-old gynaecologist working at the North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Kasturba Hospital near Jama Masjid was also found Covid-positive on Wednesday, following which at least seven doctors and four nurses, who worked closely with her, have been quarantined at home. “They will be tested soon,” the north body’s spokesperson Ira Singhal said.Kasturba Hospital is the second biggest hospital of the north corporation after Hindu Rao Hospital in Malka Ganj. The Hindu Rao Hospital had to be shut for a day, on Sunday, following a nurse testing Covid-positive there.A ward helper also tested Covid-positive at the north body’s Rajan Babu TB Hospital in GTB Nagar on Tuesday night. “Her husband, who also works in the same hospital, has tested negative. Three other ward helpers have been asked to quarantine themselves at home,” Singhal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/patparganj-hospital-closed-for-3-days-after-tb-specialist-doctor-tests-positive/story-BGlz33EVc1Ch6lU18hLIKI.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||To speed up testing, Delhi govt says no to Noida lab||To speed up testing in Delhi, the government on Wednesday ordered that no sample must be sent to central-government-run National Institute of Biologicals (NIB) in Noida till the end of the week. The samples that were being sent to the Noida-lab will be redistributed among the other government laboratories in the city.The Delhi government had on Tuesday raised the issue of delay in test results in a meeting with union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan. A day later, the Delhi government order clarified that NIB was the culprit.“The RT-PCR tests have to be performed expeditiously in Delhi for the containment zones and the patients admitted. The samples collected from different districts are being sent to various government and private labs, majorly to NIB, Noida in the last 15 days. It has been observed that there is considerable pendency for testing reports in NIB which is hindering the effective containment of the disease [sic],” the Delhi government order said.Similar orders have been issued in previous weeks.“We have not been sending our samples to the NIB for at least a week now. The reports were taking about a week. The problem is without the positive results, even though we tell people to remain in quarantine, they end up going to local shops, etc. If this happens for a week, imagine the number of people that could be infected. We need the reports as soon as possible so we can admit them to Covid centres,” a district health official said.There has been a tussle between the Delhi and UP governments for the use of the laboratory’s resources, sources who know of the matter said. “The laboratory has been chosen for district sampling because of its huge capacity, but the pendency is high and there has been a tussle between who should use its resources as the UP government has also been sending several samples to the facility, leading to a long waiting time,” the person said.In most Covid-19 designated hospitals, microbiology laboratories are equipped to do the Covid-19 tests, meaning there are no delays.“Usually it takes two days at the latest to get the reports in the hospital. However, the wait time has gone up by around a day since other samples have started coming in. Our laboratory is equipped to manage our cases,” a doctor from Lok Nayak Hospital said. The government has also come up with a coding mechanism for the samples being sent to the lab—CCC for Covid Care Centres, CTC for Covid Test Centres, CHC for Covid Health Centres, and CZ for containment zone. This is to be followed by the numerical district code 01 – 11, followed by a three-digit code for the facility. Samples coming from hospitals will be marked with their initials such as LNJP, RGSSH, LHMC, RML etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-speed-up-testing-govt-says-no-to-noida-lab/story-10JI1c6BU4kzU5CmIVvMPP.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||In the shadow of a Covid Care Centre in Narela, local residents live in fear||Pratap Chauhan always called the area where he lives a ghost town. Every evening, as he stood on the terrace of his fourth-floor flat with his wife and daughter, all he saw were rows and rows of empty and dark apartment buildings without a soul in sight; a scene, he says, that depressed him.But in mid- March, those buildings began to shimmer to life over the span of a few days. Then, he began to see people on the balconies of those buildings. But, ironically, the brightly lit buildings and people, instead of lifting his mood, left him feeling anxious. For the buildings were part of a Covid-19 Care Centre in Narela , one of the largest quarantine facilities in the country, where hundreds of people, including those who attended a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin in March and tested positive, have been quarantined in the past one and a half month.The city has seven Covid Care Centres and, as on Wednesday, according to the Delhi State Health Bulletin, the facility in Narela housed 473 of 985 Covid-19 patients admitted in these centres. The army took over the daytime management of the Narela quarantine centre on April 16, while the Delhi government’s health department manages it at night.“Earlier, we were the only ones in this uninhabited urban jungle. Now we have company. But I am worried. While I have heard that the virus does not travel through air, you never know in the case of a new virus. Everyone in our apartment is living in fear,” Chauhan says.Till a month ago, the terrace of his apartment was where Chauhan went every evening with his family to overcome the claustrophobia of his cramped flat. But now he is wary of going there. “I can see the quarantined people on the roofs and balconies, and hear announcements on loudspeakers asking them to go inside. That makes me fearful,” he says.Chauhan is a resident of Arayavrat Apartment in Sector G-2, Narela, a sprawling complex of 2,156 LIG (low-income group) flats spread over an area of 4.71 hectares. The residents have, for the past five years, led an isolated life with little access to transport or social infrastructure.All Delhi Development Authority (DDA) flats around Chauhan’s complex are still empty. The DDA has so far offered 4,600-odd flats in Narela’s Sector G6 to the Delhi government to run the quarantine facility. Currently, about 1,000-odd flats are in use in different towers.Residents of Arayavrat Apartment say the area which not so long ago had the silence of a graveyard, suddenly began to buzz with activity –several white tents of security personnel came up; and all variety of vehicles from ambulances, police vans, cars and buses started speeding past their gate, often with sirens blaring.“Earlier, a creepy silence permeated the area, which had now been replaced by the horns and sirens of police vans and ambulances,” Ravi Chandra, another resident, says.Chandra can see the quarantine centre from his kitchen window, on the other side of an open field, about 300 metres away. “I liked the fresh air coming through the window every morning as I made tea. But now I keep all doors and windows shut and we prefer to wear masks even inside homes,” says Chandra, who lives with his wife and son.But the DDA said residents have little to fear. “The distance between the boundary walls of the quarantine facility and the nearest housing society may be 300 metres, but the main entries of the quarantine facility and the nearest residential complex is more than a kilometre from each other,” says Rajiv Gandhi, commissioner (housing) DDA.Shekhar Gaur, the guard of Arayavrat Apartment, says that his wife has been pressuring him to find another job, away from the quarantine centre. “But I remind her of doctors and other health care workers posted right inside the quarantine centre and doing their duty,” Gaur says.Initially, when the empty DDA flats were declared a quarantine centre, Gaur says he had a tough time telling vehicle drivers that the apartment complex was not a quarantine centre. “The area was new to most people and some of them confused our building for the quarantine centre. Now I keep the gates closed at all times,” Gaur says.Currently, about 400 families live in Arayavrat Apartment. “Some families left and some sent their children to relatives, fearing they might contract the virus,” says Dimple Rani, who lives with her husband and two children. “I am scared of letting my children stand even on the balconies now,” she says.Chauhan says what also instilled fear among the residents was the news that two of quarantined people at the centre tried to run away, though they were later caught. “We got worried what if someone ran away from there and entered our apartments,” he says.Dheerendra Rai, who lives with his father, says he regrets the fact that no one from any government agency has met them or tried to allay their fears. “They should at least undertake the sanitisation of the entire area on a regular basis, it was done only once, ” says Rai. “Earlier, all of us fervently wished that buildings in our vicinity were occupied; that we all got some social life. But I am not sure if this was what we bargained for.”“Such areas are closely monitored in adherence to guidelines issued by the Union health ministry. Other than that, teams from the subdivisional magistrate’s office periodically talk to community leaders and residents’ welfare body members to minimise their concerns regarding transmission as long as the stay indoors and follow social distancing norms,” a senior official from the district administration, on condition of anonymity, said.Chauhan says that there are also some positive aspects of having a quarantine centre in the vicinity. “Every other day, we used to hear about thefts and robbery, but not any more. The heavy security in the area keeps us safe from criminals, though I am not sure if we are safe from the coronavirus,” he says.Professor Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College & Safdarjung Hospital, says that the virus cannot travel through the air for more than one metre and anyone living in the vicinity of a quarantine centre need not worry. “Three hundred metres is quite a long distance. What the apartment people need to do is maintain general hygiene, and they should ensure no one spits in the open, ” he says, adding, “ Spraying the walls does not help; it is better to keep your doors, handles, lift button sanitised. ”The area in a 500m radius of the quarantine centre has been turned into a buffer zone, a senior medical officer in the north Delhi revenue district said. The buffer zone , the official said, is treated like a semi-containment zone with high surveillance, restricted movement of individuals and vehicles and staggered timings for shops selling essentials.A senior Delhi government official said, “All standard operating procedures have been followed at the facility. Residential areas are far off from the facility. People don’t have to worry”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-the-shadow-of-a-covid-care-centre-in-narela-local-residents-live-in-fear/story-Pfil52LAIXkgDM18scsbWK.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||In Delhi, pets abandoned, strays face cruelty due to Covid fear||The lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection has had an adverse impact on animal life in the city, according to animal lovers and activists.Members of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and activists say that instances of pets, mainly dogs and cats, being abandoned during the lockdown have gone up significantly, with most winding up at shelter homes. Besides, strays are being subjected to cruelty due to the Covid scare and also being run over by speeding vehicles.According to Frendicoes, which runs an animal hospital and asylum in Defence Colony, Delhi and Gopalpur, Haryana, there has been a three-fold rise in the number of pets left at its doorstep.“Earlier, we would get only about four or five pet dogs a month, but since the lockdown began, we have received 30 of them — ranging from puppies to old German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, Great Danes, Labradors and loal breeds — left at our facilities,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, executive member, Frendicoes.“We have counselled at least thrice the usual number of pet owners over the phone not to leave them (the pets). People cite reasons like inability to get cat or dog food, take them for a walk, or neighbours objecting to their presence. One man recently told me, ‘Mere chhote chhote bacche hain, unhe dog se corona ho gaya to?’ (I have small kids at home, what if they catch the infection from the pet?),” said Geeta Seshamani, vice-president of the organisation.Divya Puri, an animal lover, said Chennai-based Indian Veterinary Association (IVA) on April 1 issued a public notice stating: “To date, there is no evidence of companion animals spreading the disease.”This was after a report stated that a cat had tested positive for Covid-19 in Belgium.“We recently found a small Chow Chow dog tied to a pole and left to die in this searing heat in Jangpura. It is an expensive breed, costing no less than ₹50,000-60,000 in the market. This one was absolutely healthy, leading us to assume it’s a fallout of the Covid-19 fear,” Puri added.Many dog owners are simply keeping their pets in balconies and refusing to let them inside the house, Puri said.And stray dogs are suffering from bizarre incidents of cruelty. A resident of RK Puram recently reported two cases, wherein someone had poured a bucket of Savlon solution on a cat and phenol on a dog.“The cat’s eyes were affected, and in the case of the dog, the phenol went into its ears. Both had to be rushed to a veterinary hospital. I am convinced someone did it deliberately, trying to disinfect them in a very inhumane, unscientific and crude manner,” said Anusheh, the resident, who works with Indigree Angels Trust, an NGO. She gave only one name. Anusheh also said she recently buried nine dogs killed on the roads. “The roads are devoid of heavy traffic now and the animals can’t see many humans around, so they have become relaxed while crossing roads. Meanwhile, the few vehicles on the roads are speeding, leading to road kills,” she said.A wildlife rescuer in Delhi said the road kills are not just restricted to domesticated pets and stray dogs, but also to wild animals. “We are finding many dead mongoose and squirrels, which went under the wheels, around the forested ridge area,” said Abhinav Srihan, who runs Fauna Police, an NGO.There are also concerns about the impact of sodium hypochlorite, used by municipal corporations for sanitisation, on animals. “We are asking all persons, who find such cases (of animal poisoning), to send the carcasses for a post-mortem examination or viscera for testing toxicity,” said Gauri Maulekhi, a member of the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI).The health officer of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, Ashok Rawat, said, “We have not received any such complaint so far. Besides, this is a highly diluted solution, of only 1% sodium hypochlorite in 99% water, prepared as per the norms prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO).”A veterinary official of the municipality, who didn’t wish to be named, said it’s highly unlikely that a stray animal could die of ingesting the disinfectant liquid. “Dogs have a very strong sense of smell and sodium hypochlorite has a pungent smell. So it’s highly unlikely that an animal would even touch it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-delhi-pets-abandoned-strays-face-cruelty-due-to-covid-fear/story-DfBhY69bpedg9BvUL9ccWL.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Southwest district magistrate’s office reports three Covid-19 cases||At a time when local administrations in each of the 11 districts of Delhi are pulling out all stops to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the southwest district administration Wednesday suffered a setback with three officials in the district magistrate (DM)’s office testing positive for the coronavirus infection. This is the first instance of cases being reported from a DM’s office, Delhi health officials said. As per the Delhi government’s rules, an area has to be declared a containment zone if three or more Covid-19 cases are reported from there. “As soon as a place reports three positive cases, our officials declare the identified area as a containment zone. As of today, 90 of the 100 containment zones in Delhi have not reported any new Covid-19 case. So, our strict containment policy has helped prevent the spread of the virus,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said, during his daily media briefing Wednesday.When asked if this meant that the southwest DM’s office, too, would become a containment zone, a senior government official said that would not be possible as all Covid-19 management activities in that district are being carried out from the office complex.A senior official in the southwest DM’s office who is authorised to speak to the media, said their office is functioning as usual. “The entire office complex has been sanitised and social distancing is being maintained,” the official said.As a precautionary measure, DM (south-west) Rahul Singh has put himself in home quarantine, while 17 others, who were in close contact with the first official who tested positive, have been kept under observation at the Chaudhary Brahm Prakash Ayurvedic Hospital, which is a dedicated Covid-19 health centre.The disease spread in the DM’s office come to fore Sunday night when Singh’s personal secretary tested positive for Covid-19. “On Wednesday, we received the test reports of 17 others from DM’s office. Unfortunately, two civil defence volunteers have tested positive for Covid-19. Both are contacts of the first case (personal secretary to the DM),” the official said. The administration said contact tracing is currently being done and samples will be collected of their primary contacts.“The personal secretary, who was the first case from this office, is likely to have contracted the infection from Uttam Nagar. That’s where he lives and that area also has reported a number of Covid-19 cases. So, preliminary findings indicate that the virus was contracted from his area of residence. The 17 other staff members will be in isolation for the next few days before returning to work,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-southwest-district-magistrate-s-office-reports-three-covid-19-cases/story-FsJa8266EwrZA1VtPhDDCO.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 update: HIV+, stigmatised, GB Road sex workers stare at an uncertain future||A 25-year-old sex worker in Delhi’s GB Road pulled out a Rs 500 currency note from her gullakh (piggy bank) on Tuesday. “This is the last of my savings. Ab sab bhagwan bharose hai (now I have left everything on God),” she says, trying to mask her worry with a laugh.At GB Road, one of Delhi’s largest red light areas, corridors that echoed with the sounds of bangles, anklets and men haggling with brothel heads are eerily silent these days, the faint smell of jasmine gajras (flower headband) and ittar (perfume) has vanished; the balconies from where women called out to potential customers are also empty.Sitting in a room so small that it barely fits a single bed and a table fan, the 25-year-old woman and her friends say that since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on March 25 they have not earned a single penny.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“The area was barricaded and we were asked to close business. We were hoping that things will resume after a while, but now we do not know how we will survive,” she says.SELF RESPECT AND HUNGERIn the initial days of the lockdown, a few NGOs and philanthropists had taken care of their basic needs, such as groceries, but as days rolled on these women have been left to mostly fend for themselves. Cash strapped and uncertain about if they will be able to resume work at all, sex workers in the national capital are more worried about their survival than the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“How long will social organisations come and help us? Till when will people distribute food and groceries? Ultimately, everyone will be left alone to survive,” says a 32-year-old who had come to Delhi when she was 18 years old. She now has an eight-year-old daughter who is studying in Kolkata.“I have not even been able to send any money home this time. Starvation will kill us before this illness does,” she says.HIV AND COVID-19Delhi government estimates that nearly 986 women are engaged as sex workers in GB Road brothels. The living conditions are unsanitary and three to four women share one residential quarter, just big enough to allow three people to sleep side by side, making it impossible to observe the rules of social/physical distancing—a necessity to keep the viral infection at bay. Many women are also HIV positive because of the nature of their job, making them even more susceptible to contract the virus.Despite the health risks, women here are eager to resume work but the brothel heads are unsure when clients would return.“We are hearing that even if the lockdown ends there is no possibility that people would come to seek the services of women here. We have never witnessed anything like this before. Even when the economy goes down we managed to get customers, but times are different now,” says the head of one of the 250 brothels in the area, where the unofficial number of sex workers is 1,500. Social groups working with sex workers here say that in an unorganised set up such as this, women are highly vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases. Now, they will also run the risk of catching the coronavirus.“When the lockdown had started, we had gone there with volunteers to distribute groceries. We have asked them to call us if they need anything. These women are considering defiled, but it is the circumstances and society that brought them here (to this profession). At present, we are all responsible for each other. We all need to come together to help humanity,” says Sukhdev Bharadwaj, organisational head (Delhi-NCR) of Sewa Bharti, an organisation that works for the underprivileged.BROTHELS AS HOT SPOTS Sakhi, another NGO, which dedicatedly works with sex workers in GB Road, says the government will have to come up with a long-term plan for these women as their business is likely to be the worst affected. The organisation is conducting mental health counselling for the women here to help them tide over this pandemic. In these sessions, many women have expressed fear of the uncertainty of their future. “These women are not high-end escorts; they barely earn enough to survive. While the government is doing so much for migrant labourers and homeless, no one is talking about sex workers and transgenders (the now officially recognised third sex). The living conditions here are among the worst in the city. If the lockdown doesn’t ease, they are going to die of poverty and if it does they would probably die of the infection; their heads are on a chopping block either way,” says Subrajyoti Sikdar, co-founder of Sakhi.Sikdar ads that the brothels of GB Road could emerge as the biggest hotspots, if a long term plan is not implemented in the area.“Many women were trafficked to Delhi when they were children and some have families that rely on them for sustenance. There is a big question mark on what the future will hold for all of them,” he says.OFFICIALS SPEAKDelhi police officials in the area say that they are dealing with this pandemic “one day at a time” and that they are taking care that the virus does not reach the crowded quarters of the brothels.“We are ensuring that the area is disinfected regularly and we are also working with NGOs to ensure these women get masks, food and groceries from time to time. If a case emerges in any of the kothas (brothels) it will be difficult to control the spread because of their living conditions,” says a senior police official in the area requesting he not be named.Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal says that even though the present circumstances are peculiar, they have directed the Delhi police and NGOs to at least ensure that basic needs of women here are fulfilled.“According to the report we have received, food is not a problem there at present but the women there are definitely concerned about their income. These are peculiar circumstances, but we are doing everything in our power to ensure that they are taken care of,” Maliwal says.Despite the ordeal, these women are prepared to support the government in this time of crises. Women here say that when the entire nation stepped into their balconies on April 5 to light candles in a show of support, they also followed the call. “We all came to our balconies, clapped and sang to show our support for our government in their fight against this disease. I am hopeful that things will get better,” says one of the sex workers here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hiv-stigmatised-gb-road-sex-workers-stare-at-an-uncertain-future-amid-covid-pandemic/story-LzXgI2yjkgINzl7Iff6dlJ.html
30-04-2020||Gurugram||Antibody testing to begin in Gurugram from Thursday; Sector 39 and Jharsa first in line||The rapid antibody testing for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease is likely to begin in Gurugram from Thursday. According to state officials, at least 25,000 rapid testing kits (RTK) procured earlier this week from a South Korean company based in Manesar, after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) prohibited the use of Chinese kits, will be used across 22 districts in Haryana. About 1,500 kits have been provided to each hotspot district such as Gurugram, Nuh, Palwal and Faridabad.State health officials said that immediate rollout of antibody tests is crucial for surveillance of Sars-Cov-2 in hotspot districts. Of the 24 containment zones in Gurugram, the district health team will be starting the antibody tests in Sector 39 and Jharsa.Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “Haryana will start antibody testing from Thursday to check Covid -19 clustering in hotspot districts and containment zones. The state will be using 25,000 kits procured from the South Korean company. Other states, too, are using kits procured from non-Chinese sources after the ICMR advisory on not to use Chinese RTKs. The Chinese kits are being returned, as communicated by the ICMR.”“Hotspots districts of Gurugram, Nuh, Palwal, and Faridabad are getting 1,500 kits each, while Panchkula will get 2,000 RTKs. Other affected districts such as Ambala, Rohtak and Sonepat will get 1,000 kits each. Also, 500 kits will be allocated to all medical colleges in the state,” he said.He further said that data on rapid tests is emerging and understanding of their utility for diagnosis is still evolving. “These kits will be primarily used in hotspot areas and in case there is no hotspot area in a district, it will be used to trace places which can emerge as hotspots. It is a useful surveillance tool in areas where cases have not emerged so far,” he said, adding that rapid tests cannot replace the frontline RT-PCR tests.According to the order issued by the health department Tuesday night, at least 21% of the kits allocated to a district will be used for frontline workers such as police staff, street vendors, sanitation staff of MCG, media professionals, newspaper vendors, employees of district administration and all health care workers on field and in government offices. Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, said, “We have received RTKs and testing will start from Jharsa containment zone.” The health team is in a rush to identify people who came in contact with asymptomatic cases reported from the area last week. It includes four health care workers, out of the nine cases reported from the containment zone. Till now, 53 cases have been reported from Gurugram, including two health staff deployed at Sector 10 Civil Hospital tested positive on Wednesday.Antibody tests help in finding out whether a person has developed antibodies against Covid-19. A negative test does not prove that a person is free of disease. Health officials say it is likely that antibodies for Sars-Cov-2 are not present in a patient’s blood in the initial stages of the infection. The test is of utility after the incubation period of the coronavirus is over in five to seven days. It is also a useful tool to assess the prevalence of the disease within a specific area.In rapid tests, blood is collected by pricking the finger. Using micropipette, a minimal quantity of 10 microliter of the blood is taken and collected in the well of the cassette, which is the kit. A buffer solution is added to the blood. A coloured band appears on the top section of the kit, called the result window, to show whether the test is working, while in another section lower to it a coloured band will appear to show the test result.While using the new kits, the district health department will be following the previous guidelines prepared by PGIMS, Rohtak for antibody testing. According to the department, even if a suspected case with flu-like symptoms tests negative for antibodies, his/her swabs will be taken for RT-PCR test and the person will have to be isolated or quarantined for 10 days. Antibody tests will not be done on those having signs of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) or on high-risk cases. Their samples will be directly collected for RT-PCR.Earlier on April 21, the Gurugram health department had tested at least 61 people, including 30 journalists, for Covid-19 using Chinese RTKs. Of the 10,000 kits given to Haryana by the central government, Gurugram received 750.Till now, 54 cases have been reported from Gurugram, including two health staff deployed at Sector 10 Civil Hospital and one at a private hospital tested positive on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/antibody-testing-to-begin-in-gurugram-from-thursday-sector-39-and-jharsa-first-in-line/story-D3hVdejHPIS7xkDwExfprJ.html
30-04-2020||Noida||Three persons arrested for creating ruckus at mosque in Greater Noida||The police on Wednesday arrested three persons for allegedly creating ruckus at a mosque and throwing out mats and other things in Bhanota village in Surajpur. The suspects were identified as Satish Singh, Dinesh Sharma, and Neeraj, residents of Bhanota village.The complainant, Sadin, said that there has been a mosque in the village since 2011. “We had bought a piece of land from a local in 1994 and donated it for the mosque. Locals later built the mosque and started offering prayers,” he said.The complainant said that on March 22, a group of locals, including the suspects, reached the mosque and asked his family members, who are custodians, to lock it due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Sadin said that the mosque has been closed since then and no one has offered prayers there.However, on April 28, a group of 100 to 150 persons gathered at the mosque and forced the family to open the lock. “They threw out the mats and other things from the mosque and also videographed the incident. They also threatened the local Muslims with dire consequences and left,” he said in the complaint. The complainant said that the mob also violated lockdown norms by gathering in huge numbers and creating a ruckus.Chand Khan, a resident, said that there are around 100 Muslim families in the village and only one mosque. “We had built this mosque to offer prayers and educate our children. The premises have been locked for one month and there is no activity here. But a section of people does not want us to return to the mosque,” he said.Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer, Surajpur police station, said that based on the complaint, they registered a case against the suspects under Section 147 (rioting), Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc), Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings), Section 504 (intentional insult), and Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.“The three suspects were arrested from their residences on Wednesday. During interrogation, they said that at the time of the land deal, the buyer had not stated that they would use the land for a mosque,” Tripathi said.The three suspects were produced before a magistrate and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-persons-arrested-for-creating-ruckus-at-mosque-in-greater-noida/story-7kZkhiURh1qNNe7bDv9fCL.html

The child welfare committee was informed and she was handed over to them,” a police spokesperson said, adding that the child was rescued before any animal or vehicle could have injured her.Officials said that under normal circumstances, abandoned infants are kept under 24-hour medical supervision at the Child PGI hospital, but because it is currently sealed after coronavirus cases were detected the hospital, the baby was taken to a private hospital.“She was declared medically fit and sent to a shelter home. There doesn’t seem to be any sign of abuse or injury. Doctors say it looks like he child was delivered in an institution, which makes it easier for them to track down her family,” said Satya Prakash, programme manager of FXB India Suraksha, the NGO that manages the district childline.“We are already going through telecommunication information to see what unusual phones were active in the area at the time. We are also working on checking the records of several government and private hospitals where she may have been delivered. Once we trace her family, due legal action will be taken including registering a case” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police, women safety.Police also checked the CCTV cameras in the area though most of them remain dysfunctional.According to orders from the Child Welfare Committee, received Wednesday, the infant will be taken to the adoption centre in Mathura.

30-04-2020||Noida||Three more Covid-19 patients in GB Nagar, total reaches 137||The Covid-19 count in the district reached 137, with three new cases identified on Wednesday, including two more from a slum colony in Noida’s Sector 8.So far, 17 people from the JJ colony have tested positive for the contagious coronavirus disease. The two who tested positive from the colony on Wednesday include two women — a 52-year-old and a 23-year-old. Health department officials said the sources of their infections was still unclear.Since April 8, officials have shifted hundreds of people from slums in sectors 8 and 5 to government quarantine centres as a precautionary measure, after four persons — one of whom was linked to fire safety solutions firm Ceasefire — tested positive for the coronavirus disease in the Sector 5 JJ colony.Officials fear community transmission in areas where there are no resident welfare associations, and where social distancing is not possible because of high population density.“All possible measures have been taken in sectors 8 and 5 to contain the spread of the disease and avoid community spread,” a senior district health official said.The third patient who tested positive on Wednesday is a 35-year-old man from Noida’s Sector 122, who works as an electrician with a local news channel. Officials said they were in the process of tracing the man’s contacts, and were trying to ascertain if he was in touch with any other media personnel. The district health department has also been forced to emphasise that non-Covid patients need to be given appropriate medical attention, amid reports that non-Covid designated hospitals have turned away patients.The district administration has asked the director of the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) has been asked to train and encourage medical and paramedical staff of all Covid and non-Covid hospitals to open themselves up for patients.“We held an online session on Wednesday morning with various hospitals to encourage them to open up during this crisis. Regular patients also need to be treated, and hospitals have to function for that to happen. In the session, we told hospital authorities about the precautions, they need to take while tackling Covid-19 suspects. If precautions are taken properly then this situation can be handled without making regular patients suffer,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS.As of Wednesday evening, the health department had taken note of 2,161 people who had travelled to Gautam Budh Nagar from districts, cities, states or countries. Officials had also collected total of 3561 samples.Of the 137 Covid-19 cases in the district, 81 patients have been discharged, and 56 are being treated. Another 796 people in Gautam Budh Nagar are under institutional quarantine.On Wednesday, around 10 medical staff of the district hospital in Sector 39 protested outside the office of district magistrate in Sector 27 to complain against the chief medical superintendent for not providing them personal protection kits. They said they are being forced to enter the Covid-19 wards with just masks and gloves.“I have met the staff of the district hospital, they are our corona warriors and all their demands will be met. We have asked the CMS to provide them PPE kits. They have also demanded some raise in their salaries which will also be taken care of,” Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-more-covid-19-patients-in-gb-nagar-total-reaches-137/story-nVMu6gs1JvsTkctUhpQO4J.html

Always wear masks and gloves and use sanitisers before coming in contact with a paper or vehicle.

He also took stock of security arrangements at different check posts and barriers made in the localities of Khoda colony and Model Town, which are located near the Noida-Ghaziabad border.On Monday evening, Singh, along with Greater Noida’s chief executive officer Narendra Bhushan, conducted a surprise inspection of the quarantine centres at the new building of the district hospital in Sector 39 and in Galgotias University. Both officers reviewed their preparedness to check the spread of Covid-19, as well as the cleanliness, security and quality of food served at these centres. They also interacted with the people in quarantine there and took their feedback on several issues.Instructing officials on duty to speedily redress inmates’ problems, Singh said officials must ensure all arrangements as per standard operating protocol (SOP). “No laxity in ensuring timely availability of adequate safety equipment, visors, PPE kits, sanitisers and masks in the quarantine centres, will be tolerated. CCTV cameras should immediately be installed at these places,” he said.Later, Singh and Bhooshan also inspected the hot spot area in Salarpur village and gave necessary instructions to the officials deployed there, for ensuring uninterrupted supply of essential items such as milk, fruits, vegetables, medicines and ration and maintaining good hygiene.

30-04-2020||Pune||Poona District Table Tennis Association hopeful of on schedule season despite Covid-19 threat||The Poona District Table Tennis Association (PDTTA) is hopeful for an on-schedule start of the 2020 season in June this year.Rajeev Bodas, president of PDTTA said most local tournaments in the city are scheduled in the beginning of the season which starts in June.“I hope it will be a normal start for us and the season will continue as per the schedule,” Bodas added.The association will follow government directions on allowing district players to travel to the city.“We need to wait and watch,” Bodas said on conducting district ranking tournaments.The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) – world governing body of the game has postponed international tournaments which spiraled a number of problems for Indian athletes.“There was a world championship scheduled for the veterans in France, many players had to cancel their tickets and hotel bookings. There are questions on whether the athletes will receive a refund. It is a tough time for sports,” he said.Annually, in the month of May, the association conducts a number of table tennis summer camps. PDTTA had planned to bring a top coach to the city next month.“PDTTA had put in a request to the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) to provide us with a coach but now it won’t be possible,” Bodas said.Most coaches in the city are currently busy with online tutorials and digital fitness meetings.“All athletes are continuing practice in whatever way they can. Coaches are conducting fitness sessions online. Many players are engaging in shadow practice which keeps them in touch with sports. There are many coaches in the city as well, who are conducting one on one session with the players,” added Bodas.Current role of PDTTAThe association has advised players to keep themselves busy with sports in innovative ways.“In a normal routine, players don’t get much time for yoga sessions or reading books about the technicality of the games. Reading about sports and understanding the game also helps one to become a better paddler. This is the right time to explore the other side of sports which will improve their game,” Bodas said.The association has advised athletes to focus on weak points and overcome them via social video conferencing or by availing a digital consultation with the coaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pdtta-hopeful-of-on-schedule-season-despite-covid-19-threat/story-dQeLSleYCUCGbgDIDoYlEK.html

30-04-2020||Pune||Labourers work with minimum safety gear, travel to work from containment zones sans ID cards||As Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has undertaken pre-monsoon work in the city a group of labourers was found cleaning the stormwater lines, near Sadhu Vaswani chowk with minimum safety gear on Tuesday afternoon amid the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic caused due to sars-Cov-2 virus. These workers also commute from containment zones to the work area without any identity cards, according to the supervisor Rajendra Waghmare.The pre-monsoon work includes clearing drainage and storm-water lines, repair of culverts and rebuilding fencing walls near nallahs.HT reporter found that the men were working with masks or handkerchiefs which covered their face.Datta Manwatkar, 25, one of the labourers, who lives in Yashwantnagar, Yerawada, with his wife and is a native of Sultanpur Buldhana, said, “We have these gumboots and these gloves that are given to us, but it is very difficult to work in these as they are oversized. Going down this duct, if we hit the water, these boots are of no help.”When asked about safety measures prescribed to them, their supervisor Waghmare, said, “We have been given sanitizers and soap to wash hands before lunch.”Vijay Shinde, superintending engineer, road department, PMC, said, “This is the process of stormwater clearing. They simply clear the debris that may be stuck in these lines to allow rainwater to flow. It is the annual rain work. In this condition, only social distancing is an option and they have been instructed about it. This work needs to be done.”Shinde also agreed that the use of gloves is not an option for this work. The work requires them to enter two to four feet deep stormwater lines and clear the debris or garbage if any.Waghmare is a resident of Lakshminagar area of Yerawada which contains several micro-clusters identified by Pune police for having over five positive Covid-19 cases. Yashwantnagar is located close to Lakshminagar.When asked about the difficulty in entering and leaving the containment zone in the area where the labourers and Waghmare come from, Waghmare says, “We work in the essential services. This works needs to be completed.” However, none of the workers have identity cards to that effect, he added.For the past five days, they have cleaned silt and potential blockages in sewage lines near Naidu hospital, a hub for Covid-19 treatment in the city, regional transport office (RTO), Jehangir hospital road, and the stretch between ZP chowk and Pune railway station, according to Waghmare.The Pune civic body this year has undertaken pre-monsoon work on a large scale given the September last year’s flash floods that killed 26 and caused massive damage to properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/labourers-work-with-minimum-safety-gear-travel-to-work-from-containment-zones-sans-id-cards/story-NUKcptWzopPEIpJiIecYML.html
30-04-2020||Pune||Family of four from Baramati recovers from Covid-19||When the first 14-day post-incubation test for 30-year old Sameer Bagwan’s family came negative last week, everyone’ faces lit up with joy at Pune’s Civil Hospital at Aundh.Sameer’s 26-year-old wife Samina, his two daughters aged eight and one, and his brother Jameer, were soon shifted to another ward. With the second report coming negative, they were finally discharged and given a heartfelt send-off by the hospital staff.When they reached home in Samarath Nagar, Baramati, there was another surprise waiting for them. “We were overwhelmed by the welcome we received from our neighbours,” said Jameer. Fire crackers were lit, people in their lane clapped to welcome them and “they even showered flowers on the ambulance in which we came,” he said.Hailing from a family of fruits and vegetables sellers in Baramati, it all began when Sameer’s 60-year-old father, Majjid Bagwan, developed fever and cough in early April and was taken to a local hospital for check-up. He was soon moved to the Baramati Government Hospital where the doctors said he had symptoms of pneumonia and advised the family to move him to the Dr. Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital in Pune.This is where the senior Bagwan tested positive and the health authorities immediately instructed the entire family to get tested and go into isolation.“Soon, I along with my mother, wife, elder son and two daughters reached Pune for testing. Along with my brother we underwent the swab tests and on April 7 we were informed that my brother, wife and our two daughters had tested positive. The rest of us had tested negative and so we were discharged,” said Sameer.On April 9, the Bagwans lost their father who had turned critical at Sassoon Hospital. Since most family members were in quarantine at the hospital, the immediate family members could not attend the funeral and the last rites were done by relatives from Pune.“Till their discharge from the hospital, I did not inform my family members about my father’s demise as it would have caused immense grief in the hospital,” said Sameer. It was only when they returned home in Baramati that they were informed, he said.Jameer said the only thing that worried him most was the positive status of his nieces. He was extremely happy with the good care from the doctors, nurses and the cleaning staff at the Aundh Civil Hospital during their 14 days stay there. “They treated us well and we cannot complain about anything,” he said.Sameer’s wife said all the needs of the children were met, right from warm milk to special baby food, diapers and other things. “We would woke up at around 6 am, say our prayers and would then get our tea at 8 and milk for the baby. Breakfast would comprise eggs, shegdana ladoos (nutritious peanuts snack) , milk, poha or Idli . The lunch and dinner arrangements were also very good,” she said.The doctors would come two to three times a day for check-up while the nurses would be around throughout the day. “They were very friendly and kept us in high spirits, giving us moral support to fight the disease. A nurse would come almost every hour to ask if the baby needed something,” she said. The hospital staff even gave their own mobile phone to the family members to enable them to keep in touch with their relatives.Now at home, the Bagwans have been advised home quarantine for 14 days, after which they are hopeful that life will once again become normal for them.“This Covid-19 experience has taught us a lesson of a lifetime: If you are strong mentally, you can win any battle in life,” said Jameer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lesson-learnt-if-you-are-strong-mentally-you-can-win-any-battle-in-life/story-rLCEyYPlrqiN9OrDTQsIoK.html

Chandumama Sonawane Hospital is run by the PMC in Kashewadi area and will have 80 beds for Covid-19 pregnant women patients while talks are going on with private hospitals for more such facilities. “Similarly talks are currently underway with another private maternity hospital in Pune with a capacity of 50 beds. The process of making necessary arrangements to treat patients at these hospitals is going on and within the next couple of days Sonawane Hospital will be functional,” said PMC’s assistant health chief Dr Sanjeev Wavare. The decision was taken after a 25-year-old pregnant woman was tested positive in the city on April 16. Later on April 20, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy and was not infected by the disease. However, looking at the increasing number of positive patients and also the large number of pregnant women in Pune, these dedicated maternity hospitals for Covid-19 positive pregnant patients have been started. “If our agreement with more private hospitals is finalised, then this number will increase and pregnant women who test positive for Covid-19, will be treated at these hospitals with extra care,” added Dr Wavare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-positive-pregnant-women-get-2-dedicated-hospitals-in-pune/story-LZIVNveNnhX0OP2T8MmKmM.html
30-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: People need to stay at home for the lockdown to work effectively, says Charnjit Singh Sahni||Charnjit Singh Sahni is the president of Gurudwara Guru Nanak Darbar in Camp, who believes in being of service to humanity. Although he is a businessman in the solar industry, the 63-year-old has left the business to his children while he devotes his time to social work and the gurudwara. What exactly is your role during this crisis?In our religion, we are taught the mantra - Garib ka Muh, Guru ki golak hai” (no one should sleep hungry and feeding the needy is equivalent to giving a donation to the gurudwara) - so, ever since the lockdown started, we decided to reach out to the maximum number of people with the basic need for food. Through our Guru Nanak Medical Foundation, which is run from the gurudwara premises, we started giving medical services through our trustee Dr Dashmeet Singh’s consultation. Then, we started receiving demands from various hospitals and people staying nearby the gurudwara. We first got a requirement from the Army Hospital for ventilators for the new hospital they were setting up for Covid-19 patients in Wanowrie, so we decided to give them four ventilators. Then, we have also given sanitizers, masks, face shields to the needy too. After demands from the Pune Cantonment Board police stations, we have donated hand wash units. We also got a demand from the Sassoon hospital for oxymeters and within a day, we arranged 100 oxymeters and gave it to the dean. Personal protective equipment (PPE) kits are in demand and we gave 100 to the Army hospital, 50 to the Muslim Popular Front group, an NGO authorised by PMC to arrange funerals, 50 PPEs to Family Planning Association of India who are working with AIDS patients and 50 to the Indian Medical Association. We will soon be giving ICU monitors to Sassoon hospital. How does your day begin and roll out?I wake up by 5am, begin my prayers and do some yoga and if possible walk within my society, then post 8am, begins all the coordination for making chappattis. Then by 10:30 am, I coordinate with the distribution team and attend to the daily calls of demands from hospitals, NGOs and the needy people. We also hold online conferences with the medical team for approvals and then for the final nod with the management team. By 10pm, I usually spend time with my family. What precautions are you taking?We do not go out, we manage everything from home. We follow the rules and only in case of emergency do we go out, wearing masks, gloves and maintain social distance. What is your assessment of the Covid-19 crisis n Pune? How is it unfolding?Pune is managing it very well on the field and trying their level best to control it, but we feel that there is a need for a stronger appeal to people to follow and cooperate with the government’s decision and stay at home to make this lockdown work better and learn to live with whatever is at home. What gaps do you see in healthcare and relief work?This pandemic was so sudden for the city that no one is prepared for it and however, the administration and the hospitals are working on a war footing to control the spread. The frontline doctors and paramedical staff’s safety should be our priority as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-people-need-to-stay-at-home-for-the-lockdown-to-work-effectively-says-charnjit-singh-sahni/story-FqQ0lNE03xwMutkX496AYL.html
30-04-2020||Pune||Shelter homes made for red containment zones in Pune fail to attract temporary residents||Though the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has created 70 temporary shelters in schools for the most congested high Covid-19 prone ‘red containment zones’ of Bhavani peth, Dhole Patil road and Kasba-Vishrambaugwada, slum dwellers and others in small, congested tenements are unwilling to move there. In some areas, even the residents living around these dedicated schools have opposed these shelter homes for shifting people from red zone areas.Congress Avinash Bagwe from Bhavani peth area said,“People are not ready to move for various reasons. There is no food facility and for every small thing they need to return home which would not be allowed by the police. People are saying that those who are Covid-19 positive and under quarantine are not getting good facilities. Then, why should we leave our homes? They are worried that their belongings and utensils might get stolen from their homes if they move out.”With the Covid-19 positive cases maximising in five wards in the city, namely- Kasba peth, Vishrambaugwada, Bhavani peth, Dhole Patil road and Shivajinagar- Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad had decided to convert 70 schools into the temporary shelters.Even though the shifting to these centres was to be voluntary, some sections of the media and social media created panic by reporting that some 70,000 families from the crowed areas would be shifted to the temporary shelters.Gaikwad said, “We made the temporary arrangement of the shelter homes. In many homes people are living in small houses which is not more than 100 to 150 square feet. During the lockdown, it is not possible to stay in small homes where more positive cases are emerging. So, we appealed to the people to stay in temporary shelters and PMC would provide toilet and water facility. It is voluntary and not mandatory that each citizen gets shifted.”Dhole Patil road ward officer Dayanand Sonkamble said, “We kept six schools ready and cleaned all the class rooms. We appeal to the people to come and stay here.”Congress corporator Arvind Shinde who is representing Dhole Patil road and Tadiwala slum areas said, “It is wrong planning to make temporary shelters. People live in small groups at home, but the government machinery is asking them to come and stay inside these schools with 30-40 other people. Sending people there without any screening is wrong.”One of the ward officers on condition of anonymity said, “We got many messages from the residents living around schools who were opposed to the shifting of the citizens from crowded areas to these schools as they are worried that it would spread the infection in their areas as well.”Another PMC officer on the condition of anonymity said that it is true that there is less response to the temporary shelters as people do not want to leave their homes. “PMC is only providing a place to stay, for tea, snacks and food they have to again go home. It is not possible to create a food facility for such a large number of people at the schools every day,” he added.Avinash Bagwe who is an elected member of the PMC said, “The schools are located at least a kilometre away from the homes of the residents, they have to walk back and forth for food, among other things. Hence, residents do not want to shift.”Pune Municipal Corporation issued a press statement and said that only 43 citizens on Tuesday night shifted from Sadashiv peth and Navi peth to the Dharmaveer Sambhaji School on Tuesday evening and stayed at night . This school is located near Navi peth.Resident Dilip Patole living in Bhavani peth area said, “Earlier, our impression was that the government would shift us forcefully. When we got more information, we came to know that the administration is only providing a place to stay and there is no food and bed arrangement. It means that we have two options- one to shift our utensils and cook there, which is not possible and second option is to go there and rest but come home for daily needs like tea, and food. Both the options are not practical and hence, we preferred to stay at our homes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-s-new-shelter-homes-for-red-containment-zones-fail-to-take-off/story-FWQZvu6GFGLqZPfbS42LlK.html
30-04-2020||Delhi||Covid Kavach vehicles to help cops drive into congested containment zones||To keep their personnel safe, while at the same time being able to enter the congested containment zones under their jurisdiction, the south-east police Wednesday launched eight fully covered e-rickshaws, called ‘Covid Kavach’. With 17 containment zones, south-east is among the districts in the national capital most badly hit by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “We realised that there was a lack of communication between the police and the public in these zones,” said RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east). “Some of these areas are thickly populated and it was difficult to keep an eye on the public who would come out of their homes without a valid reason,” Meena said. As a matter of practice, too, the police have generally been keeping themselves to the periphery of the containment zones, dressed in personal protection equipments and going in only to accompany officials or to sometimes provide essential items to residents. The DCP said the ‘Covid Kavach’ will solve this problem. “These hired vehicles are fully covered and will have a driver and two policemen -- all covered from head to toe in PPEs,” the DCP said. These officers in e-rickshaws will be able to visit the congested areas which were previously inaccessible to regular police vehicles. “The policemen will keep a watch on those leaving homes without a reason, will help those who need essential goods and make announcements. All this will happen while ensuring that the policemen are not at risk of infection,” Meena said.For now, these ‘Covid Kavach’ vehicles are being deployed in containment zones located in Jaitpur, Kalindi Kunj, Jamia Nagar, Sarita Vihar, Shaheen Bagh and Nizamuddin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-kavach-vehicles-to-help-cops-drive-into-congested-containment-zones/story-f5P9U4efxVow6DwhC484pM.html

Of the total Covid-19 positive cases reported from Pune, over 60 per cent have been recorded from slums, as indicated in the statistics shared by the municipal administration. Last week during its visit to Maharashtra, the central government’s team had visited these sums in Mumbai and Pune. In his briefing, joint secretary with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Punya Srivastava, said, “The team found that the use of community toilets leaves residents to defy the lockdown and step out of their homes.” The Centre had also advised to install portable toilets to reduce the use of community toilets in slum areas.Taking cognisance, Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad issued a circular on Wednesday with instructions to clean public toilets at least four times in a day, which earlier used to be cleaned only once a day.According to former deputy mayor and a practising doctor Siddharth Dhende, public toilets in Pune’s slums have been a real hotspot for spreading the coronavirus. “Almost 42 per cent of the city’s population is living in slums where many residents do not have toilets in their homes and need to relay on public toilets. The PMC has to seriously consider toilets as a source of spread of the infection in order to improve the situation,” said Dhende.Assistant medical officer Vaishali Jadhav who is incharge for contact tracing and conducting the door-to-door survey in the city, said, “It is found that many people in slum areas are using common toilets. Our medical teams suspect that it is one of the reasons for the spread of the virus. Hence, the municipal administration has now started cleaning the public toilets four times a day.”Avinash Bagwe, who represents Bhavani peth area where there are slums and a large number of Covid-19 patients (263 cases till April 28), said, “It is true that the public toilets is a place where residents gather. Police can’t take action there as residents are standing in queue to use the toilets.”Dhole Patil ward office’s ward officer Dayanand Sonkamble said, “With the number of patients increasing, we have started cleaning the public toilets four times a day and even spray disinfectants around the public toilet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-starts-cleaning-community-toilets-in-slum-areas-four-times-a-day-to-prevent-covid-19-spread/story-7f12QDoor4pvD6GOhZE21M.html
30-04-2020||Pune||Air ambulance lifts Pune patient to Jaipur for emergency surgery||PUNE: An air ambulance was arranged to transport a 46-year-old software engineer needing emergency surgery for a malignant skull base tumour, from Pune to Jaipur on Tuesday morning.According to surgeon and director of CitiCare Hospital Dr Arvind Patil, the surgery was performed on Wednesday afternoon on the patient whose tumour had become progressive in nature and begun penetrating into his eye ball and brain.“Signs of further complications like bleeding through nose and proptosis of the eyeball were visible in the patient. It was necessary to intervene surgically immediately otherwise it would have led to life-threatening complications,” said Dr Patil.The condition was only treatable by an endoscopic surgery and the most experienced surgeon in India Dr Satish Jain practices in Jaipur, according to Patil.He said that since Dr Jain could not come to Pune due to the lockdown, in a final attempt, the doctors at CitiCare Hospital contacted Dr Nirmalkumar Rakshe, managing director of UnM LifeCare, which provides emergency medical services in four states for road mishap rescue.“Rakshe saw the patient and helped me to contact International Critical Care Air Transfer Team (ICATT) and arranged an air ambulance for the patient with necessary permission,” Dr Patil said.Dr Rakshe said that seeking permission for the air transport of the patient wasn’t easy and assistance from Satara Member of Parliament Shrinivas Patil and Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham helped.Finally, the patient was airlifted in a private plane.Dr Patil said, “The surgery was successful and the condition of the patient is stable. It was a very complicated disease that extended to the brain and eyeball and exposed frontal lobe of brain.”The surgery held at afternoon went on for an hour, the doctor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-ambulance-lifts-pune-patient-to-jaipur-for-emergency-surgery/story-Zml0uhMV5JP01Z2bAR8qwO.html

30-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt launches dedicated website for Covid-19 updates||The Delhi government on Tuesday launched a website for all Covid-19 related updates and information, the government said in a press statement.The website — DelhiFightsCorona.in — would act as a single-window with detailed lists and geo-locations of containment zones, testing facilities, ration shops, temporary relief centres and hunger relief centres of the Delhi government, the statement said.The website would also have a daily tracker of the number of Covid-19 cases and the testing statistics of the Capital. It would have special windows to help people apply for free meal passes and e-passes for movement during the lockdown. It would also have detailed sections dedicated to frequently asked questions (FAQ) and all government press releases, the statement said.“The containment zones section has the locations of all the red zones or the hot spots of Covid-19 in Delhi. The locations are updated from time to time as decided by the government. This section also has a brief description of the Operation SHIELD, a unique initiative by the Delhi government under the direct supervision of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, to tackle the spread of Covid-19 in the containment zones,” a senior government official said.SHIELD translates to sealing, home quarantine, isolation, essentials’ services ensured, local sanitisation and door-to-door health surveys.“The testing facility section of the website has a list of Covid-19 testing centres set up by the Delhi government as well as private centres, and information on how to avail of Covid testing. Any person interested to know the location of the centre will have to click on the name of the centre and the location will be shown in Google Maps,” the statement said.The statement read, “The key locations section of the website has the list and location of all the ration shops in Delhi, temporary relief centres and hunger relief centres. In the ration shop section, there is a list of over 2,000 ration shops which can also be searched constituency-wise. There is also Google Map locations available for the individual ration shops.

30-04-2020||Delhi||11 Covid-19 cases linked to Azadpur market, test results of 100 awaited||At least 11 cases of Covid-19 have so far been linked to the Azadpur agriculture market in Delhi and more than 25 traders and their employees have been quarantined after being traced as contacts of the 11 cases.Test results of more than 100 individuals—traders and employees—who have been traced as contacts of the confirmed cases or those who have been shortlisted after a screening programme this weekend are still awaited, office bearers of the agriculture produce market committee (APMC) said. A large number of registered shops in Delhi’s Azadpur market—the Capital’s lifeline for supply for fruits and vegetables—remained closed on Tuesday, with groups of traders raising concerns over the transmission of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Anil Malhotra, a trader and elected member of the committee that runs the Azadpur market said, “Traders are concerned. Most of them are demanding that all traders and employees in the market be tested. Others are demanding that the market be moved to some other location in parts and the current market premises be turned into a containment zone.”The Azadpur market has around 2,800 registered shops and traders employ around 12,000 individuals in different roles—from porters to accountants. On a regular day, the market witnesses a footfall of more than 100,000 and the arrival of at least 3,000 trucks.District magistrate (north) Deepak Shinde said that the market premises are under strict surveillance and the district administration ensures that social distancing and other protocols are followed.Officials in Azadpur APMC maintain that the market continues to operate round the clock—a decision which was implemented last week in the light of supply disruption leading to a rise in the prices of fruits and vegetables in the city in the middle of the ongoing nationwide lockdown.“I cannot comment on individual shops. But all the sheds in the market were functional. Supply is steady. The market is periodically sanitised with disinfectants. More than 600 sanitation workers and 900 civil defence volunteers have been deployed,” Adil Khan, the chairperson of the Azadpur APMC, said.When asked about photographs and videos of deserted sheds in Azadpur market that have been doing the rounds on social media, Khan said, “To ensure social distancing, a system of 200 coupons per hour has been introduced for trucks, no vehicle is allowed to be parked inside the market for long hours, retail traders are also given access on a staggered basis and are asked to leave the market once the transaction is over. So, those photos and videos do not depict the accurate picture.”The 11 confirmed cases so far—of which one led to a death last week—are spread across four neighbouring blocks, records shared by the APMC showed. It further showed that shops in the vicinity of five of them have been sealed. The others have not been sealed because the patients had stopped coming to the market much before they were tested positive and quarantined, a senior office-bearer of the APMC said.SPREAD IN OTHER MARKETSA trader in Naya Bazar in Anaj Mandi area of the central district on Tuesday tested positive for the coronavirus disease. According to district administration officials, the patient sells foodgrain and had a shop in the area.Nidhi Srivastava, DM (central), said that as a precautionary measure, a contact tracing exercise would soon start in Naya Bazar market.“The person lives in Pitampura and his shop was not opened for the last 15 days. Today (Tuesday), he tested positive. We will get contact tracing done soon,” Srivastava said.She added that the number of people to be quarantined would be known only after contact tracing is done.Meanwhile, the traders of the Naya Bazar market have raised an alarm to ensure safety while working.Sunil Kumar Garg, general secretary Delhi Grain Merchants Association, said that necessary directions on maintaining social distancing in shops have been issued to the shop owners and managers. He said that at one time not more than two people would be allowed in the shop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/11-cases-linked-to-azadpur-market-test-results-of-100-awaited/story-ngI6VMyG9VzwCCxb4BpUuI.html
30-04-2020||World||After over 26,700 deaths, PM Boris says UK is past peak||The death toll in the United Kingdom from coronavirus was 26,711 on Thursday, but a slower rate of new infections and dwindling rate of deaths prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson to declare that the country is past the peak.Addressing the daily briefing for the first time after returning to office, Johnson, who had a brush with death after contracting the virus, said he was “very, very lucky” when he was admitted to the intensive care unit, but regretted that many people had lost their lives that.He said: “Today the number of Covid hospital admissions is falling. The number of patients in ICU is falling. We have so far succeeded in the first and most important task we set ourselves as a nation. To avoid the tragedy that engulfed other parts of the world. Because at no stage has our NHS been overwhelmed”.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageFive mega hospitals were quickly set up with help from the military, but after admissions slowed, the NHS was left with considerable capacity. Figures released on Friday said the number cases across settings in the UK were 171,253.Johnson said: “And it is thanks to that massive collective effort to shield the NHS that we avoided an uncontrollable and catastrophic epidemic where the reasonable worst case scenario was 500,000 deaths. And so I can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope”.Responding to growing demands that the government announce steps to exit the current lockdown, Johnson said he would set out a “comprehensive plan” next week, and highlighted ongoing efforts to develop a vaccine in the UK.The University of Oxford and the biopharma major AstraZeneca on Friday announced a not-for-profit collaboration for large scale production and distribution if a vaccine produced by the former currently under human trials succeeds by September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-over-26-700-deaths-pm-boris-says-uk-is-past-peak/story-ioHBMhAEuDF0iVayBvGbfP.html

Health officials issued new guidance on Wednesday that such staff should not be deployed in the frontline of treating patients stricken by the virus.NHA England figures show that 15 per cent of the dead were from the BAME (official categorised as Black and Asian Minority Ethnic) communities. The Indian sub-category constitutes 3 per cent, accounting for 560 deaths, followed by those of Caribbean and Pakistani origin.According to Kamlesh Khunti, medical expert at the University of Leicester, the reasons Indian and other non-white people figure more in the statistics, despite accounting for only 14 per cent of the UK population, include many coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, working in public-facing occupations, holding different cultural beliefs and behaviours or being at high risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.People of south Asian origin are considered more susceptible to diabetes, heart and other diseases. A majority of those passing away from coronavirus have underlying health conditions, which make recovery more challenging.Medical staff of Indian heritage who passed away include Jitendra Kumar Rathod, Manjeet Singh Riyat, Krishan Arora, Rajesh Kalraiya, Pooja Sharma, Jayesh Patel, Vivek Sharma, Kamlesh Kumar Masson, Amarante Dias, Sophie Fagan, Hamza Pacheeri and Amrik Bamotra.London boroughs such as Brent, Barnet, Ealing and Harrow with large population of Indian origin figure among the areas with the most number of cases. There are reports that funeral services catering to the Indian community have sees more cases than usual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indians-top-grim-list-of-non-whites-dying-of-covid-19-in-uk/story-CMQhHt5W7tY4UVRz0jS24O.html

30-04-2020||World||US intel: Coronavirus not manmade, still studying lab theory||US intelligence agencies have concluded that the new coronavirus was “not manmade or genetically modified” but say they are still examining whether the origins of the pandemic trace to contact with infected animals or an accident at a Chinese lab.The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the clearinghouse for the web ofspy agencies, comes as President Donald Trump and his allies have touted the as-yet-unproven theory that an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak, was the source of the global pandemic that has killed more than 220,000 worldwide.In recent days the Trump administration has sharpened his rhetoric on China, accusing the geopolitical foe and vital trading partner of failing to do act swiftly enough to stop the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19 or sound the alarm to the world about the outbreak.“The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,” said the statement. “The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”Trump addressed the theory earlier this month, saying, “More and more, we’re hearing the story.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added, “The mere fact that we don’t know the answers — that China hasn’t shared the answers — I think is very, very telling.”Pompeo also pressed China to let outside experts into the lab “so that we can determine precisely where this virus began.”Scientists say the virus arose naturally in bats. Even so, Pompeo and others have pointed fingers at an institute that is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It has done groundbreaking research tracing the likely origins of the SARS virus, finding new bat viruses and discovering how they could jump to people.“We know that there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology just a handful of miles away from where the wet market was,” Pompeo said two weeks ago. The institute has an address 8 miles, or 13 kilometers, from the market.US officials say the American Embassy in Beijing flagged concerns about potential safety issues at the lab in Wuhan in 2018, but have yet to find any evidence the virus originated there nearly two years later.The Chinese government said Thursday that any claims that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory are “unfounded and purely fabricated out of nothing.”Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang cited the institute’s director, Yuan Zhiming, as saying the lab strictly implements bio-security procedures that would prevent the release of any pathogen.“I would like to point out again that the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue, and it should be studied by scientists and professionals,” Geng said.Geng also criticizedpoliticians who have suggested China should be held accountable for the global pandemic, saying they should spend their time on “better controlling the epidemic situation at home.”But a Chinese government spokesman, Zhao Lijian, demonstrated that China was not above sowing confusion in the face of the pandemic. He tweeted in March the falsehood that the virus might have come from theArmy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-intel-coronavirus-not-manmade-still-studying-lab-theory/story-8nDJ8McXNeAITQL4XgOkWN.html
30-04-2020||World||California to shut down beaches, US toll and job-losses continue to rise||California state could shut down its beaches and public parks even as it takes tentative steps to join other states that are reopening for business by lifting stay-at-home orders that worked so successfully and prevented a full-fledged flare-up of Covid-19 cases after an initial surge.California and Washington are often cited as model states for how they shut out the virus. But they are now getting ready to reopen as others. Washington has already allowed some businesses to resume and California governor Gavin Newsom has unveiled a broad outline of a four-phase opening.For now, he is not taking chances and is expected to issue orders Thursday shutting down beaches and some parks after the crowds that descended on them last weekend.“This virus doesn’t take the weekends off,” Newsom said during his daily Covid-19 briefing. “The only thing that will set us back is people stopping to practice physical distancing and appropriate social distancing. That’s the only thing that’s going to slow down our ability to reopen this economy.”Many states have reopened in recent days as the number of news Covid-19 cases continued to slow down, as have those for hospitalizations and fatalities. Cumulative totals also continued to look daunting — the number of confirmed infections rose by 27,327 in the last 24 hours to 1.04 million and the toll to went up by 2,612 to 60,999 Thursday.The toll on the economy and the livelihood of Americans also continued to rise. New data released Thursday showed 3.8 million more people filed for unemployment benefits last week, taking the six-week total of people left jobless by the lockdown ordered by states to combat the epidemic to 30 million. States now want to remove these restrictions. So does President Donald Trump. He told reporters Wednesday that the federal social-distancing guidelines that expire on Thursday will be “fading out”. He added that the states “getting it going, and we are opening our country again”. Many of those restrictions are now included in the reopening guidelines, public health officials explained.New York, the epicenter of the American epidemic, is also taking baby steps towards and announced plans to roll out a phased “unpause” from May 15. New cases and fatalities are going down but not as quickly as desired, as Governor Andrew Cuomo has stated repeatedly.In a sign of continued challenges confronting state, 100 bodies were found piled up in unrefrigerated trucks outside a funeral home in New York city Wednesday. The city has arranged for refrigerated truck to temporarily store bodies to ease the pressure on overwhelmed funeral homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-to-shut-down-beaches-us-toll-and-job-losses-continue-to-rise/story-ycq8bwTES6Jl3ir14wce2O.html

No one was injured.The unidentified person fired multiple rounds from what some reports said was a high-powered assault rifle.“This morning at approximately 2:15 am, US Secret Service officers responded to the Embassy of Cuba following reports of shots fired,” the Secret Service said in a statement.“One individual was arrested for being in possession of an unregistered firearm as well as unregistered ammunition, assault with the intent to kill, and possession of a high capacity feed device.“No injuries were reported at the scene.”Washington’s police department confirmed the incident but said an investigation was in the hands of the Secret Service, which often handles investigations involving foreign diplomats. Local media said the person arrested was a man who fired about 30 rounds from an assault rifle-type weapon.The embassy, located on 16th Street at the edge of the Adams Morgan neighborhood, a normally bustling area full of bars and restaurants but which has been stilled by the coronavirus shutdown.The administration of President Donald Trump has chilled relations with Havana, reversing course after an opening initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama.In October 2017, it expelled 15 Cuban diplomats after a rash of incidents in which US embassy staff in Cuba reported as yet unexplained head pains, dizziness and hearing loss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/assailant-opens-fire-on-cuban-embassy-in-washington-one-person-arrested-report/story-4uqJWmkspNCqOJqNYnBJTL.html
30-04-2020||World||Labour now keen to rebuild trust with India, Indians in UK||Labour leader Keir Starmer on Thursday made the first moves to rebuild trust with New Delhi and the Indian diaspora by insisting that controversial issues such as Jammu and Kashmir should not be allowed to divide communities in the United Kingdom.The Labour party under former leader Jeremy Corbyn came in for stringent criticism from large sections of the Indian community in the UK and India for passing a resolution at the party’s conference in September last that called for external i ntervention in the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.While the ministry of external affairs in New Delhi rejected the resolution, calling it “uninformed and unfounded”, the party raised hackles in the UK before the December election when some of its members were perceived as supporting violence before the Indian high commission. The developments had some impact on the fortunes of Labour candidates during the election, while the resolution remains part of its approach to the Kashmir dispute. Starmer’s olive branch was received with cautious optimism in Indian circles. Starmer’s overture came following a meeting with the executive of the Labour Friends of India, a lobby group within the party, co-chaired by Rajesh Agarwal, deputy mayor of London. The leader also promised to work towards fielding more Indian-origin candidates in elections.Starmer said: “Britons of Indian origin contribute so much to the UK and to the Labour party. I’m committed to working closely with Labour Friends of Indian to rebuild trust with the community”.“We must not allow issues of the sub-continent to divide communities here. Any constitutional issues in India are a matter for the Indian Parliament and Kashmir is a bilateral issue for India and Pakistan to resolve peacefully. Labour is an internationalist Party and stands for the defence of human rights everywhere”.Starmer, who was seen as a unifying candidate during the party leader’s election, is due to meet the Indian high commissioner shortly. The shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy had an interaction with envoy Ruchi Ghanashyam this week.Starmer added: “A Labour Government under my leadership will be determined to build even stronger business links with India and to co-operate on the global stage on issues such as climate change. I look forward to meeting the Indian high commissioner in due course to open a renewed dialogue between the Labour Party and the people of India.”Traditionally the party of choice for the Indian community, Labour has been haemorrhaging support in recent elections, with many young, aspirational members gravitating towards the Conservative party, particularly since David Cameron became party leader in 2005.Agrawal said: “I really welcome his commitment to rebuilding strong links between the Labour party and the Indian community. This has been a great start and Keir has achieved a lot in the short span of couple of weeks”.“Labour Friends of India will work closely with him and will continue to promote UK-India ties as well as continuing to raise any issues from the community to the leadership”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/labour-now-keen-to-rebuild-trust-with-india-indians-in-uk/story-KyaxUAJGMCTXvGkKuGIYBL.html
30-04-2020||World||Italy PM Conte battles local leaders over Covid-19 lockdown||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte Thursday criticised regional chiefs for defying the government and lifting lockdown measures early, saying it risked undoing efforts to prevent a second coronavirus wave.He also rebutted opposition accusations that he was robbing Italians of their constitutional rights.“Initiatives involving less restrictive measures are contrary to national rules and are therefore to all intents and purposes illegitimate,” Conte told parliament.Regions south of Rome have suffered relatively few deaths from Covid-19 and local officials have been among the most vocal opponents of the two-month shutdown.Calabria in the south allowed bars and restaurants with outside tables to open to the public on Thursday.But areas of the north have also begun to open up.Veneto region, which was among the first to be hit by the virus but has suffered far fewer deaths than neighbouring Lombardy, lifted a range of restrictions including on takeaways, pizzerias and some shops on Monday.“We cannot allow the efforts made to be in vain because of rashness at this delicate stage. Moving from the policy of ‘let’s close everything’ to ‘let’s reopen everything’, would risk irreversibly compromising these efforts,” Conte said.While some businesses have been allowed to reopen, the lockdown will not begin to be lifted nationwide until May 4 and even then it will happen gradually over a series of weeks.‘Freedom’Conte said officials would carry out some 150,000 tests in May to see how many people were developing antibodies to fight the virus. An app to trace contacts between potentially infected people would be voluntary, he said.Evidence of a rise in infections could lead to restrictive measures being reintroduced locally.The virus reproduction number (R0) in Italy was currently between 0.5 and 0.7 -- meaning 10 virus sufferers infect between five and seven other people. Should it rise again to 1.0, intensive care units would once again be overwhelmed, he said.Conte’s speech to the lower house was delayed after opposition members complained that the prime minister was not wearing a mask.The League party, whose members took off their own obligatory masks, forcing the speaker to temporarily suspend the session, spent Wednesday night occupying both chambers of parliament.The far-right party’s head Matteo Salvini has accused Conte of extending the lockdown because it was the easy option and stripping Italians of their fundamental freedoms.He has said his party was deliberating whether to join grassroots protests called for Saturday.Conte said the accusations were “profoundly unjust” and the saving of lives was a “primary good” that trumped other rights.His lockdown may be unpopular but it was not an electoral programme designed to please anyone, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-pm-conte-battles-local-leaders-over-covid-19-lockdown/story-qn8So9Om0yUboMOAt4NU7M.html
30-04-2020||World||Oxford-AstraZeneca pact if Covid-19 vaccine trial succeeds||Biopharma major AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford on Thursday announced an agreement for the global development and distribution of the university’s potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing Covid-19 infection from SARS-CoV-2.The Oxford vaccine is currently undergoing human trials and initial data is expected in May and advanced results by September. But the Boris Johnson government and experts are working to put in place facilities to produce the vaccine on a large scale if it succeeds.Under the agreement, AstraZeneca would be responsible for development and worldwide manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine.Pascal Soriot of AstraZeneca, said: “As Covid-19 continues its grip on the world, the need for a vaccine to defeat the virus is urgent. This collaboration brings together the University of Oxford’s world-class expertise in vaccinology and AstraZeneca’s global development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities”.“Our hope is that, by joining forces, we can accelerate the globalisation of a vaccine to combat the virus and protect people from the deadliest pandemic in a generation.”Alok Sharma, business secretary, added: “This collaboration between Oxford University and AstraZeneca is a vital step that could help rapidly advance the manufacture of a coronavirus vaccine”.The Oxford vaccine project is among over 80 across the globe working to produce the vaccine, as the death toll and number of cases continue to mount in various countries.Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, said: “Our partnership with AstraZeneca will be a major force in the struggle against pandemics for many years to come. We believe that together we will be in a strong position to start immunising against coronavirus once we have an effective approved vaccine”.“Sadly, the risk of new pandemics will always be with us and the new research centre will enhance the world’s preparedness and our speed of reaction the next time we face such a challenge.”The Oxford vaccine entered Phase I clinical trials last week to study safety and efficacy in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years, across five trial centres in England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-astrazeneca-pact-if-covid-19-vaccine-trial-succeeds/story-2PnHuUjiBsUFg894982oKL.html

It has infected more than 1 million Americans and has thrown the US economy into a deep recession.“There are many things I can do,” Trump told Reuters. “We’re looking for what happened.”Geng reiterated during Thursday’s briefing that China was a victim of the epidemic and not its accomplice, adding that attempts by “certain politicans” to shift the blame away from their poor handling of the outbreak to Beijing would only “expose the problems of the US itself”. “The US should know this: the enemy is the virus, not China,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-has-no-interest-in-meddling-in-2020-us-presidential-polls/story-a5lIqSzovrY8loQ0R06hEK.html

So they will be brought back from Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Estates. Some flights will be operated from Sudan, Kenya and the UK,” Dawn news quoted Yusuf as saying.The number of Covid-19 cases reached 15,759 in Pakistan after 874 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours, health authorities said. Three hundred forty six people have died of the disease so far in the country.Punjab province is the worst hit with 6,061 cases, followed by Sindh with 5,695, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa with 2,313, Balochistan with 978, Gilgit-Baltistan with 333, Islamabad with 313 and Pakistan-cccupied Kashmir with 66 cases.So far 4,052 patients have recovered while the total active cases in the country were 11,361.Pakistan’s Ministry of National Health Services said that local transmission was 84 per cent and foreign travel 16 per cent.The government said that 3,560 patients were admitted across the country in 717 hospitals with Covid-19 facilities, while others were isolated at their homes.Among the high profile people who got infected by the coronavirus includes Governor of Pakistan’s southern Sindh province Imran Ismail, a very close aide of Prime Minister Imran Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-has-lowest-covid-19-mortality-rate-says-minister-as-country-records-highest-single-day-fatalities/story-miOdsaASrBakVIocCVYEHK.html
30-04-2020||World||SEALs tried to locate US citizen taken captured by Afghan militants||In the days following the capture of an American contractor in Afghanistan earlier this year, Navy commandos raided a village and detained suspected members of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network while the US intelligence community tried to track the cellphones of the man and his captors, The Associated Press has learned.While the circumstances surrounding the abduction remain unclear, the previously unreported operation described by multiple American officials over the past month shed new light on early efforts to locate Mark R. Frerichs, a contractor from Illinois whose disappearance has been shrouded in mystery and whose case has been the subject of minimal public discussion by the US government.The new details emerge as violence and political infighting in Kabul threaten to scuttle a Taliban peace deal with the US Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo voiced frustrations after a failed attempt to mediate a power struggle between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and political rival Dr. Abdullah Abdullah. The Trump administration said it would cut $1 billion in aid to Afghanistan.Washington has urged Kabul to release Taliban prisoners, which is part of the peace agreement, arguing the detainees were at risk of spreading the coronavirus.But there are no public indications Frerichs, a Navy veteran, has been part of negotiations between the US and Taliban leadership, or that his release is part of any peace deal.“The Taliban kidnapped my brother in January. In February, the US signed a peace deal with the Taliban. My brother wasn’t part of the deal. Now we are arranging for the Taliban and Afghan government to exchange thousands of prisoners,” Charlene Cakora, one of Frerichs’ sisters, said in a statement provided to the AP. “Why can’t we make an American hostage be one of them?”Frerichs’ father, Art, said in a statement that though he has faith in President Donald Trump and Pompeo, “I just need them to tell their people negotiating with the Taliban that America won’t lift a finger until my son comes home. He’s a veteran. This is America. We don’t leave people behind.”The Pentagon and US Special Operations Command declined to comment on the SEALs raid. The rescue effort is being coordinated through the FBI-led, multiagency Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which said in a statement that it was working with its partners to ensure “that Mark Frerichs and all Americans held hostage abroad are returned home.” It encouraged anyone with information about the case to come forward.The State Department said it was aware of an American who’d been abducted in Afghanistan.“The welfare, safety and security of Americans is the Trump Administration’s highest priority,” the department said. “The United States will continue to push for the safe return of this and all other U.S citizens through all relevant channels.”A former US national security official who is advising the Frerichs family called on Washington peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to resolve the situation and that “he is aware of Mark’s presence, but it does not appear yet that he understands that he needs to get him home.” The former official insisted on anonymity to speak candidly since the official sometimes works with the Trump administration.U.S. officials believe Frerichs, 57, of Lombard, Illinois, was held for at least some time in Khost, an eastern province along the border with Pakistan and its so-called tribal regions, a mountainous area that has historically been a haven for Taliban and al-Qaeda militants.The former national security official said that Frerichs has been in Afghanistan for about a decade working on commercial projects and was not a US government contractor.“The first 96 hours is crucial,” a senior US government official briefed on the case told the AP on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. “If they’re not recovered in the first few days, it becomes harder every minute after.”Though no formal demands are known to have been made, US intelligence officials believe Frerichs was captured by members of the Haqqani network, a militant group aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Haqqanis have strong links to North Waziristan, a tribal region in Pakistan, south of Afghanistan’s Khost province.The Obama administration designated the Haqqani network as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012 for its ties with the Taliban and the group’s attacks on US military and civilian personnel. Though the Haqqanis are known to carry out assassinations and kidnappings for ransom, Taliban leadership has not acknowledged Frerichs’ capture.“I have not received any information about him,” said a Taliban source who asked not to be named. “There has been no clue despite my contacts with every side to get information.”In November, the Afghan government released three prominent members of the Haqqani network in exchange for an American citizen and an Australian professor abducted in 2016. Pompeo characterized the prisoner swap as a “goodwill gesture.”Rep. Michael Waltz, a Florida Republican and Army veteran who led the teams that searched for Bowe Bergdahl after the Army soldier abandoned his post in 2009 and wound up captured by the Taliban, said the Taliban frequently hides American hostages until they can move them over the border into Pakistan.“I have real concerns about suggestions that the Taliban are serious about peace, that the Taliban are upholding their end of the deal when — as we speak today — they are holding a former Navy veteran and American citizen hostage that they took, again, during the peace negotiations,” Waltz said in an interview.The search area for Frerichs began in Khost and extended south to the province of Kandahar, according to the senior US government official and a second official at the Defense Department.Members of the elite Naval Special Warfare Development Group, more familiarly known as SEAL Team Six, who were involved in the Frerichs effort had spent late January working to recover the bodies of two American service members who died when their aircraft crash-landed in Ghazni in central Afghanistan, according to the two US officials.The bitter winter weather that limited overhead surveillance of the airplane wreckage by US military drones also worked against officials during the later SEAL operation on the night of Feb. 3. Periods of poor-to-nonexistent visibility ultimately delayed a planned intelligence-gathering operation on a known Taliban location, said the senior US government official, who has direct knowledge of the raid.Once the weather cleared, the SEALs loaded onto helicopters and flew to the undisclosed location. The senior official declined to disclose the exact location of the province for operational security reasons.The senior US government official and the Defense Department source with knowledge of the raid, who also requested anonymity, said the SEAL platoon was not met with any Taliban resistance and that once at the compound, they detained several alleged Haqqani militants and uncovered a weapons cache. It’s not known if the weapons cache was destroyed at the scene or given to Afghan security forces.The suspected Haqqani members were questioned about Frerichs’ whereabouts and ultimately turned over to the Afghan government, according to the senior US government official.On Feb. 4, American intelligence officials received a report that Frerichs had possibly been moved to Quetta, Pakistan, a historical haven for the Taliban, the two officials said. But the information was deemed not credible enough to warrant a special operations mission, according to the senior US government official.The report also conflicted with signals intelligence US officials had at the time. Signals intelligence is information gathered from the electronic signals that are broadcast from devices like portable radios and cellphones. The information can be used to track the movements of individuals or eavesdrop on conversations, known in the spy business as low-level voice intercepts.US intelligence officials continued to receive location pings from the suspected cellphones of Frerichs and his captors, but the trail went cold on Feb. 5, according to the senior US government and Defense Department officials.While the senior US government official would not say where exactly the last location ping for Frerichs came from, the official said it was near where he was captured. The AP was not able to determine how the US intelligence community knew to target these specific cellphones to monitor.“Operationally, the reason why time is critical in a kidnapping is because you can close the distance quicker, ideally immediately or by utilizing sources,” said the senior US government official. “This is not the case right now. He could be two houses down from where he was taken and we would not know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seals-tried-to-locate-us-citizen-taken-captured-by-afghan-militants/story-o4zp4nw7DNNWADftBa9PxI.html

The Kremlin this week extended until May 11 a “non-working” period when Russians would stay at home but still receive their salaries as part of sweeping efforts to contain the virus.Yet the measure has brought uncertainty to the economy and business owners struggling to pay full salaries to employees while shutting their doors to customers.Despite the steady increase in cases, Putin said that Russia may begin to gradually lift different quarantine regimes throughout the country from mid-May.

As of Tuesday, the country had counted nearly 72,000 positive cases, 5,017 deaths, and a 7% death rate.When asked during the same news conference about mounting fatalities, President Jair Bolsonaro answered, “So what? What do you want me to do about it?” before joking that even though his middle name means messiah in Portuguese, “I can’t make miracles.”The leader has refused to follow World Health Organization guidance on combating the virus throughout the outbreak. On the domestic front, he’s criticized governors who called for quarantines, fired his health minister for advocating for restrictions and containment measures, and personally took to the streets without a protective face mask, shaking hands and visiting crowded bakeries and markets as a rebellious gesture.Even as increasing numbers of Brazilians fall victim to the virus, some businesses across the country have taken Bolsonaro’s lead. Popular clothing store Hering announced Tuesday it would immediately reopen their 104 stores, and more than 50 shopping malls are back in business, welcoming crowds of masked consumers.In other places in the country, the outbreak is ravaging fragile health systems: hospitals overwhelmed, and beds and ventilators in short supply. Images of hastily-dug cemetery plots in Sao Paulo are splashed across front pages of international newspapers. Some local leaders, including the governors of Ceara and Sao Paulo states and the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, have extended their quarantine periods to cope with the escalating damage inflicted by what the president had at one pointed derided as just “a little flu.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-curve-in-brazil-on-the-rise-death-toll-hits-5000/story-6QikfwvS2vf1WUJ8IsEVRL.html

China’s National Health Commission (NHC) on Thursday said the country reported only four new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the total number to 82,862, while no death due to the disease was registered. The virus has claimed 4,633 lives in the country. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here China’s arduous efforts to contain the coronavirus have brought a decisive outcome to the fight of defending Hubei and its capital city Wuhan, Xi told a high-powered Central Committee meeting of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on Wednesday. The nationwide battle against the epidemic has gained major strategic achievements, the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Xi as saying. Xi said Hubei, including Wuhan, should continue strengthening community-level epidemic prevention and control. He asked officials to make efforts to contain the virus case at Heilongjiang Province bordering Russia, where a large number of Chinese returning from Russian cities were tested positive for coronavirus.The meeting emphasised the need to accelerate work resumption and business reopening, help companies especially micro, small and medium-sized enterprises address difficulties, and promote the recovery of pillar industries such as auto manufacturing, electronic information, new materials and bio-medicine, the report said.The meeting stressed accelerating farm production and expanding sales channels for agricultural products to boost income for farmers. The Hubei province and its capital Wuhan -- where the COVID-19 first emerged in December last year -- were the epicentres of the deadly virus, which later turned into a pandemic, bringing the world to a standstill.The Covid-19 pandemic continues its explosive growth overseas, Xi said, noting the mounting pressure to prevent imported infections and the growing complexity of stemming domestic epidemic resurgence. Xi demanded no relaxation in epidemic control to safeguard the hard-earned achievements, the report said.According to the NHC, all the four Covid-19 patients reported on Wednesday were imported cases.The number of imported cases rose to 1,664, including 13 patients in severe condition, it said. The CPC Central Committee meet was held amid mounting pressure for an international inquiry into the origin of coronavirus and the allegations that the deadly virus was originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) before it spread across the world and wreaked havoc.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage China has come under increasing global pressure over lack of transparency in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far infected over 3,193,960 people and claimed more than 227,640 lives across the world.State-run CGTN TV on Wednesday reported that American scientists are working with their Chinese counterparts to investigate the origin of the novel coronavirus, a prime demand of US President Donald Trump and several other countries. The report said the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDCP) is facilitating the cooperation between Dr Ian Lipkin, Director for Centre for Infection and Immunity of Columbia University, and Prof Lu Jinhai of Sun-Yat-Sen University of Guangzhou to conduct the probe.“The two are working together to determine whether the virus emerged elsewhere in China before Wuhan in December” last year, the report said.It is not yet clear whether the investigation has the official consent of the US government, it said.Besides the US, the UK, Australia and Germany have also called for more transparency from Beijing on the COVID-19 origin.China on Wednesday announced to hold the annual meeting of its Parliament --National People’s Congress (NPC), which was postponed in March due to Covid-19, from May 22, signalling that the pandemic which paralysed the country for over three months is finally under control.Official media said the meeting period of the NPC, which has over 3,000 deputies, could be shortened and held through video link. However, no official announcement has been made so far.The annual session of the national advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), is also expected to be held in Beijing on May 21, official media reported.Dubbed as the annual political season, the NPC and CPPCC sessions -- which together have over 5,000 members, are held every year in early March during which the CPC unveils its national agenda for the year, including the annual budget and formulates new laws.According to the National Health Commission, 77,610 coronavirus patients have been recovered so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-strategic-achievement-xi-jinping-hails-china-s-covid-19-battle/story-K8sy0mUUDcjaKZ2NIhQsgJ.html

30-04-2020||World||US finds tentative cure for Covid-19, hunts chutes for a vaccine||A sliver of hope ran through a nation ravaged by a new virus and shuttered at home after a top US government scientist announced Wednesday that data from ongoing federal trials demonstrated that an antiviral drug can significantly shorten the duration of the illness and hasten recovery from coronavirus.News reports indicated the US Food and Drug Administration could fast-track the approval process to make this medicine, remdesivir by Gilead, available widely.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Anthony Fauci, a top epidemiologist and member of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task-force told reporters, prefacing the announcement as “quite good news”.The trial, which was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that Fauci leads, showed “a drug can block the virus”, Fauci added and described it as “a new standard of care” for treating Covid-19.The top epidemiologist, who has become the most trusted member of the task force, compared the development to the trial 36 years ago in 1986 that led to the HIV antiviral AZT, a drug that had then shown only “modest” efficacy but became the base for better and more improved treatments over the years.Remdesivir is not a vaccine and cannot prevent Covid-19. It can treat Covid-19 better than any other drug around now.It could not be immediately ascertained if remdesivir will be available in India at the same time as in the US and some countries in Europe.But industry experts have speculated in recent days that any company that finds a cure or vaccine to the virus that has infected millions around the world and killed upwards of 200,000 people may have to look to countries with established production capabilities to produce enough for not any single country but beyond.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Early data about the efficacy of the drug, as revealed by Fauci, show that in randomized placebo-controlled trials (in which some patients are administered the drug and others are given inactive mock alternatives, with neither cohort aware of what they are getting) spanning multiple countries, mortality was lower among remdesivir recipients by 8% to placebo’s 11%, and the recovery periods were 11 days to 14 for the two cohorts.The second data point was the more important of the two, according to medical experts. “The primary endpoint was the time to recover -- namely, the ability to be discharged,” Fauci said while announcing the “good news”.And it was celebrated thus across the country from the White House, where President Trump happily acknowledged it as much as he let Fauci do the explaining. Investor interest perked as well despite dismal projections all around of an economy shrinking at a far greater rate than since 2008.Most TV and radio news outfits kicked off their programmes Wednesday with the “good news” about remdesivir even as they went on to urge caution.Americans have grown skeptical about claims of touted cures — the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and even some household disinfectants — as the epidemic has continued to cross new and grimmer milestones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-finds-tentative-cure-for-covid-19-hunts-chutes-for-a-vaccine/story-Ckcj4Z3yyIGhvCjlA3H2jO.html
30-04-2020||World||Antiviral drug remdesivir could hold promise in fight against Covid-19: Study||An investigational antiviral drug could hold promise in devising a treatment for Covid-19. In a trial, evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of the drug remdesivir in coronavirus patients, it was found that the administration of the drug in patients with a severe manifestation of Covid-19 achieved improvement. “The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist who oversaw the study, told reporters at the White House as reported by news agency AFP.It was found that coronavirus patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status when compared to those taking a 5-day treatment course.The trial was conducted by Gilead Sciences, Inc., a research-based biopharmaceutical company headquartered in California, US, with operations in over 30 countries. This study determined if a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir, would achieve similar results as the 10-day course of the drug. The effectiveness of the drug was measured in terms of clinical improvement reported in patients ranging from improvement in breathing, increased level of oxygen support to hospital discharge. “Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry,” the study stated.  Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.The study found that patients who received remdesivir within 10 days of the onset of Covid-19 symptoms had improved outcomes when compared to those who were treated after over 10 days of symptom onset. Nearly 50% of patients in the 5-day treatment showed clinical improvement in 10 days while for those in the 10-day treatment group it was 11 days to report improvement in health. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14. “These data are encouraging as they indicate that patients who received a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir experienced similar clinical improvement as patients who received a 10-day treatment course,” said Aruna Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, and one of the lead investigators of the study. “While additional data are still needed, these results help to bring a clearer understanding of how treatment with remdesivir may be optimized, if proven safe and effective,” she added.Remdesivir is not licensed or approved globally.

More than 95% of them are working in units of fewer than 10 workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/half-of-the-world-s-workers-could-lose-livelihoods-ilo/story-6ebZl0B6WeotoMluWgo7gM.html
30-04-2020||World||South Africa records highest daily Covid infections as easing of lockdown approaches||South Africa reported its highest daily coronavirus infection in a 24-hour cycle Wednesday, just a day before the countrywide lockdown moves down to the phase-4 of a five-phase plan to combat Covid-19.There had been a 73% daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 infections, with 354 new cases taking the total to 5,350, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said Wednesday evening. There were also 10 deaths overnight, raising the toll toll to 103.The Health Department attributed these large figures to a proportionate increase in the number of tests conducted.“The total number of tests conducted to date is 197,127, of which 11,630 were done in the last 24 hours. This is the highest number of tests done in a 24-hour period, representing a 66% increase relative to the previous day’s tally. “Additionally, we have also recorded the highest Covid positive result yield from a 24-hour cycle of testing at 3%,” the statement said.The department also expressed concern that that the number of new cases in the Western Cape Province had almost doubled from 133 on Tuesday to 264 on Wednesday.“In the past 24 hours, the Western Cape contributed to 75% of the total new cases nationally, while only contributing 30% of total tests over the same period.“These concerning trends have prompted us to plan for additional support to be deployed to the province to help contain the spread of Covid-19. The province has been asked to recruit additional personnel and 30 Cuban doctors will also be sent to reinforce the human resource capacity.” As many as 200 doctors from Cuba who arrived in South Africa on Monday are currently in quarantine before being deployed to assist local medical personnel across the country.South Africa has been on an extended 45-day national lockdown that ends on April 30.From May 1, the country will be on the phase-4 of the lockdown, during which there will be slight changes, mainly allowing prepared food deliveries and the sale of cigarettes, both of which were previously prohibited.Some industries will be allowed to gradually start operating again, with strict restrictions regarding number of workers, social distancing and PPE availability.A decision which was expected this week on the reopening of schools and other educational institutions has been deferred to an indefinite date amid reports that many schools will not be ready for the required social distancing and sanitisation processes; as well as concerns raised by both parents and teachers about the risks involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-records-highest-daily-covid-infections-as-easing-of-lockdown-approaches/story-ucVvwlMi2MihLxCCzmMGMI.html
30-04-2020||World||Covid-19: 35 US states release formal opening plans||As many as 35 of the 50 American states have released formal opening plans, as US President Donald Trump on Wednesday exuded confidence that much better days are ahead for the country that has seen more than 61,000 deaths over the past two months due to Covid-19.“We mourn, and I have to say this so strongly we mourn every life tragically lost to the invisible enemy. And we are heartened that the worst of the pain and suffering is going to be behind us,” Trump said, during a White House roundtable with industry executives on “Opening Up America Again”.By Wednesday, more than 61,000 Americans have lost their lives due to coronavirus and over 10 lakhs have tested positive with Covid 19; the highest for any country in the world. Most industries and business activities remain shut and over 95 percent of the country’s 330 million population have been under stay-at-home orders. Over 26 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits and the number is expected to go up to more than 30 million.The US economy has come to a standstill. It grew by negative 4.8 percent in the first quarter. On Wednesday, Trump exuded confidence that economy would be back to track by the fourth quarter.“We think we really have crossed a big boundary, and much better days are ahead, and I often say I see the light at the end of the tunnel very strongly,” Trump said.“We are seeing tremendous pent-up demand, and it’s a beautiful thing to see, so it’s wonderful to have America industry leaders, and that is what you are, true leaders to the White House,” he told the industry leaders.“This demand is going to be incredible. I think next year is going to be an incredible year for our economy. I think the fourth quarter is going to be really, really good,” he added.Thanks to the devotion of the American people, the number of new cases continues to decline, the United States has now conducted nearly six million tests, far more than any other nation, the President said. “And so much has been learned about what we are fighting, and if it does rear up a little bit in the fall or even a lot, we will be able to put it out. We will put out the embers,” he added.Vice President Mike Pence said he is encouraged by the progress, and even the hotspots around the country cases are levelling off and in some areas going down. “Hospitalizations are declining even in the greater New York City area.” “That is a testament to the American people to the way the American people now nearly 45 days ago embraced the guidelines to slow the spread. And as we come to the end of this mitigation period, states across the country have all embraced those same mitigation and social distancing efforts,” he said. “The American people have put them into practice. We have saved lives, we have protected the vulnerable, we have reserved our healthcare system, and we are well on our way to healing our land,” he added.It was just on April 16 that Trump laid out a plan for opening up America again. “And we sit here today. I am informed that 35 states have already released formal opening plans many of which are consulting directly with our team here in the administration and we are going to continue to work with all of them,” Pence said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-35-us-states-release-formal-opening-plans/story-c9CFRTXMMvNm0PzNnQHJ5K.html
30-04-2020||World||Trump says he won’t extend Covid-19 social distancing guidelines||President Donald Trump said Wednesday the federal government will not be extending its coronavirus social distancing guidelines once they expire Thursday, and his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, predicted that by July the country will be “really rocking again.”Meanwhile, Trump said he plans to resume official travel with a trip to Arizona next week. And he said he’s hoping to hold mass campaign rallies in the coming months with thousands of supporters, even though medical experts have said there is little hope of having a vaccine by then.Click here for full Covid-19 coveragePutting a positive face on the latest grim numbers — the US death toll has now surpassed those in the Vietnam War — Trump delivered his daily upbeat update and Kushner described the administration’s much-criticized response to the pandemic as “a great success story.”Trump also talked up the good news the day provided: hopeful results for a possible Covid-19 treatment. But the government announced dismal new economic numbers as the pandemic took hold and shut down much of the country.The US economy shrank at a 4.8% annual rate in first quarter of the year — a precursor to far grimmer reports that are expected this summer from the severe recession triggered by the pandemic.The White House has been trying to pivot to a new stage of the crisis, focused on efforts to reopen the nation’s economy state-by-state amid concerns that lifting restrictions too quickly and without sufficient testing and contact tracing will spur a resurgence.“We’re heartened that the worst of the pain and suffering is going to be behind us,” Trump said as he led a roundtable with executives from companies like Hilton and Toyota.Trump laid out a vision of a return to pre-coronavirus normalcy — “with or without” a vaccine — with packed restaurants and filled stadiums. That vision flies in the face of sober assessments from doctors who say the country will need to embrace a “new normal” that includes extended social distancing and mask-wearing.“I don’t want people to get used to this,” Trump told reporters. “I see the new normal being what it was three months ago.”To underscore his confidence, Trump announced that he plans to resume out-of-state travel after spending more than a month mostly cooped up in the White House. He said he’s planning a trip to Arizona next week, followed by a possible trip to Ohio, even as much of the country remains under effective lockdown with all but essential travel banned.“We’re going to start to move around and hopefully in the not-too-distant future, we’ll have some massive rallies and people will be sitting next to each other,” he said, adding that having people spaced out in accordance with social distancing guidelines “wouldn’t look too good.”Click here for Covid-19 updatesHe didn’t say exactly when he envisioned such rallies returning, but said the timing would depend, in part, on the states, since some have had far fewer cases than others. The federal government and most states have urged residents to avoid mass gatherings and to remain at least six feet apart.The announcement came after Trump said he will not be extending the White House’s “30 Days to Slow the Spread” guidelines when they expire Thursday.“They’ll be fading out because now the governors are doing it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he met with John Bel Edwards, the Democratic governor of Louisiana.Those guidelines — which were originally supposed to last 15 days and were then extended an additional 30 — encouraged Americans to work from home and avoid restaurants, group gatherings and discretionary travel and advised older Americans and those with serious underlying health conditions to isolate themselves.Vice President Mike Pence said the guidelines have been incorporated into the new guidance issued by the White House earlier this month that lays out how states can gradually ease restrictions and begin to reopen as the rate of new cases slows.Edwards, who recently extended Louisiana’s stay-at-home order through May 15, is currently under fire from Republican lawmakers in his state. While he was in Washington, some GOP legislators were trying to rally support to take the extraordinary step of trying to override the governor’s emergency decision-making.But Trump commended Edwards on the job he’s done after New Orleans became one of the nation’s coronavirus hot spots. “I just wanted to congratulate you,” Trump said.At the same time, Trump’s campaign released a digital ad praising elements of the federal response. It is set to reach residents of 17 battleground states featuring Democratic governors whose approval ratings have skyrocketed during the crisis.The White House on Wednesday was also pointing to the prospect of an experimental drug, Remdesivir, which proved effective against the virus in a major new study.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, said the drug reduced the time it takes patients to recover by 31% — 11 days on average versus 15 days for those just given usual care.“It’s highly significant,” said the usually cautious doctor. “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.”The White House and Trump in particular have been eager to give the country positive news as they work to move past the crisis and rebuild the economy, even as the country’s death tally continues to rise. The US has now recorded more than 58,000 deaths from the virus, surpassing the total number of Americans who were killed in the Vietnam War. More than 1 million people have now tested positive.Trump said that number has risen so high because of an increase in testing. The country has dramatically improved its testing after a slow and rocky start, but many health experts say the country still must do more — as many as 5 million tests a day — to safely reopen. Otherwise, they warn, cases will skyrocket as Americans return to work.“The only thing worse than an unnecessarily slow recovery is a reversed recovery,” Joshua Bolten, the president of the Business Roundtable, an association of prominent CEOs, said during the White House event.Meanwhile, Kushner, who has been helping lead response efforts, said in an interview with “Fox and Friends” that he believes May will be “a transition month” and that, “by June, a lot of the country should be back to normal. And the hope is that ... by July the country is really rocking again.”“I think that we’ve achieved all the different milestones that are needed,” he claimed. “So the federal government rose to the challenge, and this is a great success story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-won-t-extend-social-distancing-guidelines/story-AVTo7VmZROm4NUmwDaE7uL.html
30-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update- ‘They misled us’: Donald Trump on WHO’s handling of Covid-19 pandemic||President Donald Trump Wednesday termed the World Health Organization “literally a pipe organ for China” and said the United States will soon come out with its recommendations on the global body, followed by one on Beijing.“They misled us,” he said of the WHO on the coronavirus outbreak. “We will have a recommendation pretty soon but we are not happy with the World Health Organization,” Trump told reporters at his Oval Office of the White House.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Trump has launched an investigation into the WHO’s role in the spread of coronavirus and have accused it of siding with China during the pandemic. Pending an investigation, the President has stopped US aid to the WHO. The investigation would look into the role of China and as to how coronavirus spread from its Wuhan city.“On world health with China to follow,” Trump said when asked to clarity about his comment on recommendation. “On the World Health Organization or a recommendation on China or what do you mean?” he was asked.“What are you hoping to learn about China and the World Health Organization with this investigation you have commissioned with the intelligence agencies?” he was asked.“It is coming in and I am getting pieces already and we are not happy about it and we are by far the largest contributor to WHO,...and they misled us. I don’t know. They must have known more than they knew because they came after what other people knew that weren’t even involved,” Trump said.“We knew things that they didn’t know and either they didn’t know it or they didn’t tell us or you know right now they are literally a pipe organ for China. That is the way I view it,” he said.Trump said, while the US on an average has given the WHO a financial aid between USD400 and USD500 million, and China is giving USD38 million. “And yet, they seem to work for China and they should have been in there early, they should have known what was going on and they should have been able to stop it,” he said.Responding to a question, the President said that there are lots of different people whom the US can give this money to. “We can give this money to lots of different incredible groups. There are a lot of groups out there. It doesn’t have to go to the WHO. We can give it to groups that are very worthy and get much more bang for your buck, but we’re going to make a decision in the not-too-distant future,” Trump said.“You talk about stopping the spread or stopping the embers that could have been stopped there. And then why did China allow planes to fly out but not into China,” he said.“They allow planes to come out and planes are coming out of Wuhan and they’re coming out -- they are going all over the world. They are going to Italy very, very big time to Italy but they are going all over the world but they are not going into China,” he said.As such Trump said his Administration is “coming up with a very distinct recommendation”. There is nothing positive about what happened in China having to do with this subject, he said reiterating that China could have stopped the virus at the source.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “They didn’t have to let airplanes fly out and loads of people come out and we are lucky,” he said.

30-04-2020||World||Donald Trump erupts at campaign team as his poll numbers slide||President Donald Trump erupted at his top political advisers last week when they presented him with worrisome polling data that showed his support eroding in a series of battleground states as his response to the coronavirus comes under criticism.As the virus takes its deadly toll and much of the nation’s economy remains shuttered, new surveys by the Republican National Committee and Trump’s campaign pointed to a harrowing picture for the president as he faces reelection.While Trump saw some of the best approval ratings of his presidency during the early weeks of the crisis, aides highlighted the growing political cost of the crisis and the unforced errors by Trump in his freewheeling press briefings.Trump reacted with defiance, incredulous that he could be losing to someone he viewed as a weak candidate.“I am not f—-ing losing to Joe Biden,” he repeated in a series of heated conference calls with his top campaign officials, according to five people with knowledge of the conversations. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.The message to the president was sobering: Trump was trailing the former Democratic vice president in many key battleground states, he was told, and would have lost the Electoral College if the election had been held earlier this month.On the line from the White House, Trump snapped at the state of his polling during a series of calls with campaign manager Brad Parscale, who called in from Florida; RNC chair Ronna McDaniel, on the line from her home in Michigan; senior adviser Jared Kushner; and other aides.Echoing a number of White House aides and outside advisers, the political team urged Trump to curtail his daily coronavirus briefings, arguing that the combative sessions were costing him in the polls, particularly among seniors. Trump initially pushed back, pointing to high television ratings. But, at least temporarily, he agreed to scale back the briefings after drawing sharp criticism for raising the idea that Americans might get virus protection by injecting disinfectants.Trump aides encouraged the president to stay out of medical issues and direct his focus toward more familiar and politically important ground: the economy.Even as Trump preaches optimism, the president has expressed frustration and even powerlessness as the dire economic statistics pile up. It’s been a whiplash-inducing moment for the president, who just two months ago planned to run for reelection on the strength of an economy that was experiencing unprecedented employment levels. Now, as the records mount in the opposite direction, Trump is feeling the pressure.“We built the greatest economy in the world,” Trump has said publicly. “I’ll do it a second time.”Trump’s political team warned that the president’s path to reelection depends on how quickly he can bring about a recovery.“I think you’ll see by June a lot of the country should be back to normal, and the hope is that by July the country’s really rocking again,” Kushner told “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday morning. But other aides, business leaders and economists predict a far longer road toward recovery.Representatives for the RNC and the Trump campaign did not comment on the polling or last week’s phone calls.According to people familiar with the incident, Trump vented much of his frustration at Parscale, who served as the bearer of bad news.Trump has long distrusted negative poll numbers — telling aides for years that his gut was right about the 2016 race, when he insisted that he was ahead in the Midwest and Florida. At the same time, Parscale and other Trump aides are talking up the sophistication of their data and voter outreach capabilities this time.The president and some aides have had simmering frustrations with Parscale for a while, believing the campaign manager — a close Kushner ally — has enriched himself from his association with Trump and sought personal publicity. Trump had previously been angered when Parscale was the subject of magazine profiles. This latest episode flared before the campaign manager was featured in a New York Times Magazine profile this week.Aides have grown particularly worried about Michigan — which some advisers have all but written off -- as well as Florida, Wisconsin and Arizona.Trump announced Wednesday that he will visit Arizona next week — his first trip outside Washington in a month — as he looks to declare that much of the nation is ready to begin reopening after the virus.The president has mocked Biden, his presumptive general election rival, for being “stuck in his basement” in his Delaware home during the pandemic.Trump said Wednesday that he hopes to soon visit Ohio, a battleground state that Trump carried handily in 2016 but that aides see as growing slightly competitive in recent weeks.Aides acknowledged that the president’s signature rallies would not be returning anytime soon. Some have privately offered doubts that he would be able to hold any in his familiar format of jam-packed arenas before Election Day, Nov. 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-erupts-at-campaign-team-as-his-poll-numbers-slide/story-Ko6INWxtMuL1xmo4beu66M.html

Search and rescue efforts are currently underway,” it added.The statement did not give details on how many personnel were on board, although a Greek military source earlier said it was believed the aircraft had been carrying six people.Initial reports said the helicopter had been over international waters 50 nautical miles off the Greek island of Kefalonia, the Greek air force said.Italian, Greek and Turkish frigates also took part in the patrol that had moved from Greek to Italian waters on Wednesday, with the Greek frigate remaining in Greek waters.Greek naval and air forces were ready to assist in a rescue operation “if Italy requests it”, a military source told AFP.A spokesperson for Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), which plans and carries out all NATO operations, added: “I confirm there has been an incident involving a helicopter from a ship under NATO command.“There is currently a search and rescue operation being conducted and national notifications taking place.”hec/har/to/rma/jah||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-nato-helicopter-goes-missing-off-greece/story-oXzyX3ckBk3yafXB0OeHkO.html
30-04-2020||World||Joe Biden under pressure to address sexual assault allegation||His campaign has strongly denied it but pressure is mounting on Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential hopeful, to personally respond to a sexual assault allegation made by a former Senate aide.Tara Reade, 56, claims that the assault took place in 1993, when she was a 29-year-old staff assistant in the office of Biden, then a US senator from Delaware.Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager and communications director, issued a statement dismissing the allegation but there has been no comment so far from the 77-year-old former vice president himself.“Vice President Biden has dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women,” Bedingfield said in the April 13 statement.“What is clear about this claim: it is untrue,” she said. “This absolutely did not happen.”The denial has however done little to calm media coverage of the claims, which have drowned out other news about Biden, such as his search for a running mate, who he has pledged will be a woman.President Donald Trump’s campaign manager Brad Parscale has flooded his Twitter feed with mocking references to Reade’s allegation, ignoring the string of accusations made by women against his own candidate.More than a dozen women have accused the real estate mogul of sexual misconduct before he became president, including a writer who claims he raped her in a Manhattan department store.Biden has not been asked directly about Reade’s allegation in the interviews he has given from his Delaware home, where he has been confined because of the coronavirus pandemic.The question has also not come up at the various online events he has held, including one on Tuesday during which 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton endorsed his White House bid.- ‘Had me up against the wall’ -According to Reade, the assault took place in August 1993 in a hallway on Capitol Hill.“We were alone, and it was the strangest thing,” Reade said in a late March interview on the Katie Halper Show podcast. “There was no, like, exchange, really, he just had me up against the wall.“His hands were on me and underneath my clothes and, yeah, he went, he went down my skirt but then up inside it and he penetrated me with his fingers,” she said.“He was kissing me at the same time,” she said.Reade said she pulled away and Biden allegedly said: “‘Come on man, I heard you liked me.’““For me everything shattered at that moment,” Reade said.Reade has since recounted her story to several other media outlets and according to US press reports, she filed a complaint with the Washington police in early April but did not name Biden.Other women have accused Biden of touching or embracing them inappropriately in the past, and Reade’s initial claims were similar -- less severe than her most recent allegations.The New York Times reported that it had interviewed Reade on multiple occasions, along with her friends and others who worked for Biden in the early 1990s. According to the Times, no former Biden staffers corroborated her account, and a pattern of misconduct was not uncovered.A friend said Reade had told her about the alleged assault at the time. A second friend said Reade told her in 2008 of a traumatic experience while working in Biden’s office.Reade said she had also related the incident to her brother.The allegations have led some supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, who dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination and endorsed Biden, to call on the former vice president to end his White House bid.“Now is the time to deal with the ramifications of Tara Reade’s accusations, not this fall,” said Claire Sandberg, the former national organizing director of the Sanders campaign.“There is simply no moral justification for Biden to continue as the presumptive nominee,” Sandberg said. “Out of respect for survivors and for the good of the country, he should withdraw from the race.”elc/cl/sst||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-under-pressure-to-address-sexual-assault-allegation/story-e6xLTqM85UMixDyYppBg4K.html
30-04-2020||World||Antiviral drug shows some hope in US govt-run study||Gilead Sciences Inc. said early results from a US-government-run study showed its experimental drug to treat coronavirus helped patients recover more quickly than standard care, suggesting it could become the first effective treatment for an illness that has turned modern life inside-out.Gilead shares jumped as much as 7.1% Wednesday after the company’s statement. The news appeared to boost the entire U.S. stock market as well, with the S&P 500 gaining 2.4% despite data showing a deep contraction in the U.S. economy in the first quarter of the year.The company issued a news release early Wednesday commenting on the study from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases without providing details of the results.Anthony Fauci, the head of NIAID and the government’s top infectious-disease specialist, said at a White House meeting with President Donald Trump and Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards that the trial showed a significant positive effect on the virus and that the results “were quite good news.”Fauci called the study the “first truly high-powered randomized placebo-controlled trial” of remdesivir.Gilead’s share price and the broader stock market have been churned in recent weeks by a series of early looks and leaks of trial data on the drug, called remdesivir. Last week, the market swooned after apparently discouraging results from a Chinese trial were accidentally posted on a World Health Organization web page. Data confirming those more downbeat results were published in the U.K. medical journal The Lancet on Wednesday.Remdesivir, which was originally developed to treat other novel viruses, has placed Gilead at the head of the race to develop a treatment for Covid-19. The drug, which has also been tested on Ebola, hasn’t been approved for use anywhere in the world.A separate study released by Gilead on Wednesday said remdesivir appears equally effective when it’s given over just five days, rather than the 10-day course used in NIAID and other trials. But the Gilead study doesn’t have a comparison group.The five-day regimen “could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir,” said Merdad Parsey, Gilead’s chief medical officer.Taken together, the studies could signal a profound shift in the race to get the novel coronavirus under control. The availability of a treatment could allow the world to start reopening economies, as well as offer psychological relief to billions of people who have been self-isolating to hide from the virus.In the most severe cases, Covid-19 can lead to respiratory failure and death. More than 1 million cases have been confirmed in the U.S., and over 200,000 people have died around the globe from the illness.Multiple trials of the drug are being conducted. The NIAID trial measured how quickly patients taking it were able to be removed from supplemental oxygen therapy or were discharged from the hospital. It’s not known yet how much benefit the Gilead drug gave patients, and if it will make a meaningful difference in their care.The trial, run by the National Institutes of Health, aimed to sign up about 800 patients to test the drug and give a definitive answer as to whether it can help treat the illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antiviral-drug-shows-some-hope-in-us-govt-run-study/story-yqIrMrWjbgUD5gjmAR7NzO.html
30-04-2020||World||UK PM Johnson, a Covid survivor, becomes a father||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, gave birth to a baby boy on Wednesday at a London hospital, slightly earlier than had been expected.Both mother and child are doing well, a spokeswoman said. Symonds had been expected to give birth in early summer.“The prime minister and Ms Symonds are thrilled to announce the birth of a healthy baby boy at a London hospital this morning,” a spokesperson said. Johnson returned to work on Monday, a month after testing positive for Covid-19, which he said had threatened his life. Symonds also had symptoms of the virus but recovered swiftly.The couple, who have been living together in Downing Street since Johnson became PM in July, announced in February that they were expecting their first child.Focusing on population infected by coronavirus and suspending treatment of cancer patients in the UK could lead to deaths of over 18,000 infected by the malignancy, experts forecast.According to campaign group Macmillan Cancer Support, nearly 18,000 people with cancer in England could die as the pandemic has forced hospitals to suspend treatment and deterred patients from seeking NHS care. Cancer should not be “the forgotten C”, it said.Research by the group shows that an extra 6,270 people in England recently diagnosed with cancer could die from it over the next 12 months as a result of the disruption caused by the virus, and the additional toll taking into account those living with cancer could be 17,915.A further 765 deaths from the coronavirus have been reported in the UK. The total toll rose by 3,811 as the country added historical data to its running total.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-a-covid-survivor-becomes-a-father/story-LrWqeMxUDV6CiBCokoXYwN.html
30-04-2020||World||British coronavirus death toll now world’s third-worst||Britain’s death toll from the coronavirus outbreak jumped to 26,097 on Wednesday -- the second-highest in Europe behind Italy and third-highest in the world -- as the government took into account fatalities outside hospital, including care homes, for the first time.The increase came after surprise news that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had become a father again at age 55, several months earlier than expected, and just weeks after he was taken to hospital with Covid-19.Downing Street announced that his partner, Carrie Symonds, 32, gave birth to a healthy baby boy, prompting messages of congratulation from across the political spectrum at home and abroad.The rare good news was soured however by the additional 4,419 deaths in the overall coronavirus death toll, just as Johnson, who returned to work on Monday, is under pressure to ease a month-long lockdown.Until now, Britain had reported only deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 in hospital but there has been mounting concern about high numbers of unreported victims in the wider community.On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics said deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending April 17 were running at roughly double the five-year average and were the highest weekly total since 1993.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Wednesday said there were an additional 3,811 deaths included in the outbreak since the start of March, on top of figures from the last 24 hours.“They don’t represent a sudden surge in the number of deaths,” he told reporters.According to an AFP tally from official sources at 1300 GMT on Wednesday, Britain has now leapfrogged the tolls in France and Spain and is the second-worst affected country in Europe, behind Italy’s 27,359 deaths. The United States has the world’s worst death toll with 58,355.- Second peak -Britain has widened its testing regime for Covid-19 to care homes, the over-65s and people unable to work from home, as part of increased measures to curb the outbreak.A total of 85 frontline workers in the state-run National Health Service (NHS) have died from the coronavirus, and 23 in social care, according to the government.There remain questions about the provision of personal protective equipment to medics and others dealing with patients, and the availability of testing. Raab, who has deputised for Johnson during his illness and recovery, warned the government is not yet ready to ease lockdown restrictions.“This issue of a second spike and the need to avoid it, it’s not a theoretical risk,” he said.“Having relaxed restrictions in Germany over the last week, they’ve seen a rise in the transmission rate of coronavirus.“We’re in a delicate and dangerous moment. We’re coming through the peak, but we’re not there yet.”- ‘Relief and joy’ -Britain shut non-essential shops and services, and ordered people to stay at home except to shop for groceries and medicines, on March 27.A review of the measures is expected on May 7, amid dire warnings about the economic impact and indications of frustration at the continued confinement.Johnson held a lunchtime telephone call with the leader of the main opposition Labour party, Keir Starmer who has called for more clarity on the lockdown exit plan.Starmer earlier joined well-wishers in congratulating Johnson on becoming a father again, particularly after his recent experience. Symonds also displayed Covid-19 symptoms but was not tested.“Whatever differences we have in this house, as human beings we all recognise the anxiety the prime minister and Carrie must have gone through in these past few weeks,” he told parliament.“I really hope this brings them incredible relief and joy.”Johnson had to spend three nights in intensive care, and later admitted his illness “could have gone either way”.He was present for the birth at an unnamed NHS hospital in London and would be taking some paternity leave later in the year, his spokesman said.Johnson has at least five other children, including four with his second wife, Marina Wheeler, from whom he split in 2018.He also had a daughter as a result of an extra-marital affair while he was mayor of London, according to a 2013 court case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-coronavirus-death-toll-now-world-s-third-worst/story-9yDxyhP9ioSfaVZzXs1cyI.html

We don’t have any information to report today, we’re watching it closely,” Pompeo told Fox News after being asked about conflicting reports about Kim’s health.Pompeo said the United States was also monitoring the situation more broadly in North Korea, given the risk presented by the coronavirus.“There is a real risk that there will be a famine, a food shortage, inside of North Korea too,” he added. “We’re watching each of those things closely, as they have a real impact on our mission set, which to ultimately denuclearize North Korea.”President Donald Trump met Kim three times in 2018 and 2019 in an attempt to persuade him to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States. While talks have stalled, Trump has continued to hail Kim as a friend.Pompeo did not elaborate on the risk of famine in North Korea, but a North Korean economic delegation was due in Beijing this week to discuss food supplies and trade issues as the coronavirus outbreak has severely disrupted the country’s food supply, two people with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.Impoverished and isolated North Korea is prone to food shortages. As many as 1.1 million people died during the famines of the 1990s, according to South Korean estimates.Also read: With Kim Jong Un’s health status unclear, his uncle suddenly relevant after 40 yrs abroadOfficials in South Korea and the United States have said Kim may be staying at a coastal resort to avoid exposure to the new coronavirus, and have expressed skepticism about media reports he had some kind of serious illness. They caution, however, that Kim’s health and location are closely guarded secrets and reliable information is difficult to obtain in North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-sign-of-north-korea-s-kim-real-risk-of-famine-in-country-says-pompeo/story-fkq3m1KvnQc1YPLpN2HBjM.html

30-04-2020||India||Industries in K’taka may start from May 4||Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa on Thursday announced that all industries in the state outside containment zones will be allowed to operate from May 4 a day after the extended lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 spread will end. He said the Covid-19 cases might continue for another two to three months and added efforts to control the pandemic would go hand in hand with economic activity which has almost fully stopped due to the lockdown.Yediyurappa said the cases reported from Bengaluru have been coming down for the last two to three days but they will wait for a few more days to take a final decision on allowing economic activities in the city. Bengaluru, which has reported 147 of Karnataka’s 565 Covid-19 cases, has around 24 containment zones. The city is Karnataka’s economic engine and contributes nearly half of the state’s revenues.Yediyurappa said they have no plans for allowing malls, hotels or movie theatres to reopen and added the state would wait for Centre’s directives before taking a final decision.Yediyurappa later met representatives of associations of commerce and industries and asked them to be ready to resume operations. He appealed to the industrialists to pay wages and salaries to their employees.The Karnataka Cabinet met separately and decided to issue one-time permits for inter-state and inter-district for stranded migrants and labourers.Law minister J C Madhuswamy said the cost for the travel would be borne by those who want to travel and the government would merely provide permits and bus services. On Wednesday, another minister, Suresh Kumar, said the state government would bring back stranded people from Karnataka from Gujarat and buses would be sent for the purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/industries-in-k-taka-may-start-from-may-4/story-AQHkSpyqm3t0ky3Hd0ByzJ.html
30-04-2020||India||105 Covid patients dead in W Bengal||KOLKATA: West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said on Thursday that 105 Covid-19 patients had died in the state, 33 of them succumbing to the viral disease, and the rest to co-morbid conditions. The state government also reported 37 new cases on Thursday, taking to 795 the number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19.This new figure of fatalities was released six days after the state administration said 57 persons who tested positive for Covid-19 had died, and attributed 18 of the deaths to the disease and 39 to “severe co-morbidity.” Bengal is the only state that has formed a committee of doctors to determine the cause of death among Covid-19 patients.“Today I have received a report from the expert committee conducting audits into the deaths of Covid-19 positive patients. Altogether 105 cases have been examined by them, out of which they have said 33 died of Covid-19 infection. In 72 other cases, death was caused by co-morbid conditions and Covid-19 was only incidental,” Sinha said.Meanwhile, the number of containment zones increased. In Kolkata from 227 on Monday to 264 on Thursday, and in neighbouring Howrah to 70 from 56.A controversy has raged over Bengal’s way of listing Covid-19 fatalities, with opposition parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress and the Left accusing the state government of manipulating the number of deaths.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Wednesday said that she and her government did not tamper with the numbers and that an expert committee of doctors was conducting the audit independently. Over the past two days, a new controversy haS been brewing over an official order from the superintendent of Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital asking doctors not to mention Covid-19 in the death certificates of patients who had tested positive for the disease.This government order from the medical superintendent-cum-vice principal of Murshidabad Medical College was dated April 25 and numbered Msd/MCH/MSVP/2006. While top health department officials remained tightlipped, the hospital superintendent, Debdas Saha, was transferred on Thursday.“The administration is trying to make the superintendent a scapegoat. The administration from the top is differentiating between the deceased persons to show a lesser number of deaths. There is a death audit committee for this purpose. The only mistake the super may have done was to put the government’s viewpoints in the writing,” BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh alleged.Congress’ Lok Sabha leader and Berhampore MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury echoed Ghosh.Chief secretary Sinha, refusing to comment on the transfer, said the death audit committee had nothing to do with death certificates.“This committee was not doing any kind of audit in death certificates; it was auditing the cause of death,” Sinha said.Senior doctor Rezaul Karim, a leader of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, said that he had raised the issue of death audit during the chief minister’s meeting with eight doctors’ associations on Tuesday.“It is possible that a person testing positive for the presence of novel coronavirus in her/his body is not a Covid-19 patient. She/he may have no symptoms of the disease at all and might only be a carrier. But these fine differences could be part of academic debates within the boundaries of academic institutions. We told the chief minister that at the time of a pandemic, deaths of all patients testing positive for coronavirus infection should be attributed to Covid-19 in order to avoid confusion and controversy in the public sphere,” Karim said. On Thursday, senior Left leaders staged a demonstration in Kolkata to protest against the “manipulation in the number of deaths,” and alleged a scam in the public distribution system and mismanagement in reaching relief to the poor. They maintained social distancing while staging the demonstration with placards in their hands and faces covered with masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/105-covid-patients-dead-in-w-bengal/story-ibgojGgKXZR0zLGqH1VC0K.html
30-04-2020||India||25% Gujarat cases from 2 zones in capital||JaipurOne in every four cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Gujarat has so far been reported from two zones of the Ahmedabad municipal corporation, with a population of 320,000, government data shows.Till Thursday, 4,395 cases were reported, out of which 24.50% cases have been reported from the central and southern zones of Ahmedabad. Of the total 1,713 cases reported from these two zones, most have been from Khadia, Dariapur, Shahpur, Jamalpur, Danilimdi and Behrampur, according to officials.Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra said the wards from central and southern zones come under the Walled City of the district and have high population density. “On a scale never seen before in India, we sealed the old Walled City in a single day and surveyed more than 100,000 people. We adopted a strategy of cluster containment early on and were able to moderate the growth of virus in hot spots such as central Ahmedabad. Even at the cost of a rise in figures, we started aggressive testing and surveillance,” he said.An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the municipal corporation took some time to react after the first case was reported on March 30. “Also, the lockdown norms were not strictly enforced in these wards,” the local government official said.Giving out details of Covid-19 cases in the state, health secretary Jayanthi Ravi on Thursday said the recovery rate considerably improved over the past few days. “We expect to see a lot of improvement in the next week or so,” she said.Following the guidelines of the Union home ministry, the state government has also started the process of identifying people of Gujarat stuck in other states. “Responsibility has been assigned to 16 officers of Gujarat to make arrangements to bring back stranded persons. The process will be carried out in phases,” said Ashwani Kumar, secretary to the chief minister.In Surat, a 50-year-old Covid-19 patient, who allegedly left the Covid-19 ward of a civil hospital two days back, was found dead on a bench outside the medical facility on Thursday morning, police said. Preliminary investigations and CCTV footage of the hospital indicated that the man did not go outside the hospital campus, located in Khatodara area, during the last two days, an official from Khatodara police station said. He was admitted on April 21 and a few days later, his wife also tested positive and was admitted to the same hospital.“As of now, we don’t know why he ran away in the middle of his treatment, where he went and how he died. We are carrying out a thorough investigation into it,” deputy commissioner of police Vidhi Chaudhari said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-gujarat-cases-from-2-zones-in-capital/story-SMLUAUGWbNKkB13tSyKU2O.html
30-04-2020||India||At 17.5%, Ujjain has MP’s highest death rate||Bhopal/Ujjain: Ujjain has recorded the highest death rate--17.51%--in Madhya Pradesh with 17 Covid-19 related fatalities there over the last seven days, according to the government data. Seven out of 76 Covid-19 patients had died in Ujjain until April 23 and every fourth patient has succumbed to the disease over the last seven days.Ujjain, which is known for famous Mahakal Temple and hosts one of four Kumbh fairs every 12 years, had reported 137 Covid-19 cases as of Thursday and 24 fatalities. Indore, the worst-hit place in the state by the pandemic, had a death rate of 4.40 until Wednesday followed by Bhopal (2.89%). Madhya Pradesh, with 130 deaths, has a death rate of 4.88%. It is 3.19% nationally.Officials said the government has now involved a private medical college’s laboratory in Ujjain for testing as a delay in getting reports is one of the reasons behind the high death rate in the district.Ujjain’s first Covid-19 case came to light on March 25 after a woman tested positive for the disease after her death. It had reported just six cases until March 31 and two deaths. On April 15, Ujjain had 30 Covid-19 patients and six fatalities. The number of cases rose after April 22 and so did the deaths.A health department official, who did not wish to be named, said the situation was alarming right from the beginning when five members of the family of the first patient were found infected. “Ujjain’s situation was similar to that of Indore. The hotspots were identified early and the administration thought the situation could be controlled with the lockdown and curfew restrictions.” The official said there was hence no focus on surveys, screening and collection of samples. “The state government did not pay attention to the problem... [it did not] upgrade any lab here for Covid testing. The administration in Ujjain heavily relied on labs in Indore and Bhopal, which were already overburdened... The result was the reports were delayed by 10 to 15 days. In between, the administration also sent samples to labs in Pune, Ahmedabad and certain other centres but it hardly helped.”HP Sonaniya, the nodal officer for Covid-19, said about 90% of the patients who have died were suffering from other diseases. “Only two to three young patients have died. The rest were above 60. There were at least seven to eight who died within two hours of their admission to hospital as they were admitted in a very serious conditions. Also, seven to eight patients were brought dead but their numbers were added to the list of deceased as their samples were collected for tests as per protocol.”Ujjain division commissioner Anand Sharma said mostly Covid-19 patients in Ujjain are from containment areas as they are able to trace them. “As we have got a lab in Ujjain now, it will clear the backlog... The situation will improve.”Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said Ujjain is a classic case of a state government’s failure in assessing the ground situation and inaction. “Besides lack of required surveys, screening and testing, the administration relied on a private facility for treatment of patients without trying to know if it had enough infrastructure. That there was no government laboratory till now and a private lab was engaged on Thursday, 35 days after the first case, speaks volumes about the bureaucratic approach in dealing with the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-17-5-ujjain-has-mp-s-highest-death-rate/story-SLUoZqRMVXjbXA5g4CI7SI.html
30-04-2020||India||No SC stay on Central Vista project||The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to stay the Central Vista Redevelopment Project for the time being, saying there is no pressing urgency for granting one because the country is in a state of lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19. “During Covid-19, nobody is going to do anything. There is no urgency...” Chief Justice of India SA Bobde remarked.Petitioner Rajeev Suri, an advocate, had moved the court challenging the Centre’s notification on March 20 for changing the land use for the proposed project. The redevelopment plan includes a new Parliament building, and a common secretariat for central government offices . Almost all opposition parties have urged the Centre to shelve the project and spend the money instead on the fight against Covid-19. The total project is expected to cost around Rs 20,000 crore. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, defended the project. “Parliament is being constructed. Why is there a problem?”The court said another petition by Suri on the same issue is pending before it. That petition, which was initially filed before the Delhi high court, was transferred to the Supreme Court on March 6. The court disposed of Suri’s fresh petition while granting him the liberty to amend the pending petition.“The Supreme Court has granted liberty to amend the writ petition challenging the Central Vista project which is pending. In the order today, there is no rejection of prayer. In this pending petition, the Supreme Court has already passed an order that the proposal of the government in regard to the Central Vista will be subject to the outcome of the pending writ petition,” said Suri. He added that Mehta has also accepted the notice and sought time to file a counter-affidavit . “There is no refusal to stay. Today, it granted liberty to amend the writ pending.”Suri and another petitioner, Lt Colonel (retd) Anuj Srivastava, moved the high court in February challenging a Delhi Development Authority (DDA) notification on December 21 regarding changes in land use for the redevelopment. He challenged the alterations envisaged by the Centre, arguing that the DDA is not vested with the requisite power to bring about such changes. Suri submitted the power, if at all, for bringing about such changes lies with the Centre.Srivastava challenged the public hearings held to raise objections to the exercise, arguing that they were a mere formality devoid of any meaningful exercise.A single-judge bench of the high court on February 11 granted them interim relief and ordered the DDA to approach it before notifying any of the proposed changes in the land use. “In case a decision is taken to notify the proposed changes in Master Plan Delhi 2020-21, the DDA will approach the court before notifying such decision,” the high court ordered while issuing notices to the Centre and the DDA.A high court division bench comprising Chief Justice D N Patel and justice C Hari Shankar stayed the order of the single judge on February 28. Suri then approached the Supreme Court.The Centre subsequently notified change in the land use on March 20 which Suri challenged in his fresh plea before the Supreme Court .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-sc-stay-on-central-vista-project/story-M6DFkVPiHQ1Wy97vqB0ohP.html

30-04-2020||India||SC settles 1996 cricket World Cup tax dispute||A full 24 years after the conclusion of the 1996 Cricket World Cup jointly hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, India’s top court has ruled that payments made to cricket associations for matches conducted in India will be liable to tax. The Income Tax authorities had raised a demand of Rs 38.88 lakh payable by a joint consortium formed by the host nations based out of India.After conclusion of the World Cup, Indian tax officials discovered that a consortium by the name PILCOM (Pak-Indo-Lanka Joint Management Committee), transferred payments out of India to the cricket boards of member countries of the London-based International Cricket Council (ICC). ICC has nine full members and 20 associate members. PILCOM opened two bank accounts in London into which money was transferred.A show cause notice was served to PILCOM for non-deposit of tax liable on these payments as these were considered income accrued in India under Sections 201(1) and 194E of the Income Tax Act. On initial calculations, the amount liable to be deposited came to Rs 2.18 crore. But PILCOM challenged this assessment before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, which ordered a re-assessment in the year 1997.A second assessment order was passed on December 28, 1998. PILCOM filed an appeal before the Tribunal but lost. The matter went to Calcutta High Court which partly upheld the tax demand on November 11, 2010. It was an appeal against this order that finally came to be settled by the apex court on Thursday.PILCOM argued that the payment made to cricket associations was towards “grant of privilege” and had nothing to do with matches played in India. The amount was called “guarantee money”. The tax department maintained that the income in question arose from a source of income in India, i.e. playing of cricket matches, fully satisfying the mandate required under law.On Thursday, a bench of Justices UU Lalit and Vineet Saran said, “The payments made to the Non-Resident Sports Associations in the present case represented their income which accrued or arose or was deemed to have accrued or arisen in India……Though the payments were described as Guarantee Money, they were intricately connected with the event where various cricket teams were scheduled to play and did participate in the event. The source of income, as rightly contended by the Revenue, was in the playing of the matches in India.”The court noted the provision of Section 115 BBA (1)(b) of Income Tax Act which talks about income generated by non-resident sports association in India and held this income to include guarantee money as well. PILCOM had further sought tax exemption under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) signed with Australia, England, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Holland. The judges held, “The obligation to deduct tax at source under Section 194E of the IT Act is not affected by the DTAA…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-settles-1996-cricket-world-cup-tax-dispute/story-SB5NDV4KmMjui987RKlyUL.html
30-04-2020||India||With 17 deaths in 7 days Ujjain’s mortality rate is highest in MP||Bhopal/Ujjain: With death of as many as 17 Covid-19 patients in the past seven days Ujjain has reported the highest death rate in Madhya Pradesh leaving Indore and Bhopal, two other big hotspots much behind, according to the state government’s data.Madhya Pradesh has reported a total of 2,625 cases of Covid-19 and 137 deaths as on Thursday evening.Ujjain district registered as many as 137 Covid-19 cases till Thursday morning out of whom 24 have died. The mortality rate is 17.51%. On April 23 the number of patients stood at 76 with seven dead. Thus in the past 7 days almost every fourth Covid patient died in the district.Indore’s mortality rate as on Wednesday evening was 4.40% and Bhopal’s 2.89%. Madhya Pradesh’s mortality rate was 4.88% against the national mortality rate of 3.19% with 1,075 casualties.It was only on Thursday, 35 days after the first Covid-19 case was reported in Ujjain that the state government could engage a private medical college’s laboratory in the city for testing the samples.Health department officials say the inordinate delay in getting reports of samples was one of the main reasons behind the high mortality rate. Ujjain’s first Covid-19 patient came to light after her death on March 25 when she tested positive. Till March 31 there were just six patients and two of them had died. On April 15, six of the 30 patients had died. But the number of Covid-19 positive cases rose alarmingly after April 22 and so did the number of casualties.A health department official who did not want to be named said, “The situation was alarming right from the beginning when as many as five members of the family of the first patient in Ujjain who had died were found infected. Ujjain was a similar case as that of Indore. The localities which were epicentres were identified early but the administration believed that with lockdown and curfew restrictions it would be able to control. Hence, there was no focus on massive survey, screening and collection of samples to be tested.”He said, “As the state government too didn’t pay attention to the problem of upgrading any lab here for suspected Covid patients’ samples the administration in Ujjain heavily relied on labs in Indore and Bhopal which were already overburdened with a high number of samples to be tested. The result was the reports were delayed by 10 to 15 days. In between the administration also sent samples to labs in Pune, Ahmedabad and certain other centres but it hardly helped.”Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said, “Ujjain is a classic case in the country of a state government and its machinery’s failure in assessing the ground situation and swinging into action to control the situation. Besides lack of required survey, screening and samples collection the administration relied on a private facility for treatment of patients without trying to know if it had the infrastructure to treat patients. The fact that there is no government laboratory till now and a private lab was engaged on Thursday 35 days after the first case of Covid-19 found speaks volumes for the bureaucratic approach of the government in dealing with a pandemic.”But the government says that most of those who died of Covid-19 in Ujjain had co-morbidity factors.The nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr HP Sonaniya said, “About 90% of the patients who died were suffering from several other diseases. There were only two to three young patients who had died. The rest were above 60 years of age. There were at least 7 to 8 patients who died within two hours of their admission to the hospitals as they were admitted in a very serious situation and they came very late. Also, 7 to 8 patients were brought dead but their number was added to the list of deceased as their samples were collected for test as per protocol.”Commissioner, Ujjain division Anand Sharma expects the situation to improve in the near future.“Mostly the patients in Ujjain are coming from containment areas as we are able to trace them after contact tracing of the patients. As we have got a lab in Ujjain now it will not only clear the backlog in Ujjain but in the division too regarding the test of samples. The number of deaths rose as four deaths were reported from one family only in Badnagar, a town in Ujjain district. The situation will improve in the coming days,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-17-deaths-in-7-days-ujjain-s-mortality-rate-is-highest-in-mp/story-QRIV4rXYEhckJhqPyxI8ZK.html

I shared the photos on social media because I have never seen such a sight in Saharanpur and I have been posted here for a long time,” Indian Forest Service officer and secretary of UP State Biodiversity Board, Ramesh Pandey said.“These are the same mountains, which can otherwise be seen from Mussoorie,” Forest conservator, Saharanpur division, V K Jain said.Lack of vehicular traffic and industrial emissions due to the lockdown has led to a sharp dip in pollution levels across most cities and towns. It is just not Saharanpur, which is enjoying clean air during the month-long lockdown. A few days earlier, people in Jalandhar had been able to see the Dhauladhar range at a distance of about 200 km for the first time in decades.An official of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board said Saharanpur does not have an automatic AQI station in place. “A manual report is also not available since offices are closed. But the nearest AQI station at Muzaffarnagar has recorded an AQI of less than 50. Generally, Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur, have similar AQIs so it is estimated that Saharanpur’s AQI too, must be below 50. In the past, AQI here has been recorded in the “very poor” category of 300,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-aqi-below-50-up-s-saharanpur-catches-glimpse-of-snow-capped-himalayas/story-gNRl7FPAn1UuIfSad75xaM.html
30-04-2020||India||‘All borders sealed to keep out infections’||New Delhi: There have been no major activities like infiltration of terrorists, human trafficking, cattle, fake currency or drug smuggling along India’s borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh over the last month as they have been completely sealed, the head of Border Security Force (BSF) and Indo-Tibet Border Force (ITBP) said on Thursday.“Our priority during the [Covid-19] lockdown has been to stop infiltration of coronavirus carriers from across the border while maintaining tight vigil on other activities,” said Surjeet Singh Deswal. “We have maintained a high level of alertness at the borders, which are completely sealed with no movement of any kind.”Jammu & Kashmir police chief Dilbagh Singh last week accused Pakistan of pushing Covid-19 infected militants to spread the disease in the Union Territory. The intelligence agencies have also alerted the government that about 300 terrorists were waiting to cross over from Pakistan, according to people aware of the matter. Pakistan has also resorted to shelling and firing, which are often used as cover to push in infiltrators into India, along the Line of Control (LoC) or the de facto border between the two countries in Jammu & Kashmir.Without going into specifics, Deswal said Pakistan’s “mischievous acts” along the international border and the LoC have been responded “with double impact”.Deswal said a few incidents of smuggling or people crossing from the Bangladesh border have been reported over the last month. According to the BSF data, over 20,000 cattle were smuggled to Bangladesh from January 1 to March 24. After the lockdown, this number has come down to around 300. Smuggling of heroin, drugs, gold, and silver has drastically reduced since March 25 when the lockdown was imposed.According to the data, 97 kg of heroin was seized along the India-Pakistan border in Punjab between January 1 and March 24, while only 17 kg heroin was seized from March 25 till April 12.“There has been no infiltration of terrorists. A couple of incidents had taken place in Punjab when a Pakistani national was stopped from crossing over on March 25 at Pulmoran in Amritsar while another Pakistani was apprehended from Bamer in Ferozepur on March 26. Otherwise, the border is quiet,” said a BSF officer who did not wish to be named.The BSF is responsible for guarding the 2,289-kms border with Pakistan from Gujarat to Jammu. It also manages 237-km long LoC under the army’s operational control. The BSF guards the entire 4,092 km-long border with Bangladesh.Deswal said they were maintaining 100% vigil along the India-China border as well. He added the BSF and ITBP are now Covid-19 free and a few cases reported have been cured. “We have told all the troops and their families to undertake extra physical exercise as having a healthy body is the best medicine against the coronavirus,” Deswal said. He added they have begun calling troopers, who have been on extended leave due to Covid-19 lockdown, back to duty from areas that have reported no cases. He said the ITBP is also making masks and Personal Protection Equipment for the Central Industrial Security Force, which may resume Delhi metro and airport services soon.Deswal has also briefed the troops deployed at Indian embassies in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka on the safety measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-borders-sealed-to-keep-out-infections/story-yNP70nRWwQX9X4QPZ93nvM.html

The Imran Khan government’s handling of the pandemic has also faced criticism within Pakistan.During the virtual meeting on the Covid-19 pandemic, India said the impact of the crisis is “still unfolding in a multidimensional manner, including on human rights and fundamental freedoms”. India said the guidelines issued by the special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing are “very relevant in this crisis”.“As we all are aware, the flow of information is very crucial is carrying out mandated activities by the special procedures. In the current situation, we would like to ask how the pandemic has affected the flow of credible information to the special procedures,” the Indian statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-targets-pak-for-disinformation-campaign-at-un-human-rights-body/story-g79bWxNVqmqwZDiLUFDvyI.html

However, such treatment must be guided by the guidelines or instruction given by the State Government in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic,” said the bench comprising justices Shatrughan Pujahari and KR Mohapatra.Azra Jamal, a lawyer-activist, had filed a PIL in Orissa HC seeking action against Shanti Nursing Home, alleging it denied dialysis treatment to Hasan, which led to his death on April 10. “Shanti Hospital in Cuttack had refused to treat the chronic kidney disease patient because he belonged to the Muslim community. As a result of which he died on the same day,” Jamal had said in her petition. She said the private hospital had turned the patient away, demanding the production of negative “Covid-19 test result before allowing him to access the dialysis facility.The son of the deceased had initially lodged a complaint with the police alleging his father was asked to follow a lot of protocol compared to other patients upon his arrival at the hospital on April 10. Though the man was a regular patient with the nursing home for a year and a half, the hospital staff allegedly advised him against coming for dialysis. Members of the hospital management asked my father to come back with personal protection equipment for the medical staff who would give him the dialysis, the son of the deceased alleged.The petitioner in her PIL said news reports over Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi had resulted in fear and hatred towards the Muslim community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-hc-orders-probe-in-death-of-a-muslim-who-was-denied-dialysis-in-lockdown/story-205siq8mIUWoSCaFbDETqI.html
30-04-2020||India||PM Modi meets ministers to discuss investment, booster for economy expected||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday held a “comprehensive” meeting discussing strategy to boost the battered economy as the government may announce its first booster dose to protect lives and livelihood after the lockdown is eased next week, people aware of the development said.There is a general consensus that the government would respond to emerging economic challenges as and when required instead of a one-time stimulus, they said requesting anonymity.But, one thing is certain that all policy and fiscal measures will be aimed at making India a preferred global manufacturing hub where both domestic and foreign direct investments (FDIs) will be encouraged.Hindustan Times on Tuesday reported that the government plans to aggressively push its ‘Make in India’ programme by offering domestic and foreign manufacturers policy and fiscal incentives to manufacture locally. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) confirmed it on Thursday. “Various strategies to bring investments into India in a fast-track mode and to promote Indian domestic sectors were discussed [in the meeting],” a PMO statement said.“PM Modi held a comprehensive meeting to discuss strategies to attract more foreign investments into India as well as to promote local investments in order to give a boost to the economy against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the statement said. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Modi, was attended by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, home minister Amit Shah, commerce and industries minister Piyush Goyal, minister of state for finance Anurag Singh Thakur and other senior bureaucrats.According to people mentioned above, the government is, however, cautious while opening the economy from next week as the country cannot afford another nationwide lockdown that has hit both formal and informal sectors.The government ordered a three-week nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 from March 25 and further extended it till May 3. “The lockdown will be eased next week for certain safe areas and economic activities would be conducted there strictly as per the MHA (ministry of home affairs) guidelines,” one person said. According to the person, the government is working on relaxing regulatory norms, removing bureaucratic hurdles and providing fiscal incentives to both domestic and foreign investors. This matter was also deliberated in the meeting, he said.“It was discussed that a scheme should be developed to promote more plug and play infrastructure in the existing industrial lands/plots/estates in the country and provide necessary financing support,” the PMO statement said.During the meeting, the PM directed that the action should be taken for a more proactive approach to handhold the investors, to look into their problems and help them in getting all the necessary central and state clearances in a time bound manner, it said.Various strategies to bring investments into India in a fast-track mode and to promote Indian domestic sectors were discussed. Detailed discussions were held on guiding states to evolve their strategies and be more proactive in attracting investments, it added.It was also discussed that the reform initiatives undertaken by the various ministries should “continue unabated” and action should be taken in a time bound manner to remove any obstacles which impede promotion of investment and industrial growth, it said.N Venkatram, CEO at consultancy firm Deloitte, said, “Swadeshi 2.0 is about manufacturing from India. This will happen if our own industrialists have the ability to invest in India in turn encouraging foreign investment as well as manufacturing by foreign companies in India. We also need to look at changes needed in regulation and get the Industrialist mindset back. We need to build our economy to its export potential based on our competitive advantages and generate employment.” Mithun V, partner-M&A, Private Equity and General Corporate at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co said the move is “reassuring” for the global and local investor community. “This is also a very good time for the government to focus on encouraging infrastructure and manufacturing sector investments, especially given the ongoing global backlash against our land border sharing neighbour,” he said.The industry called it an apt policy at the right time and said India should strategically target each of the companies which is relocating from China.Confederation of Indian Industry director general Chandrajit Banerjee said, “We suggest that these [investment zones] should be large zones with a special purpose vehicle to provide approvals and clearances, along with world-class urban infrastructure such as roads, worker housing and facilities, sewerage and low-cost power. Land and labour regulations can also be specifically instituted for these zones to ensure large scale employment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-meets-ministers-to-discuss-investment-booster-for-economy-expected/story-oxYCfIvdandaJFiaCDDU9K.html

The issue was discussed at a meeting held by chief secretary Somesh Kumar late on Wednesday, following the Central government’s order allowing return of people stranded in different parts of the country. The Telangana government nominated senior IAS officer Sandeep Kumar Sultania as nodal authority to oversee transportation of stranded migrant labourers and others to their native places, as per the protocol suggested by the Centre. He will be assisted by a team of officers.According to an official release, the chief secretary said a letter would be written to his counterparts in all the states to provide details of persons from their respective states who are stranded in Telangana. These states should make their own arrangements for the shifting of stranded passengers to their destinations.Somesh Kumar asked the stranded persons who wish to go home to get in touch with their native state for transport arrangement. “The government of Telangana will permit stranded persons to move to their native states,” he said.He requested the chief secretaries of the other states to advise their nodal authorities to get in touch with Telangana nodal authority for facilitation of shifting of the stranded people. “Our nodal authority will arrange for screening of the persons and issuance of passes to the asymptomatic persons for undertaking the journey,” he said.Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh, has also begun a similar exercise to see the safe return of stranded people to their respective states.State chief secretary Neelam Sawhney, who took part in the video conference with cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba in the morning, discussed the issue with her senior officials and instructed that necessary measures be taken for bringing the Telugu workers stranded in other states back to the state.State chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who constituted a Group of Ministers to oversee the Covid-19 situation in the state and take appropriate measures, asked them to ensure that necessary measures are taken for sending the stranded people to their destinations.At the same time, the government would also take all measures for the safe return of migrant labourers and construction workers from Andhra Pradesh stranded in various states to their respective districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-your-arrangements-telangana-to-states-ready-to-bring-people-home/story-GCfJvBsIUV1iq3pFGoTsHI.html
30-04-2020||India||India says social media posts in West Asian states are ‘propaganda’||India on Thursday described a flurry of social media posts in West Asia on the treatment of Muslims in the country as “propaganda” and said countries in that region were keen to work with New Delhi for economic recovery after the Covid-19 crisis.Over the past few weeks, several commentators from West Asia and a member of the royal family of the United Arab Emirates have called out what they said were Islamophobic social media posts by a handful of Indians working in the Middle East. They have also criticised what they said was the targeting of Muslims in India.As the issue gained prominence, external affairs minister S Jaishankar reached out to many of his counterparts in the West Asian countries, especially members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), to address the matter and also to discuss the welfare of some eight million expatriates in the region.Responding to a string of questions on the issue during an online news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava described much of the material on social media platforms as “propaganda by interested parties”.“Stray tweets cannot be used to characterise our bilateral relations with these countries, and the real picture of these relations is very different. The prime minister and external affairs minister have been in regular touch with their counterparts from the region, and spoken to them over the past few days,” he said.The West Asian states, he said, also want a “priority discussion with India on the post-Covid-19 economic recovery”.Srivastava added: “So what comes out clearly in these discussions is that these countries are deeply committed to friendly relations with India. They also don’t support any interference in the internal affairs of India. It is, therefore, important that the friendly and cooperative nature of our relations is accurately recognised and the misuse of social media is not given credence.”The West Asian states have also made requests for India to send medicines and medical teams. “There’s a request to send doctors and nurses from India,” Srivastava said, adding that so far, a medical rapid response team had been deployed in Kuwait for a fortnight.India has also made special efforts to ensure uninterrupted supply of food and essential commodities required by these countries during the holy month of Ramzan.Responding to a report that Oman, which is home to 770,000 Indians, has launched a drive to replace expatriates working in the government sector, Srivastava said this was a decades-old policy that isn’t “specific to India and doesn’t target Indians in any way”.Countries such as Oman “greatly value relations with India and also value the large and important role that our diaspora has played in contributing to the economic prosperity of that region”, he said. Oman has also been taking special care of Indians amid the Covid-19 crisis by providing them free testing and treatment, he added.Oman’s finance ministry recently issued a circular calling for the expatriates employed in the government sector to be replaced by Omanis, with proposals in this regard to be submitted by July. The circular also said the replacement of expatriates should be done in a speedy manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-says-social-media-posts-in-west-asian-states-are-propaganda/story-Gk9IQgPsvbqEUaGG32sM1K.html
30-04-2020||India||In Karnataka, industries outside containment zones to start from May 4: Yediyurappa||Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa has said all industries outside containment zones will be allowed to operate from May 4. Stating that Covid-19 cases might continue for another 2-3 months, he said that efforts to control the spread of the disease would go hand in hand with economic activity which has come to a stop due to the current lockdown.On allowing economic activities in Bangalore which continues to be a red zone district with nearly 24 containment zones, the CM struck a more cautious note saying that while cases have been coming down for the last 2-3 days, they will wait for a few more days to take a final decision in this regard. Bangalore is the economic engine for the state bringing in nearly half of the state’s revenues and taxes.He also said that at present there were no plans to allow malls, hotels or movie theatres to start functioning, but hinted that the state government would await the Centre’s directives in this regard before taking a final decision.Later in the day, CM Yediyurappa met with members of various associations of commerce and industries and asked them to be ready to resume operations. The CM also appealed to the industrialists to pay wages and salaries to employees.The Karnataka cabinet which met earlier also decided to give a one-time permit to inter-state and inter-district travel for those who are stranded including migrants and labourers.However, law minister J C Madhuswamy clarified that the cost of travel would be borne by those who want to travel and the government would merely provide permits and bus services. It also said hair salons, liquor outlets and restaurants would continue to be closed for now.On Wednesday, minister for primary and secondary education Suresh Kumar had said that the government would bring back stranded Kannadigas from Gujarat and buses would be sent for this purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-karnataka-industries-outside-containment-zones-to-start-from-may-4-yediyurappa/story-WIDKfkaBwytxaKSgDlt2pL.html
30-04-2020||India||Sikkim: India’s only Covid-free state gets its first testing lab||Sikkim, India’s only Covid-free state, has come up with its first laboratory to test swab samples of Covid-19 patients, top officials of the tiny Himalayan state said on Thursday.Till date the state had to send swab samples to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH) in Darjeeling district of West Bengal, around 100 km away, under tight security. Around 200 samples have been tested at NBMCH so far.“Four Truenat beta-CoV test machines have been installed in state-run STNM hospital in Gangtok. Earlier it took us at least two days to get the test result as they had to be sent to NBMCH in Siliguri. Now we will get the results in one hour,” said Mani Kumar Sharma, health minister of Sikkim.Truenat beta-CoV test is a screening test. If tested positive, a person has to undergo an RT-PCR test for confirmation of Covid-19. Sikkim, with a population of 6.19 lakh, shares international borders with China, Nepal and Bhutan. While the state was amongst the first to close the international borders and ban the entry of foreign and domestic tourists, it also took early decision to close two of the four border check posts with West Bengal.“So far not a single person has tested positive for Covid 19 in the state,” said a top health official of the state.Adjoining Kalimpong district in West Bengal has witnessed the death of a 44-year-old woman from Covid-19 on March 30 at NBMCH. In all, 11 members of her family in Kalimpong and Siliguri also tested positive. They have all been treated and discharged.“Along with the four Truenat machines, the state has also received 1,440 testing kits.

On Wednesday, the Union home ministry had suggested that states arrange buses to ferry home workers who have been stranded in the lockdown.“In the prevailing situation, bus journeys are not safe. And there is a limit to keep social distancing in buses. So we want the railways to run non-stop trains for them. The state chief secretary has written to the cabinet secretary in this regard and we are waiting for an early reply,” Vijayan said. Follow coronavirus latest updates here.There have been reports that in some areas migrant workers are getting restless.In Malappuram the police launched a mild baton charge to control about 100 workers who took out a procession seeking immediate travel arrangements for them. The CM said some forces are deliberately provoking them.The government calls the migrants “guest workers” and has introduced many welfare schemes including insurance for them. Most of them work in the construction sector, hotels and small-scale units. Though the government is taking care of the food, lodging and necessities like phone recharge coupons the migrants say calls from their kin make them worried.Kerala reported two fresh cases off Covid-19  on Thursday taking the total to 497 out of which 384 have been discharged leaving 113 in hospitals, the CM said. He said at least 70 areas are in hotspots and there is no plan to ease restrictions in those places.

Will you?” The call has evoked good response.Wearing new clothes on Eid-ul-Fitr, which is likely to fall on May 24 this year, is an age-old tradition for the Muslims. However, it is still not clear whether the lockdown will be lifted by then, allowing the garments shops and showrooms to be thrown open to the public.In an open appeal to fellow Muslims of Hyderabad through WhatsApp, Nawab Najaf Ali Khan, descendent of last Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan, asked not to buy clothes for Eid, even if the lockdown is lifted.“Let us pledge to exclude our materialism and gloating and be mindful of the underprivileged around us. Let’s say no to excessive and unnecessary shopping for Eid. Keeping in mind the current situation due to the ongoing lockdown for Covid-19, most of us are at home, but the poor and needy are left to fend for themselves without a job as everything is shut down,” he said.Stating that it was disheartening to see so many people face difficulties in fulfilling their daily needs, Khan asked the Muslims to donate as much as they could towards the daily expenses of the poor. “The money that we spend on our extravagance, can be used to help a family survive and live without this fearful uncertainty,” the Nizam’s descendant said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesMuslims are also being advised against extravagance and in favour of saving for the future. “Please save the money and realise that in future, we may need money for medicines, food and education,” one of the messages said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19During Ramzan, the Muslims practice the tradition of Zakat Al-Fitr. While Zakat involves parting with 2.5 per cent of money saved in a year to help the poor and the needy, Fitr involves the distribution of around 2.5 kgs of staple food to the poor to help them celebrate Eid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/several-hyderabad-muslims-back-no-new-clothes-in-eid-call-in-solidarity-with-the-poor/story-qIyyWCrMhasC5AjKdjAX6M.html

Burathi who works as a navigation officer at a shipping company in Tehran, had been sanctioned two months’ leave by his company but the flight on February 28 was cancelled due to Covid-19 restrictions.“I have been quarantined a fourth time in Champawat. It took me around two months to travel 3,551 km from Tehran to Champawat. When I reached Tehran airport on February 28, I was informed that flight for Delhi has been cancelled due to Covid-19 outbreak and countries restricting the movement of people across borders. I was told there was no certainty when the next flight will leave for India,” said Praveen Burathi.Burathi said he then contacted the Indian embassy in Tehran. “There I was advised by officials that I would be quarantined in a hotel till the next flight is available. I remained in quarantine there till March 14 and my sample was taken by Iranian officials, which tested negative on March 16.”“Finally I boarded the Air India flight for Delhi with 195 other Indians on March 18 from Tehran. After we reached Delhi we were taken to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan through two domestic flights and quarantined there for 14 days,” Burathi said.Burathi said after completion of the quarantine period, their samples were taken again for Covid-19 testing on March 31. “The report was received on April 5, which showed two people had tested positive for Covid-19. So the rest of us were quarantined again for 14 days at the same centre. We completed the second quarantine period on April 19, when samples were again sent for the testing”, he said.“When the test reports came negative on April 23, then we were permitted to go home. But it took me three more days in obtaining a pass from the authorities in Jaisalmer. During this, we were allowed to stay at the centre. After obtaining a pass, I hired a taxi for Rs 30,000 and left for Champawat,” said Burathi.Burathi reached Champawat on Tuesday and went straight to the local police station to inform them about his arrival. Given his travel history, he was quarantined again in a local hotel for 14 days.“If I had gone directly to my village, the police would have taken action against me for hiding my arrival or villagers might have informed the police. So I thought it is better to approach the police before going to my village,” Burathi said.“I want to go home so badly. I am eagerly waiting for this quarantine to end so that I can be with my family. It has been the longest and most tiresome journey of my life,” he saidChief medical officer Champawat district Dr RP Khanduri said, “The man who came from Iran has been kept under institutional quarantine at a hotel in Champawat for 14 days”.“Though we are quarantining people who come from outside the state, given this man’s travel history we are extra cautious. After he completes his quarantine period, his samples will be sent for testing. If they come negative, he will be sent home and advised to stay at home,” she said.In Uttarakhand, where 57 people have tested positive for COVID-19 so far, 11,120 people have been home quarantined and 2,218 have been quarantined in various institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-days-and-counting-uttarakhand-man-flying-from-tehran-in-4th-quarantine/story-snCE4A2c2KwpHOoTcGzpFJ.html

30-04-2020||India||SC notice to Centre in plea to regulate Covid-19 treatment costs||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday sought the response of the central government in a plea to regulate the cost of treatment for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients at private hospitals across the country.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, issued notice to the central government in the petition filed by a lawyer, Sachin Jain, who claimed that private hospitals are exploiting Covid-19 patients by charging exorbitant amounts for their treatment and were making a fortune out of their miseries amid the nationwide healthcare emergency.“The state should combat the commercial exploitation by private hospitals and bring in necessary regulations on the tariff structure for regulating private hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients,” the petition prayed.Jain, in his petition, referred to a news report published on April 3, which had stated that insurance companies revealed that private hospitals were saddling customers with inflated bills that were, in turn, passed on to the insurance firms.“A reputed insurance company confirmed that it had, till April 2, settled 41 insurance claims of Covid-19 and the maximum amounted to Rs 6.5 lakh. Another well-known insurance company has stated that it has been receiving an average claim size of Rs 5-6 lakh for treatment of Covid-19 patients at private hospitals,” the petition stated.The size of the claims, the petitioner submitted, was a matter of grave concern and the insurance companies had stated that the bills were highly inflated and unreasonable.One such incident cited by an insurance firm was where a private hospital used personal protective equipment (PPE) units such as 300 gloves and one coverall suit on a Covid-19 patient in a single day.The insurance companies have even started rejecting claims of Covid-19 patients by up to 50% of the amount, the petitioner submitted. “If such inflated bills can become a cause of concern for the insurance industry, what will be the plight of the common man, who neither has a fat wallet nor an insurance coverage plan?” the petition said.Jain also sought a direction from the apex court to be issued to these private hospitals, who are functioning on public land, to treat Covid-19 patients pro bono or on a no-profit basis.Jain prayed that the central government should bear the expenses incurred at private hospitals by poor and vulnerable people, who don’t have any insurance coverage plan.“Medical treatment owes a constitutional duty to treat the have-nots and a person cannot be refused treatment merely on the ground that he is not in a position to afford the fee payable for such expensive treatment,” the petition added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-centre-in-plea-to-regulate-covid-19-treatment-costs/story-MeTEGONQbVyw2mSWFUr4JL.html

The 53-year-old male patient was in critical condition and had been under ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU).The patient was brought to the hospital on April 20 after his swab test report returned positive for coronavirus infection on April 19. But due to the delay in the detection of the virus, he had already developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was immediately put on ventilation in the ICU. According to the doctors from the hospital, despite having symptoms like sore throat, dry cough and fever, he delayed his treatment thinking he couldn’t have contracted the disease since he didn’t have any travel history and was also not a high-risk close contact of any Covid-19 positive patient.“When the patient was brought to the hospital, his condition was already extremely critical. He had severe breathing problems due to the delay in treatment. He had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia,” said Dr V Ravishankar, CEO of Lilavati Hospital. On April 25, the hospital performed the first convalescent plasma therapy on the patient after procuring approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The therapy involves transfusing plasma – a component of the blood – from a recovered patient into a patient fighting the infection, to act as reinforcement for the latter’s immune system.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesHe became the first novel coronavirus patient in the state to undergo the clinical trial for plasma therapy. On the first day, a 200ml of plasma was transfused. Though he was critical, it helped improve the oxygen intake in his body. However, from the early morning of April 27, his condition started deteriorating. He developed infections and was kept on a high dosage of antibiotics.“We had to postpone the next two doses due to his deteriorating health condition. Sadly, he succumbed to the infection on Wednesday night,” said Dr Ravishankar.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19On Tuesday, the health ministry had categorically said that the plasma therapy was in the trials stage and not an approved treatment for coronavirus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-covid-19-patient-to-receive-plasma-therapy-in-maharashtra-dies/story-Gxa8zmEzbF8UEKsKlQ19KN.html
30-04-2020||India||Govt to draft guidelines for PMAY post-lockdown||The Centre will draft special guidelines for key infrastructure projects, including the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (urban) while anticipating a higher demand in the housing and construction sector, after the nationwide lockdown restrictions, which have been imposed from March 25 till May 3 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, are lifted, according to officials aware of the development. Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Puri chaired a review meeting of key projects, including the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (urban) and the Swachh Bharat Mission (urban), on Tuesday. The ministry is looking at a higher demand in the realty sector after the lockdown is lifted and accordingly drafting standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the resumption of construction activities.“The government is expecting the demand in housing to go up after the lockdown is lifted and we’ve to be prepared accordingly. Our target is to sanction 1.12 crore houses. The Centre’s priority will be to provide housing for the poor,” a ministry official said, requesting anonymity.According to the ministry’s data, 1.04 crore houses have been sanctioned so far under the scheme, out of which construction work has started in 64 lakh and completed in another 33.5 lakh. The Centre has a target to sanction1.12 crore houses and to deliver them to the intended beneficiaries by 2022.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also chaired a meeting on Thursday to discuss schemes to be developed to promote more plug-and-play infrastructure in the existing industrial lands, plots, and estates across the country and provide necessary financing support.“The PM directed that the action should be taken for a more proactive approach to handhold the investors, to look into their problems and help them in getting all the necessary Central and state clearances in a timebound manner,” the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement. The Centre will soon also issue an advisory to state governments and Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, (RERA) authorities on the measures required to protect the interest of homebuyers as well as the depressed real estate sector.An urgent meeting of Central Advisory Council (CAC), constituted under the provisions of RERA, was held Wednesday to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the real estate sector and to treat it as an event of ‘force majeure’ under its provisions. Puri and Niti Aayog chairman Amitabh Kant also attended the meeting. The concerns of the real estate sector, particularly the impact of Covid-19 and consequent nationwide lockdown restrictions, were deliberated in the meeting. “There was a demand for providing special relief to the real estate sector in a bid to help it cope with the adverse impact of the current crisis. Covid-19 has already disrupted construction activities due to reverse migration of labour at a large-scale and the disruption of the supply chain of various construction materials,” the ministry said in a statement. Puri said the Centre would issue an advisory to the RERA authorities and states about the special measures that need to be taken to safeguard the interest of homebuyers and all other real estate industry stakeholders.Maneesh Upadhyaya, chief business officer, 99acres.com, a real estate database website, put the industry’s expectations in perspective. “We expect homebuyers to return to the market gradually after the easing of social distancing norms, as real estate prices are likely to come down. The government’s pro-realty measures, including a voluntary three-month moratorium on the payment of home loans and .75 percentage-point cut in interest in borrowing rates, have calmed the homebuyers’ nerves, but we’re looking for more institutional support,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-draft-guidelines-for-pmay-post-lockdown/story-4UHgdLlDO6ETI6rxn7yOFJ.html

It is not possible now to restart inter-state bus, train or air services. Lockdown is the only way and people need to accept this as part of their lives,” he told reporters at the Civil Secretariat late on Wednesday evening.“The lockdown will continue in some form or other till a vaccine for the coronavirus is developed,” he said without specifying whether he was referring to restrictions across the country or in Tripura. Deb made the remarks after holding a meeting of all political parties at the Civil Secretariat. Representatives of 18 parties, including the CPI-M, Congress, INPT, BJP and its alliance partner IPFT, joined the meeting. Speaking about initiatives to tackle the economic crisis after the lockdown, Deb said the primary sectors, such as agriculture, horticulture, dairy and poultry farms, are the mainstay of the state’s economy and work has already started in these fields. Besides, 50 of the state’s 75 industrial units have resumed functioning. “Though Tripura is a small state, our government has adopted initiatives to revive the economy after the lockdown. We have started to work in the primary sectors and 50 industrial units have already started functioning,” he said.“We have helped all the poor people in terms of cash benefits and supplies of rations during the lockdown. They have received different amounts, ranging between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 in their bank accounts and free rations,” said Deb. During the meeting, the CPI-M demanded the state government should provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to people engaged in cleaning and sanitation tasks, and food items such as potatoes, pulses and onions to poor families for three months.

Under its influence, there will be squally winds and heavy rainfall over south Andaman Sea, southeast Bay of Bengal and Andaman and Nicobar Islands over the next five days.“The low pressure area is likely to develop in the next 24 hours and a depression is likely to form in the subsequent 24 hours. We have forecast that the depression is likely to intensify further. If it develops in to a cyclonic storm, it will be called Amphan,” said M Mohapatra, director general of IMD. Fishermen are advised not to venture into the sea along and off north Sumatra coast, south Andaman Sea and adjoining areas of southeast Bay of Bengal from May 1 to May 3. The depression or cyclone is likely to move north-northwestwards during the first three days and north-northeastwards towards Myanmar coast thereafter.“The ocean parameters continue to be favourable for its strengthening while over the east-central Bay and neighbourhood. However, there is no consensus amongst the weather model over the timelines, area, and level of intensification,” Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said on its website on Thursday.A fresh and intense western disturbance is likely to cause widespread rain and thundershowers over the western Himalayan region, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan during May 3-6. There will be thunderstorms, hailstorms, lightning, gusty winds (30-40 kmph) over north western India during the period, according to IMD.A western disturbance, the seventh in April, was affecting the north-western region on Thursday. “We have already started recording rain in many parts around Ghaziabad. There can be some thunderstorms and hailstorms too on Thursday and Friday. But the next WD will be intense because an area of low pressure will form, and on the night of May 3, a cyclonic circulation is likely to develop over west Rajasthan; there will be moisture incursion from Arabian Sea. The WD will bring rains, thunderstorms, squally winds of 40 to 50 kmph speed over the entire northwestern region 3 to 4 days.

30-04-2020||India||How good fortune and planning have helped Chennai avert water crisis this year||Amidst the dark Covid-19 clouds, there may be a silver lining for the 10.5 million citizens of Chennai. The unprecedented water crisis that crippled Chennai last summer is unlikely to revisit the city in 2020. Thanks to a combination of good fortune and planning, the four lakes that feed the city are nearly 14 times fuller than last year. The average ground water level at 5.3 metres is 1. 5m higher than it was in March 2019. “We are nowhere near the crisis we faced last year. The inflow into the lakes has been excellent and we’ve managed to significantly reduce the supply of freshwater to the industrial clusters by providing them recycled water,” said T Prabhushankar, executive director, Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB). The crisis of 2019 was yet another reminder for Chennai that efficient use and prudent management of water resources were as important as big-ticket investments in desalination plants. The city already has two desalination plants with capacity of 210 million litres a day that service the northern suburbs. A third 150 million litre plant costing nearly Rs 1300 crore would be ready next year.The city also took a raft of administrative measures. Two new tertiary treatment and reverse osmosis (TTRO) plants that recycle sewage into 90 million litres of potable water became operational by October 2019. The CMWSSB has now completely stopped supplying freshwater to the two big industrial clusters on the northern and western fringes of Chennai. Their requirements are met by the two recycling plants built at a cost of Rs 630 crore. The capacity of the plants would soon go up to 120 million litres a day. This has freed up domestic drinking water supplies and reduced the reliance on the already stressed ground water resources.According to CMWSSB, higher domestic consumption given the emphasis on frequent hand-washing and personal hygiene due to the lockdown may have evened out the lack of commercial demand for water. Commercial establishments account for close to 40-50 million litres of water a day. Even during the lockdown, the water utility has maintained the usual daily supply of 650 million litres. However, Prabhushankar said that given the storage levels, a further increase in demand could also be comfortably met.In 2019, the four reservoirs around Chennai — Poondi, Red Hills, Chembarambakkam and Cholavaram— with a combined capacity of 11.3 billion cubic feet (BCft) had dried up by May leading to one of the worst water crises faced by the city. CMWSSB could barely supply half the city’s daily demand of 1 billion litres. The deep groundwater aquifers too dried up in the face of excessive extraction of water. Hotels, factories and large IT parks had to shut down for several days.Although Chennai had made rainwater harvesting (RWH) mandatory in 2003 to get construction approvals and water connection, poor upkeep by citizens had rendered these structures non-functional. “Over the last nine months in collaboration with Greater Chennai Corporation we have inspected nearly 15 lakh households. We ordered nearly 500,000 households install new RWH systems. As a result, the ground waters levels we measure through 145 observation wells in the city have risen significantly,” said Prabhushankar. According to CMWSSB nearly 370 large community wells that had become defunct have been recharged as part of the groundwater renewal drive. But experts said that these efforts may be inadequate. “The audit of RWH systems is not as easy as the government thinks. A lot of factors such as soil quality have to be accounted for. Those who carried out the surveys were simply not trained to do it. It was an exercise to divert public attention in the midst of a crisis. The public too continues to think of RWH as a tamasha ,” says Sekar Raghavan, a scientist known as Chennai’s ‘rain man’ who through his NGO Rain Centre has been a RWH evangelist for nearly three decades. He has been campaigning for an audit of Chennai’s RWH readiness by independent, specialist agencies. By Raghavan’s estimates, only 40 per cent of Chennai’s buildings have RWH systems that actually work.The efforts of Chennai’s civic agencies notwithstanding, it is nature that has offered the biggest relief. The monsoon was only moderate in 2019. But the inter-river basin transfer of water to Chennai has ensured the city won’t go dry this year. Under the Telugu Ganga project initiated in the 1980s, Chennai’s four lifeline lakes are also fed by the waters of Krishna. The city also gets supplies from Veeranam, a giant lake 235 km to the south in Cuddalore district that depends on discharge from the Mettur dam on Cauvery river. Both Cauvery and Krishna river basins received such massive amounts of rain that storage levels in all dams on their course continue to remain healthy. Chennai’s lakes too, brimmed up with nearly 8 BCFt of Krishna water, the highest inflow in 25 years. Without the supply from the Krishna basin, Chennai’s lakes would have only had 1.4 BCFt of water even with normal rainfall. The combined storage of the reservoirs on April 24 was close to 6 BCFt compared to 415 MCFt at the same time last year.“Thankfully, we don’t have to tackle two disasters at once this year. We can fully focus on dealing with Covid-19 instead of worrying about water supply,” said Prabhushankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-good-fortune-and-planning-have-helped-chennai-avert-water-crisis-this-year/story-MStSLbmioc9GHynuRnkT2I.html

30-04-2020||India||Amid Covid-19 lockdown, poaching spikes in western Rajasthan||Poaching of wildlife has increased in western Rajasthan during the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus, forest department officials said Thursday.Among the wildlife targeted by poachers is Rajasthan’s state animal chinkara. The wildlife flying squad of the Rajasthan forest department has registered six cases of illegal hunting in Jodhpur district in the last one month and arrested six poachers. The chinkara is a protected animal under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. “Hunting incidents have increased in a month. We were informed of six cases and the accused have been arrested,” said Ashok Panwar, flying squad range officer. Experts say that due to the lockdown, wildlife in desert areas are moving closer to human habitations due to which there have been more cases of hunting and poaching.Another forest official who did not want to be named said the police were not able to prevent much of the poaching during the lockdown. Action is being taken only in those cases in which villagers give information. Some cases have also been registered by the territorial wing of the Forest Department and the police, he said.He said that many people in rural areas rendered unemployed by the lockdown are also hunting wildlife, including chinkara, blackbuck and sandgrouse.The forest department had registered 15 cases of chinkara poaching in the district of Jodhpur during the year 2019-20 till February. In the last one month the situation has become worrisome.Dr Hemsingh Gehlot, Assistant Professor in the Zoology department at Jodhpur’s Jai Naraian Vyas University, said hunting cases have increased due to food scarcity. He also said some particular communities in the rural areas are involved in the poaching.In the last one month, there have been four instances of poaching where chinkaras have been killed, one case of rabbits being poached and one in which sandgrouse were hunted, forest department officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-lockdown-poaching-spikes-in-western-rajasthan/story-WgUwwfLgceu7lOggvEX5mK.html
30-04-2020||India||No stay by Supreme Court on Central Vista redevelopment project for now||The Supreme Court on Thursday declined stay on the redevelopment of Delhi’s Central Vista for the time being, stating that there is no pressing urgency to grant any interim relief as the country is in a state of lockdown.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde was hearing a petition filed by Rajeev Suri challenging a notification issued by the central government on March 20 proposing changes in land use for the proposed redevelopment project.“During COVID-19 nobody is going to do anything. There is no urgency...”, CJI Bobde remarked when the case came up for hearing on Thursday.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, the central government second senior-most law officer, defended the redevelopment project.“Parliament is being constructed. Why is there a problem?”, he submitted.The Central Vista houses iconic buildings like the Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhavan, the North and South Block buildings, which house important ministries, and the India Gate. The union government is proposing to redevelop the Central Vista by constructing a new Parliament house, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice President, besides several new office buildings.The bench, which also comprised justice Aniruddha Bose, noted that another petition on the same issue which the same petitioner had filed is pending before the Supreme Court. That petition, which was initially filed before the Delhi high court, had been transferred to the Supreme Court by way of an order passed by the top court on March 6.The court, therefore, disposed of the fresh petition filed by Suri while granting him the liberty to amend the pending petition which had been transferred from the high court to the apex court.“Mr. Shikhil Suri, counsel appearing for the petitioner prays for withdrawal of this petition with liberty to amend the writ petition which has been transferred to this court from the high court. Prayer is allowed”, the court ordered.“The Supreme Court has granted liberty to amend the writ petition challenging the Central Vista project which is pending in the Supreme Court. In the order today, there is no rejection of prayer. In this pending petition, the Supreme Court has already passed an order that the proposal of the government in regard to the Central Vista will be subject to the outcome of the pending writ petition. The Solicitor General had also accepted the notice and sought time to file a counter affidavit which it has not done so far. There is no refusal on stay,” petitioner Rajeev Suri said.Suri, along with another petitioner Lt Colonel Anuj Srivastava, had first moved the Delhi high court in February challenging a notification issued by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on December 21 last year regarding changes in land use for the redevelopment.Suri had challenged the alterations envisaged by the central government on the ground that it involves changes to land use and standards of population density and that the DDA is not vested with the requisite power to bring about such changes. He submitted that the power, if at all, for bringing about such changes lies with the central government.Srivastava, meanwhile, challenged the public hearings held to raise objections to the exercise, arguing that the hearings were a mere formality devoid of any meaningful exercise.A single-judge bench of justice Rajiv Shakdher had, on February 11, granted them interim relief ordering that the DDA should approach the high court before notifying any of the proposed changes in the land use.“In case a decision is taken to notify the proposed changes in Master Plan Delhi 2020-21, the DDA will approach the court before notifying such decision,” Justice Shakdher had ordered while issuing notice to the centre and DDA in both the petitions.However, a Division bench of the Delhi high court comprising Chief Justice DN Patel and justice C Hari Shankar stayed the order of the single judge on February 28.Suri then approached the Supreme Court challenging the denial of interim relief by the high court.The Supreme Court, however, transferred the entire case to itself on March 6.“…in larger public interest, we deem it appropriate that the entire matter pertaining to challenge pending before the high court is heard and decided by this court expeditiously,” the top court ordered.The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, subsequently notified change in land use on March 20 which Suri challenged in his fresh plea before the Supreme Court claiming violation of right to life under Article 21.“Central government brashly issued notification dated March 20, 2020, changing land use, (which) will deprive residents of Delhi and citizens of India a vast chunk of highly treasured open space in the Central Vista area, available for public, semi-public, social and recreational activity, (and) stands against Article 21, right to life and the right to enjoyment of a wholesome life”, the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-stay-by-supreme-court-on-central-vista-redevelopment-project-for-now/story-eGLnq100r6z8wOfK63ebTO.html

The dashboard allows a birds’ eye view of the city’s coroanvirus status and is also aimed to help in formulating a containment response depending upon the changing dynamics that can all be ascertained at one place. The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs says, it showcases use of technology in a smart city for data collection, Covid-19 monitoring and containment efforts. One look at the dashboard helps identify zones with the most number of infections and other tools like heat mapping, cluster and point identification allow authorities to make assessments key to disease containment efforts. The dashboard lists all essential information including the total number of infected in the district on a given day, number of active cases, number of recovered patients and the total number of deaths, apart from providing a graph that provides a perspective on the rate of growth of the disease on a day to day basis. According to the dashboard, Agra has 401positive cases on Thursday including 318 active cases, 71 recovered cases and 12 deaths.The dashboard also lists all areas with positive cases and the number of patients in each area. It also collates other important information needed by the residents and the authorities, including total number of beds available in the district, community kitchens in operation, guidelines for quarantine facilities, resource material for dedicated Covid hospitals, apart from important government advisories and releases. The technology used for the development of the dashboard can be useful for creating solutions for several sectors like agriculture, defence forestry, disaster management etc to name a few, says the ministry of housing and urban affairs in the union government.For Coronavirus Live Updates“This dashboard is developed on IGiS platform an indigenous technology which brings GIS, Image Processing, Photogrammetry, and CAD together on a single platform which can also cater to a multitude of solutions across industries like Agriculture, Defence, Forestry, Disaster Management, Land Information, Mining, Power, Smart City, Urban Planning, Utilities and Location-Based Service,” said a government release.

30-04-2020||India||Covid-19 patients’ recovery rate climbs to 25.19% from 13% a fortnight ago||India’s recovery rate of Covid-19 positive patients has steadily climbed to 25.19%, up from 13% which was the recovery rate of infected patients about fourteen days ago, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said on Thursday. “A progressive trend in Covid-19 patients’ recovery rate has been noticed in the last few days. The number of recoveries in the last 24 hours stood at 630, taking the total number of people who have recovered to 8,324. The total recovery rate is at 25.19%. So the recovery rate of the country has increased from 13% fourteen days ago to over 25% currently,” Lav Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry said at the daily news briefing.The current case fatality rate is 3.2% for Covid-19 in India, with 65 per cent being men and 35 per cent women, the health ministry data revealed.ALSO READ | Over 1,700 Covid-19 cases in 24 hours take India’s tally to 33,050“As far as testing and treatment protocol is concerned we have to use RT PCR test only, according to government guidelines,” Aggarwal said.Barely a day earlier, on Wednesday, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had indicated that the country’s doubling rate of Covid-19 positive cases is now 11.3 days since the last three days, and the country’s mortality rate due to the highly infectious disease is around 3 per cent.Although the global mortality rate of coronavirus patients is around 7 per cent, India’s mortality rate of 3 per cent extends hope for all those afflicted by the disease.About 86 per cent of those Covid-19 patients who have succumbed to the deadly disease so far also had co-morbid conditions like acute diabetes and hypertension, the minister, who is a doctor himself had said.In the last 24 hours, 1718 new coronavirus cases have been detected across the country taking the total number of positive cases to 33,050.The total number of active cases have climbed to 23,651.

He is just waiting for the promised bus to take him there. After a nearly 40-day ordeal of skimming for food, Sohail, a migrant worker, is tired and all his hopes are now depended on the bus the government has said will ferry him home from Surat in Gujarat where he has been stranded due to the lockdown. “I just want to go home now. We have been struggling here. There is hardly any food. I keep thinking if I should have tried to return earlier like the others. But I am no good to my family if dead. I just hope I can return to my son. I want to hug him,” Sohail, who stitched clothes at a factory before the lockdown told PTI on the phone. The Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday issued a fresh set of guidelines to let migrant workers, students, tourists and pilgrims stranded in different parts of the country to get back home.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe inter-state movement of these stranded people will be facilitated by the state/UT governments by road only, the order stated. Anyone willing to be transported back home will have to be medically screened at the source as well as destination and will be kept in a home or institutional quarantine on arrival, the home ministry guidelines said.Suman who works as a labourer in Nagpur, Maharashtra had decided to walk back to his home in Meghnagar, Madhya Pradesh but was restrained by fellow workers after they got to know that some like them had been detained by the police. “I was ready to walk it. I was tired of waiting for food and basic necessities. When we earned, whatever little we did, we lived on our own terms. Here, we have to beg for everything. Now, when the buses come, I want to be the first to get on it. While I have been here for seven months, never have I longed for home like this,” he said.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“This uncertainty of the lockdown has made me long for the safety of my house.The first thing I would do when I get home is eat food cooked by my mother,” the 22-year-old said.While the protocols for ferrying these migrants will be chalked out in the next couple of days, workers stranded in distant lands are restless and want to ensure that their names feature on the lists of those granted access to the buses. “I was told we need a pass for it. Where will I get the pass? Can you tell me please. I don’t want to miss this opportunity to go home,” said 34-year-old Ramnath, a labourer from Bihar’s Muzaffarpur who is stuck in Mangalore with 21 other migrant workers since the lockdown.Ramnath, who has two children back home, never again wants to come back if he gets work in his home state.The MHA in its order has stated that state governments need to coordinate with each other to facilitate the movement of the migrant workers. It is not clear how that will be achieved, but migrants from different parts of the country hope that their respective chief ministers won’t let them down. “We saw on TV that our CMs will help us get back. I hope they do something quickly. I am ready to go however they take me, on a bus, train or car. I just want to leave. There is no food and no money,” said 23-year old Avinash Kumar from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh who works as a labourer in Nagpur. Others like him -- Ramashankar and Guddu stuck in Surat, Urmila Devi from Lakhisarai stranded in Faridabad, Anita Devi in Gurgaon -- are all waiting for the buses to take them home to their loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-want-hug-my-son-migrant-workers-hope-cms-will-not-turn-them-down/story-C0GkEX9anwdlReUbgNIAAN.html
30-04-2020||India||What an Indian expert has to say about Remdesivir in Covid-19 treatment||The antiviral drug, Remdesivir, has emerged as the first successful treatment against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after a US government-funded trial on 1,063 people found it could effectively block the virus and boost recovery. “The data shows Remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” said US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director Dr Anthony Fauci, who likened the finding to the first retrovirals that worked with modest success against HIV in the 1980s.The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) is expected to announce an emergency-use authorization for use of Remdesivir to treat patients.Remdesivir is an experimental antiviral drug developed by the US-based pharma major Gilead Sciences. It failed in trials against the Ebola virus and was found to have limited effects among patients in Wuhan, China, where the illness was first detected last year.Dr Nirmal K Ganguly, emeritus scientist and former director general of Indian Council of Medical Research, has gone through the findings of the soon to be published NIAID trial. He spoke to Sanchita Sharma on what these findings mean for India.Remdesivir has failed several trials in the past. How effective is it against Covid-19?The world finally has a drug against Covid-19, but it will not be a public health tool as it has to be given intravenously to hospitalized patients to hasten recovery.The drug was originally created as a pan-viral drug to treat RNA viruses, Marburg and Ebola, but it was not successful. In later trials, it has also been investigated for action against all coronaviruses, including those that cause Sars [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome], Mers (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome), and now Covid-19 as well as it worked against animal coronaviruses. It was found to be clinically fulfilling Lipinski’s Rule [which give the probability of the success of a drug] and was found to work on viral replication in respiratory epithelial cells, which are the first target of infection. It does not promote mutation.The NIAID study has confirmed its effectiveness in hastening recovery, and Gilead now plans to expand trials to include 5,600 patients in seven countries. India does not figure in the list.However, it was not licensed in any country in the world. The USFDA has now recommended its use as an emergency drug. A small study done by Dr Aruna Subramanian, a clinical professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Stanford University School of Medicine in California, also found 50% patients given 5 mg of the drug improved in 10 days, and 60.6% were discharged in 14 days.If Remdesivir gets the USFDA nod, will India consider using it to treat Covid-19 patients?Results from the NIAID preliminary trial show Remdesivir reduced recovery time for Covid-19 patients from 15 to 11 days, which is similar to the effect that influenza drugs like Tamiflu, which don’t cure patients quickly, but help them recover.The NIAID trial used the drug for five days and 10 days in patients with pneumonia who needed oxygen, but did not need ventilator support at that given moment. The impact on death give a trend of 4% advantage, but this result was not statistically significant, the trend was visible.The first dose was 200 mg, followed 100 mg a day, give intravenously to hospitalised patients, with one group given the drug for five days and the other for 10 days. A significant number of patients given Remdesivir did not have to go on ventilator support, and at least 30% fewer patients needed ventilation. There was clear advantage of reduction in hospital stay, with patients given the drug being discharged in 10-14 days. Five days of therapy was as effective as 10 days, which is a critical advantage in terms of reducing hospital stay, cost of medication and risk of severe adverse events [side effects]. Should India consider using Remdesivir to treat patients?Gilead Sciences is reported to have drugs to treat 120,000 patients, and now plans to expand trials to many countries, excluding India. Available data shows it is one of the foremost potential drugs against the disease, and since the supply is limited, according to Gilead, India must plan to get access to Remdesivir.In this emergency situation, the USFDA has announced emergency use authorisation. India must consider ways to make this drug available to its population. In the past, India saved millions by providing affordable and effective anti-retroviral drugs to treat HIV and AIDS, not just to its own population, but also to other countries who needed them, including to many countries in Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-an-indian-expert-has-to-say-about-remdesivir-in-covid-19-treatment/story-s4ytM6dDUxguxmDmrm3fHJ.html

30-04-2020||India||‘No hospital can turn away any patient in Maharashtra’: Govt||After a number of complaints of hospitals denying admission to patients or delaying treatment, the Maharashtra government on Thursday issued an order that no hospital can turn away any patient without examination and required intervention under any circumstances. All private and government hospitals in the state have also been directed to check any patient who is entering hospital premises and after scanning may be shifted or admitted depending on the patient’s medical condition.To decongest hospitals, the government has also ordered shifting of all asymptomatic patients without co-morbid conditions to Covid Care Centres whereas private hospitals can send such patients for home quarantine but after proper counselling, states the order issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Thursday. The order will come in to force from May 2.The hospitals have been warned of action in case directives are not followed scrupulously.“Any patient entering hospital premises for any treatment of Covid-19 or non Covid-19 ailment should be immediately checked in to casualty or screening clinic. After triage the patient may be shifted or admitted. Depending upon the site condition, the staging area may be created for screening and triage of patients in isolation so that infections are not transmitted. No patient is to be turned away without examination and required intervention under any circumstances,” the order reads.The government has asked the directors of health services to prepare the standard operating procedure (SOP) for screening, transferring, admitting and discharging of patients. “Each patient needing hospital admission will be assigned a unique id by the round-the-clock onsite team of the disaster manage department (DMD) of the local body such as BMC, without which admission cannot be granted. DMD should use this as a more accurate and efficient bed management in all hospitals,” it further states.For this, the state government has given them two days of time and hence the provisions of the order will come in to force from May 2, said a senior official.“All the Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 hospitals are also directed to ensure that no admission is granted to asymptomatic positive patients without co-morbidity. Similar patients in private hospitals should be stamped and sent away for home quarantine after proper counselling, according to the Government of India guidelines,” it adds.The hospitals are also directed to collect swabs of all the suspected Covid-19 patients admitted on top priority and ensure that reports are collected within 12 hours and ensure that the patients are diagnosed as per clinical conditions and shifted to CCC, Dedicated Covid Health Centers (DCHC) for patients with mild symptoms and Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) for serious patients. In case of death of a Covid-19 positive patient, the hospital administrations are also directed to ensure that the body is shifted from the ward within 30 minutes and disposed off within 12 hours for which necessary processes have to be defined keeping in view the prevalent regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-hospital-can-turn-away-any-patient-in-maharashtra-govt/story-ik2goQEyLfAZRTVTeRBcOP.html
30-04-2020||India||Its back to study time for India’s first Covid-19 patient||Her days in the isolation ward no longer haunts India’s first Covid-19 patient in Kerala and the 20-year old medico who has fully recovered is now busy attending online classes from her university in Wuhan in China as she completed three months since being diagnosed with the disease.She is not unduly perturbed by the fact that Wuhan turned out to be the epicentre of the deadly virus, which went on to affect most parts of the world, and eagerly waiting to go back to the Chinese city and resume her course once normalcy returns.“I am attending online classes of our university since February. The classes are held everyday depending on the subjects. We were told the portions now being taken would be take once again after the regular classes start as practicals have to be held”, the student told PTI from her home town in Thrissur district.It was on January 30 that the third year medical student from Wuhan university tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the country’s first Covid-19 patient, days after she had returned home following semester holidays.After nearly three weeks of treatment at the Thrissur Medical College Hospital, she had tested negative twice for the virus, confirming her recovery, and was discharged on February 20.Soon, she started attending the online classes of her university in Wuhan, which has been attracting several students from Kerala in view of its comparatively lower fees and other facilities.The classes begin at 5.30 am (Chinese time 8 am) and go on till 9 am with a 10 minute break, the woman said.“The faculty in the university include those from China, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, but our faculty are mostly Chinese teachers and they take classes in English,” she said.Though the university has indicated that the classes would be conducted afresh once students return, no time-frame has yet been given.“It seems there are no patients in Wuhan now. That’s what we have been told”, she said adding the flight services have to commence first.Health officials in China on Sunday announced the last COVID-19 patient in Wuhan has been discharged and the hospitals in the epicentre of the global pandemic have no coronavirus cases for the first time after more than three months of arduous battle against the deadly virus that infected over 80,000 people on the mainland.The toll in Wuhan has recently been revised to 3,869.Asked how she was passing her free time since recovering from the disease, the Keralite said she was fond of cooking and been helping out her mother in preparing mouth-watering dishes.“I love cooking and in Wuhan hostel we have kitchen and I used to cook my meals. Now I assist my mother. We prepare samosas, cutlets and grilled chicken,” she said.The student was admitted to the district hospital on January 27 after she informed medical officials about symptoms like sore throat and dry cough.Asked if she was scared when she tested positive, the medico replied in the negative.“When my sample result came, many people world over had recovered. I was not scared and I did not have any health issues either,” she said.While returning from Wuhan, Indian embassy officials had told her and others to inform officials in Kerala that they were from China.“We were asked to approach health officials in case of any symptoms of the virus besides being strictly following the 28 day home quarantine as stipulated by the Kerala government,” she said.The health department officials were in constant touch with her on a daily basis enquiring about her health.“When I developed sore throat and dry cough, they were immediately informed and an ambulance was sent to pick me from my house”, the youngster said, recalling the turbulent times. All praise for the Kerala Health department for the care and treatment, she said “Our health care system is very good and I got excellent treatment leading to my recovery. I did not have fever at all during my hospitalisation.” Her classmate from Alappuzha and a senior from Kasaragod, who were the second and third positive cases in the country, have also recovered.The state, which saw arrival of several people from Covid-hit countries like Italy and Gulf region before the lockdown, reported more cases later, but did well to contain the spread with effective quarantine and treatment protocols, which have come in for praise.As of Wednesday, the number of Covid-19 cases in Kerala stood at 485 with 123 active patients.The Covid-19 first emerged in a food market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, and later became a pandemic, affecting most parts of the world, including India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-back-to-study-time-for-india-s-first-covid-19-patient/story-YkLsskMXvfbF4Z0vD4TfCO.html
30-04-2020||India||Borders sealed, stopping infiltration of Covid-19 carriers our aim now: BSF chief||India’s borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh haven’t witnessed any major illegal activities such as infiltration of terrorists, human trafficking, fake currency or drug smuggling for the past five weeks, according to the head of the BSF and ITBP.There were only a few negligible incidents as the frontiers are sealed, according to Surjeet Singh Deswal, who heads the world’s two largest border guarding forces – Border Security Force (BSF) and Indo-Tibet Border Force (ITBP).In an exclusive interaction with HT, the IPS officer of the 1984 batch said: “We have maintained high level of alertness at the borders, which are completely sealed with no movement of any kind.“Our priority during the lockdown has been to stop infiltration of Coronavirus carriers from across the border, while maintaining tight vigil on other activities.”Last week, Jammu and Kashmir director general of police Dilbagh Singh had said Pakistan is pushing militants infected with Covid-19 to spread the disease in the Kashmir Valley. Intelligence agencies have pointed out that more than 300 Pakistani terrorists are waiting across the border to sneak into India. Pakistan resorted to unprovoked firing and shelling along the Line of Control (LoC) for more than a week this month.Without going into specific incidents over the past month, Deswal said: “All the mischievous acts of Pakistan, be it on the international border or LoC, have been responded to with double impact.”Similarly, the Bangladesh border has witnessed very few incidents of smuggling or people sneaking across in the past month.According to the data compiled by BSF, 97 kg of heroin was seized along the Pakistan border in Punjab between January 1 and March 24, while only 17 kg of heroin was seized between March 25 and April 12.Another BSF officer, who didn’t want to be named, said: “There has been no infiltration of terrorists. A couple of incidents had taken places in Punjab, including when a Pakistani national was stopped from crossing over at Pulmoran in Amritsar on March 25, while another Pakistani was apprehended from Bamer in Ferozepur on March 26. Otherwise, the border is quiet.”BSF is posted along the 2,289-km international border with Pakistan from Gujarat to Jammu, and it manages 237 km of the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir with the army having operational control over its personnel. It guards the entire 4,092-km border with Bangladesh.Data on the Bangladesh border compiled by BSF showed that more than 20,000 heads of cattle were smuggled into the neighbouring country from January 1 to March 24. After the Covid-19 lockdown, the number dropped to 300.The smuggling of heroin, Yaba drugs, gold and silver too has drastically declined since March 25.Deswal said vigil is maintained along 100% of the India-China border as well.Referring to Covid-19 infections in BSF and ITBP, Deswal said both forces are now “corona free”, and the few BSF personnel who were infected have recovered.“We have told all troops and their families to indulge in extra physical exercise, as having a healthy body is the best medicine against Coronavirus,” Deswal said.He has also partially started calling personnel, who were on extended leave due to the lockdown, back to duty, especially from areas with no cases of Covid-19.The ITBP is making masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) in bulk for the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which may resume services at the Delhi Metro and airport soon.Deswal has also directed all his troops deployed at Indian missions in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka to follow safety measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/borders-sealed-stopping-infiltration-of-covid-19-carriers-our-aim-now-bsf-chief/story-ubREWvMmQJtGIX07KtKPcM.html
30-04-2020||India||Month of May could be ‘make or break’ for Covid-19 fight, say medical experts||As the May 3 deadline for the lockdown nears, medical experts feel the next month can be “make or break” for the fight against Covid-19 and an aggressive containment strategy for hotspots along with insulation of green zones is essential while giving some relaxations.The experts also suggested that railways, air travel, inter-state bus services, malls, shopping complexes, religious places, among others, should be kept shut at least for the month of May. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday had told chief ministers that the country will have to give importance to the economy while continuing the fight against coronavirus.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Centre on Wednesday gave clear indications that the ongoing nationwide lockdown will be extended beyond May 3, but with “considerable relaxations” to people and services in “many districts”.Medical experts feel an aggressive containment strategy in red zones and insulation of green zones is a must while giving relaxations.The number of Covid-19 hotspot districts in India has come down to 129 from 170 a fortnight ago, but in the same period the number of infection-free districts or green zones too decreased from 325 to 307, official sources said on Wednesday.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakDuring this time, the number of non-hotspot districts, also known as orange zones, increased from 207 to 297, they said.Dr Rajesh Kumar Gupta, Additional Director, Pulmonology and Critical Care, Fortis Noida, said it is important to understand that the lockdown does not kill the virus, it only slows the spread. Gupta suggested that the lockdown should be continued in red zones for about two weeks or some more time, and curbs be lifted in green zones while ensuring that there is no intermingling between them.May could be the “make or break” month for the fight against Covid-19 and it is important to keep curbs on in places from where cases are being reported, he told PTI.Dr Arvind Kumar, a noted lung surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it was important that railways, air services, interstate bus services, malls, shopping complexes, religious places etc., should be kept shut.The borders of green districts should be sealed and limited activities be allowed while ensuring social distancing with hand washing and wearing of masks being part of people’s lifestyle, he told PTI.In districts where cases have been reported, the lockdown should continue until such a time when there is a downward trend.May is very crucial in this fight against Covid-19 as India has done well till now and it is important to keep the cases in check and follow an aggressive containment strategy in red zones, while being very cautious in lifting curbs in green zones, Kumar said.Dr Rommel Tickoo, Associate Director, Internal Medicine, Max Healthcare, said any major relaxation at this juncture of the fight against Covid-19 could be “disastrous”.He advocated that restrictions remain in place at least for one more month, asserting “May could be the make or break month” in the nation’s battle against Covid-19.“Places like malls, schools, colleges, markets should remain closed through the month of May as one slip up could lead to major spread, undoing the good work,” he told PTI.“I would say lockdown should be in place for at least four more weeks. Numbers are increasing so it is not the time to remove it. Some economic activity can be allowed in green zones, but we have to be very careful,” he asserted.India seems to be better placed than the US and other western countries, but Prime Minister Modi has cautioned against complacency.At various benchmark numbers, India seems to have done relatively better than most advanced nations. At the 1,000 deaths benchmark, India had registered 31,332 cases, while Italy (15,113), UK (17,089), France (22,304), Spain (21,571) and Belgium (15,348), had registered lesser cases, according to official data.This shows that India’s death rate, the number of deaths with respect to the number of cases, remains low.Till now, India also seems to have done well in checking the increase rate of doubling of cases, which was three days when cases increased from 2,000 to 4,000 and went up to 10 days in doubling of cases from 16,000-32,000.India has the best rate of doubling of cases from 16,000-32,000 when compared with the US, Italy, Spain, France, Germany and the UK.The death toll due to the novel coronavirus pandemic rose to 1,074 after 66 more fatalities and the number of cases climbed to 33,050 in the country on Thursday, according to the Union Health Ministry.To maintain the good work till now, focus is now on containment strategy in red zones.The government has already identified 15 districts in nine states, including Delhi, Maharashtra and Gujarat, as having “high case load”. “These 15 districts are critical in our battle against Covid-19. Of them, 7 show particularly high case volumes. India’s success in battling Covid-19 is dependent on them. We must aggressively monitor, contain, test, treat in these districts! We must win here,” Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant tweeted on Monday.The nationwide lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Modi on March 24 in to combat the coronavirus threat. It was extended till May 3.Travel restrictions and other curbs may remain for some time and will eventually go away, but looking at global trends and the spread of the pandemic, it seems wearing masks, washing hands and practicing social distancing would be a way of life from here on, experts say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/month-of-may-could-be-make-or-break-for-covid-19-fight-say-medical-experts/story-YHa40C5ldBC3beIk921lSP.html
30-04-2020||India||PM Modi’s popularity gets a huge boost for being face of Covid-19 efforts||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s response to the country’s surging coronavirus epidemic may help him walk away unscathed from a host of political and economic problems that hounded his government just months ago.His approval rating on April 21 was 83%, up from 76% on January 7, according to Morning Consult, a US-based survey and research firm. A separate survey, the IANS-CVoter Covid-19 tracker also showed that trust in his leadership jumped to 93.5% as of April 21 from 76.8% on March 25.In early March, just as the number of people with Covid-19 began rising, Modi was presiding over an economy set to expand at the slowest pace in more than a decade, one of India’s biggest bank failures, riots on the streets of New Delhi and months of sustained street protests against a new citizenship law.Those issues seem to have been forgotten for now as Modi has placed himself front and center of India’s virus fight and bolstered his image as a world leader by promising to help other countries with medicines like the much-hyped hydroxychloroquine. The street protests have withered away amid the nationwide lockdown, as have criticisms of his government’s handling of the economy, with even the opposition parties focusing on the virus fight.But the battle to retain the tag of India’s most popular leader is still likely to be an uphill task for Modi at a time when millions have lost their jobs and small businesses have been shuttered in one of the world’s most stringent shutdowns. So far, a slower infection rate -- which virus experts say may be masked by low testing numbers -- and a contained death toll in the country of 1.3 billion people have earned him praise.“As the leader with the biggest megaphone, most agile political organization, and the full support of the government machinery, Modi will undoubtedly use the crisis as a way to consolidate his own position while also pinning the blame for India’s economic woes on the virus,” said Milan Vaishnav, director and senior fellow at the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“Politics in India is in a state of suspended animation -- in that vacuum, Modi’s leadership has become even more visible while the center has used this crisis to further centralize decision-making authority,” Vaishnav said.Government spokesman KS Dhatwalia did not reply to an email seeking comments for this story.Soaring PopularityIndia has been under a stringent nationwide lockdown since March 25, even though some restrictions were eased on April 20 to allow farmers and some industries to resume operations in rural areas and in districts that were free of infections.The country had reported 31,360 infections, including 1,008 deaths as of Wednesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The 40-day mandatory stay-at-home for almost all of the nation’s 1.3 billion people -- is in place until May 3 -- has crippled business activity and put a lid on consumption, the backbone of the economy, which could be heading for its first full-year contraction in more than four decades.But through it all Modi has made regular televised appearances, asking for the nation’s cooperation in the virus battle and thanking citizens for their discipline and fortitude during the lockdown.Road AheadThe fight against rising infections may have silenced the opposition and pushed Modi’s many challenges to the back-burner, but the path ahead is less certain.When the country is eventually able to exit its lockdown, the prime minister will be questioned about a strategy to help the economy back on its feet, said Sandeep Shastri, a political scientist and Pro Vice Chancellor at Jain University in Bangalore.“The response to the questions will be the barometer to measure the success of the current leadership.”The main opposition Congress party says it is waiting for virus fears to abate before it puts Modi to the test. The pandemic makes political mobilization difficult, said Manish Tewari, a spokesman for the Congress party. “Nothing else focuses the mind more than the possibility of invisible and lurking death be it on a door knob or a mirror.”There’s been limited opposition from other political parties as well, although state governments have complained the federal government has corralled finances even as they struggle to find funds to scale up their medical infrastructure.And the protests that rocked India’s streets until just before the spread of the virus and the subsequent lockdown, are also still simmering.“The protests will not end,” said Muzakkir Zama Khan, a lawyer who was part of the demonstrations against the government’s new citizenship law. “The means of expressing our viewpoint may, however, have to change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-popularity-gets-a-huge-boost-for-being-face-of-covid-19-efforts/story-gNKhqIczAzZ3PqjmxFX2DO.html

But a farmer in Jodhpur district of Rajasthan has donated his life savings of Rs 50 lakh to help feed the hungry during the lockdown.Ram Niwas Manda of Ummednagar village in Osian sub-district of Jodhpur has so far provided ration kits to 8,500 families in 83 gram panchayats.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former cricketers VVS Laxman and Virendra Sehwag have appreciated his efforts. PM Modi wrote to Manda on April 11, lauding his efforts to feed the poor and disabled families. The cricketers also called him and praised him.“Obviously I was thrilled when I got the mail from the PM. I was busy and saw the mail only on April 12. All this appreciation makes me feel humbled and encouraged to work harder to help people. I am glad I did the right thing,” he said.He denied any links to any political party. “I don’t have any political ambitions. I am not interested in propaganda. I only wanted to help people,” he said.Manda says his father, Paburam, inspired him“When the lockdown started, we heard of people going hungry as they did not have money to buy food. So, then, I thought I should do something and spoke to my father. He was very encouraging and said we should try to help others in this time of need,” says Ram Niwas, 39.Manda said his father offered his life savings and that inspired him to do the same. “So together, we contributed Rs 50 lakhs to provide food to people,” he says.“We formed teams of volunteers to prepare lists of the needy in 83 gram panchayats. I tried to reach out to those who are not covered under any government welfare scheme – such as daily wagers, labourers and the differently-abled.”Manda said one kit contains 10 kg wheat flour, 1 kg rice, 1 kg dal, 1 kg oil, spices, soaps and biscuits. The cost of each kit is Rs 790. He said the contents would last a family of 4-5 people for 8-10 days.Manda said after he began distributing the kits, other philanthropists in the villages too came forward and began contributing. “What began as an individual effort ended up becoming a collective one with others making their contributions in this time of distress,” said Manda.He said in the first round of ration distribution which began from April 2, 6000 kits were distributed. Then there was a demand from some villages where no one came forward to help those left out of the government aid, we carried out a second round of ration distribution and gave 1500 kits and in the third round, we distributed 1000 kits.He says he has around 1200 kits still in store and will continue to send them to villages from where there is demand. “In case the lockdown is extended further, then I will try to get people together to donate and provide food to those in need,” he said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Manda does not have any qualms about giving up his life savings.“My brother and I have 83 bighas of land. We have money to meet our daily expenses. We don’t immediately need savings. Our children are young. My son is 13 years and my brother’s daughters are one and five. We will build up our savings again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-farmer-gave-away-rs-50-lakh-life-savings-to-feed-needy-during-lockdown/story-yya0NVLFZcCUxsmJA83f1M.html

Both Rai and Pradhan, who belong to Lebong and Tindharia in the Darjeeling hills, respectively, and work as nurses at the state-run North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH), had tested Covid-19 positive after attending the region’s first patient, who had contracted SARS-CoV-2 that causes the disease. North Bengal’s first Covid-19 positive, a woman from Kalimpong, had died at the NBMCH on March 30.Rai and Pradhan were admitted to the NBMCH on April 4 and 11, respectively, and later shifted to the private nursing home that the West Bengal government has earmarked for Covid-19 patients in Siliguri.Later, Rai’s 22-month-old son, husband and mother also tested Covid-19 positive.Though she and her mother have recovered, her child and husband are still undergoing treatment.The two nurses said their sheer will power helped them face the ordeal and they were thankful to their colleagues for the support. However, they are hurt by people’s attitude towards Covid-19 patients. “Doctors, nurses, hospital staff, ward boys and sweepers – all those who at the frontline in battling the pandemic – aren’t getting the appreciation they deserve,” Pradhan said.“When I initially got the symptoms I requested many people in my neighbourhood to keep my son with them for a few days. But, they refused on the pretext that other residents might object,” Rai said. Rai’s neighbours, however, welcomed her and her mother when they returned to their apartment, which is located close to the NBMCH. Pradhan, too, received flowers when she returned to her parents’ home at Tindharia, which is located 27 kilometres north of Siliguri. But her relatives said some local people at Darjeeling More in Siliguri pressured the owner of the house, where she lives as a tenant, not to let her in.“She’d have loved to stay in her rented accommodation in Siliguri, if she’d have been allowed to go there,” said Anjana Sinchury, a Tindharia resident.“When I tested Covid-19 positive, I felt very low. But I didn’t break down because I knew that I’d have to face the crisis,” Pradhan said.Rai said had the NBMCH authorities were more cautious, her family members might not have been infected. Some of her colleagues, who didn’t wish to be identified, agreed with her assessment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cured-darjeeling-nurses-face-ostracism-say-health-workers-are-least-appreciated/story-M5u0kqrlgaNBCoOpoGW53N.html

30-04-2020||India||In waiting, Shiv Sena hopes ‘message from Delhi’ reaches Maharashtra Raj Bhavan||As the window of time closes in on chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to enter the state legislature, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi leaders and the Shiv Sena are examining all options to get him nominated to the upper house of the state legislature. Sena leaders said that they are also exploring their legal options and will be writing to the Election Commission.Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has remained non-committal on processing the recommendation of the state cabinet. The CM then reached out to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday evening to resolve the crisis. Sena insiders said that they would wait for a couple of days to see if “the message from Delhi reached Raj Bhavan”.Thackeray’s fate as chief minister hangs in balance as he has to get elected to one of the two houses of the state legislature by May 27. As per constitutional provisions, a minister or chief minister has to get elected to the state legislature within six months of taking oath. Thackeray, who was sworn in as the CM on November 28, will have to resign if he fails to get nominated to the upper house in the state assembly..The elections on the nine seats of the legislative council were deferred due to the coronavirus outbreak.“Uddhav ji has spoken to PM Modi. Let us wait for a couple of days if the message reaches Raj Bhavan. Meanwhile, we are working on our options. We would write to the Election Commission requesting it to hold the legislative council polls. Another option is to approach the Supreme Court seeking it to direct EC to hold the polls,” a Sena leader said requesting anonymity.The Sena is hopeful that the governor would process the nomination soon and it would not come to the MVA’s last option of Thackeray resigning. “It would not come to that (Thackeray’s resignation as CM),” the leader said. If Thackeray resigns, he would be re-elected as the leader of the MVA coalition and form the government again amid the ongoing battle against the coronavirus outbreak in Maharashtra.During the phone conversation between Thackeray and Modi, the former expressed unhappiness over the “politics being played” over his nomination to the legislative council. “Uddhav ji discussed the current political uncertainty in the state with the PM. He expressed unhappiness over the politics being played over his nomination as MLC at a time when the state is combating the coronavirus outbreak in the state,” a senior Sena leader told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-waiting-shiv-sena-hopes-message-from-delhi-reaches-maharashtra-raj-bhavan/story-2mny9GgkginpG7TyFmcUdJ.html
30-04-2020||India||Before receiving people from outside, Assam govt decides to help those stranded across the state||With the Union Home Ministry allowing inter-state movement of persons stranded across the country due to the coronavirus lockdown, all states are bracing up to handle the task of screening and quarantining thousands.But before that happens, the Assam government is ensuring that thousands stranded across the state travel from one district to another to reach their homes, workplaces or bring back family members.Inter-district travel within stateThe process, which started on April 25 and will continue till May 2, involves coordination between various departments, huge logistical support and use of technology to ensure social distancing and safety norms related to Covid-19.Till Wednesday, 48,770 people had taken permissions from district authorities and used their vehicles to travel from one district to another. Applications of 50,626 others are under process.Similarly, around 28,000 persons were helped to reach their destinations within the state by over 1,200 buses belonging to the Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) till Wednesday. The free service, which will continue till May 2, will benefit 13,000 more people.“This has eased one of the biggest problems we faced due to the lockdown. We will soon have to think about bringing back people stranded outside the state. But we need to be careful not to aggravate the Covid-19 situation in Assam,” Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Wednesday.Assam has recorded 41 Covid-19 positive cases. While 1 patient has died, 29 others have recovered and 11 others are under treatment.Transporting people while ensuring safetyThe exercise to allow people to travel and also transport them from one place in the state to another was a huge task. A website was started for those travelling on their own to register themselves for passes. WhatsApp numbers for each of the 33 districts were also given for applicants to register. For those travelling in ASTC buses, the department gave a helpline number where people could call and register. This was followed by the allocation of e-tickets, coordinate routes of buses, ensure travel on particular dates etc.“We have been able to undertake this challenging task in a short span of time due to a beautiful combination of human brain, technology and coordination between persons and departments involved,” said ASTC managing director Anand Prakash Tiwari.“There were some routes on which there were just one or two travelers and it was not feasible to send a bus for that. We had to keep every data in mind without getting confused as it could hamper operations on the ground,” he added.With a dedicated team of nearly 4,000 people - including call centre operators who handled queries to drivers and cleaners of buses who sanitized them - the department was able to plan routes of buses, passenger allocation and issue of e-tickets.“Despite the scale of the exercise, there was no laxity in the compliance of safety norms. Every passenger was screened before they boarded the buses. The police were present to ensure order and only 15-20 passengers were allowed to travel in each bus while maintaining social distance,” said Tiwari.Getting ready for those from outsideWith travel and transportation of people stranded within the state done, Assam is now gearing up for the arrival of those stranded outside the state.“Once lakhs of people start coming back to the state from outside, our health experts apprehend that a second wave of infections could close in on us in Assam,” Sarma said.The minister had earlier said that the state government wanted to take care of those stranded within the state first before those from outside come in and the health machinery gets busy in screening and quarantining them, if needed.The government’s initiative to reach-out to people stranded outside Assam has led to nearly 6 lakh people giving missed calls on a helpline number. It is assumed that 20% to 30% of them could return once travel between states is allowed.Assam is already planning a staggered entry of people from outside. Those who want to return will have to register themselves first following which they will be given permits allowing their return on specific dates. This will help keep a check on the number of people coming back and also ensure that they were quarantined properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/before-receiving-people-from-outside-assam-government-decides-to-help-those-stranded-across-the-state/story-E1T0SJCPh7Zepto8mFswCI.html

The girl was reportedly strangulated to death by her mother and uncle who later burned the body and buried it near the river banks.According to police officials, the girl used to live with her family members in Punay district of Rajasthan and was a native of Sonai Manji village - 10-kilometres from Pali district headquarters.  “The victim, identified as Rinku Sirvi, allegedly had an affair with a boy from Maharashtra with whom she had escaped three-months back. She was later found at Dadar railway station in Mumbai. The boy with whom she had escaped was arrested on charges of kidnapping and other relevant sections under the POCSO Act,” said Rahul Katakey, superintendent of police (SP), Pali.Also read: Rajasthan police starts dedicated helpline for ‘corona warriors’The boy, who was around 20-years-old, was granted bail a month later after which Sirvi told her mother that she wanted to get married to him once she is an adult. Her mother and uncle were allegedly completely against it. Irked by Sirvi’s persistence, her mother Sita and uncle Savaram made a plan to kill the minor. They took the victim to Sonai Manji village instead of visiting their deity’s temple.“On March 19, Sita and Savaram went to visit their deity’s temple located in isolated farms where they strangulated the victim’s neck and burned her body later. As the body was burnt partially, they packed it in a sack and buried it near a river bank located 1.5 kiolmetres away from the spot where the victim was killed,” the SP added.After disposing of the body, Savaram returned to Punay while Sita went to her parent’s home in Sodawas village of Alwar district.Few days back, the Pali police received a tip and recovered the body. The officers later interrogated the parents after which Sita and Savaram confessed to the crime and were arrested on Wednesday.

30-04-2020||India||Struck by Covid-19, India pushes pedal to the metal on virtual diplomacy||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Thursday kicked-off a detailed interaction with Indian envoys abroad to compare notes on the battle against Covid-19, its impact on India and the road ahead. This is Jaishankar’s second round of meetings with top Indian diplomats abroad.A recurring theme in his last interaction on March 20 was the status of stranded Indians. He had then asked the envoys to urge Indian nationals to stay put and not panic, and look around to secure medical equipment supplies that India would need back home.The government’s evacuation plan to bring the stranded Indians home over the next few weeks could figure in Thursday’s interaction with the Indian envoys. Jaishankar has started with envoys from the Asia Pacific region; South-East Asian countries will be next and then, South Asia.Taking virtual diplomacy to the next level. Began the first of a series of regional reviews. A good video conference with our High Commissioners and Ambassadors in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Papua & New Guinea and the Pacific Island countries. pic.twitter.com/EqdaWcJfyKJaishankar isn’t the only one talking.Top external affairs ministry officials are holding a parallel global outreach campaign; interacting with foreign envoys posted in national capital Delhi. The foreign envoys are being told how India is fighting the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen.Indian diplomats are also taking notes on how other countries have dealt with the virus that has, in just about four months, killed 225,000 people, infected over 3 million and driven countries to go into lockdown mode and threatened to push the global economy into a recession.Diplomacy couldn’t afford to go in lockdown mode. Instead, it went virtual, shifted gears and went into an overdrive, a foreign ministry official told Hindustan Times.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had set the template early in the crisis and has been working the phones to scale up India’s diplomatic engagement with the world. That he had also held a video conference with the heads of Indian missions on 30 March was one step in this direction.In the next 30 days, PM Modi spoke to leaders of 30 countries. Had a good discussion with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. We discussed the evolving COVID 19 scenario and agreed to work together to address the challenges in the spirit of our excellent bilateral ties and India's neighbourhood first policy.Ditto for Jaishankar who has kept pace with the prime ministers and reached out to his counterparts, even in countries that may have been assumed to be off New Delhi’s radar.Grenada, a tiny Caribbean island - one of the smallest countries in the western hemisphere - has a population of just over 1 lakh. Comoros, a volcanic archipelago off Africa’s east coast, has a population of 8 lakh.Many of these calls were to offer support and help. Congratulated the newly appointed FM of #Angola, @amb_tete. Agreed on an early meeting of our Joint Commission. Will work on new areas of cooperation, including health. Recognised the importance of the #IndiaAfricaForumSummit taking place soon.Jaishankar told the G-20 foreign ministers conference this week that New Delhi is providing pharma assistance to nearly 85 countries on a grant basis, many of them in Africa to support their response to the pandemic.There have been occasions when the external affairs minister has spoken to counterparts in Russia, Brazil, the United States, Saudi Arabia and Oman in 24 hours. This was on Thursday last.Jaishankar calls it “virtual diplomacy”.“Strong friendships thrive even virtually,” he tweeted after wrapping up his video calls to leaders in five countries.Government sources explain that the stepped-up effort is designed ·to ensure that the diplomatic machinery doesn’t go into stall mode but is kept primed for big action.India will be moving into a lead role at the World Health Organisation next month when its nominee formally takes over as the director general of the World Health Organisation. Next year, India will also get a spot in the United Nations Security Council as one of the 10 non-permanent members.The last time India had made it to the UNSC ws in 2012; Hardeep Singh Puri, the ex-diplomat in PM Modi’s council of ministers, was then India’s face at the UN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/struck-by-covid-19-india-pushes-the-pedal-on-the-metal-on-virtual-diplomacy/story-gkF4rCPIXciTZ1kUeYCOxM.html
30-04-2020||India||Amid uncertainty over Uddhav’s MLC nomination, experts differ on governor’s role||As uncertainty surrounds chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s nomination to the legislative council and Maharashtra stares at a constitutional crisis, experts differ on whether governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari is duty-bound to nominate Thackeray to the House from his quota, as recommended by the state cabinet.Thackeray has to get elected to one of the two Houses of the state legislature --- legislative council or the legislative assembly --- by May 27. Since he is not a member of any of the houses, he will, according to Article 164(4) of the Constitution, lose his post unless is he elected within six months from the date of taking oath (November 28).Under Article 171 of the Constitution, the governor can nominate members to the legislative council from the fields of literature, science, art and social service. Social service has a wider scope and political leaders have been nominated in this category in the past. With the governor yet to take a call on the cabinet’s recommendation, Thackeray called Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.In the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, the Election Commission has put on hold elections to fill vacant seats in the Rajya Sabha, and all by-elections and civic body elections --- a development that has led to the uncertainty in Maharashtra. The ruling Shiv Sena-Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) combine has alleged that the governor is not taking swift action. Technically, Thackeray can resign and take oath again as the chief minister after getting elected the leader of the ruling combine comprising the three parties. While a section of constitutional experts said it is the governor’s decision alone, others argued that he has to go by the recommendations of the state cabinet. “If the governor decides that it will be his discretion under which the issue will be dealt with, then that cannot be questioned. The governor is bound to act on the advice of the council of ministers except when he chooses to address the issue under his own discretion,” constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap said.Kashyap said the governor can also refer an issue to the President, who, in turn, can seek the advice of the Supreme Court. “The second issue is: should a nominated member be appointed a minister or the chief minister? At the Union level, no such appointments have been made in the last 70 years, but at the state level, there have been precedents in Bihar and Maharashtra. I personally feel that a nominated member being appointed a minister or the chief minister is against the spirit of democracy, though it is not illegal,” he said.But constitutional expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general  PDT Achary said the governor cannot sit on a decision on a matter such as this, and has to go by the advice or recommendation of the state cabinet.“The governor has no other option but to accept it [the cabinet’s decision] and can, at best, seek a clarification from the government. But once the government gives its clarification, the governor cannot sit over it. I don’t know why the governor is not taking a final decision on the issue,” he said.“In our constitutional scheme, a governor cannot act independently and has no discretion in this matter because it is an executive function. Nominating a member to the legislative council and the Rajya Sabha is basically an executive act. And a governor acts only on the advice of council of ministers,” Achary added.The first recommendation to the governor by the state cabinet on Thackeray’s nomination was made on April 9. A delegation of leaders, led by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, met the governor a second time on Wednesday to reiterate its demand.Out of the total 78 members in the Maharashtra legislative council, 12 are nominated by the governor. There are two vacancies from the governor’s quota, after Rahul Narvekar and Ramrao Wadkute resigned from the council last year. While Wadkute resigned the NCP to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Narvekar got elected to the state assembly on a BJP ticket.The ruling side also argues that section 151A of the Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951 --- which some see as an impediment to Thackeray’s nomination --- does not apply in the present circumstances, especially at a time when the election commission has put all polling processes on hold. This section mandates the election commission to fill vacancies in the Houses of Parliament and state legislatures through by-elections within six months from the date of occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the remainder of the term of a member in relation to a vacancy is one year or more. Terms of both the seats from where Thackeray can be nominated will end on June 6. The ruling side argues this section only deals with the election of member, and not his or her nomination. Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde said the provision does not necessarily mean that the seats in question will have to remain vacant.“The provision says elections need not be conducted if the term is less than a year, but if it is the Cabinet’s decision to fill those seats and since the governor is bound by the cabinet’s advice, there is nothing to say that the nomination would be illegal,” he said.Achary said there is no clarity in the law as far as the term of a nominated member is concerned.“…I would say that a governor has to act only by the aid and advice of the council of ministers, irrespective of the term of a member. That shouldn’t matter. Instead of sitting on the decision, the governor should seek clarifications from the council of ministers and take a decision,” he said.Mumbai-based political analyst Abhay Deshpande said the governor should accept the state cabinet’s recommendation because of the extraordinary situation prevailing in the country due to the Covid-19 outbreak.“Thackeray’s matter is different from the past cases. Thackeray is not getting a chance to get elected because the election commission has deferred the scheduled polls in view of the prevailing situation. If elections are not held, you are denying him a chance to get elected. Had elections been held on time, the chances of his elections were very good. So, you can’t compare apples with oranges,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-uncertainty-over-uddhav-s-mlc-nomination-experts-differ-on-governor-s-role/story-Gp22epms2gl1BpsC2AEyJP.html

The renovation of the Parliament building is a segment in the Centre’s larger Central Vista project which includes a new Parliament house, a new Central secretariat complex for ministries, and new residences for the Prime Minister and the Vice President. The entire project is expected to be completed by 2024.The Delhi Development Authority last December had changed the land use of a 15-acre plot from recreational to residential on Dalhousie Road near South Block where the PM’s new residence has been proposed.The opposition parties have criticised the Centre’s decision to go ahead with the project as the country battles the deadly coronavirus disease.Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to the PM, on April 10, in which she urged him to suspend the Rs 20,000 crore allocated to the project. “At a time like this, such an outlay seems self-indulgent to say the least. I am certain that Parliament can function comfortably within the existing historical buildings. There is no urgent or pressing requirement that cannot be postponed until this crisis is contained,” she wrote.Trinamool leader and MP Mahua Moitra also slammed the move. “The government is suspending MPLADS funds for two years for generate resources to fight Covid-19 but wants to spend Rs 20,000 crore on the central vista project,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-put-stay-on-delhi-central-vista-project/story-eMgU2sLoZApx1J7dDOJPIN.html

The minister made the statement after holding a meeting with industry players, associations, and chambers of the electronics goods market.The mobile manufacturing industry, which is staring at an estimated loss of over Rs 20,000 crore because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, has urged the MeitY for broadening the definition of essential goods in a bid to allow online and offline sales of mobile device and networking products.They have also pleaded with the ministry that all authorised sales and service centres of all electronics goods be allowed to resume their services.Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of the Indian Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), said that the industry is facing a severe crisis due to the viral outbreak. “The industry is in deep trouble. Production losses are estimated to be around Rs 20,000 crore. All companies’ plants are closed. Exports losses have gone up to Rs 2,500 crore and 2.5 crore mobile phones are lying unrepaired. Our meeting with the minister ended on a note of cautious optimism. Hopefully, the government will take immediate action by including the mobile manufacturing industry as an integral part of essential goods,” Mohindroo said.Prasad announced during the meeting that Aarogya Setu, a Covid-19 tracking mobile application developed by the MeitY’s National Informatics Centre, has been downloaded a record eight crore times. The minister said that electronics factories should be opened in a calibrated manner.Prasad has asked the electronics goods companies to ramp up production of medical electronics such as ventilators because of the equipments growing demand to treat Covid-19 patients. He also urged the IT sector to take advantage of three new government schemes that would be launched soon to attract global investments and strengthen the industry in a post-Covid-19 world.“The minister said that the country’s domestic demand is going to be huge, as the lockdown restrictions have increased people’s dependence to transact via the digital medium. He asked the industry to increase exports to cater to growing global demands,” said an official, who was present at the meeting.Industry players told Prasad that major electronics manufacturing clusters in Noida, Greater Noida, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh are facing local restrictions because of their presence in high-risk Covid-19 zones. Prasad, however, allayed their concerns and told them that he has already had a word with respective states seeking their cooperation. Mobile phone manufacturers such as Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, Foxconn, Lava, Wistron, Oppo, Flex, Sterlite, Micromax, Deki Electronics, Tejas Networks Ltd, and, Panasonic, etc., attended Wednesday’s meeting, which took place a day after Prasad held talks with all his state counterparts.Industry bodies, including the ICEA, Manufacturers Association for Information Technology (MAIT), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI), Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD), Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association of India (TEMA), Ph.D. Chambers, and Indian Telephone Industry Limited (ITI), among others, also attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-asks-mha-to-consider-mobile-products-as-essential-goods-after-industry-demand/story-wXAGKkKufrKuL5Uzn8pEGP.html

Many of them have been attacked which is illegal and is a big hurdle to contain the spread of the virus,” Lather said.The DGP added, “This helpline number is created to help medical staff, paramedical staff and ASHA workers involved in door-to-door survey and screening of Covid-19. Also, nodal officers have been appointed to take up the grievances of the corona fighters,” said Lather.He further informed that Vishal Bansal, inspector general of police (crime branch), has been appointed as the nodal officer at the state level while for the districts, a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) rank officer has been appointed.The nodal officers will also share the complaints with the state government and the Indian Medical Association, Lather said.

They reached Udaipur in Gomati district on the same day late evening. “There were two ambulance drivers, who took turns to drive over 3,000 kilometres by road from Chennai to Tripura. All seven people, including the drivers, were immediately quarantined after they reached here. We also collected their swab samples and sent them for tests. One of the drivers, who is from Tamil Nadu, has tested Covid-19 positive. The rest six have tested negative,” the minister told the media persons.“All the seven people were screened before they entered Tripura and none of them had shown any symptoms of Covid-19,” he added.The minister said that the Covid-19 positive driver is undergoing treatment in Siliguri, north Bengal. “All those, who came in contact with the driver during his stay in Tripura, will have to undergo tests,” the minister said.The state government, which is all set to begin rapid random community Covid-19 tests, urged people to volunteer for tests if they show any symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 that causes the disease.Around 6,000 people, who are stranded outside Tripura, have registered with the state authorities in their bid to return home at the earliest, officials said. The state has conducted 4,613 tests to date, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-ambulance-driver-who-drove-couple-to-tripura-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-q8yLDFEzRxoOrcha6TZTMJ.html

The Opposition said that Kerala government was taking revenge on employees after it suffered a serious setback in the court.The government was forced to bring the ordinance after the Kerala High Court stayed its order to slash employees’ salaries for six days every month for the next five months (totalling 30 days). Reeling under severe financial constraints, the government is planning to save Rs 2,000 crore through this.“It is sad that a big controversy was created over this. It should have been avoided at this juncture. Opposition also provoked employees’ outfits,” said state finance minister Thomas Issac welcoming the Governor’s decision and adding that it was a temporary arrangement.The government order issued to that effect last week said the move will be applicable to employees of all state- owned enterprises, public sector undertakings, quasi-government organisations and universities, among others.“All are undergoing a difficult situation. So it is natural that employees will also be a part of the process. We have deducted 30% salaries of ministers, MLAs, board chairmen and others for one year,” Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday.Announcing the cabinet decision, Isaac had told mediapersons on Wednesday: “As per this ordinance, the state government has been empowered to defer 25% of the salary of government employees, in case of a disaster.”The minister, however, made it clear that 25 per cent of the salary would not be deferred and the state government would go ahead with its initial six-day cut plan. The employees’ outfits have, meawhile, said they will move the Supreme Court against the ordinance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-governor-gives-nod-to-ordinance-which-allows-govt-to-temporarily-cut-salaries/story-kzJQz5utGzg4n5fhGuSiwK.html

30-04-2020||India||MP govt sets up facilitation centre to redress farmer’s grievances, stirs controversy||The Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Madhya Pradesh (MP) on Wednesday stoked another controversy when its agriculture department set up a Kamal Suvidha Kendra in its directorate’s information technology (IT) cell in a bid to redress farmers’ grievances.The main opposition, Congress, was quick to seize on the nomenclature and the timing of the launch, as kamal (lotus) is the ruling party’s electoral symbol.The Congress accused the BJP of hankering after publicity amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“The BJP leaders’ hunger for publicity amid the Covid-19 tragedy has astonished the people. State agriculture minister Kamal Patel, who has a kamal ring to his name, couldn’t have come up with a more inappropriate name than Kamal Suvidha Kendra. The minister used the opportunity to not only publicise his own name but also the BJP’s electoral symbol,” alleged Narendra Saluja, state Congress president’s media coordinator.“Earlier, CM Chouhan’s photograph was inserted in ayurvedic herbal packets that were distributed by the state government. The BJP has launched a campaign selfie with a mask as if the mask is a symbol of entertainment. The BJP leaders are rejoicing the occasion and busy with their self-promotion when MP has emerged as one of the Covid-19 hotspots in the country,” he added.Saluja was referring to CM Chouhan’s announcement on Monday, where he had said that the state government’s Amrit Jeevan Yojna aims to distribute 10 million packets of ayurvedic herbs to help people boost their immunity to combat SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, and other viral infections. Chouhan’s photograph is printed in a leaflet that’s inserted in each of herbal product’s packets.State Congress spokesperson Ajay Singh Yadav alleged that the BJP was pushing its electoral agenda via this herbal therapy scheme.State BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai, however, countered the Congress for its bid to “raise irrelevant issues and demeaning the role of an effective opposition”.“If the Congress is so averse to the name Kamal, then will it ask the party’s state president Kamal Nath to drop his first name?” he asked.The state government’s order to redress farmers’ grievances across the state got lost amid the political slugfest.“A true friend of farmers ­­--- Kamal Suvidha Kendra --- has been set up in the agriculture department’s directorate’s IT centre to receive suggestions and redress grievances of farmers across the state,” said the order issued by the department’ director.The centre would function between 10.30am and 5.30pm on all working days and two employees would be posted there, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-govt-sets-up-facilitation-centre-to-redress-farmer-s-grievances-stirs-controversy/story-M1Amid8KIXxnFmsJoiHMPM.html

The exact number of cases in Maharashtra stand at 9,915, according to the health ministry website.Mumbai leads in the number of new Covid-19 cases - the city recorded 475 cases on Wednesday - taking its tally to 6,644. It is now the worst-affected city in the country.On Wednesday, Maharashtra also recorded its single highest-day toll with 32 deaths reported, of which 26 were in Mumbai.Mumbai’s situation continues to be grim as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) projected that the cases in Mumbai (city and suburban districts) will reach 28,859 cases by May 15. The total number of cases in Mumbai city, suburbs, Pune, Palghar and Thane may collectively cross 37,000 by May 15, the ministry projects. The state government has, however, dismissed the projection and said that the multiple mathematical models have given various projections and the state’s plan is being based on a realistic model. Maharashtra till date has tested 1,37,159 samples in total, of which 1,26,376 were negative. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said that the doubling rate in Mumbai has improved from seven days to 10 days now, and the mortality rate has also reduced. The ministry on Wednesday also said that stranded migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists and students will be allowed to move with conditions during the lockdown. The Maharashtra government is preparing guidelines to transport the stranded migrants in the state. The number of Covid-19 cases in the country increased by 1,718 in the last 24 hours, pushing the overall tally up to 33,050. The number of deaths went up to 1,074 after 66 more people died of the disease in the last 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-tally-inches-towards-10-000-mumbai-worst-hit-in-country/story-E5GFRPnVlZ5U2rPycVSUvM.html
30-04-2020||India||‘Rs 65,000 crore needed for poor during Covid-19, we can afford it’: Raghuram Rajan||Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan has said that India needs Rs 65,000 crore to feed the poor during the Covid-19 pandemic, insisting the country can afford to do that with a GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of about Rs 200 lakh crore.Rajan also said India needs to be “cleverer in lifting the lockdown and open up its economy in a measured way” as it does not have the capacity to support the people across the spectrum for too long.Rajan was in dialogue with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi as part of his series of video conversations with global and Indian thought leaders to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences on the Indian economy.Asked by Gandhi how much would be required to be distributed among the poor to tide over the crisis triggered by the deadly coronavirus, Rajan replied, “Approximately Rs 65,000 crore. Our GDP is Rs 200 lakh crore and out of that Rs 65,000 crore is not a huge amount. So, we can do it. If this is for the poor and to save their lives and livelihood, we must do it.”On lifting the lockdown, the former RBI governor said, “We have to be cleverer about opening up...We need to open up in a measured way but as fast as possible so that people start having jobs. We don’t have the capacity to support people across the spectrum for too long. Being a relatively poor country, people start out with significantly lower reserves. It is all too easy to have a lockdown forever, but obviously that is unsustainable for the economy.”To contain the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had first announced a nationwide lockdown from March 25 to April 14 and later extended it till May 3.Rajan agreed with Gandhi that aggressive testing is at the heart of the management of Covid-19. “I don’t think we have to aim for 100% success and have zero cases when we open up. That is unachievable. What we have to do is to manage the reopening so that when there are cases, we isolate them,” he added.Asked by Gandhi that India is a big country and its ability to test like the United States or the European countries is comparatively limited, the former RBI governor said, “You are talking about 2 million tests a day in India if you have to get the level of confidence that you have in the United States. And clearly, we are nowhere near that. I think we are somewhere around 25,000 or 30,000 tests a day at this point.”Gandhi and his Congress party have repeatedly urged the government to scale up testing, calling it the biggest weapon against the Covid-19.Rajan evaded direct responses to questions on centralisation of power and the authoritarian way of governance in India.“I do believe that decentralisation is important both for bringing more local information to work but also about giving empowerment to the people. What you see across the world is a great sense of disempowerment. Decisions are being made elsewhere, but not by me,” he said.However, Rajan stressed the need for social harmony, saying India cannot afford to have its house divided in challenging times.“Social harmony is a public good. Having everyone believe that they are a part of this system, an equal part of the system is essential. We cannot afford to be a house divided especially in these times when our challenges are so big,” he said.For his part, Gandhi said infrastructure connects people and that gives opportunity, but if there is division and hatred, that disconnects people.“There is an infrastructure of division and hatred and that causes as big a problem,” the former Congress chief added.On opportunities after the Covid-19 situation, Rajan said India can help mould dialogue post-pandemic to make space for multi-polar global order. “There will have to be rethinking on everything in global economy once we are out of this pandemic. India can find opportunity for its industry and supply chain in the world. It can also help make its voice heard in the global order,” he added.However, Rajan sounded caution when Gandhi asked him if India can take advantage of the situation due to pandemic.“These kinds of incidents rarely have positive effects for any country, in general. There are ways countries can take advantage of. What I think we can say is that there will have to be a rethinking of everything in the global economy once we are out of this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-65-000-crore-needed-for-poor-during-covid-19-we-can-afford-it-raghuram-rajan/story-0VIr0BAoK1w81Y6N4V4p6M.html

30-04-2020||India||India can lead global dialogue on ‘rethinking’ economy after Covid-19 crisis: Raghuram Rajan tells Rahul Gandhi||In an interaction on Thursday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan discussed the many aspects of the coronavirus crisis that plagues the world and has gripped the country.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said people’s minds are full of questions around the ongoing coronavirus crisis and what is going to happen with the economy.“I thought an interesting way to answer some of those questions would be to have a conversation with you,” the Congress leader said.In one of his questions, Gandhi asked if there will be any strategic changes after the coronavirus pandemic which India could use to its advantage. Rajan said that incidents like the Covid-19 pandemic rarely have any positive results for any country. However, the crisis will enable a “rethinking of everything in the global economy”.“India can assume the leadership role in shaping that dialogue, to be a leader in that dialogue,” Rajan said.“There will have to be a rethinking of everything in the global economy once we are out of this. If there is an opportunity for India, it is in shaping that dialogue and in being the leader in that dialogue. India is not one of the warring parties but a country big enough to have its voice heard in the global economy,” the ex-RBI governor told Gandhi. Rajan also said that going for a second or third lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will be devastating for the country’s economy.“Second or third lockdown will be devastating. It does diminish our credibility. We don’t have to aim for 100 per cent success - it is not possible too - we have to manage the reopening,” Dr Rajan stated.The dialogue with Rajan was first in the series that Gandhi plans to hold with public intellectuals. The session was pre-recorded and shared on Congress party’s social mediums.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-can-lead-global-dialogue-on-rethinking-economy-after-covid-19-crisis-raghuram-rajan-tells-rahul-gandhi/story-qiMSQ4qsQKNs9nXYh98MnN.html
30-04-2020||India||‘Progress in Panchayati Raj lost, moving towards bureaucratic structure’: Rahul Gandhi||A lot of progress made in the Panchayati Raj has been lost, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Thursday.“I am sorry to say, it’s a retreat. A lot of forward movement in Panchayati Raj that had taken place, we are now moving to a sort of bureaucratic, DM-based structure. If you look at the southern states, they are doing a better job because they are actually more decentralised. The northern states are centralising power,” Gandhi said while speaking to former RBI governor Dr Raghuram Rajan on a video dialogue.“I do believe that decentralisation is important, both for bringing local information for work and giving empowerment to the people. What you see across the world is disempowerment, decisions are made elsewhere. Not by me (the common man), I have a vote but that elects somebdy else and my local government or state government has less power,” said Dr Rajan.“The more decisions are taken to people, the more ability they have to keep a check,” he added.During the conversation, Gandhi asked Rajan ways and means on how to revive the economy currently in the grip of a crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic.This is the first in a series of dialogues that Gandhi plans to hold with intellectuals and other public intellectuals.The dialogue was pre-recorded and disseminated by the Congress on social media.Gandhi will also be later having dialogues with health experts on how to deal with the pandemic, besides talking to experts in different fields on the effect of the novel coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/progress-in-panchayati-raj-lost-moving-towards-bureaucratic-structure-rahul-gandhi/story-iyXFip7GTQDSDtOY2eQQYL.html
30-04-2020||India||Second or third lockdown will be devastating for India’s economy, says Raghuram Rajan in conversation with Rahul Gandhi||Former governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Dr Raghuram Rajan, has said that if India has to go for a second or third lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19, it will be devastating for the country’s economy.“It’s very important to have as much information about the issue as possible. We have to start thinking about starting people’s livelihoods, and it has to be sequenced. The reopening is not just about office, it is also about following social distancing on the way to and coming back from your workplace,” Dr Rajan said while speaking to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on a video dialogue.“Second or third lockdown will be devastating. It does diminish our credibility. We don’t have to aim for 100 per cent success - it is not possible too - we have to manage the reopening,” Dr Rajan added.The dialogue with Rajan was first in the series that Gandhi plans to hold with public intellectuals. It included a detailed discussion on the state of the economy and how to revive it in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.“To really be confident about reopening up of economy, you have to triple up the number of tests which is currently happening in India. You have to have about a million tests, if you want a confidence like the United States,” Dr Rajan added.The dialogue was pre-recorded and disseminated by the Congress on social media.A slew of changes in the Congress party has recently been interpreted by many party leaders as a sign of Gandhi’s return to presidency. Most recently, Congress interim chief Sonia Gandhi constituted an 11-member consultative group under former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s leadership to deliberate on matters related to the Covid-19 pandemic and to formulate the party’s views on them.The group also includes Rahul Gandhi, Randeep Singh Surjewala, KC Venugopal, P Chidambaram, Manish Tewari, Jairam Ramesh, Praveen Chakravarty, Gaurav Vallabh, Supriya Shrinate and Rohan Gupta. This is the first time Rahul Gandhi has become a member of a party panel since he stepped down as the Congress chief last year.

This registration exercise would help the Government of India to obtain relevant information in respect of Indian nationals wishing to travel to India for “compelling” reasons.As the clamour for repatriation is rising from hundreds of thousands of Indians in the virus-hit countries, ANI learns that the GoI has listed some categories, who would be given priority and will get the first seats in special repatriation flights, followed by the students stranded in foreign countries.As the government is continuously assessing the situation and working on all possible options, it is still not certain when and how will Indian citizens stranded in the United States will return home.“The Middle East will first be the focus.

30-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Plan to use malaria drug in Mumbai slums temporarily shelved||A plan to give the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to thousands of people in Mumbai’s crowded slums to prevent coronavirus infections has temporarily been shelved, officials said Wednesday.Health officials in Mumbai said that a test to prove the efficacy of the much touted but largely untested drug was still in the cards, but that for now they would follow federal Indian guidelines.India, which reached the grim milestone of over 1,000 deaths from the virus on Wednesday, is one of the few countries that has pushed for the use of hydroxychloroquine, as a precautionary measure among high-risk groups such as health care workers or people who have come in close contact with COVID-19 patients.Mumbai, one of the world’s most densely populated cities, has struggled to contain the spread of the virus, and has over 3,000 cases. In Mumbai slums like Dharavi, which is Asia’s largest, social distancing is nearly impossible. In response, the state government had said it would conduct a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine on slum residents.But experts pointed to the scant evidence for the efficacy of the drug and the risks it poses, and questioned the ethics of using hydroxychloroquine on a vulnerable population. Dr. Daksha Shah, Mumbai’s deputy executive health officer, said that officials would now follow guidelines set by India’s top medical research body, and that they were waiting for approval to test the drug.The state government has now said that hydroxychloroquine — which has been touted by President Donald Trump — can be given only after patients consent to taking it while knowing the risks involved. It added that adverse reactions need to be immediately reported to authorities, and that doctors must sign off on giving the drug to those with heart ailments, diabetes or blood disorders.But concerns remain over India’s policy of using the drug as a precautionary measure. India’s National Task Force for COVID-19 issued a statement on March 22 that said its decision to allow the use of the drug was based on “risk-benefit considerations, under exceptional circumstances” and was “derived from available evidence of benefit as treatment and supported by preclinical data.”After the statement was issued, health workers in Mumbai, like other parts of India, began taking hydroxychloroquine. The drug was also given to healthy police officers in the city.But experts say there is no evidence that the drug is a preventative tool against COVID-19. Even for the treatment of diagnosed patients, hydroxychloroquine has shown no benefit.An analysis of 368 patients in U.S. veterans hospitals published earlier this month reported more deaths among those given the drug versus standard care.“If there is no evidence ... why are scientific bodies pushing this drug and giving the impression to the public that there is a magic bullet, and this is your last hope?” said Dr. Shriprakash Kalantri, an epidemiologist in the west Indian state of Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-plan-to-use-malaria-drug-in-mumbai-slums-temporarily-shelved/story-8tgG6ToV6y4KNefQ3qURwN.html

30-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Haryana to adopt district level strategy to start industrial operations||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Wednesday that the state would be divided into two zones for giving impetus to economic activity. Khattar said that in 15 districts where the number of coronavirus positive cases is less than 10, a district-level strategy would be adopted to start industrial operations. In the remaining seven districts, namely Gurugram, Faridabad, Nuh, Sonipat, Panipat, Palwal, and Panchkula, the strategy would be made as per the block and town level. No economic activity would be allowed in the containment zones, the chief minister said.Khattar said that those industrial units that follow social distancing norms and carry out their operations with less than 50% labour strength, can extend their working hours from 8 to 12 hours. The CM added that such industrial units should pay double salary to their workers for working overtime as per section 59 of the Factories Act, 1948.CM Khattar also said that all brick kilns have been allowed to function and presently around 2.07 lakh labourers are working at these kilns. Besides this, various industrial units have been restarted wherein approximately 5.5 lakh workers are employed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-haryana-to-adopt-district-level-strategy-to-start-industrial-operations/story-y4XhLs794i8UPhvLmL9wcI.html
30-04-2020||India||Tremendous gain in Covid-19 situation, considerable relaxations after May 3, hints Centre||The Centre has indicated that after the Covid-19 lockdown ends on May 3, there will be “considerable relaxations” in many areas.In a series of tweets, the Union Home Ministry spokesperson said that a comprehensive review meeting was held on the lockdown situation in the country where it was found that there have been tremendous gains and improvement in the Covid-19 situation due to the lockdown till now.“New guidelines to fight #COVID19 will come into effect from 4th May, which shall give considerable relaxations to many districts. Details regarding this shall be communicated in the days to come,” the home ministry spokesperson tweeted.However, in the same series of tweets, the MHA spokesperson said that there was a need to maintain a strict lockdown till May 3 so that the gains are not squandered away. New guidelines to fight #COVID19 will come into effect from 4th May, which shall give considerable relaxations to many districts. Details regarding this shall be communicated in the days to come.#Corona Update#StayHomeStaySafe @PMOIndia @HMOIndia @MoHFW_INDIAThe Centre’s announcement - the first such official indication of what to expect after May 3 - came hours after the government relaxed the norms for migrant movement. The decision on migrants came on the 36th day of the national lockdown, amid hundreds of thousands of migrant workers stranded away from their home or returning home on foot, and demands by states seeking policy clarity.The MHA, in an order, said that migrant workers, students, tourists, pilgrims and other persons stranded in other states, should be allowed to move, and issued a protocol on how this should be done.The first guidelines were issued on March 24 immediately after the prime minister announced the lockdown for 21 days.The guidelines, issued under the Disaster Management Act by the Union Home Secretary, specified the people and services exempted from the lockdown.On Wednesday, the number of Covid-19 hotspots in India came down to 129 from 170 a fortnight ago, but in the same period the number of infection-free districts or green zones too decreased from 325 to 307.During this time, the number of non-hotspot districts, also known as orange zones, increased from 207 to 297.On April 15, the Centre had declared 170 districts across 25 states and Union Territories as coronavirus hotspots or red zones. Of these, 123 were hotspot districts with large outbreaks and 47 with clusters.The government has already allowed industrial activities in rural areas with conditions. Similarly, apart from the shops for the essential commodities, standalone business establishments of non-essential goods were also allowed to open during the lockdown.According to the Union Health Ministry, the number of coronavirus cases in the country climbed to 31,787 and the number of fatalities rose to 1,008 on Wednesday, registering a record jump of 71 deaths in 24 hours.The number of cases too increased by 1,813 between Tuesday and Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tremendous-gain-in-covid-19-situation-considerable-relaxations-after-may-3-hints-centre/story-cflUAZp53UhqEIDz5USkBL.html
30-04-2020||India||Warships on standby to evacuate Indians||India has kept three warships on standby to bring back thousands of Indians stuck in West Asian countries as New Delhi works towards implementing an evacuation plan that will also include special flights amid the coronavirus outbreak, officials said Wednesday.These warships are INS Jalashwa and two other amphibious warships, the officials said. “The ministry of external affairs (MEA) is steering the plan. The navy is prepare,” one official said.As reported by HT on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spelt out the ground rule for the evacuation — India’s blue collar workers stranded abroad will get the first seats in the special flights that will be run by the government to get them home.Students will be next, followed by everyone else, including those who were travelling for work, or pleasure.The officials said that the MEA is also in touch with the Indian Air Force (IAF), which has conveyed how it can contribute and what assets can be deployed to bring back the stranded people. The officials said the IAF’s C-17, IL-76 and C-130J aircraft could be pressed into action but it would make more sense for Air India to send its aircraft as they are “better configured to carry passengers and cargo”. “Nothing has been finalised yet,” a second official said.MEA officials refused to comment on the matter.The three warships can accommodate around 1,500 people in all. The Jalashwa can bring back around 800 and the warships can together accommodate 700, the officials quoted above said.“The warships can carry more people but social distancing norms will have to be followed during the proposed evacuation,” one said.A navy spokesperson refused to comment on the development.Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies, said, “The military has time and again shown that it has the capabilities to come to the aid of stranded diaspora. We saw that in Yemen recently and in Libya and Kuwait evacuations earlier. With the available capability, we can actually declare ourselves to be a regional HADR (humanitarian assistance and disaster relief) provider.”The armed forces have played an important role in the fight against Covid-19, setting up quarantine centres, providing healthcare facilities and evacuating Indian nationals from other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/warships-on-standby-to-evacuate-indians/story-oR8IJSvJy0AM31NDpXEP8I.html
30-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India, Peru, Portugal, and Ecuador are clustered between the 15th and 20th positions in terms of the number of Covid-19 cases. The number of cases in the four countries, on Wednesday morning, was 31332, 31190, 24322, and 24258 respectively; the number of deaths, 1008, 854, 948, and 871. The corresponding death rates were 3.21%, 2.73%, 3.90%, and 3.59%. There is a wide variance in testing rates — from a low of 559 per million population in India, to 37,223 per million population in Portugal — and, of course, the countries are very different, in terms of population and economic development; yet, here they are, clustered together in terms of number of cases and deaths. (All the data is from worldometers.info).Correlation isn’t causation, but it’s interesting to note that India, Peru and Portugal have almost universal coverage of the BCG vaccine — given to children to fight tuberculosis, and which helps them build immunity to several other respiratory ailments. Ecuador used to give its children the vaccine, but stopped it. There has been a lot of speculation, and some research on whether people who have been administered the vaccine have some level of immunity to the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19. Australia has started a study that will cover 4,000 health workers (who will be administered the vaccine) to assess whether there is a relationship between the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin injection and the rate of Covid-19 infection.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageHow does one read the death numbers in India? The country crossed 1,000 deaths on Tuesday and on Wednesday night, the number stood at 1,076, which translated into a death rate (as a proportion of those infected) of 3.25%. This works out to 0.9 deaths per million population. Any which way you look at the number, it is low. Sweden, where the number of cases stood at 19,621 on Tuesday (2,355 deaths) presents an interesting comparison. The death rate (as a proportion of those infected) in Sweden is over 12%; per million of population it is 230. Yet, because it did not lock down (even school terms continued) — it did issue guidelines on social distancing, but left the enforcement to its people and businesses — the country likes to see its response to Covid-19 as a success (and indeed, this is evident in some of the coverage regarding Sweden’s strategy in dealing with the pandemic). At this point in time, at least to this writer, those numbers do not indicate a success at all; in the trade-off between lives and livelihoods, Sweden seems to have swung too much towards the latter.Sweden, an entire country, has a population of a little over 10 million.Dharavi, Mumbai’s biggest slum, has a population of around 850,000, 8.5% of Sweden’s. The slum has a population density of around 354,167 people per sq km (it is spread across 2.4 sq km). On Wednesday, the number of cases of Covid-19 in the shanty town, which is also home to thousands of small businesses, and where almost all residents use communal toilets, touched 344(18 deaths). That should worry the local corporation and the Maharashtra government (see page 6).Anecdotally, across Indian cities such as Ahmedabad, Indore, Jaipur, Agra, Delhi, and Mumbai, clusters of infections have appeared in neighbourhoods that are crowded and congested, and which are, in most cases, not exactly the cleanest. The link between hygiene and health was always known, but many people chose not to act on it. The Covid-19 pandemic will no longer give them that choice — and the onus is as much on municipal corporation and city officials as it is on the residents of these boroughs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-uWRar73hAXk490HdznG49J.html
30-04-2020||India||IT min asks MHA to consider mobile goods as essentials||Responding to demands from the mobile manufacturing industry, the IT ministry has asked the home ministry to consider broadening the definition of essential goods to include information and communications technology (ICT) products. In a meeting with industry players, associations and chambers of the electronics goods market on Wednesday, Union minister of electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad said the ministry had taken note of the demand from mobile manufacturers and taken it up with the home affairs ministry. The mobile manufacturing industry, which is staring at losses of over Rs 20,000 crore asked that the definition of essential goods be broadened to include mobile and networking products, and allow their online and offline sales. Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of the Indian Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA) said that the industry has come to a standstill. “The industry is in deep trouble with production losses of ₹20,000 crore, and as all plants are closed, exports losses have mounted to Rs 2500 crore and 2.5 crore phones are lying dead or unrepaired,” Mohindroo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-min-asks-mha-to-consider-mobile-goods-as-essentials/story-xyU6TJPXaXuxutynVNHsjP.html

30-04-2020||India||One of Indian cinema’s greats takes his final bow||Irrfan, the virtuoso Bollywood actor who made a mark in Hollywood as well, died on Wednesday in the presence of his family in Mumbai, having added to his legacy until the final rounds of a hard-fought battle with cancer over two years.The 53-year-old actor was on Tuesday admitted to the intensive care unit at Mumbai’s Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital where he was under observation for colon infection. He had been battling cancer since 2018, when he was diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour.Irrfan had lost his mother on April 25 but could not be present for her funeral in Jaipur due to the nationwide lockdown. Filmmaker Shoojit Sircar was the first to tweet about Irrfan’s death. “My dear friend Irrfan. You fought and fought and fought. I will always be proud of you.. we shall meet again...” Sircar wrote.Irrfan’s family later issued an official statement, saying: “...A man of few words and an actor of silent expressions with his deep eyes and his memorable actions on screen. It’s saddening that this day, we have to bring forward the news of him passing away. Irrfan was a strong soul, someone who fought till the very end and always inspired everyone who came close to him...”Irrfan, who dropped the surname Khan in 2016, was buried at the Versova burial ground. He is survived by his wife, writer-producer and his NSD classmate, Sutapa Sikdar, and sons Babil and Ayan. In March 2018, Irrfan shared the news of being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer for which he underwent extensive treatment for a year in the UK. He returned to India in February 2019 and shot for Angrezi Medium, his last film. Released in March, the film bore the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic and was later re-released on an OTT platform.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Irrfan will be remembered for his versatile performances across different mediums. His demise is a loss to the world of cinema and theatre, Modi wrote on Twitter. Superstar Shah Rukh Khan called him a “friend...inspiration & the greatest actor of our times”.Born in Jaipur, Irrfan aspired to become a cricketer and was even selected for the CK Nayudu Tournament for emerging players under 23, but fate had something else in store, as the tournament was shelved, and in 1984, he joined the National School of Drama. Though Irrfan made his acting debut in 1988 with a small role in Mira Nair’s Salaam Bombay!, it took him more than a decade to be recognised as a commercially viable actor and secure his place in the Hindi film industry. In between, he worked in a number of TV soaps including Banegi Apni Baat, Chanakya, Chandrakanta, Shrikant, Bharat Ek Khoj and Darr.With a career spanning three decades, Irrfan is celebrated for Hindi films such as Haasil (2003), Maqbool (2003), Life in a... Metro (2007), Paan Singh Tomar (2012), Lunchbox (2013), Haider (2014), Piku (2015), Hindi Medium (2017), Blackmail (2018), among others.One of the most recognizable Indian faces in the West, Irrfan also worked in a bunch of British and American films including Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Life of Pi (2012), The Warrior (2001), A Mighty Heart (2007), The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), Jurassic World (2015) and Inferno (2016).Irrfan won the National Film Award for Paan Singh Tomar and, in 2011, was conferred the Padma Shri, India’s fourth highest civilian honour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-of-indian-cinema-s-greats-takes-his-final-bow/story-F11heE2sPTSN7NmKu5Cu1L.html
30-04-2020||India||BJP, Congress blame each other for protecting wilful defaulters||The government and the opposition Congress sparred over technicalities of dealing with India’s bad loan mess and economic offenders on Wednesday. Top leaders in the BJP camp contended that the central government did not waive loans of wilful defaulters, while the Congress stuck to its guns and alleged that the government’s handling of the issue benefited economic fugitives such as Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. Information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who has sought to corner the government over the issue, should take economics lessons from his party colleague and former finance minister P Chidambaram.“The Narendra Modi government has not waived off any loan (as alleged by the Congress). Write-off (what has been done) is a normal accounting process. It doesn’t stop recovery or action against defaults,” Javadekar said. According to a finance ministry official who did not want to be named, such write-offs are a “technical necessity to keep banks’ books in order”. “It should not be anyway construed that the government has waived these loans. In fact, legal actions have been initiated against all the wilful defaulters,” this person added. But veteran Congress leader Chidambaram wondered why the government wrote off loans of embattled businessmen Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya, who are fugitive economic offenders. “You can technically write off the loan…One is not denying that there is such a rule…But why do you apply that rule to wilful defaulters who have fled India…that is the question,” he told reporters.Chidambaram said he asked the government in Parliament to divide non-performing assets, or NPAs, based on three periods — given before 2004 in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, between 2004 and 2014 (in the Congress rule) and after 2014 (in the present government). He said he did not get any answer.The controversy erupted on Tuesday after the Congress party alleged that the Centre waived loans worth ~68,607 crore of 50 top defaulters, including Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya. Citing a right to information (RTI) reply from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Congress said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in power waived loans worth ~6.66 lakh crore after coming to power in 2014 till September last year.Explaining the difference between writing off and waiving a loan, Pavan Kumar Vijay, the founder of legal and corporate advisory firm Corporate Professionals Group, said: “Waiving is like a loan amnesty where a borrower has no liability against the loan. Write-off is an accounting procedure in case of a bad loan where a lender (bank) takes a hit only in its book but the liability of the borrower continues.” A loan account is declared NPA if a borrower is unable to service the loan for over 90 days, Vijay said. “In that case, the lender has to make a provision in its book for accounting purpose as per RBI IRAC (Income Recognition and Asset Classification) Guidelines. As per RBI, in case of insolvency the minimum write-off is 50%. But, the liability of borrower or the defaulter continues in full,” he said.Defending her government, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman took to Twitter late on Tuesday, detailing the action taken against Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya. She too argued that no loan was waived. Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi are facing legal action for a ~13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud. Vijay Mallya, who is facing extradition proceedings in London, defaulted on loans worth ~9,000 crore and fled India in March 2016. Modi is too is facing extradition proceedings in London. Sitharaman said the government attached or seized properties worth ~18,332.70 crore in cases involving the three fugitive economic offenders. The government is pursuing wilful defaulters, and has filed 9,967 recovery suits and 3,515 first-information reports (FIRs) against such offenders, she added in a series of tweets.Sitharaman said the Congress “attempted to mislead people in a brazen manner”, adding that it’s typical of the party that resorts “to sensationalising facts by taking them out of context”.“@INCIndia and Shri. @RahulGandhi should introspect why they fail to play a constructive role in cleaning up the system. Neither while in power, nor while in the opposition has the @INCIndia shown any commitment or inclination to stop corruption & cronyism,” Sitharaman said.She said commercial banks wrote off ~145,226 crore between 2009-10 and 2013-14, when the Congress-ruled United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power. “Wished Shri. @RahulGandhi consulted Dr. Manmohan Singh (who was then the prime minister) on what this writing-off was about,” she said.Referring to media reports and quoting former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, she said a large number of bad loans originated in the 2006-2008 period in the Congress rule, and “too many loans were made to well-connected promoters who have a history of defaulting on their loans...”Her response triggered a series of tweets by Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala. He asked whether the RTI reply from RBI to activist Saket Gokhale stated the facts, and questioned why the government was writing off “bank loans of absconders and frauds”.“And @nsitharaman ji, Cleaning the Banks of people’s money by writing off loans of absconders & fraudsters is not called ‘cleaning the system’. ... It’s called weakening the entire Bank architecture fiscally & imprudently, if not maliciously,” Surjewala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-blame-each-other-for-protecting-wilful-defaulters/story-pJsA06m4KLEQTSrCEhxQGJ.html
30-04-2020||India||Considerable easing next week, says govt||Even as it indicated that restrictions will be eased in many districts, after May 3, when the extended national lockdown is scheduled to end, the Union government, on Wednesday, issued guidelines to enable the return of migrants to their home states by buses — a move welcomed by many states. Both suggest that the Centre is now looking at relaxing the lockdown, in a phased manner. In a tweet late on Wednesday night, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) said, “New guidelines to fight #COVID19 will come into effect from 4th May, which shall give considerable relaxations to many districts. Details regarding this shall be communicated in the days to come.” A person familiar with the development said that the ministry had a comprehensive meeting on the lockdown, assessed that there had been “tremendous gains” due to the lockdown so far, full strictness shall be observed till May 3; and that there will be new guidelines with relaxations which will he communicated soon. While no specifics were offered, in the backdrop of statements that the government is focusing on resuming normal economic activity in green zones — which are currently unaffected by the coronavirus disease — it is likely that restriction will be eased in these regions. The centre’s announcement — the first such official indication of what to expect after May 3 — came hours after the government relaxed the norms for migrant movement. The decision on migrants came on the 36th day of the national lockdown, amid hundreds of thousands of migrant workers stranded away from their home or returning home on foot, and demands by states seeking policy clarity. The MHA, in an order, said that migrant workers, students, tourists, pilgrims and other persons stranded in other states, should be allowed to move, and issued a protocol on how this should be done. All states, the order said, should appoint nodal authorities who should register stranded individuals in their states. The sending and receiving states should then consult and agree with each other about “movement by road”. Those who wished to travel had to undergo screening, and only those who were asymptomatic could proceed. The order said that buses shall be used for enabling movement — and these should be sanitised and social distancing maintained in their seating arrangements. The states and union territories on the way shall allow the movement of such buses. On Wednesday, Hindustan Times reported that Uttar Pradesh was planning to embark on an exercise to transport a million of its residents, all migrant workers, stuck outside the state back. Emphasising the protocol to be followed once the stranded individuals get home, the order said, “On arrival at their destination, such person(s) would be assessed by the local health authorities, and kept in home quarantine, unless the assessment requires the person(s) to be kept in institutional quarantine.” The order stipulated periodic health check ups, and encouraging all such individuals to download the Aarogya Setu app. The move comes just days after chief ministers in a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the plight of migrant workers and difficulties they were facing. This was also a concern voiced by state chief secretaries in a meeting with the cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, over the weekend. Close to five million workers would have to be brought back to their respective states, as per the data collected by the state governments till Tuesday afternoon. There have been reports of thousands of migrants walking hundreds of kilometres to get home; in other instances, there have also been reports of disquiet and anger building up among migrant workers, and even spilling over on to the streets, as happened in Surat, where workers clashed with security personnel. An official involved in the discussions in framing the guidelines pointed out that such a federal framework was necessary to ensure smooth transit through different states and setting a standard protocol for such operations. The guideline will be useful for states that were grappling to find ways to bring back its workers or students stranded outside. Some states had, in consultation with each other, began the process of getting back their residents — while others, such as Bihar, had wanted the Centre to frame guidelines. Officials also pointed out that while the Centre had imposed a federal ban citing provisions under The Disaster Management Act (NDMA), 2005, the same law also stipulates Centre’s role in “evacuation, rescue, temporary shelter or other immediate relief”— the one which has been used to erect temporary shelters across the states for migrant workers. According to a second official, the government also looked into a 1979 law, the inter-state migrant workmen act, while trying to find solutions to the migrant worker crisis. The law also gives the Centre sweeping powers to give directions to the states.Commenting on the fresh guidelines for migrants, Yamini Aiyar, president and chief executive of the Centre for Policy Research, said, “The MHA guidelines to facilitate inter-state travel for migrant labour to go home, if they choose to do so, is significant step in the direction of restoring the rights and dignity of hundreds of thousands of Indians who have suffered deeply since the lockdown was imposed.” The next crucial measure, Aiyar said, that needed to be implemented “on a war footing” was the universalisation of food distribution and building a portable social security architecture. “This will ensure that the crisis India has witnessed this last month is never repeated.”The move was welcomed by the states. Bihar’s chief minister Nitish Kumar said that the decision of the Centre was in keeping with state’s request. “The Centre has taken a positive decision on our request. This will help a great deal in bringing back the interested migrant population stranded in different states. Following the Centre’s guidelines is in the interest of everyone. Bihar government has always followed the directions issued under the disaster management act,” he added. Others also pointed to the challenge involved in the exercise. Jharkhand chief secretary Sukhdev Singh said it would be a huge task as over 900,000 people, including workers and students, from the state were stranded and willing to come back. “I have seen the notification. It’s big number. We need to deliberate on their safe transit and post-transit measures as per covid-19 protocols,” he said.Earlier in the day, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren spoke to railway minister Piyush Goyal requesting him to provide train service to bring back students and migrant workers stuck in other states. But the Centre’s guidelines have clearly specified that movement has to happen through road, using buses, and thus has ruled out the possibility of resumption of immediate rail services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/considerable-easing-next-week-says-govt/story-VoiwbtleylpCfk4wp3lcpL.html
30-04-2020||India||SC says minority colleges not exempt from NEET||The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that colleges run by religious minorities will not be exempt from the common National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admissions to graduate and postgraduate medical and dental courses across India.Institutions like Vellore’s Christian Medical College (CMC) have been at the forefront of efforts to ensure their right to hold separate entrance examinations. The college cited Constitution’s Articles 25, 26, which relate to the freedom of religion, and the specific right of religious minorities to administer their educational institutions under Article 30 to seek an exemption from NEET.A host of private educational institutions and deemed universities joined the CMC in challenging the NEET, saying it violated their rights under Article 19(1)(g) that relates to the practice of any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. “Minorities are as much part of the nation as the majority, and anything that impinges upon national interest must necessarily in its ultimate operation affect the interests of all,” a bench of Justices Arun Mishra, Vineet Saran and MR Shah said in a unanimous 108-page order against the exemption. The court noted Parliament introduced the NEET to eradicate corruption in medical admissions, whose victims were meritorious students.The Supreme Court upheld the NEET in 2016 and the only question left for consideration was whether the common test infringed upon the minority rights. It accepted the right of religious minorities to govern their institutions but made it subject to the larger public interest to promote merit, achieve excellence, and curb malpractice prevailing in the admission process including the sale of seats. Several Constitutional decisions have laid down strict protection for minority institutions. The bench cited a 2016 Constitution bench ruling in Modern Dental College case in which the top court said that minority rights must give way to the larger public interest of students. Moreover, if an exception is made, there will be no end to such claims for holding multiple examinations, the bench said.The NEET came into force within a month after the Supreme Court upheld it in April 2016. By way of amendment, it was incorporated as Section 10D in the Indian Medical Council Act and Dental Council Act.The court ruled that rights available to minority institutions under Article 30 and that of private colleges under Article 19(1)(g) will not be impacted by imposing NEET as the uniform test is intended for the proper functioning of institutions and to ensure the maintenance of high standards of education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-says-minority-colleges-not-exempt-from-neet/story-3cELZCkNByCQq56gfsE8YO.html
30-04-2020||India||Scrap Dibang Valley project: Activists||Nature conservationists on Wednesday petitioned the environment ministry to reject the 3,097 megawatt Etalin hydropower project in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley that will entail the diversion of luxuriant forest land, felling of tens of thousands of trees and pose a threat to the region’s rich biodiversity.Conservation India, a non-profit website on wildlife and nature conservation, sent a memorandum with 4,305 signatures to the ministry, asking it to deny environmental clearance for the project. The signatures were received only in the past three days, the portal said.Wildlife biologists and scientists including Nandini Velho; Umesh Sreenivasan, assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; Aparajita Datta, senior scientist at the Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF); Anindya Sinha, a professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies, and others wrote at least four letters last week to the ministry’s forest advisory committee (FAC) flagging massive biodiversity loss if large hydropower projects were allowed to go ahead in Dibang Valley.FAC has considered granting forest clearance to the Etalin hydropower project at a meeting last Thursday; the minutes of the meeting are yet to be released. The project will involve diversion of 1,150.08 ha of forest land and clearing of .270,000 trees in subtropical, evergreen and broad-leaved rainforests.Dibang Valley is home to a genetically distinct population of tigers, over 75 species of other mammals, and 300+ species of birds, including many endangered ones, Conservation India said in its memorandum. The valley is part of the Eastern Himalayan Global Biodiversity Hotspot, which is one of only 36 such hotspots in the world. In addition to tigers, the greater region of Dibang Valley harbours mammals including the clouded leopard, Asiatic golden cat, Asiatic wild dog, red panda, Mishmi Takin, red goral, and Gongshan Muntjac.Rapid bird assessments in the region have found endangered species such as the Blyth’s tragopan, Sclater’s monal, rufous-necked hornbill, Ward’s trogon, Hodgson’s frogmouth, beautiful nuthatch, wedge-billed babbler and the recently discovered Mishmi wren-babbler. “There is consensus amongst scientists that the rise in zoonotic diseases (such as Covid 19) and acceleration of climate change is linked to biodiversity and forest destruction,” the memorandum said, adding that the proposal should be scrapped.According to FAC’s own factsheet, the project falls under the richest biogeographical province of the Himalayan zone and one of the mega biodiversity hotspots of the world. The proposed project location falls at the junction of the Paleoarctic, Indo-Chinese, and Indo-Malayan biogeographic regions with luxuriant forests and rich flora and fauna. It is also a “vital tiger area.”“We have received some letters and memorandums from people but we don’t know if they are from scientists. They are all in the same format and have similar wording. Some have names signed, others don’t,” said a senior environment ministry official and FAC member. “To be absolutely sure about the project we have asked for some information from agencies on the area. The minutes of the FAC meeting will be out soon. We haven’t taken a decision on the project yet.”HT reported on April 23 that an FAC subcommittee, which visited the site in February, had recommended in its report dated April 21 that the Etalin project be allowed on condition that the developer deposits money for wildlife conservation in the area.The project is proposed to be developed by Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture of Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited and Jindal Power Limited (JPL). The total cost of the project is about Rs 25,296.95 crore, according to the factsheet.“We have been eagerly waiting for this clearance which is a must for grant of forest clearance for the project. The proposal for grant of forest clearance to Etalin project was submitted to environment ministry in 2014. The proposal has since been discussed in FAC a couple of times. In the FAC meeting scheduled to be held on April 23, the report and recommendations of sub-committee of FAC will be discussed for final recommendations on grant of FC to the project. We are hopeful that FAC will finally be recommending the proposal for grant of FC,” Bharat Rohra, MD & CEO, Jindal Power Limited, said on April 22 in response to queries from HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scrap-dibang-valley-project-activists/story-TErkLQh6zvHJgFW3rWdhdO.html
30-04-2020||India||His nomination stuck with Guv, Thackeray sends a distress message to PM||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday called Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss his nomination to the state legislative council which has been hanging fire, people aware of the development said.Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari is yet to take a call on the state cabinet’s recommendation to nominate Thackeray to the legislative council.According to a person familiar with the development who requested anonymity, the Shiv Sena chief, in his conversation with Modi, referred to a possible constitutional crisis should the governor not accept the recommendation.Thackeray urged the Prime Minister to intervene in the matter, noting that the country is battling the deadly Covid-19 pandemic and that Maharashtra is the state with the most number of positive cases of the disease.A Shiv Sena leader said on the condition of anonymity that Thackeray apprised the Prime Minister of attempts allegedly being made to create political instability in Maharashtra through non-acceptance of the state cabinet’s recommendation that he be nominated to the legislative council.Because Thackeray is not a member of the legislative council or the legislative assembly, the Maharashtra cabinet had recommended to Koshyari that he be nominated to one of the two vacant seats in the state’s upper house under the governor’s quota.The law demands that a chief minister or a minister who is not a member of either of the two houses be elected within six months of being sworn in. Thackeray took the oath as the chief minister in November soon after his Shiv Sena broke away from the Bharatiya Janata Party and forrmed a post-poll alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress.The Shiv Sena and the BJP fell out because of differences over power sharing.Commenting on the development, a senior BJP functionary said the governor had taken time to seek legal counsel on the recommendation.“Section 151A of Representation of the People Act 1951 lists the rules for the governor’s discretionary power to nominate a person to the legislative council. Legally, election or nomination to vacant seats in the legislative council cannot be done if the remainder of the term of a member in relation to a vacancy is less than one year,” he said.The BJP functionary, who requested anonymity, declined to comment on Thackeray’s phone call to Prime Minister Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thackeray-calls-pm-seeking-intervention-into-mlc-nomination/story-VdJvuHjyNeJMPZYuDUwe9H.html
30-04-2020||India||MP count crosses 2,500, experts ask state govt to make testing data public||The number of Covid-19 cases in Madhya Pradesh has gone up to 2,560 as 173 patients more people have been diagnosed with the disease since Tuesday even as the government has stopped giving information on testing for three days. The state has so far reported 130 Covid-19 related fatalities.According to the state’s Covid-19 bulletin on Wednesday, 104 fresh cases were reported from Indore alone that has taken the city’s infection tally to 1,476. Indore has reported a bulk of the Madhya Pradesh’s Covid-19 deaths--65.Bhopal has reported 483 Covid-19 cases. The 14 people who have died of the disease in the city include at least 13 survivors of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy, said Rachna Dhingra of the Sambhavna Trust. “The state and the central governments should immediately act to protect the lives of the tragedy survivors.”In a joint statement, public health experts Amulya Nidhi and SR Azad sought a comprehensive bulletin daily citing the government’s move to withhold the testing data since April 27. “Till April 26, there were 8,439 pending test results. A lot of patients have been waiting for a number of days for their test results. But now, as there is no data being given on pending test results and availability of test kits, there is no transparency around the testing...”The statement said the death rate in Madhya Pradesh is the highest in the country. “The India death rate is 3.21%, whereas the fatality rate in Madhya Pradesh is more than 5%. The death rate has been stagnant at around 5% for the last two weeks. The death rate in Delhi is 1.62%, Maharashtra 4.29%, Gujarat 4.79%, and in Rajasthan 2.11%.”Additional chief secretary (health) Muhammad Suleman could not be reached for his comments.An official, who did not wish to be named, said health minister Narottam Mishra has said there would be a jump in the number of cases once or twice before the situation improves. He said the government is not hiding the data but getting information gradually from the districts. “Hence it is difficult to give a clear picture as to how many samples have been collected across the state.”Madhya Pradesh has drawn flak for its handling of the pandemic and is among the states, where the Centre has deputed interministerial teams to probe perceived lapses in efforts to control the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-count-crosses-2-500-experts-ask-state-govt-to-make-testing-data-public/story-vqZdZTiMLiWMlb4LAIdTPL.html
30-04-2020||India||Access to internet not a fundamental right: J-K||Right to access the internet is not a fundamental right and the degree of access for exercising free speech or for carrying on any trade or business can be curtailed, the administration of Jammu and Kashmir said in the Supreme Court on Wednesday.The submission by the newly created Union territory came in an affidavit it filed in a case seeking restoration of 4G mobile internet services in Jammu & Kashmir.High-speed Internet as been suspended even after the easing of restrictions, including a communication blockades, imposed after erstwhile state was divested of its special status with the revocation of Article 370 of the constitution in August last year. Simultaneously in August, the Centre pushed through provisions reorganising the state into two UTs -- J&K and Ladakh --- with effect from October 31. .Protection of the sovereignty and integrity of India and ensuring security of the country are sound grounds to reduce the speed of the internet, the affidavit said.“The right to access the internet is not a fundamental right and thus the type and breadth of access for exercising the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) and/or to carry on any trade or business under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India (CoI) through the medium of internet can be curtailed”, it stated.The centre’s affidavit was in response to a plea by a not-for-profit organisation, Foundation for Media Professionals, which said the lack of high-speed mobile internet was causing difficulties during the Covid-19 outbreak with patients, doctors, and the public in general remaining in the dark about the latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions related to the pandemic.The petitioner challenged the order issued by the J&K administration on March 26 restricting the internet speed in mobile data to 2G and prayed that 4G internet services be restored in the Union territory.“Various public health practitioners, medical professionals, and doctors have repeatedly expressed their concern about wasting precious time trying to download the latest studies, protocols, manuals and advisories on treatment and management of COVID 19. In some cases, doctors are not able to access these resources at all, due to the internet speed being too slow to download heavy files”, the petition stated.The J&K administration claimed that the submission was misconceived because most of the information relating to Covid-19 can be accessed through fixed line high-speed internet which is available in the Union territory without any speed restrictions.“The information regarding COVID-19 is also available on various social media platforms which can be easily accessed on low speed 2G internet. Various Government websites like website of WHO, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, etc. associated with timely information flow in the form of awareness/advisories/orders can also be easily accessed at Low Speed internet”, the affidavit said.The Supreme Court in a judgment passed on January 10, had held that access to information and the freedom of trade and commerce via the internet are fundamental rights under the Constitution of India. It had, therefore, ordered the central government and J&K administration to periodically review the orders restricting Internet services in J&KJ&K, in its affidavi,t told the court that after the January 10 judgment by the apex court, various orders were passed by the administration gradually lifting restrictions in J&K. Mobile phone services - initially post-paid and thereafter pre-paid – were restored and restrictions on internet access were progressively lifted.The affidavit said a decision as to whether controlled access to the internet is still warranted depends on an assessment of the ground situation.“..post August 2019 constitutional developments, Pakistan handlers, either directly or indirectly, have increased activity on Social media intending to and aiming at disturbance of peace in the region , inciting violence and abetting terror activities”, the document claimed.Increase in internet speed, the centre submitted, will lead to swift uploading and posting of provocative videos and other heavy data files.“High speed internet services (4G) decrease the time of circulation of various photographs, videos, propaganda audios and hence enable the associated content to go viral, with the reaction time of law enforcement agencies to such situations decreasing”, the affidavit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/access-to-internet-not-a-fundamental-right-j-k/story-BdQq5e5PGmeQsxb5lFWXAN.html
30-04-2020||India||Digital platforms cornering ad revenue from news, govt told||Unfair commercial terms of tech platforms such as Google and Facebook have resulted in these giants cornering 85 % of digital advertising while Indian media companies, whose journalists continue to report fearlessly even in the most challenging circumstances (during the current pandemic), are at the receiving end, the Indian Newspaper Society (INS) has told the Information and Broadcasting (I&B) ministry.The body and a grouping of radio operators have separately written to the government highlighting the financial crisis their members are facing and sought a support package.In a letter to I&B secretary Amit Khare, INS president Shailesh Gupta has sought the creation of a level playing field for the Indian media organizations vis-a-vis foreign platforms operating beyond the law. If corrective action is not taken, there could be closure of many regional or even national titles, he added.In his letter, Gupta said the operational costs of Indian media organizations were increasing year on year. “More than 85% of the digital advertising of Rs. 15,000 crore last year went to these tech giants, leaving almost nothing for Indian media companies. Indian media companies have been raising this unfortunate situation for years. There is also no transparency regarding advertising rates and the commission from these companies,” Gupta said.The letter reflects growing concern in many parts of the world around how these platforms operate. Last week, after the tech platforms and media companies could not arrive at an agreement on the payment to news media companies from advertising placed around content generated by them but used on these platforms, the Australian government asked the country’s competition watchdog to come up with a solution to how this can be done. In France, the competition watchdog has asked Google to hold talks with news media to arrive at a similar arrangement. In his letter, Gupta mentioned that the Indian media is going through troubled times because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown.“As an essential service, we continue to work overtime during this lockdown to bring the latest news and information pertaining to the pandemic. We are also battling the fake news virus that is prevalent on social media,” Gupta said. His reference is to unsubstantiated and sometimes inflammatory content that sometimes finds its way onto such platforms , which do not have the same responsibility or liability as media firms for the content they showcase. Indian media companies report and produce the news and these tech giants walk away with all the revenue, the INS letter said.Google and Facebook were not immediately available for comments.Gupta’s letter listed several issues which the INS has been raising: tax status of tech platforms, jurisdiction of Indian laws over them, fake news, search results hurting quality journalism and lack of copyright recognition for use of content.Meanwhile, the Association of Radio Operators of India (AROI), has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterating the need for support. The body previously wrote to I&B minister Prakash Javadekar seeking waiver of a year on all licence fee and government charges; the restoration of government advertising on radio; clearance of past government dues; and the deferment of advance payments for 2020-21. AROI said that the I&B ministry had responded to the request with a three-month extension of license fee payments without interest. While this will reduce the pressures on the industry to some extent, the support is much less than what was requested, it said in its letter. The radio operators’ body appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consider its demand for a support package for the industry that directly and indirectly employs over 20,000 people. It has requested the Prime Minister’s Office to consider the four points it made in its original letter to the I&B minister. Being a free to air medium, radio again becomes critical for reaching out to the masses regarding government and policy announcements, AROI said adding that the prime minister himself had effectively used the medium.Looking at the current situation, Government support is critical to help radio companies survive the on-going emergency in the short term, till the economy stabilises itself, AROI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-platforms-cornering-ad-revenue-from-news-govt-told/story-BR4ZdosVU2E5TEtDmaMFOK.html
30-04-2020||India||Centre tells its employees to download Aarogya Setu app||The central government has ordered all of its departments to ensure their staff install the Aarogya Setu mobile application and attend offices only if they have been classified as “safe” or “low risk” according to it, according to an order issued on Wednesday.The measure comes ahead of what may be a phased return-to-work period over the next month when the nationwide lockdown meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is relaxed in some places. According to the order, all officers and staff, including outsourced resources, must install the application. “Before starting for office, they should review their status on Aarogya Setu and commute only when the app shows ‘safe’ or ‘low risk’ status,” the order says.The order, issued by the Department of Personnel and Training, instructed joint secretaries (administration) across departments to ensure the directions are strictly followed. The Aarogya Setu detects others mobile devices running the programme in its proximity, creating a digital trail of close contact between people that, officials say, can speed up the identification and isolation of people who may have been exposed to Covid-19. The application is similar to what has been rolled out in several countries, such as Singapore. It uses the Bluetooth module in modern-day smartphones to transmit its presence to, as well as record that of others, running the Aarogya Setu programme in close proximity. According to its developers, it creates a risk profile of users by querying the list of devices they came close to against a centralised database of Covid-19 infected persons. Those regarded high risk are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days.The application, downloaded by roughly 80 million Indians, has triggered criticism from privacy experts who say that there is no transparency in how the sensitive personal data collected by the app – address book details and location history – will be used. “There are many problems with the app,” said Apar Gupta, a lawyer at the Internet Freedom Foundation. “There is a privacy concern, and a cyber security one. All the information is stored on a backend server. There may be a possible security threat. People who are working with the government, their movements will be tracked at all times. The only form of restraint is the privacy policy which may be changed anytime,” Gupta said. Independent security researcher Srinivas Kodali said that the app collects “information but doesn’t not provide essential information.” “The app has security features, yes,” Kodali said. “It is an experiment with a good aim that may fall flat. The question remains how is data used and who has access to the data collected. The essential problem is a trust deficit when it comes to the government. It is a surveillance app.” Kodali added that the app isn’t very useful unless a majority of the people download it.According to Arnab Kumar, program director and a member of the Aarogya Setu core team, “the benefit of the app lies in its ability to automatically contact trace”. The app collects the name, phone number, sex, and travel history of the person over the last 30 days. According to officials in government think tank NITI Aayog, the data is stored for around 45 days after which it is deleted if a person is not at risk.“Security and privacy concerns have been paramount while designing the app,” Kumar said. “Each phone number is assigned a unique id and once someone is found Covid-19 positive, the app traces other unique ids the person has come in contact with. Using Bluetooth technology we can determine the time and distance the persons maintained and thus, warn others who may be at risk.” Kumar added that the data is stored with the government and accessible to only those who are directly involved in battling the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-tells-its-employees-to-download-aarogya-setu-app/story-RugfI9ofUzcDKyrGX71pTN.html
30-04-2020||India||Bringing food, dignity to a Bengal village||Each night of the past two weeks of the lockdown, 36-year-old Shyamal Maji has been making frequent trips to the villages and outskirts of Santiniketan and Bolpur town in Bengal’s Birbhum district.His trips were meant to be a secret: he would carry food packets and other essential items like soap and masks, and leave them outside the doors of the huts and shanties of poor residents.“These people are mainly wage labourers, who have lost their livelihoods. They still go out during the day with the hope of earning a living. But at night they return home. I don’t want to earn fame and want to remain behind the wings. I just want to help these poor people. Third, not all of these people would stand in a queue as some feel ashamed to take help. They would rather go hungry,” said Maji.Maji has been running a coaching centre in Bolpur since 2006; each year, his institute receives almost 250 higher secondary and undergraduate students, who receive tuitions on everything from Bengali language to history and political science. It was this network that Maji turned to, in order to get both supplies and help in distributing them. By the middle of the month, Maji formed a team comprising 10 students, who would help distribute rations. “My students, who are scattered everywhere, helped identify the neediest persons in their respective areas. Help pours in from the students itself. Some are employed, and a few come from well-to-families. All of them donate generously. Many chip in with whatever they can, even packets of puffed rice,” Maji said. Till date they have been able to distribute around 250 kilos of rice and 50 litres of cooking oil, he added.Puffed rice is an important ingredient of a popular Bengali dish called, jhal muri, made with vegetables, spices and mustard oil.Each packet that Maji and his students left at doorsteps contained two kilos of rice, potatoes, a few vegetables, cooking oil, salt, puffed rice and a soap. Since the donations are made daily, the distribution team aims to reach at least 10 houses every day. As the police have stopped issuing travel passes, the team tries to arrange for as many two-wheelers as possible, as only one person can ride one vehicle. During the day, they plan out the areas they will cover at night.“Sometimes I see people clicking photos while providing relief to poor people. They will provide one kilo of rice to a poor needy man and 15 people will gather to take a photo. Is that what you are providing the relief for?” he asked. Maji added that without his wife’s support — she helps him pack the kits, for instance — he would not have been able to do this each night. The duo has a four-year-old daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bringing-food-dignity-to-a-bengal-village/story-ltzEVgWie8igFPuyhtOAYJ.html
30-04-2020||India||New govt app for labs to report test data quicker||With discrepancies in reporting of sample testing data found from certain labs, the Union health ministry on Wednesday launched a dedicated real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) mobile based application, for labs to fill the data at the point of sample collection.“It is an app for collection centres to fill data at the point of sample collection, to minimise error in reporting real time data to the government authorities. It was seen that the data was being duplicated as it was sent separately to various authorities involved, such as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and the state government. Now just one time entry will help reach the information everywhere, which will also save the time and reduce other errors such as address, name, and so on,” said a health ministry spokesperson.This application is linked to the main data base operated by the health ministry that will automatically keep updating it.The director general of ICMR, Dr Balram Bhargava, who is responsible for overseeing Covid-19 testing, said, “The app has been made functional and needs to be put to use immediately.”So far, a total of 7695 people have been cured, which takes India’s current total recovery rate to 24.5%. The total number of confirmed cases now stands at 31,332.In the past three days, the doubling rate has been 11.3 days in the country. “…although global mortality rate is around 7%, India is having a mortality rate of around 3%, and around 86% of the fatalities are of persons with co-morbidity. Only 0.33% patients are on ventilators, 1.5% patients are on oxygen support and 2.34% patients are in ICU, which reflects the quality of care being provided across the country. In case of any further eventuality, the country is well equipped with isolation beds, ventilators, PPE [Personal Protective Equipment], and masks,” said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.A present, 288 government laboratories are working along with 97 private laboratory chains, with around 16,000 sample collection centres, and testing around 60,000 samples per day. The government is working to increase the testing capacity to 1 lakh tests per day within next few days.The health secretary, Preeti Sudan, held a review meeting with states through video conferencing on Wednesday, and discussed the functioning of the systems dashboard, Covid-19 portal, apart from releasing the RT-PCR application.The health secretary again directed to states that medical treatment to non-Covid-19 patients should not be denied, and essential care, such as dialysis, cancer treatment, diabetic care, anti-natal care for pregnant women and those suffering from cardiac ailments and other chronic conditions, must continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-govt-app-for-labs-to-report-test-data-quicker/story-5j7ZLU6MteBiFYcfUFrpkO.html
30-04-2020||India||Strong link between coronavirus count, bad air: Study||A University of Verona and Stanford School of Medicine study has found a statistical correlation between highly-polluted areas and Covid-19 infections in Italy, which is among the worst-hit countries by the pandemic. The study, which is yet to be published, has concluded that cities and provinces, where coarse particulate matter (PM 10) exceeded standards for over hundred days a year, were found to be associated with a three-fold higher risk of the disease.The analysis is limited to Italy and does not mention how air pollution and testing positive for Covid-19 are linked. Air pollution in Indian cities is among the worst in the world; capital New Delhi regularly tops the listing of cities with the worst air. Such studies may give researchers and governments an idea about what to look for, but independent scientists underlined that their conclusions cannot be generalised. This is the second study from Italy, which has linked air pollution with Covid-19. Air pollution is likely to be a major risk factor for the lethality of Covid 19, scientists from Italy had concluded in a paper that probed whether atmospheric pollution can be considered a co-factor in the extremely high level of SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, lethality in Northern Italy. The paper was published in Elsevier’s journal of Environmental Pollution on April 4. Prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory response even among the young and healthy, which makes people living in polluted areas more susceptible to developing complications. The lethality was 12% in Italy’s Lombardy and Emilia Romagna compared to 4.5% in the rest of the country, the study found.In the latest study, scientists collected air pollution data in Italy from 2019 and the number of Covid-19 cases per province till April 5. The extent of pollution within each specific Italian province was expressed in terms of days per year during which PM 10 or Ozone exceeded their safe levels. “Since several lines of evidence also attest that Lombardy region has an extraordinarily high level of environmental pollution, we aimed to explore the potential epidemiological association between the number of cases of Covid-19 and environmental pollution in Italy…the association remained statistically significant even when the number of days above pollutant limits was correlated with the number of Covid-19 cases per 1000 inhabitants,” said the latest paper published in Medrxiv, a pre-print server for health sciences on April 27.Kalpana Balakrishnan, the director of ICMR Centre for Advanced Research on Air Quality, Sri Ramachandra Institute for Higher Education and Research, cautioned against merely looking for a correlation without adjusting for anything, saying it is not helpful. “The paper does not provide a basis for their analysis,” said Balakrishnan. “I note that this paper is not yet peer-reviewed, and is only available as a preprint.”People with underlying respiratory conditions are more vulnerable to Covid-19 and people in areas with higher air pollution areas are more likely to be affected.Pallavi Pant, a staff scientist at Boston’s Health Effects Institute, said during the earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome episode in the early 2000s, studies had pointed towards such a relationship. “Ideally, we would like to see multiple studies showing these results for the scientific process to work.” Pant has been compiling peer-reviewed and pre-print studies on the link between air pollution and Covid-19. Among the peer-reviewed studies, one in Germany based on spatial analysis of nitrogen dioxide pollution on a regional scale and combined with the number of death cases taken from 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany, also found a relationship between pollution and Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strong-link-between-covid-count-bad-air/story-ja0dF98Pt1nJHsiQ7wBdcM.html
30-04-2020||India||Bengal man dies day after Covid-19 negative result||A 70-year-old man died of Covid-19 on Tuesday, a day after he was readmitted to a hospital in West Bengal when it as found that he had been discharged on Sunday after having wrongly been declared to have tested negative for the infection, his son said on Wednesday. The son said the gross negligence has endangered their family, including a seven-month-old child, as they spent time with him after he was discharged from Kolkata’s designated Covid-19 M R Bangur Hospital.A health department official, who did not want to be named, said all members of the family would now be tested for coronavirus. “It was a human error. The report came positive but got wrongly listed as negative,” said a doctor at the hospital, who did not want to be identified.West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, state health services director Ajay Chakraborty and health secretary Vivek Kumar did not respond to questions about the alleged negligence and whether an inquiry had been initiated.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday admitted to “minor clerical mistakes” and added they should not be highlighted. She did not mention the Bangur Hospital or the alleged negligence. The son said his father was admitted to the hospital on April 22 as he complained of dry cough. “On April 25, I received a call from the hospital at night, saying my father has tested negative and would be released. He was discharged on the morning of April 26 and the discharge certificate had ‘Covid-19 negative’ written on it. However, that very night, hospital authorities telephoned me again, this time to say that there had been a mistake and he was actually [Covid-19] positive. They asked me to bring him back to the hospital,” said the son.The man was readmitted to the hospital on April 27 and died the next day.“Who is responsible for this mistake? They killed my father. Also, what if my children now test positive? My father spent time with them after coming back home. My mother is 63. They are all vulnerable,” said the son.Banerjee said there could be some errors and must be forgiven for the time being. “People are not making mistakes deliberately. This is a new task and a new initiative. Some minor mistakes may happen,” she said without naming the hospital or the patient. “How can you expect that each and every health worker will be totally trained in this short span of time? They can also make mistakes. They can make errors in what they write. There can be a minor error in a notice; a printing mistake. Some are trying to malign the government... All these health workers need at this hour is some appreciation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-man-dies-day-after-negative-result/story-PkMmM06KZhxUY1IPgsXXRN.html
30-04-2020||India||Study finds fragments of virus in airborne droplets||Scientists in China have said they found genetic fragments of the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in airborne droplets in medical and staff areas during the outbreak in February and March in two Wuhan hospitals, but they stopped short of saying the disease is airborne.An important finding of the study was that ventilation and sterilisation brought down airborne genetic shards (RNA) of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, to undetectable levels and reduced the risk of airborne exposure.Small droplets expelled while breathing or talking can remain airborne and infect people who inhale them, said the study, but it could not determine whether the Sars-CoV-2 RNA were harmless or infectious. The study was published in the journal, Nature.“Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols,” concluded the study that did an aerodynamic analysis of Sars-CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals.“Viral RNA of positive strand is theoretically infectious but there are no known cases to my knowledge of RNA-mediated infection. Thus, practically, only intact virus/virion is infectious. Many of these studies that look at viral RNA should be interpreted with caution,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.“Viral RNA is not infective,” said Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva.Covid-19 spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks, according to WHO. These droplets are relatively heavy and quickly sink to the ground, but people can get infected if they inhale droplets from a sick person or touch contaminated objects and surfaces, then touch their eyes, nose or mouth, said the global health agency.Earlier this month, a high-level US scientific panel said that the virus that causes the disease is airborne and can spread through just breathing and talking, which makes its spread easier and sustainable. The scientists from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine said the virus can stay suspended in air in the ultrafine mist that is produced when people exhale.On March 17, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found the virus stayed suspended and infective in aerosol droplets that are below 5 microns across for up to three hours in lab conditions. The aerosolized virus had a median half-life of about 1.1-1.2 hours, similar to the related Sars-CoV, the coronavirus that causeD Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), the study found. The half-life indicates how long a virus can survive in different environments, regardless of how much virus happens to be present at the time of sampling. Infected people, who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms of fever, cough or fatigue, also spread the disease to others, with a study from China published in Nature Medicine on April 15 estimating that 44% of infections are spread by people who are not obviously ill.The study from China found that the concentration of Sars-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was elevated in the patients’ toilet areas, indicating that they need the same level of sanitisation as the intensive care units and isolation wards.“Levels of airborne Sars-CoV-2 RNA in the majority of public areas were undetectable except in two areas prone to crowding, possibly due to infected carriers in the crowd,” said the study, which also found high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions in some medical staff areas.The viral RNA, however, reduced substantially to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitisation procedures. “Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitisation of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of Sars-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols. Future work should explore the infectivity of aerosolized virus,” the study said.It recommended that for public health prevention and medical staff protection, hospitals must focus on ventilation and sterilisation of toilets as a potential spread source of the virus; personal protection measures for the general public, such as wearing masks and avoiding crowded placed to reduce the risk of airborne virus exposure; and the effective sanitisation of the high risk area in the hospital to limit the transmission of airborne Sars-CoV-2 and protect the medical staff.It highlighted that conversion of a naturally ventilated stadium into a field hospital for patient quarantine and treatment limited aerosol transmission of Sars-CoV-2; as did surface sanitisation of the personnel protection equipment before they are taken off, which reduced the potential infection risk of medical staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-finds-fragments-of-virus-in-airborne-droplets/story-n1gogl072H2khfCt1zo7AN.html
30-04-2020||India||Red Cross plans log of recovered patients||The Indian Red Cross Society is starting a dedicated database of people who have recovered from coronavirus disease (Covid-19) , and who can therefore be potential plasma donors for convalescent plasma therapy (use of blood from the recovered patients to treat severely sick patents) which can be done under the clinical trial mode. The therapy isn’t approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research as a regular line of treatment and the health ministry said on Tuesday that it can only be done as a trial, with requisite clearances from regulators. Still, the Indian Red Cross’ blood bank has already started receiving queries from relatives of Covid-19 patients looking for plasma from a recovered patient. The society plans to online counselling of short-listed recovered patients to encourage them to donate their plasma for the study.“In a day or two, the Red Cross of India will begin psychosocial counselling of shortlisted recovered Covid-19 patients to prepare them as plasma donors. Our job is to look through the pile of recovered patients, and screen those who could be potential plasma donors. Once shortlisted these people will be counselled by our experts,” says Dr Vanshree Singh, director (blood bank), Indian Red Cross Society.The society plans to speak to hospitals to get details of patients who recovered in past one month. After they get the list, it will be narrowed down further to those who will be eligible to donate, and the final list will be recommended to the government.“Ideally we will be looking at the recovery time of 28 days, but anything over 14 is good. Our regular blood donation criteria will apply along with the fact that they should have completely recovered from Covid-19. Eligible donors have to be between 18 and 50 years (of age), with no co-morbid conditions such as heart, kidney disease, diabetes etc. Even women can donate but not those with more than one children as their antibodies don’t work. Unmarried women who fulfil other criteria can also donate,” said Dr Singh.The Red Cross will forward the list of shortlisted possible donors to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi because the actual donation will only happen in a hospital setting.“These people need to be bled in the intensive care unit (ICU) settings because in a stand-alone blood bank one can’t provide the kind of medical support that these people might require. So, the blood donation has to be done in a hospital,” Dr Singh said. The Red Cross will be sharing the database only with approved government facilities.As convalescent plasma therapy has shown promise in helping very sick Covid-19 patients recover, various countries including India are conducting trials to know its true potential as a treatment .Hospitals and research facilities can enrol patients as part of a clinical trial after receiving necessary approvals from the drugs controller general of India.  Union health minister Harsh Vardhan last Tuesday held a video meeting with the Indian Red Cross Society and asked it to contact recovered patients and encourage them to donate blood . However, health ministry has made it clear that the treatment is to be conducted only as part of a trial with the requisite permissions.A section of experts say if the therapy has shown promise then clinical trials can be skipped to save time.“I have been arguing for plasma therapy without a clinical trial, as it is safe to give as compared to other medicines. However, it is critical to properly document the results,” says Dr T Jacob John, former head of virology department, CMC Vellore.Dr Dharma Choudhary, a senior specialist in bone marrow transplant in India isn’t so sure: “It is a crude way of giving immunoglobulin, which are virus specific antibodies, with a belief that it will probably give some protection. I’d say it will be better than giving a placebo to a dying patient with no hope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/red-cross-plans-log-of-recovered-patients/story-XWtD2N5RtHUYC0SlzXSCmL.html
30-04-2020||India||Nations that mandate TB vaccine may have lower Covid death rates||Countries that mandate the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine for newborns to prevent tuberculosis, including India, Peru, Portugal and Saudi Arabia, have fared 3.4 times better on the Covid-19 fatality rate (CFR) than nations that haven’t made the vaccine obligatory, like Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Ecuador, though the last two still appear to be benefitting from their past use of the vaccine. That’s the finding of a HT analysis of the current fatality rate (CFR) in the eight nations that had between 20,000 and 50,000 Covid-19 cases each on Wednesday morning.The analysis appears to support an yet-to-be peer-reviewed study conducted by a group of US researchers which found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, the Netherlands and the United States) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and longstanding BCG policies such as India and China. The study was published in the preprint health sciences server, medRxiv, on March 28 . Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageTo be sure, scientists have not been able to determine a clear correlation between the severity of the coronavirus disease and neonatal BCG vaccination. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that two clinical trials addressing the question of BCG offering protection against Covid-19 are underway.On average, 2.65% of people who have been infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus in the four nations that have mandatory BCG vaccination programmes have died, according to the study. In the four that do not prescribe mandatory neonatal BCG vaccination, an average of 9.19% of confirmed Covid-19 patients have died. This means that on average, a person is 3.4 times more likely to die if he or she gets infected by Sars-Cov-2 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Ecuador than in India, Peru, Portugal and Saudi Arabia, .Portugal,which reported 948 deaths from 24,322 cases, has the highest CFR (3.9%). India, with 1,007 deaths from 31,329 cases, has a CFR of 3.2%. Peru (31,190 cases and 854 deaths) has a CFR of 2.7% and Saudi Arabia has a CFR of 0.8% (20,077 cases and 157 deaths). (Chart 1)Ecuador and Switzerland had mass BCG vaccinations programmes until as late as the 1980s. This may be the reason why these two countries fare better than Belgium and Netherlands which have not had mass BCG immunisation in the recent past.Of the four counties that do not insist on mandatory BCG vaccination of newborns, Belgium has 47,334 cases and 7,331 deaths (CFR: 15.5%). The Netherlands has reported 38,416 cases with 4,566 deaths (CFR of 11.9%). Switzerland has a CFR of 5.8% with 29,264 cases and 1,699 deaths and Ecuador has a CFR of 3.6% with 24,258 cases and 871 deaths.The study by US researchers also found that the onset of the coronavirus disease had been abrupt in the non-BCG nations while cases of the disease emerged more gradually in countries with the mandatory vaccination programmes. (Chart 2)Experts, however, said that besides than BCG vaccinations other factors like age, comorbidity, social distancing and lockdowns may be influencing the outcome of Covid-19 cases.“Developing countries may have BCG vaccinations but they also have a younger population. If say 30% of the population is above the age of 60%, then you may expect higher mortality. So, you may think that it is BCG vaccination that is causing the lower death rate, but it just may be the age or the fact that younger people have fewer comorbid conditions. We can’t know for sure just yet,” said T Jacob John, former head of the Indian Council for Medical Research’s Centre for Advanced Research in Virology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nations-that-mandate-tb-vaccine-may-have-lower-covid-death-rates/story-73iR73VtrWeIqKINhfxkeP.html
30-04-2020||India||Punjab has a turbulent history... we know how to handle this crisis: Manpreet Singh Badal||Punjab on Wednesday announced the extension of the lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 spread until May 17. Manpreet Singh Badal, the state’s finance minister, spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about it. Edited excerpts:Why have you extended the lockdown and how will it work?...Punjab has a very large immigrant population and most of them are settled in the first world, which is currently the hotspot of the infection. We were aware of this and we had anything from 70,000-90,000 NRIs [non-resident Indians] visiting their families. We were aware that Punjab could be the troubled spot. So we went for a lockdown before others... At the same time, we are aware that economic activity has to start and we have allowed construction activities to go ahead in rural areas. ... 90% of India’s bicycles, 60% of India’s tractors, 90% of India’s hosiery are produced in Punjab. So we have also allowed the industrial activity to start as long as they can ensure the transportation of labour or the labour can actually be housed within the premises of factories. We are into the harvesting season of wheat and we supply large parts of India’s surpluses. Luckily for us, harvesting wheat is 99% mechanical...Have you ever played chess? There are 32 pieces in a chess game but there are a billion moves that you can play as long as you know how to play. Culturally and historically, Punjab has a very turbulent history... we have been through very turbulent times and we know how to handle this crisis. We know a billion moves, we will try each one of them and hopefully, something will work.How are you responding to the migrant crisis?Punjab has had a culture of langars [community kitchens] and feeding people. So that is not a problem. Most of the migrant labour is also seasonal and come for the paddy transplant season. So we have plan B ready in case we cannot get migrant labour. Before Punjab was forced to become a rice-growing state, we were a major state in cotton production. We are trying to shift a lot of areas from rice to cotton cultivation. And we also will be experimenting with the seeding of rice mechanically. Hopefully, we will be able to overcome the problem of migrant labourers not coming.Are your people being stuck abroad a concern?Our immediate concern was the pilgrims stranded in Nanded in Maharashtra and some of them have tested positive. We have sent government buses to fetch them. We are also concerned about students stuck in Kota and other places. There is pressure on the government to get them back. ...we need our kids back. Punjab has had 330 [Covid-19] cases and it started with the NRIs. I am not blaming them...How are the people likely to react to the lockdown extension?...Punjab is an agricultural powerhouse... those [agricultural] operations are going unimpeded. We have allowed industry and construction activity to start which leaves very little workforce which is not involved in some meaningful activity. Obviously, there are challenges like keeping people at home and away from depression. Second is to get money and food into their houses. The third is trying to move the wheels of the economy and fourth is to try to get some scientific solution so that this can be permanently done away with. So, we are fighting on four fronts. It is a crisis like this that brings out the character of nations and individuals. Every generation has gone through some kind of suffering. So, we are not the first and would not be the last. This also gives an opportunity to Punjab... farmers will have to work in their fields now that there are no migrant labourers. I am happy about that. The entire drug trade supply chain has been broken. We were sitting on two lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains and this is being transported out of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-has-a-turbulent-history-we-know-how-to-handle-this-crisis-manpreet-singh-badal/story-XC9qLJ3MIGTKEZg21dNzCK.html
30-04-2020||India||Govt predicts 3% agri growth in FY 2020-21||India’s farm-sector is poised to grow at least 3% in 2020-21 on the back of robust output and prices, despite the coronavirus pandemic, helping the country escape a potential recession, a top official of the state-run think-tank Niti Aayog said Wednesday.“In this kind of a situation, will agriculture be the sector to rescue the Indian economy? I will share some projections,” Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand, flanked by Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, said in a webcast. Chand, a farm economist, said indicators show that “the farm sector will grow at least 3%”. This farm growth will contribute at least “0.5% or a little more” to India’s overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth, he said, helping to stave off a recession. In 2019-20, the farm sector grew 3.7%, according to Central Statistic Office.Despite these robust projections, the ongoing lockdown, set to run until May 3, has pressured farmers. The announcement of a nationwide curfew caught farmers by surprise on March 24. During its the initial days, labour shortage and shut markets led farmers to dump new harvest, especially perishables items. Of the 2069 nationally important agricultural wholesale markets in the country, less than 500 were functioning during the first weeks of the lockdown. Within agriculture, restrictions have especially hurt the animal husbandry sector, which accounts for 5% of the country’s GDP. Rumours that chicken were a carrier of the novel coronavirus tanked poultry sales. “With restaurants and hotels shut, there has been at least 25% drop in demand for various farm commodities. Many eastern states, such as Bihar and Jharkhand, aren’t allowing ice cream sales. This has caused a surplus of milk, prompting dairies to offer lower prices to dairy farmers,” said Siraj Hussain, a senior visiting fellow at the New Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. Chand’s presentation, however, struck a positive note. “Many countries are expected to post zero or negative growth. For India also, there are many estimates. But the support from Indian agriculture to the economy is going to be very strong,” Chand said.The International Monetary Fund earlier this month slashed its 2010-21 growth projection for India to 1.9% from 5.8% estimated in January. Barclays said it saw 0% growth, while the World Bank cut India’s growth forecast to 1.5-2.8% from 6.1% earlier. Chand said ground-level indicators point to a robust farm sector. A normal monsoon will see a “strong resurgence” of the agriculture sector, aside from encouraging prices and acreage trends.The India Meteorological Department had forecast a normal June-to-September monsoon, critical for summer crops because 60% of India’s net sown land doesn’t have access to irrigation and nearly half of Indians depend on a farm-based income.Summer sowing is up 38%, Chand said, while fertiliser “offtake” or sales were 5% higher in April from a year ago. Water levels in the country’s main reservoirs were 40-60% higher than the last 10 years’ average, he said. “(Wholesale) prices of various commodities are higher than last year and the prices of vegetables are significantly higher,” Chand said. Tomar said despite a universal lockdown, the agriculture has seen “minimal disruptions” because the government had exempted all farming-related activities. “I think agriculture would perhaps be the only sector which will contribute to India’s GDP growth in FY21. Therefore, agriculture and food processing should receive high priority from the government,” said Siraj Hussain, a senior visiting fellow at the New Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.According to Hussain, although the Centre had issued orders on 27 March and 30 March to ease restrictions on agriculture and related activities, in “many places the orders were not implemented by district magistrates and the local police”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-predicts-3-agri-growth-in-fy-2020-21/story-Fr6mSsB7seDeBR7BaSzKPK.html
30-04-2020||India||Metro trains to have contactless ticketing to curb Covid-19 spread||Passengers travelling in metro trains may not be allowed to use tokens anymore as Centre plans to implement a contactless ticketing system using only metro cards once restrictions on public transport are lifted.The central government is planning a slew of measures to introduce social distancing during metro travel and to ensure minimising risk of spreading Covid-19 by managing space between two passengers, zone-wise queueing, screening and controlling crowds at the stations. These recommendations are part of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for resumption of metro rail services that are being drafted by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. “We are planning to allow the use of metro cards only, make ticketing as contactless as possible and avoid queues at the counter,” a senior official said requesting anonymity.Also read : Don’t allow entry into Delhi without Aarogya Setu App, Lt Guv Anil Baijal toldThe Centre has imposed a lockdown in the wake of coronavirus crisis, suspending all public transport till May 3. Metros, along with passenger trains and flights, have been suspended since March 25. “A review meeting was held on Tuesday by the minister to begin planning on how to run metro services once restrictions are lifted. Please note, services will only resume once the order comes from the home ministry. We have to formulate a plan for whenever services resume,” the official said. “We will need to manage crowds first and foremost. We will need to manage the frequency of the trains depending on the crowd. Unlike railways, we don’t get reserved passengers and hence can’t anticipate the exact rush. We used to get peak rush at this time of the year due to the reopening of the schools and colleges etc. We are not expecting that this time, but it will also depend on the guidelines that are issued for the resumption of offices,” the official said. “We will have to plan our trains accordingly and will also have to figure out ways of maintaining social distancing inside the train. We are monitoring what other countries that have resumed services are doing and should be able to factor all that in. Our guidelines will be ready this week,” the official added. Also read: CISF to go for contactless frisking of passengers at airports, Delhi metroWhile it remains unclear whether the Centre plans to resume public transport from May 3, the railways and aviation ministries are working on plans to resume services once the restrictions are lifted. Travelling in train may come with additional measures of social distancing - arriving early at the railway stations, mandatory usage of masks and thermal screening of passengers. These norms are already being followed for special trains deployed for military personnel. In terms of passengers movement at airports, the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is preparing a standard operating procedure (SOP) prescribing strict social distancing norms including leaving the middle seat empty.A ‘business continuity plan’ drafted by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has proposed to increase the reporting time for passengers at the airport to 120. The measure has been proposed to ensure smooth passage of travellers through all channels like access control, random screening, check-in, immigration while maintaining appropriate social distance. An SOP being prepared by the CISF for its security personnel also proposes contactless frisking, the use of Aarogya Setu app to identify Covid-19 patients entering security gates, and reduction in passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metro-trains-to-have-contactless-ticketing-to-curb-covid-spread/story-jf0Lq9exqKLQVUBtxFNC3L.html
30-04-2020||India||Rs 1 lakh crore assistance for MSMEs must: P Chidambaram||Former finance minister P Chidambaram on Wednesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide Rs 1 lakh crore wage protection assistance to 63 million Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to help them pay wages and salaries to 110 million people for the month of April.For larger companies, he added, the government should announce a “Paycheque Protection Programme” on the lines of the one done by the United States.“This is not a legislation but a financial assistance package,” Chidambaram said, addressing a news conference through video-conferencing.“It is bewildering that there has been absolutely no financial package or assistance announced for businesses since the onset of Covid-19. The government may have the luxury of time but the MSMEs do not. They need to know right away whether they will be helped to stay afloat and thereby pay salaries and wages to those dependent on these businesses,” he said.“Tomorrow is the last working day of the month. More than 120 million people of India are waiting with bated breath. They want to know if they will be paid their salaries and wages for the month of April. There is palpable tension and rising uncertainty among the working people of India and their families,” Chidambaram said.Congress president Sonia Gandhi on April 25 wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to announce an immediate Rs 1 lakh crore “wage protection” package for the revival of MSMEs and warned that if problems of the sector are not addressed it could have a devastating effect on the country’s economy.She said MSMEs are suffering a loss of around Rs 30,000 crore every day due to the nationwide lockdown and efforts should be made to revive these as they are the backbone of the economy.The letter followed deliberations within the party’s 11-member consultative group, headed by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, on the revival of the MSME sector hit hard by the ongoing nationwide lockdown being implemented to contain the deadly coronavirus pandemic.“How will these people feed themselves and their families without an income? These 110 million people’s livelihoods are in danger now because most of the employers are unable to pay wages and salaries. The businesses have had no sales this month and their payments to their vendors are also stuck, leaving the vendors also in distress,”Chidambaram said.“Large swathes of the private sector are faced with what economists call an extreme liquidity shock. Furthermore, these businesses are also unsure about their future. They do not know whether they can continue their businesses or will be forced to shut down permanently. The time to make bold decisions to save the MSMEs is now. If businesses do not see hope, they will decide to close.” The former finance minister also recommended a “Rs 1 lakh crore credit guarantee fund for MSMEs that will help them to go to the banks and borrow money.” Elaborating on the Paycheque Protection Programme, the former finance minister said according to the income-tax department, there are roughly 10 million people with a salary income of less than Rs 3,50,000 a year or Rs 30,000 a month.“Assuming an average salary of Rs 15,000 a month for these 10 million people, the total cost comes to Rs 15,000 crore for the month of April. This is not a large sum to protect the livelihoods of 10 million people who have filed tax returns and paid taxes in the past, and can be easily found. The government must announce a Paycheque Protection Program right away to protect the salaries of these 10 million employees.”The Congress also suggested waiver of employers’ contributions to the employees provident fund (EPF) and employees state insurance (ESI), on a temporary basis, for the next three months, he said, adding this will assist in reducing the payroll costs of employers and retaining the workforce.“Time is of the essence. In the absence of a clear signal of assistance from the government during these extremely difficult times, the private sector will be forced to resort to large scale retrenchments and layoffs which will devastate livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people,” Chidambaram said.“We urge the Prime Minister to step in urgently and announce an assistance package to protect the wages and salaries and pay cheques that are due in the next few days,” he added.A BJP functionary said the government is already working out the plan for helping MSMEs. “MSME minister Nitin Gadkari has already assured that the government is thinking of formulating policy to help the sector in all possible ways. The government is also looking at setting soon setting a Rs 1-trillion revolving fund for MSMEs to bring in much-needed liquidity,” the BJP functionary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1l-cr-assistance-for-msmes-must-p-chidambaram/story-NFVCyls151IRWOzyPJKhIJ.html

Ludhiana’s civil surgeon, Dr Rajesh Bagga, said all patients from the district tested positive were asymptomatic. He said their reports have been received from Dayanand Medical College and Hospital and shared with the Indian Council of Medical Research, which will issue an official statement. The authorities have quarantined 56 pilgrims and 25 students, who returned from Nanded and Kota, in Ludhiana while test results of around 50 people were awaited. Two women and a child were found positive for the infection in Hoshiarpur’s Moranwali. In Faridkot, two women in their 60s were admitted to the isolation ward of the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital.Civil surgeon Dr Rajinder Kumar said two of the 20 people, who returned to Faridkot from Hazur Sahib, have tested positive while reports of 18 others are awaited. “These pilgrims were quarantined at a government school after their return and we have initiated the contact tracing.”A group of 20 returned from Maharashtra on Sunday and belong to Faridkot’s Sandhwan village. They had gone for the pilgrimage there in March and got stranded because of the Covid-19 lockdown.Deputy commissioner Kumar Saurabh Raj said around 50 more people are expected to arrive from Nanded and they have made arrangements to quarantine them as well.Around 3,000 pilgrims from Punjab had been stranded in Hazur Sahib after the imposition of the lockdown. They have been returning in batches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-pilgrims-4-students-test-ve-in-punjab/story-rFm1ZLehz9IsCtcqRVpoMO.html
30-04-2020||India||Airport guidelines to bring more checks, reduce rush||Once restrictions on passenger flights are lifted, airports will facilitate limited domestic and international scheduled flights in phases, may be at 30% capacity to facilitate social distancing, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said in a set of guidelines for resumption of service once the lockdown is lifted. Flight operations are likely to be scaled up in a gradual manner towards their previous level, according to the government’s plan. Airline operations are likely begin in Tier-I cities first, the statement added. “Initially it is presumed that airline operations will be limited to Tier-I cities i.e. metros and some of the state capitals & major Tier-II cities. The flights schedule may be cleared on city pair basis, so the origin and destination airports are open fully ,” said the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for recommencement of operations at AAI airports after the lockdown. At airports with more than one terminal, initially only one terminal shall be used and larger terminals can be scaled down to reduce cleaning area, considering limited availability of material resources, the SOP stated. “Immediately after the lockdown is lifted, or as per government directives in this direction, the scheduled flight operations will commence. Hence, all airports are required to be in preparedness to handle the flight operations,” it added. Strict social distancing norms will be introduced inside the planes to ensure space between two passengers, Hindustan Times reported on April 9. According to the SOP, passenger seating arrangement shall be done in such a manner so as to maintain social distancing (1- 1.5 m) between passengers. “Sufficient staff shall be deployed near washrooms (in airports), X-Ray machines, conveyor belts etc. to guide passengers to maintain sufficient distance,” it said. Alternate check-in counters may also be introduced to avoid congestion. “Queue at counters shall be managed by airlines staff to manage sufficient distance among passengers. Also, check-in counters may be opened well in advance to stagger the crowd,” it said. Social distancing (1-1.5 meter) markings and stickers will be provided at airports. Based on social distancing norms, airports will work out terminal building capacity and forward it to AAI so that the slots can be accordingly allocated by airline operators for the scheduled flights can be done. Food and Beverage Services and retail outlets will be limited till operations of airlines gradually increase. “Initially they should serve tea/coffee etc. with take away snacks in boxes,” it said. India has suspended international flights since March 22 while domestic flights were grounded from March 25. The current lockdown period is scheduled to end on May 3 , although it is not clear if flights will resume immediately. There will be a need for coordination with respective state governments and local administrations to ensure availability of proper public transport and private taxis for passengers and airline staff to reach the airport, the SOP said. “Also, coordinate with the respective local administration to ensure that petrol and diesel is adequately available for sustaining operations at airport,” it added. The guidelines also said that the hours of operation of airports would initially be limited. “Airlines are required to file their schedule with DGCA and simultaneously apply for slots at CHQ for approval well in advance to operate within the limited watch hours to be made available at airports, as initially the summer 2020 schedule cannot be fully implemented. The slots will be provided for ensuring staggered operation based on capacity restriction of terminal buildings to facilitate required social distancing,” the SOP said. CHQ stands for Central Headquarters.Recommencement of international flights should be also done in a similar coordinated manner, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airport-guidelines-to-bring-more-checks-reduce-rush/story-tElVXAaxr04fJCJNJTlRfJ.html
30-04-2020||India||Areas not affected by Covid-19 mostly in rural areas: Data||When the nationwide lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the Coronavirus disease ends – for now it is expected to end on May 3 – restrictions are likely to be first eased in predominantly rural areas of India, a Hindustan Times analysis shows. This is because the green zones, or districts not affected by the pandemic, are mostly in rural areas. This also means the economy of these regions is largely agriculture driven; they are also not hubs of migration.The government on April 15 classified 170 districts as Covid-19 hotspots -- those which have reported large outbreaks or multiple clusters of cases -- and 207 other districts as non-hotspot areas, those where only limited clusters of cases were reported. This leaves more than 300 of the country’s 731 districts which were not affected by the pandemic, classified as non-infected districts or green zones.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, in a meeting with chief ministers, placed particular emphasis on green zones, saying these regions would contribute to economic activity while practising social distancing, which is widely seen as a sign that lockdown will continue in red zones while there can be further relaxations in the less affected regions.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageAlthough nearly every second district in the country is classified as a green zone, these districts are home to only a third of India’s population, according to the 2011 Census. Of India’s 1.21 billion people, about 376 million people live in the districts now classified as green zones. These are predominantly rural areas – while nearly 69% of India’s population lives in rural areas, the share of rural population in the green zones is relatively higher at 84%.To be sure, this is a close approximation for present times because the population figures would have changed since the Census was last conducted, and some district boundaries have also changed since then.That more than half of the confirmed Covid-19 cases have been reported from 15 predominantly urban districts of India – including in Delhi and Mumbai – also points to the fact that it is the rural areas that are relatively less affected by the pandemic.The pattern is similar across big states, which is to say that the share of rural population in a state’s green zone districts is relatively higher than the overall share of rural population in the state. For instance, the overall share of rural population in Maharashtra is 55% but the share of rural population in its green zones is nearly 74%. Kerala is the only exception to this among big states where the share of rural population in green zones is less (33%) than its share in the total population (52%).No big urban cluster is part of the green zones. In fact, there are a very few green zone districts with significant urban population, such as Yaman district of Puducherry (no rural population), the uni-district union territory of Lakshadweep (22% rural population), Kozhikode district of Kerala (33% rural population) and Imphal West district of Manipur (38% rural population).The working population in the green zones is largely engaged in agriculture. According to the 2011 Census data, the green zones were home to nearly 150 million workers, of whom about 100 million (or 67%) were cultivators or agricultural labourers. The share of cultivators and agricultural labourers outside the green zone was 18 percentage points less at 49%.Also, there were more than 37 million people who had migrated between states for reasons other than marriage, according to the 2011 Census. Of these, only 13% (or 5 million) had migrated to any of the green zone districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/areas-not-affected-by-covid-mostly-in-rural-areas-data/story-hR05kiFItBP7oq7nC2u9EM.html
30-04-2020||India||Most states back easing of restrictions in green zones post-lockdown||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday announced that businesses like hardware, tea, mobile, book and electrical appliance shops will be allowed to operate in green zones that have reported no Covid-19 cases in the state. “No relief can be offered to salons and barber shops,” said Banerjee. She said buses can ply in green zones if they carry only 20 passengers to ensure social distancing. West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said 16 jute mills have been allowed to resume operations.Achyut Chandra, vice president of the Eastern India Corrugated Box Manufacturers Association, said some industries located outside the containment zones in Kolkata and Howrah were operating with limited manpower. Officials in Andhra Pradesh said 80% of the total 676 revenue blocks in the state come under green zones, where all activities could be allowed after May 3 when the national lockdown to check the pandemic spread is scheduled to end. Most of the red zone areas are located in Kurnool, Guntur, Krishna, and Chittoor districts.“We are hopeful about the restoration of more activities in green zones including that of private transport services and other economic activities,” an official in Andhra Pradesh chief minister’s office said. “We hope to see some spurt in the industrial activity after May 3 when more red zones became green.”Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said a modified lockdown would be enforced from May 3 even as all industries activities would be allowed with some restrictions. He said the state government was looking at sectors, such as hospitality and stone mining, that can resume operations with social distancing norms. Jharkhand has directed officials in green zones to resume all industrial activities in consultation with local businesses. “We have initiated several measures in villages... The economy will pick up in rural areas soon,” said rural development minister Alamgir Alam.He said the government will come up with norms to restart the bidi industry, which is the third biggest employer in rural India, especially in West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. Alam said the government was thinking about permitting sweet and meat shops to start businesses. “We will not allow non-essential commercial vehicles and passenger cars to ply.”Chhattisgarh plans to restart interdistrict public transport after May 3 to enable small industries to resume operations. “All government offices would resume normal operations from May 4,” said an official on condition of anonymity. He added a final decision in this regard will be taken at a cabinet meeting on May 3.In Bihar, the government is likely to allow some more relaxations to engage migrant workers, who have returned to the state. “It is unlikely that schools, colleges and offices will get back to normal functioning soon but more infrastructure projects may be allowed,” said an official. Goa will allow resumption of all industrial activities from May 3. “Let the borders be sealed. But let local activity start,” a government official said. He added after May 3, they plan to start public transport within the state. Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said he will wait for the Centre’s guidelines to ease restrictions after May 3.Himachal Pradesh’s principal secretary (revenue), Onkar Chand Sharma, said the state government has lifted several restrictions on industrial and agriculture activities in the green zones. He added the government will review the situation after May 3 and decide on easing more restrictions.Uttarakhand government spokesman, Madan Kaushik, said the state will take a call on more relaxations in green zones after the Centre notifies new regulations. Most of the industries in Uttarakhand, which have been given permission to operate, have not resumed operations because of tough conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-states-back-easing-of-restrictions-in-green-zones-post-lockdown/story-hdwGrhZ2LhRs3dP0sQLvdL.html
30-04-2020||India||Kerala brings law for temporary salary cuts||A day after the Kerala high court stayed its decision to slash employees’ salaries, the government decided on Wednesday to bring an ordinance in order to make the deductions as part of efforts to raise funds for fighting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Announcing this, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said extraordinary situations need extraordinary actions, while also giving an assurance to state government employees. “You can’t call it a salary cut. We have made it clear that the amount collected in five instalments will be repaid once the economic condition of the state improved,” he said.The move came a day after the high court stayed Kerala’s decision to deduct salaries of government employees for six days every month for the next five months (totalling 30 days).“All are undergoing a difficult situation. So it is natural that employees will also be a part of the process. We have deducted 30% salaries of ministers, MLAs, board chairmen and others for one year,” Vijayan said.The government order issued to that effect last week said the move will be applicable to employees of all state- owned enterprises, public sector undertakings, quasi-government organisations and universities, among others.Several employees’ organisations owing allegiance to opposition parties moved the court, saying a salary cut at this juncture will trigger more problems for them. Announcing the cabinet decision, finance minister TM Thomas Isaac told reporters on Wednesday: “As per this ordinance, the state government has been empowered to defer 25% of the salary of government employees, in case of a disaster.”The minister, however, made it clear that 25% of the salary would not be deferred and the state government would go ahead with its initial six-day cut plan. Now, governor Arif Mohamad Khan will have to give his assent to the ordinance.“The state government has taken the decision on the ordinance as per the Kerala high court order. We could have gone for an appeal. But, the court said that the government order on deducting salary does not have a legal backing. So, we have decided to make it legal,” he said.Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala of the Congress criticised the move and said the government was taking revenge on employees after it suffered a serious setback in the court.In the backdrop of the controversial government decision, the Registrar General of the High Court has said the state government cannot recover any amount from the emoluments of the Chief Justice and judges through an executive order.The Registrar General wrote to the chief secretary in this regard after the government on April 22 ordered deferring disbursement of salaries for six days every month from April to August of all officials who draw their wages from the consolidated fund of the state.“It may be noted that, as per Article 221 of the Constitution of India, the salaries are paid to the Honourable judges as determined by Parliament and they shall not be varied to their disadvantage after the appointment. Therefore the salaries and allowances of the Hon’ble Chief Justice and judges cannot be varied or deferred by the Government, through an executive order,” the letter dated April 27 said.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-brings-law-for-temporary-salary-cuts/story-pbrfgPK7f64ZvyQrYiQe3H.html
30-04-2020||India||9 districts with high case loads lack adequate facilities: Centre||A document created by the health ministry and shared with states and union territories on Wednesday caused a flutter after it was circulated on social media and showed that nine of the 23 districts with a high load of Covid-19 cases don’t have enough health facilities to cope with the projected number of cases on May 15. While officials from at least four states confirmed the existence of such a document and said it was mainly about the caseloads , health ministry spokesperson Manisha Verma clarified in a statement that the document was “an exercise to tell states to be regular with uploading information on case numbers, health infrastructure, manpower, etc. ... so that it shows on the central database in real-time.” She further added that the document was “not reflective of the actual situation on the ground, in terms of cases vs beds, ventilators, doctors, etc,” and that the document “was created for internal discussion and not meant to be a public document as this doesn’t portray the real picture. “ That doesn’t appear to be the impression the states walked away with, though . One senior health official from a large state said on condition of anonymity that the presentation was to get the states to do more to control the pandemic and to highlight districts where the most pressing challenges would likely be faced in terms of medical infrastructure. “Luckily, we don’t have any district in Punjab in this list as of now. But, to use the old adage, forewarned is forearmed,” said Punjab’s special chief secretary, SBS Sidhu.The total Covid positive cases in these 23 districts on Tuesday were 19,254 on Tuesday, about 62% of the total 31,329 positives cases in the country. By May 15, the health ministry has projected that the total cases with the current rate of growth will increase to 80,210. However, health ministry spokesperson Verma underplayed the accuracy of the numbers and said “the number crunching was done internally just to get a sense of the situation” and that “it doesn’t mean these will be the actual numbers”. However, what’s probably more important is that the document points out the expected shortages of isolation beds with oxygen, intensive care unit beds and ventilator facilities on specific dates for each of these cities. “The projections have been based of the weekly increase in cases in these districts since April 9. The calculation is based on slowing down of the doubling rate in these districts,” a government functionary, who was not willing to be named, said. He said the projection on gaps in health infrastructure was derived from state health department’s daily report on Covid infrastructure. The presentation named Case Load and Infra Gap Analysis showed that Mumbai and its suburban areas, Indore, Surat, Chennai, Krishna, Kanpur Nagar, Kasaragod, Agra and Kolkata are expected to see shortage in health infrastructure between April 27 and May 15, if the Covid cases increased as per the projection.The 28-page presentation was sent to the states a day after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) revised its guidelines saying the asymptomatic patients should be put in home quarantine, thereby creating more space for symptomatic and more serious patients in hospitals. Mumbai, which has the highest number of Covid-19 patients, could fall short isolation beds with oxygen supply by May 11, the projection said. With the spike in the cases, Mumbai would be short of 421 ventilators and Pune will be short of 40 ventilators by May 11. Besides, Mumbai will be short of 20,462 isolation beds with oxygen.The state health department, however, dismissed the projection and said that multiple mathematical models have given various projections and said that it is basing its plans on “realistic” assessment.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state may plan to shift asymptomatic patients in Mumbai into home quarantine as per the revised guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“It is being said that beds aren’t available in Mumbai; there have been no such complaints. As per the new guidelines of the ICMR, asymptomatic patients can be kept into home quarantine. In Mumbai, 83% of patients are asymptomatic, it may be possible to shift some of them who are not that severe into home quarantine. Those beds would be made available for more serious patients,” he said.The officials in Pune, where the ministry projected that there can be shortage of ventilators by May 11, said they were working hard to ensure adequate health facilities. Pune’s divisional commissioner, Deepak Mhaisekar, said, “If the present Covid condition of the Pune city worsens I will urge private hospitals to come forward and help. I can assure private hospitals that the administration will support them. We are facing shortage of health workers”A Madhya Pradesh government official said there was no reason to get scared as health facilities in Indore were being ramped up. “In Indore, we have 4704 isolation beds with 200 ICU beds and availability of 65 ventilators,” the official, who was not willing to be named, said. The health ministry presentation said that with cases in Indore likely to double by May 15 from present 1,208, there would be shortage of isolation beds. “Only 32% of the isolation beds are occupied (now). We have informed the health ministry about it,” said the official.According to Dr Ram Gopalakrishnan, an infectious disease specialist at Apollo Hospital who is part of a committee of healthcare and medical experts that consults with the Tamil Nadu government, the state needs more Covid-19 centres to deal with the rise in cases. According to the document, Chennai which has a current case load of 496 (as of April 28) and projected case load of 4141 on May 15 may face shortage of ‘Isolation Beds by May 11.Andhra Pradesh special chief secretary (medical and health) K S Jawahar Reddy said all major government hospitals in the state are fully equipped and if required, the government would take over all the private super specialty hospitals in the state for treating Covid-19 patients. Telangana health minister Eatala Rajender said the number of positive cases in the state would almost become negligible by first week of May as per the health ministry’s projections. Responding to the ministry’s document, Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma said the state has made adequate arrangements for equipment and protective gear in view of the COVID-19 outbreak. “I have asked for 1500 more ventilators for the state at a video conferencing with union health minister (Harsh Vardhan),” he said.(With inputs from Sowmiya Ashok in Chennai, Swapnil Rawal in Mumbai, Urvashi Dev Rawal in Jaipur, Ranjan in Bhopal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-districts-with-high-case-loads-lack-adequate-facilities-centre/story-nGL2dTUUL0jDHvYKx3Dc9M.html
30-04-2020||India||Access to internet not a fundamental right, Jammu and Kashmir administration tells Supreme Court||Right to access the internet is not a fundamental right and the degree of access for exercising free speech or for carrying on any trade or business can be curtailed, the administration of Jammu and Kashmir said in the Supreme Court on Wednesday.The submission by the newly created Union territory came in an affidavit it filed in a case seeking restoration of 4G mobile internet services in Jammu & Kashmir.High-speed Internet as been suspended even after the easing of restrictions, including a communication blockades, imposed after erstwhile state was divested of its special status with the revocation of Article 370 of the constitution in August last year. Simultaneously in August, the Centre pushed through provisions reorganising the state into two UTs -- J&K and Ladakh --- with effect from October 31. .Protection of the sovereignty and integrity of India and ensuring security of the country are sound grounds to reduce the speed of the internet, the affidavit said.“The right to access the internet is not a fundamental right and thus the type and breadth of access for exercising the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) and/or to carry on any trade or business under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India (CoI) through the medium of internet can be curtailed”, it stated.The centre’s affidavit was in response to a plea by a not-for-profit organisation, Foundation for Media Professionals, which said the lack of high-speed mobile internet was causing difficulties during the Covid-19 outbreak with patients, doctors, and the public in general remaining in the dark about the latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions related to the pandemic.The petitioner challenged the order issued by the J&K administration on March 26 restricting the internet speed in mobile data to 2G and prayed that 4G internet services be restored in the Union territory.“Various public health practitioners, medical professionals, and doctors have repeatedly expressed their concern about wasting precious time trying to download the latest studies, protocols, manuals and advisories on treatment and management of Covid-19 . In some cases, doctors are not able to access these resources at all, due to the internet speed being too slow to download heavy files”, the petition stated.The J&K administration claimed that the submission was misconceived because most of the information relating to Covid-19 can be accessed through fixed line high-speed internet which is available in the Union territory without any speed restrictions.“The information regarding Covid-19 is also available on various social media platforms which can be easily accessed on low speed 2G internet. Various Government websites like website of WHO, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, etc. associated with timely information flow in the form of awareness/advisories/orders can also be easily accessed at Low Speed internet”, the affidavit said.The Supreme Court in a judgment passed on January 10, had held that access to information and the freedom of trade and commerce via the internet are fundamental rights under the Constitution of India. It had, therefore, ordered the central government and J&K administration to periodically review the orders restricting Internet services in J&KJ&K, in its affidavit, told the court that after the January 10 judgment by the apex court, various orders were passed by the administration gradually lifting restrictions in J&K. Mobile phone services - initially post-paid and thereafter pre-paid – were restored and restrictions on internet access were progressively lifted.The affidavit said a decision as to whether controlled access to the internet is still warranted depends on an assessment of the ground situation.“..post August 2019 constitutional developments, Pakistan handlers, either directly or indirectly, have increased activity on Social media intending to and aiming at disturbance of peace in the region , inciting violence and abetting terror activities”, the document claimed.Increase in internet speed, the centre submitted, will lead to swift uploading and posting of provocative videos and other heavy data files.“High speed internet services (4G) decrease the time of circulation of various photographs, videos, propaganda audios and hence enable the associated content to go viral, with the reaction time of law enforcement agencies to such situations decreasing”, the affidavit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/right-to-access-internet-not-a-fundamental-right-centre-tells-supreme-court/story-15PF5bFyoXuoS17FKz5beI.html
30-04-2020||India||Police crack down on Covid-19 ‘misinformation’, activists concerned||Till Wednesday, around 640 cases have been lodged across the country for allegedly spreading rumours and fake news via social media on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic since the government enforced nationwide restrictions --- first, on March 25 for three weeks, and then for another 19 days till May 3 , according to the information provided by police officers from various states.Free speech activists, however, took exception to these nationwide arrests, as they contended that the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, several sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Disaster Management Act, 2005, has been randomly invoked to curb criticism against authorities in the name of the health care emergency.The colonial pandemic law gives sweeping powers to a state government, including arresting people for spreading misinformation, while the Disaster Management Act, 2005, is stricter against any kind of dissent, activists argued.“Sometimes criticism of lack of preparedness or of certain local issues has also resulted in people being booked. Some of these social media posts fall within the permissible limit of freedom of speech under the Constitution. However, state governments are using a high degree of power that goes beyond public health issues to serve the government’s political objective. This is a matter of grave concern,” said Apar Gupta, a lawyer and internet freedom activist.“Bal Gangadhar Tilak was also booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, when he had criticised the then British government for its lack of preparedness to deal with the Spanish flu in 1918-19,” Gupta said. On April 15, Maharashtra Police arrested a local journalist for airing a story claiming that railways had arranged special trains for migrant workers to return home, which led to commotion among labourers at Mumbai’s Bandra station. The reporter, who is based in Osmanabad, Maharashtra, was booked under various sections of IPC and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, the police said. In Uttar Pradesh, the police are preparing a charge sheet against a Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and a former member of Parliament (MP) for allegedly spreading misinformation about the viral outbreak after a video surfaced purportedly showing him ridiculing the Yogi Adityanath-led state government’s social distancing advisory.Triveni Singh, superintendent of police (SP), Azamgarh, said the video was an apt case of spreading misinformation and misleading people amid the pandemic. The police would file a charge sheet against the ex-MP shortly, Singh said.In West Bengal, over 100 people have been arrested for spreading fake news and rumours related to Covid-19. Many, however, have been let off after a warning, West Bengal Police officials said.The arrested people include homemakers, students, school teachers, government employees, and traders. The police are scanning social media pages for incriminating posts, said Gyanwant Singh, the inspector general (law and order), West Bengal Police.In Manipur, which doesn’t have a single Covid-19 case at present, the police have lodged cases against 27 people, including a person who allegedly mocked PM Modi’s nine-minute blackout call at 9 pm on April 5, claiming it would result in a breakdown of the national grid, a concern that was also raised by several experts. “We booked the person for spreading false information,” said K Meghachandra, SP, Imphal West. In that district, two office-bearers of the Youth’s Forum for Protection Human Rights were booked for issuing a statement questioning the location of a proposed quarantine facility by the state government. “Later, they were released on bail,” said a police officer.In Assam, the police registered 87 cases against people for spreading fake news on social media related to Covid-19. Altogether, 46 people have been arrested till date. While 12 of them have been released on bail, 16 others have been released under section 41A of the code of criminal procedure (CrPC).Police have removed nearly 1,000 posts from social media that allegedly spread misinformation on Covid-19 over the past month in Assam. Hundreds of youth, who have posted or shared those posts, have also been counselled, a police officer said.The Assam government also filed a case against Jugasanka, a Bengali daily published from Silchar, for carrying a what it said was a false news report about the state’s first Covid-19 positive patient. While the patient was still admitted at Silchar Medical College Hospital, the news story mentioned that he had recovered. It stated that the second test carried on the patient was found negative.The Assam government has constituted a five-member committee “for monitoring and checking of fake news in all forms of media.In Madhya Pradesh (MP), where the Covid-19 positive cases have crossed over 2,000, 108 cases have been registered against people for spreading rumours and misinformation via social media posts. “There is no case against any high-profile person in MP,” said D Sreeniwas Verma, the Covid-19 in-charge and inspector general of police (IGP), MP.On April 18, Telangana Police filed cases under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, against two Telugu television news channels and their reporters for carrying a report that stated a person, who had tested Covid-19 positive, was staying in Neredmet area in Medchal-Malkajgiri district because he wanted to evade treatment.Both the Telugu channels ran the report for a while, quoting the local police authorities but withdrew it after they failed to confirm the news source.Telangana Working Journalists’ Union state general secretary Virahat Ali said it was not proper to register the cases against the channels and journalists who had carried the report based on the information they had got from the authorities concerned. According to Rajasthan government official data, 177 first information reports (FIRs) were registered in which 251 people were named and 179 have been arrested for spreading misinformation and fake messages.In Himachal Pradesh, 53 people have been booked for spreading false information and fake news via social media posts, said the state’s director-general of police (DGP), Sita Ram Mardi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/about-500-cases-lodged-in-india-for-social-media-posts-on-covid-19/story-PBaxt7oNs9IdPNUCVRiUUM.html
30-04-2020||India||Man tests covid-19 negative, then positive, called back to hospital. He dies||In a case of alleged negligence, a Covid-19 patient at M R Bangur hospital, a designated Covid hospital in Kolkata, was told he had tested negative and discharged on April 26. Later that very night, the patient was told that there had been a mistake, that he had tested positive and readmitted to the hospital. He died on April 28 at the hospital.The deceased’s son has alleged gross negligence, pointing out that after returning home and the assurance of having tested negative, his father had spent time with his granddaughters, one of whom is a seven-month-old baby.Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, director of health services Ajay Chakraborty and health secretary Vivek Kumar did not respond to questions sent by text messages and WhatsApp about the incident.However, at the state secretariat, without mentioning Bangur hospital, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Wednesday that minor clerical mistakes do take place.“There could be some errors at the ground level. Those must be forgiven for the time being. This is not a deliberate mistake. This is a new task and a new initiative. Some minor mistakes may happen.” She, however, did not mention the name of the hospital or patient.“...There can be a minor error in a notice, a printing mistake. Some are trying to malign the government with these. All that health workers need at this hour is some appreciation,” she added.The man was admitted to the hospital on April 22 as he was suffering from a dry cough.“On April 25, I received a call from the hospital at night, saying my father had tested negative and would be released. He was discharged on the morning of April 26 and the discharge certificate had ‘Covid-19 negative’ written on it. However, that very night, hospital authorities telephoned me again, this time to say that there had been a mistake and he was actually positive. They asked me to take him back to the hospital,” said the son of the deceased, a resident of Bechu Chatterjee Street in North Kolkata.The man was readmitted to the hospital on April 27 and died on April 28.“Who is responsible for this mistake? They killed my father! Also, what if my children now test positive? My father spent time with them after coming back home. My mother is 63. They are all vulnerable,” said the deceased’s son.A senior doctor at the hospital said that the error was not due to defective kits, since those had been sent back. It could not be ascertained whether the hospital is using kits of Chinese origin.“It was a human error. The report came positive but got wrongly listed as negative,” said the doctor, who did not want to be identified.A senior health official, who did not want to be named, said that all members of the family would be tested for novel coronavirus infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-positive-then-negative-then-sent-home-called-again-then-dead/story-L1BpWpHjpRETX2eDC4tQ8I.html
30-04-2020||India||Coronavirus RNA airborne, but unlikely to be infective: Study||Scientists in China have found genetic fragments of the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in airborne droplets in medical and staff areas during the outbreak in February and March in two Wuhan hospitals, but they stopped short of saying the disease is airborne.An important finding of the study was that ventilation and sterilisation brought down airborne genetic shards (RNA) of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, to undetectable levels and reduced the risk of airborne exposure.Small droplets expelled while breathing or talking can remain airborne and infect people who inhale them, said the study, but it could not determine whether the Sars-CoV-2 RNA were harmless or infectious. The study was published in the journal, Nature.“Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols,” concluded the study that did an aerodynamic analysis of Sars-CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals.“Viral RNA of positive strand is theoretically infectious but there are no known cases to my knowledge of RNA-mediated infection. Thus, practically, only intact virus/virion is infectious. Many of these studies that look at viral RNA should be interpreted with caution,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.“Viral RNA is not infective,” said Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva.Covid-19 spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks, according to the WHO. These droplets are relatively heavy and quickly sink to the ground, but people can get infected if they inhale droplets from a sick person or touch contaminated objects and surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth, said the global health agency.Earlier this month, a high-level US scientific panel said that the virus that causes the disease is airborne and can spread through just breathing and talking, which makes its spread easier and sustainable. The scientists from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine said the virus can stay suspended in air in the ultrafine mist that is produced when people exhale.On March 17, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found the virus stayed suspended and infective in aerosol droplets that are below 5 microns across for up to three hours in lab conditions. The aerosolized virus had a median half-life of about 1.1-1.2 hours, similar to the related Sars-CoV, the coronavirus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), the study found. The half-life indicates how long a virus can survive in different environments, regardless of how much virus happens to be present at the time of sampling.Infected people, who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms of fever, cough or fatigue, also spread the disease to others, with a study from China published in Nature Medicine on April 15 estimating that 44% of infections are spread by people who are not obviously ill.The study from China found that the concentration of Sars-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was elevated in the patients’ toilet areas, indicating that they need the same level of sanitisation as the intensive care units and isolation wards.“Levels of airborne Sars-CoV-2 RNA in the majority of public areas were undetectable except in two areas prone to crowding, possibly due to infected carriers in the crowd,” said the study, which also found high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions in some medical staff areas.The viral RNA, however, reduced substantially to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitisation procedures. “Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitisation of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of Sars-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols. Future work should explore the infectivity of aerosolized virus,” the study said.It recommended that for public health prevention and medical staff protection, hospitals must focus on ventilation and sterilisation of toilets as a potential spread source of the virus; personal protection measures for the general public, such as wearing masks and avoiding crowded placed to reduce the risk of airborne virus exposure; and the effective sanitisation of the high risk area in the hospital to limit the transmission of airborne Sars-CoV-2 and protect the medical staff.It highlighted that conversion of a naturally ventilated stadium into a field hospital for patient quarantine and treatment limited aerosol transmission of Sars-CoV-2; as did surface sanitisation of the personnel protection equipment before they are taken off, which reduced the potential infection risk of medical staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-rna-airborne-but-unlikely-to-be-infective-study/story-pnv241Yy7oEFpCJJYzOA7H.html
30-04-2020||India||Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: The story of a Chinese girl stuck in India||With coronavirus turning life upside down all over the world, Chinese citizens are facing a double threat. As they grapple like everyone else with how to escape the virus itself, they are also facing growing racism. There has been an alarming rise in anti-Chinese sentiment across the world.In such a charged atmosphere, Zhang Aixi, a Chinese citizen found herself stuck as the lockdown was announced. Zhang had come to India on a solo trip in January.As travel came to a halt worldwide with the outbreak of COVID-19, she realised she was going to be away from her family for a very long time. It became increasingly difficult for her to keep in touch with her mother in China. Zhang felt homeless and restless in a new country and suffered a serious mental and emotional breakdown. Some people even mocker her by calling her ‘China Virus’, when she ventured out of the PG. Zhang went into severe depression, and sometimes started having episodes of aggression. With her deteriorating mental state and no medical support, she was soon thrown out of the PG she was living in Gurugram.When the Gurugram police got to know about her condition, they decided to put her up in an NGO. But none of the NGOs or shelters agreed to keep her due to coronavirus scare. Finally, Earth Saviours Foundation, in Bandhwari village in Gurugram, agreed to take her in. Ravi Kalra, founder, says “My NGO takes care of people who have been abandoned, depressed or mentally challenged. When Zhang came here, we welcomed her with open arms. I believe in selfless seva. We never discriminate between human beings. Her being Chinese doesn’t make her any less of a human being, and mental illness is no taboo.” “Many other NGOs that look after such individuals refused to her help as she was Chinese. We are glad that here she has found a home away from home,” he adds. Zhang can’t thank Indians enough for their kindness. As we connected her to Hem Kusum, assistant professor in the Department of Chinese Language and Culture, Visva Bharti University, Santiniketan, West Bengal on phone, she said, “I am so grateful to India for all the love that people gave me here. I am so lucky that I got to experience such compassion in this birth. Ravi Kalra has a heart of gold. He helps everyone selflessly, and there’s so much positivity here.” She also spoke about how badly she misses her mom and wants to be with her soon.Karan Goel, ACP, DLF, Gurgaon, says there is so much negativity and gloom around, and such real life stories of compassion give us strength in these distressing times. “We are happy that we could do something good by helping Zhang. Four lady constables have been assigned to ensure the security of the Chinese tourist. Earth Saviours Foundation has the manpower, resources and expertise to host the foreigner.” With Zhang Aixi being tested negative for Covid-19, Kalra says, “I am happy that she is doing well and there is a lot of improvement in her mental state as well. It is my duty to serve my nation, taking care of our guests has always been our tradition. In this time of crisis, hosting Zhang and ensuring that she takes back happy memories to China is the least I can do.” The NGO is in constant touch with the Chinese Embassy and they have assured that they would initiate the process of sending Zhang back to her mother as soon as possible. Kalra has arranged Zhang’s meeting with the officials and the process of sending the Chinese girl back to her country in a rare case has been initiated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vasudhaiva-kutumbakam-the-story-of-a-chinese-girl-stuck-in-india/story-T13TTa46Rzt9W3jLm4eNeK.html
30-04-2020||Editorials||Returning home, finally | HT Editorial||On Wednesday, the 36th day of the lockdown, the home ministry issued a set of guidelines to enable the movement of migrant workers, students, tourists, pilgrims and others stranded in different states to their home states. The government order stipulates that this can happen if there is a mutual agreement between the sending and receiving states; only those who show no symptoms after screening will be allowed to move; movement can only happen on road, in buses, while maintaining social distancing protocols; and those who return will either be in home or institutional quarantine, with periodic health check-ups.The government’s order is welcome, though long overdue. Over the past five weeks, India has witnessed a looming humanitarian crisis. Migrant workers sought to return home from the time the lockdown was announced on March 24. Thousands walked or cycled home, hundreds of kilometres away. Facing a severe shortage of cash and food, they went through acute suffering. State governments did step in and arranged shelter camps, but this turned out to be inadequate. There was also an emerging law and order concern, as restless and angry migrants clashed with security personnel in cities such as Surat demanding they be allowed to go home. The central government’s dilemma was understandable — it was apprehensive that mass return of migrants could lead to the spread of the disease. But humanitarian and law and order concerns, and pressure from the ground, appear to have, finally, titled the decision.The challenge is now in implementation. Reports suggest that there are 10 million migrants registered with different state governments who want to return home. Arranging transport will be a tremendous logistical challenge. The more important variable is maintaining the social distancing protocols during travel. Given that migrants are not going to be tested, but only screened, and many coronavirus disease patients are asymptomatic, there is a possibility that individuals with the disease may be travelling. This makes the requisite distancing, and then strict quarantine, and effective monitoring once they reach their destination essential. It was important to address the demands of migrants given the human tragedy that was unfolding. But India cannot afford to see the spread of the disease across the rural hinterland, where the health infrastructure is very weak. Getting this balance right will be critical in the weeks ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/returning-home-finally/story-8z2FowLgDAMP0tb3a9b95J.html
30-04-2020||Editorials||The passing away of an icon | HT editorial||When Rishi Kapoor first emerged on the big screen — playing a young student who fell in love with his teacher in Mera Naam Joker — his acting talent was noted and he won a national award. But he also evoked curiosity for his lineage — he was Raj Kapoor’s son and Prithvi Raj Kapoor’s grandson. Belonging to what many may consider Bombay cinema’s first family is what gave Rishi Kapoor the opportunity to enter the world of cinema.But it is truly a testament to his acting prowess that Kapoor so quickly outgrew this element of his identity. With Bobby, and a range of other romantic films in the 1970s, he emerged as a film icon with his own independent identity, loved by fans, particularly women, and praised by critics for his timing. He excelled in both films where he was the solo star, as well as in multi-starrers. But Kapoor’s biggest strength was his ability to evolve. After a somewhat rough patch in the 1990s and an indifferent attempt at direction, he found his niche, playing character roles of his age. Be it as the hero’s father or elderly friend, or an underground don, or middle class protagonist, or most powerfully, a Muslim in contemporary India (Mulk), Kapoor brought his distinctive touch to each role. Admirers also got to know the man behind the actor through his outspoken tweets in recent years.Kapoor’s death — he had been battling cancer — on Thursday, and the outpouring of grief it evoked is a testament to how much he meant to so many people. He has left behind an incredible body of work spanning close to five decades. But few things made him more proud than his son, Ranbir Kapoor’s, success. The family tradition will live on, but Rishi Kapoor will stand apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-passing-away-of-an-icon/story-0HGF7almxTfJAaXW0MTSmM.html
