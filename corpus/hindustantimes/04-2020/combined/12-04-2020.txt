A war is a war| Analysis||The description of the battle against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as a “war” has graduated from an analogy to a metaphor. The war metaphor is easily accessible. Most people feel that they are familiar with wars. But the war metaphor can have negative consequences in dealing with this crisis.Metaphors often shape our thinking about a problem — creating a social reality and guiding social action. To use professor Robert Entman’s phraseology, metaphorical framing can foreground a problem definition, causal interpretation, and moral evaluation. Certain policy recommendations then flow from this framing. For example, in India, efforts to reduce corruption have been characterised as a “war”. The demonetisation of high-value currency notes was described as a “surgical strike” on corruption. Checks and balances on revenue authorities and other “soldiers” in this “war” have been weakened considerably. And critics of this heavy-handed approach to a subtle, complex problem are often portrayed unfairly.Major wars and major epidemics are serious threats, but they differ from each other.First, in the Covid-19 crisis, the overarching objective is much more ambiguous than it is in a major war. The Covid-19 crisis comes from nature. As the lockdown shows, our efforts can also create significant hardships. We need to use the information available to make decisions so that the sacrifices are less than the suffering avoided over the long-term. If you don’t like to consider such trade-offs in terms of rupees, think in terms of lives and well-being. In a major war, where sovereignty is at stake, the overall objective is usually not subject to such trade-offs, and the choices have to do with the best way to achieve it.Second, even though certain areas may see greater disruptions, the overall outcome of a major war is the same for the entire country. But the outcomes in the Covid-19 crisis may be different across states and cities, depending on the background conditions and how each city and state responds. Further, given the differences in economies, health systems and administrative systems, suitable responses to Covid-19 may vary across cities and states.Third, the economics of major wars is different from the economics of dealing with Covid-19. Major wars require shutting down a large part of normal economic activity to divert people, materials, productive capacities and finances towards waging the war. But the Covid-19 crisis requires finding ways to continue many normal economic activities, while reducing the risk of transmission. Although the resource requirement of the direct public health response, which includes tracing, testing, isolating, and treatment, is much lower than that for a major war, if we don’t find ways to keep large parts of the economy working, the welfare costs will be quite high. And even if we breach the fiscal rules, we have limited fiscal capacity to mitigate these costs.Fourth, in a war, the government must lead and command, and others involved in the war effort mostly take directions. To be sure, the Covid-19 crisis has a key role for the government, but we should not assume that only the government has the answers in this crisis. Choices by individuals and families, collective action by communities, innovations by firms, and coercion by the government are all important.Given these differences, the use of the war metaphor is harmful because it skews our response to the crisis.One, the war metaphor allows certain political vices and cognitive biases of leaders to come into play. The tendency to over-centralise power and to avoid approaches that do not give direct control can go unchecked. The war metaphor privileges a command-and-control mode of thinking. This may be useful for some time, but as the crisis drags on, this approach will mean that our democracy’s key advantages — the ability to adapt and experiment and harness voluntary mobilisation and community action based on freely available information — may be lost.Two, the war metaphor makes it difficult to hold the government politically accountable for its actions, not just in this crisis but also relating to pre-existing problems. In India, the war metaphor makes it difficult to criticise the government, as we are generally expected to rally around against an external enemy. But given the nature of trade-offs in this crisis, public debate and accountability are necessary. Further, India had pre-existing problems that this crisis may accentuate, but “war” framing will make it difficult to address them. The Indian economy had been slowing down for seven quarters, with two components of demand — exports and capital formation — shrinking in the latest quarter. If hereon, a single reason — the war on Covid-19 — is given for all problems, we will lose the opportunity to understand the reasons and to make amends.To quote Bishop Joseph Butler, everything is what it is, and not another thing. An epidemic is an epidemic. A war is a war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-an-epidemic-is-an-epidemic-a-war-is-a-war-analysis/story-GPYKUbUptjocqZeeKr56WP.html
12-04-2020||News||For businesses, strategies to deal with the aftermath| Analysis||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has dealt a terrible blow to all of us. Such trying times require inspirational and innovative leadership. There are three de-risking strategies that can help us prepare for the pandemic’s aftermath.First, industries need to recast strategic and operational plans based on a revised risk assessment. Every industry will face a churn. In the short-term, the pessimistic environment will increase the power of buyers, while surplus inventory will decrease the power of suppliers. The competition will intensify, as holding the capability of high-ticket items such as real estate and automobiles decreases. Substitutes, such as working from home and digitisation, will emerge, and entry barriers will be altered as governments will fast track many sectors.Industries such as tourism, aviation, hospitality and travel will be devastated. This will create a domino effect down the value chain. Companies will face several unknowns. These will include the damage caused by Covid-19 in terms of human life, the duration of its impact, an increased focus on the climate crisis, negative market sentiments, deteriorating physical and mental health, and the time taken for the migrant labour to achieve pre-Covid-19 efficiencies. At least one annual cycle of first-time job entrants, both in the public and private sectors, will be thrown out of gear.This is not about cost-cutting or downsizing of existing plans. All previous plans have lost relevance, with no certainty of events beyond a few months. Organisations will now need to factor in the chilling possibility of losing key leadership personnel, relationships and business partners in the aftermath of the pandemic.This paradigm shift will require a drastic change in mindset and morale — the two key ingredients needed to sail through a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment.Second, industries must focus on realignment, retraining and re-skilling. The global economy was already tottering before the coronavirus crisis, but the pandemic has upended it. Companies will need new competencies and skills. Digitisation, automation and artificial intelligence will be accelerated in virtually every stream — education, health care, service industry, banking, entertainment, supply chain, transportation, food and government services. This will require a realignment of business processes, changes in curricula, development of new faculty, and reorientation of existing employees. Many employees will be untrainable, and many subunits will become unsustainable. The cogs in the intricately-connected machine will have to be re-engineered while it is running.Mindshare and resources devoted to learning and development are currently abysmally low in most organisations. There is no way companies can reorient their workforce with such inadequate capacity. If this supertanker needs to be turned around in time to save it, there has to be a single-minded focus on creating capability, executing unprecedented accelerated learning and realignment across all levels within the organisation.Third, industries should focus on culture-building and preserving tribal knowledge. Culture works as the rallying call around which organisations coalesce as a team. This is the time for leaders to learn from the history of their companies that helped them overcome adversities. It does not matter how old the company is, because even start-ups have their stories as do their founders. Whether it is a global pandemic or personal trauma, the grit and resilience required to overcome it is the same. This is the time to reiterate those struggles, and lessons learnt from them.A corollary to the storytelling organisation is the need to preserve tribal knowledge. During hard times, there is a tendency to downsize the “elder” and “redundant” employees.In the late 1960s, game parks in Africa faced a peculiar challenge of plenty. Their elephant population increased exponentially, affecting the ecosystem adversely. Culling or systematic killing of the excess population was the only practical solution. The rangers resorted to the Darwinian principle of the survival of the fittest and culled the old, infirm and sick elephants.This, however, wreaked havoc on the tribal memory and social structure of the herds. They could no longer find secret perennial watering holes during droughts or ancient routes across the game parks. When the young bulls noticed a sudden absence of elder elephants, indiscipline within the herd went up, leading to frequent fights, which were fatal for both the winner and the loser. Younger bulls tried to rut before puberty and turned rogue, threatening other elephants and tourists. The abrupt removal of social milestones and role models turned an otherwise amicable and well-adjusted herd into a squabbling and dangerous mob.Similarly, organisations will lose tribal knowledge, morale, relationships and social structures if they reduce headcount mindlessly. While some judicious whittling may be required, it is better to distribute frugality across the organisation than amputate large numbers or entire subunits.Like any economic crisis, Covid-19 will transform the business environment beyond recognition. Several companies will be devastated, many will fold, some will survive, and a few will thrive. The category the companies find themselves in will depend on their leaders leveraging the lull before the storm to think through these risks and implement mitigation strategies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/for-businesses-strategies-to-deal-with-the-aftermath-analysis/story-Q7KZm8nouo0PwjypmQPqFN.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||Curfew a trial by fire for critical patients, their families||Navneet Kaur, a Sector-50 resident, said, “My father is bed-ridden with blood disorders and kidney and brain degeneration. When the curfew was announced, my world turned upside down as his medical attendant couldn’t come home anymore. Trivial matters trigger him into a frenzy. He screams when he is hungry or cold.”Harmohinder Kaur, 82, has polio since birth. Her son, Navdeep Singh, a Sector-15 resident said, “We help feed her, bathe her, change her diapers. It’s very challenging in the absence of a nurse. ”These are just a few cases, wherein untrained family members have been left to cope with the special needs of critical or bed-ridden patients, after the lockdown deprived them of the appropriate care given by medical attendants. Unable to avail prescriptions or specialised medication after the curfew was imposed, patients and their families are at their wits end. A Sector-47 resident, whose 17-year-old son is suffering from cerebral palsy, said, “His medicines are not available with the pharmacy in the vicinity. I have begged the police to allow me to get his medicines in the last few days. Now, we also have no access to physiotherapy for him.”For others less fortunate, the curfew sounded a death knell. A Sector-38 resident lost his 98-year-old father a few days ago. “After his male nurse could not come home, my father’s condition worsened within days and he passed away,” he said. Another sales representative is worried about his bed-ridden 83-year-old father and is struggling to get passes for his attendants. Those who rely on regular prescriptions are in a fix, too. GS Uberoi, 82, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2016 and is on medication since. Amid the lockdown, he says getting medical aid is a struggle after his appointments with doctors got cancelled. The issue does not stop at availing movement passes, as a lack of co-ordination between states offers another hurdle. “After much pleading we got a curfew pass from Chandigarh, only to find out that we need permission from Punjab as well, as the caretaker lives in Kharar. And now, we will have to get it renewed after April 14,” said Navneet Kaur.Arun Kumar Gupta, UT health secretary, said, “We cannot grant curfew passes to caretakers for everyday travel because that defeats the purpose of the curfew. If some body is in dire need of an attendant, they can always have them stay at their home with the patient. We can issue passes for one-time travel.”-----------The 65-year-old wife of 73-year-old MK Jain, Madhu suffers severe pain in her hand. After being diagnosed with a skeletal deformity, her surgery was scheduled in the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital- Sector 16 on March 23. However, due to the lockdown, doctors refused to take up her case.After the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in Chandigarh, OPDs in five government hospitals including the PGIMER were closed and the scheduled surgeries were cancelled. Only emergency wards have been kept open at PGIMER, GMSH-16, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Sector 32, Manimajra Civil Hospital, Civil Hospital in Sector 45 and the Civil Hospital in Sector 22, while certain departments are available for tele-consultation. A PGIMER doctor said they have been given instructions to conduct surgeries and treatment only in case of life saving situations. “We request everyone to not visit the emergency ward unless it’s crucial because patients suffering critical illness will be far more susceptible to the virus and it will be far more difficult to save the patient,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/curfew-a-trial-by-fire-for-critical-patients-their-families/story-6qCiNxW9GsA8y68Kb3vlPJ.html
12-04-2020||City||PAU issues guidelines for operation, disinfection of harvesting, threshing machines||As movement of combine harvesters and other machines used for harvesting and threshing wheat has been allowed during lockdown, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has issued guidelines to ensure the safety of farmers, manpower and machines during the Covid-19 pandemic.Guidelines for cleaning and disinfection:Stage 1 Clean machinery with detergent water and sodium hypochlorite (1%)1. Cover electric parts of the tractor, combine with polythene.2. Prepare a solution using detergent and water and apply on required surfaces using any available sprayer like portable knapsack sprayer, preferably battery operated, or whichever is available. For large areas such as machinery sheds, high-capacity aero blasts or orchard sprayers may be more appropriate.3. Apply clean water on the surfaces. Wait for 10 minutes to dry.4. Again clean the area by using sodium hypochlorite (1%) solution or bleach solution in recommended dose.Stage 2 Disinfect frequently used surfacesThe most frequently touched surfaces such as steering wheels, throttle-lever, gear-shifting levers mirrors, feeding hoppers of threshers etc. should be wiped with an alcohol based rub or sprit rub. General Guidelines:Farmers should follow the dos and don’ts recommended by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of IndiaProtective gear such as gloves and masks should be mandatorily worn throughout the operation.Water bottles kept for use during field operations should be kept in a bag and should not be shared with anyone.The minimum number of healthy people should be seated on the tractor or combine and at maximum distance.Farmers or workers should regularly wash their hands with soap or detergent/disinfectant and avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth during work.Farmers or workers should not spit in public.Guidelines for safe operation of machinery:The tractor, combine harvester, straw reaper, thresher etc. should be well maintained. A piece of broken metallic blade or loose nut or bolt in the machine may cause fire. Ensure oil is not leaking.The battery, starter and all electrical connections should be in proper working condition and clean. Wire connections, especially at battery terminals, should be tight.Heat or sparks emitted by the silencer of an engine may cause fire. The silencer should be pointed away from the crop. The silencer should be fitted with a spark arrester.Crop surrounding transformers or electric poles should be harvested manually and moved away immediately. The area around transformers should be wet.Combine or straw reapers should be operated during day-time only to avoid chances of accident.Only fully mature crop should be harvested using a combine harvester. If the crop gets moist after rain, it should be dried before harvesting and threshing.If the crop is moist, its straw becomes soft and may wrap around rotating shaft of threshing cylinder and catch fire due to friction.Dry crops require less energy for harvesting and threshing. Also, grain breakage is minimum when the crop is dry.If a straw-reaper is operated near ground level, it may pick up pebbles, piece of bricks, nut-bolts or unwanted solid material lying in the field. The resulting friction in the machine may cause fire.The tractor, combine or machine should be parked away from the crop while making repairs.Water supply from nearby tubewells should be immediately available. A tanker or sprayer tank filled with water should be available near the field or in the village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pau-issues-guidelines-for-operation-disinfection-of-harvesting-threshing-machines/story-MmqQFV8MBe7tPVooRjkRnJ.html
12-04-2020||Delhi||200 homeless shifted to Haj Manzil after porta cabins at Kashmere Gate were set afire||As many as 150-200 homeless people, who lost their makeshift homes after two porta cabin shelters at Kashmere Gate were destroyed in a fire on Saturday, were on Sunday evening shifted to Haj Manzil, a two-storey building near Ramlila Maidan.The two shelter homes were set afire on Saturday allegedly by an agitated group of homeless people, a day after they clashed with civil defence volunteers and pelted them with stones. As a result of the clash, the police on Friday evening had resorted to lathi-charge to disperse the crowd, during which three men jumped into the Yamuna to evade the police. While two of them were rescued, the body of the third man was recovered from the river on Saturday.While no casualty was reported due to the fire, a case of rioting and arson was registered and seven men arrested on Saturday.Bipin Rai, member, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), said that 150-200 people who were living in these shelter homes were shifted to Haj Manzil. “The building has a capacity to house at least 1,000 people and therefore, we are planning to shift in the homeless from some other areas also. Their food and other requirements will be taken care of by the state administration and police,” Rai said.The deputy commissioner of police (North), Monika Bhardwaj, said her teams assisted DUSIB to relocate them. “We are providing them with any assistance required. Seven men were arrested on Saturday and our investigation is ongoing,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/200-homeless-shifted-to-haj-manzil-after-porta-cabins-at-kashmere-gate-were-set-afire/story-0UTSpUb5JmtI7eQcBNnhvJ.html
12-04-2020||Delhi||Eight detained for praying at gurdwara, FIR registered||Eight people were detained and a first information report (FIR) registered after a group of men were found to be praying at Gurdwara Sisganj in north Delhi in the early hours of Sunday, the police said. All of them were later released.The eight men have been served notices under the CrPc and the FIR has been registered under Indian Penal Code sections pertaining to disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant and negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life. The police said the congregation came to light around 2.15am on Sunday, when a team of Kotwali police station staff checked the gurdwara to find several people performing path (recitation of the religious text) . “There were over a dozen people assembled there. When they saw the police, they began running. We apprehended eight of them,” said Monika Bhardwaj, deputy commissioner of police (north district). None of them was wearing protective face masks and had violated the order that prohibits any gathering at religious places during the lockdown, said the officer.  Manjinder Singh Sirsa, the president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, said what the gatherers had done was wrong and pleaded with the Sikh community to offer prayers from their homes. “I have been appealing from the Gurdwaras to the Sikh community to stay indoors. The law is for all religions and we must rise above religion to ensure everyone is safe. I appeal to them again,” said Sirsa. Earlier, the police had registered a case against the management of the gurdwara in Majnu Ka Tila for violating prohibitory orders and the 21-day lockdown norms put in place to prevent the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes Covid-19, after 227 persons from Punjab were evacuated from there. They were later shifted to two quarantine centres in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/eight-detained-for-praying-at-gurdwara-fir-registered/story-ajNqG0FnbASTBijG1Zy6yH.html
12-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Happiness Classes, now a phone call away||At around 2pm Sunday, Rajni Kumar — mother to a class 7 student of a Delhi government school in Nand Nagri — received a text message from the state education department asking her to dial a number to learn about the “mindfulness” activity done during the Happiness Class at her son’s school.The moment she called the number, an automated message played at the other end: “Sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a deep breath and focus on your breathing. Pay attention to the inhaling and exhaling process. Open your eyes after three minutes of doing so. Ask your children about the changes they feel in their body during breathing,” the instructions played out in the 55-second recorded message.“This is the first time my son and I meditated together,” said Kumar, whose son, 11-year-old Aditya Kumar, studies in the Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV) in Nand Nagri. “With the possibility of the lockdown being extended, sending our children daily activities will ensure they have something to do with us and help them follow a daily routine.”The move comes a day after the Delhi government announced that beginning Sunday (April 12), it would send pre-recorded messages to parents of students in Delhi government schools up to class 8, to ensure they keep learning even during the lockdown.Through text messages and interactive voice response (IVR) calls, the education department said it will guide parents on how to “become teachers” and carry out step-by-step activities to conduct Happiness Classes and Mission Buniyaad at home.While Happiness Classes focus on helping build a student’s emotional quotient and honing their ability to deal with stress, the Mission Buniyaad initiative aims to improve learning levels of students studying in Classes 3 to 9 in government schools . The government said they planned to target over 800,000 children through the initiative. “When we do mindfulness in school, our classmates know about it, mostly. At home, I had to explain it to my family a little. All of us participated in the activity this morning and it made us feel peaceful,” said Aditi Negi, a class 7 student in RPVV Shalimar Bagh.Aditi’s mother Urmila Negi, who joined the mindfulness session on Sunday, said she believed the initiative would help many. “If families engage in an activity together, it is bound to reduce any prevailing tensions. While Covid-19 has become a source of stress in the country and we all remain home, our daughter is teaching us something new. She talks about doing mindfulness regularly and we too feel good about it.”The children were also asked to share their experiences of the event on class WhatsApp groups. “While we all talk about our thoughts and feelings during mindfulness sessions in class, not all students shared their experiences on the WhatsApp group today,” said Isha Poddar, a class 8 student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Sector 8 Rohini. “During the exercise, I was thinking about online classes and the tasty food my mother made,” she said, stifling a laugh.Pankaj Kumar, the Happiness Coordinator at RPVV Shalimar Bagh, said teachers had received guidelines on Saturday night to prepare various activities that could be recorded and distributed among children. “We have also thought of describing various activities on paper, so that parents don’t have to forward or rewind the audio while carrying the task out,” he said.A senior Delhi government official said teachers and principals were being roped in to ensure the activities reach as many children as possible. “The activities have been designed in such a way that they can be carried out using minimum resources and skills for all classes. Activities range from writing stories to number games for children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-happiness-classes-now-a-phone-call-away/story-UMTKicsf5lZM154hyd2DTL.html
12-04-2020||Delhi||DU teachers complain of harassment, abusive posts during online classes||As online classes in colleges across the Delhi University (DU) begin amid the lockdown, many teachers have complained that some “mischievous elements”, who are not on the rolls, were “misusing” the medium and harassing teachers with obscene messages and posts. Several teachers in DU colleges said they were abused and harassed by some attendees during the online classes. The teachers said they have informed the university administration about the misbehaviour.An assistant professor at a South Campus college, requesting anonymity, said he was taking an online class on the Zoom app last week when a person logged in and started writing obscene messages on the chat. “It was so sudden that it took us a few minutes to realise what was happening. It was embarrassing for us all. We had to abruptly suspend the class. We later went through the recorded video of the lecture to identify the person. We found that there is no student by the name in our class,” he said. Another faculty member, who teachers at an all-women college in west Delhi, said a person logged in to his class with the username of an adult movie actor, and started posting abusive messages against women. “It’s come to our notice that some outsiders are logging in to our classes using the links we send to our students every day on our college WhatsApp groups. We share our screen during the online classes with our students and everyone can use that and post their views and questions. We are trying to find out a way to address this issue,” the teacher said.DU executive council (EC) member Rajesh Jha said such incidents are being reported by many teachers over the last few days. “Several women teachers have also informed us that they were abused and harassed during these live classes. The teachers send the invites for live sessions on Zoom or Google Meet to their students every day. The students can log in simply by entering their names and email IDs. These incidents clearly indicate that students are sharing these invites with outsiders as well. Many countries are facing similar issues in conducting online classes,” he said.According to foreign media reports, Singapore banned some video conferencing applications for teaching purpose after hackers posted obscene images during the classes. DU Teacher Association (DUTA) secretary Rajinder Singh said they have also received some complaints from teachers. “Teachers have now started taking precautions. Some of them have told us that they immediately remove the person from class who writes or shares any unnecessary messages,” he said. A senior university official said they are looking into the matter. “We are aware of these incidents. We are looking into the matter and trying to fix it. We may file a police complaint in the matter soon,” a DU official said.Experts said educational institutions need to wisely choose the software tools they use for online classes.Apar Gupta, executive director at Internet Freedom Foundation, said, “There is always a chance of cybercrime or hacking while using software tools for any purpose. But the educational institutions can minimise that risk by choosing software tools that are more personal rather than using the popular ones. Also, there is a need to give proper training to teachers and instructors on how to handle such situations during a sessions.”The Internet Freedom Foundation, according to its website, is a digital liberties organisation that seeks to ensure that technology respects fundamental rights and that Indian citizens can use the Internet with liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-teachers-complain-of-harassment-abusive-posts-during-online-classes/story-cLVokQNgV0yNG2M67bC4EL.html
12-04-2020||Mumbai||Above-normal rainfall to reduce impact of Covid-19?||As the city settles into the summer, independent meteorologists have forecast above-normal rainfall this monsoon for Mumbai and its suburbs. The quantum of rain could reach 2,500mm during the four-month period (June to September), much above the seasonal average (2,317.2mm), and at par with the annual average (2,515mm for the entire year). The forecasts suggested that above-normal rain could help minimise the negative economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak.The unofficial forecasts come ahead of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) official one expected between April 15 and 20. Sridhar Balasubramanian, associate professor, IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B), predicted that the southwest monsoon could make early landfall over Kerala around May 28-30, while the onset over Mumbai is expected between June 11 and 13, much earlier than last year’s June 25.The normal onset date for Kerala has been June 1, and June 10 for Mumbai till last year. IMD will be announcing this year’s onset dates later this month.“A countrywide above-normal monsoon is expected at 100-105% of the long period average (LPA). While south India can expect excess rain, north India may end in deficit,” Balasubramanian said. India defines average or near-normal rainfall as rainfall between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 89cm for four months.“This means good water supply for most parts of India, which could minimise the negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the country’s economy as it is largely dependent on agricultural production,” said Balasubramanian.Independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, UK, Akshay Deoras said that rainfall during the first half of 2019 and the entire 2018 monsoon season was strongly influenced by the presence of El Niño which will be absent this season. “This should help the economy provided the supply chain of seeds and pre-sowing activities are not affected by the lockdown beyond mid-May,” he said. Deoras said that the effect of the lockdown had nothing to do with below-normal maximum temperatures over Mumbai and surrounding areas over the last fortnight as opposed to hotter conditions during this period in previous years. “Typical maximum temperatures have not been observed in Mumbai and Maharashtra since the lockdown commenced,” said Deoras. “This is unlikely due to the lockdown since weather models, which had no idea of the sudden lockdown, were continuously projecting reduced temperatures in the past fortnight.”Monthly forecast for Mumbai, MaharashtraMonsoon onset over Mumbai could commence on a strong note in June and then get a little sluggishOverall, June will have normal rain followed by a better performance in July and August but may be marginally below normal during SeptemberThe outlook for Maharashtra is good as coastal districts and central Maharashtra are expected to receive normal rain while Marathwada and Vidarbha may witness near-normal rain.“This is likely to give a boost to the economic situation with above-average water levels in dams. However, we should be prepared for flood-like situations with the probability of heavy rains, especially during July and August,” said Balasubramanian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/above-normal-rainfall-to-reduce-impact-of-covid-19/story-25x2IaZjXIJNmcEXUEPiTL.html
12-04-2020||City||Daily wage earners from 350 families in Thane face hardships||Around 350 families living in Thane’s Vangani area, around 60km from Mumbai, are struggling to make ends meet amid the lockdown. Most of these families are of daily wage labourers and those working at small-scale industries who had been employed under the skill development scheme. Some used to sell ornaments and other items on trains. Almost all the families have at least one visually-impaired member. With residents forced to remain at homes, these families have no means to earn money to buy the essential commodities. One of the residents, Sunil Havle, 42, works in Bandra as a masseur. He was paid only for 10 days in March. “We ate less as the provisions have started to get over,” said Havle.Another resident, Padma Amolik, 35, earns a living by making paper plates at a small-scale firm. With her factory shut, she unable to make ends meet. “Our groceries got exhausted a couple of weeks ago. My husband is ill. With no money and food at home, it has been difficult to survive. Hopefully, after the lockdown ends, I can get back to work and earn.”Amolik said a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Habitat for Humanity India, is helping around 100 families with basic grocery and have also accommodated around 15 families in a nearby building.“The groceries provided by them will suffice for a few days,” Amolik said. The NGO has been supplying residents with a kit, comprising wheat flour, rice, edible oil, sugar, varieties of dal, spices, toothpaste, soap, washing powder, dish washing liquid and other essentials, Rajan Samuel, managing director of Habitat for Humanity India, said. “We want to ensure that their lives are not disrupted and they continue to have access to food and other necessary items. If a disaster hits, it is always the poor conditions who struggle the most, said Samuel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/daily-wage-earners-from-350-families-in-thane-face-hardships/story-A6rkwS3WRMS2c6CXu9N6GO.html
12-04-2020||City||Maharashtra can test 6,000 samples a day; capacity to go up by 2,000||As the number of cases continues to rise, the Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD) has increased the daily testing capacity of the state to 6,000, the highest in the country. The state plans to increase its capacity by 2,520 more, once eight medical colleges and 13 universities get a nod from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The first case of Covid-19 was reported in Maharashtra on March 9. Then, the state had only one testing facility – National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, which was conducting 25 tests a day. Anticipating a further rise in the number of cases, the state health department soon started testing facilities in seven government- and civic-run medical institutes. By the end of March, the number of asymptomatic patients saw a jump of 65%, after which the health experts raised the need to run more tests to break the chain of infection. The state had tied up with four private labs –Thyrocare, Suburban Diagnostics, Metropolis Healthcare Limited and Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research Centre. But recently, with the approval of ICMR, 11 more private labs were added to the list. “Currently, all government labs [there are more than four labs in the state now] together have a testing capacity of 2,500 daily. With the addition of 3,500 tests at 15 [earlier 4+newly added 11] private laboratories, the number has increased to 6,000,” said Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary of MEDD. “This is the highest testing capacity that any state in India has,” he said.Till Saturday, 35,668 tests were conducted across the state, of which, 21,115 were carried out in government laboratories and 14,553 in private laboratories. The data released by ICMR shows that Maharashtra’s testing capacity is followed by Telangana where 10 private labs have got approval, followed by Tamil Nadu with 9. “Eight medical colleges and 13 universities have applied to ICMR to allow them to run tests for Covid-19. Each of these centres can run 120 tests a day in three shifts,” he said.The waiting period for permission, too, may become shorter as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Nagpur has become an approving agency. So all scrutiny for validation will be either done by NIV or AIIMS, Nagpur. Medical experts have often criticised the approval process of ICMR as slow. Mukherjee said, “Sars-Cov-2 is extremely infectious and is a BSL-2 (biosafety level-2) agent, which needs to be handled in a biosafety cabinet using standard precautions. The apex body needs to be stringent about the requirements for safety of others.” With growing cases of asymptomatic patients, the state health department has also changed the standard operating procedure (SOP) to test people. Earlier, people either with travel history or those who have come in a close contact with any infected person were tested. “Now, in addition to people with risk factors, patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) are also being tested,” he added.Meanwhile, taking note of the outbreak of viruses, ICMR along with Indian Medical Council (IMC) has instructed all medical colleges, both private and government-run, to run viral-diagnosis labs for training. “It is a good move which will keep the logistics ready in time for a crisis like this and also give experience to students,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, director of major hospitals||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-can-test-6-000-samples-a-day-capacity-to-go-up-by-2-000/story-wj8oy7XTJgZI18962SxqlJ.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||‘Govt unsympathetic to small-scale industrialists’||City-based industrialist Gagandeep Singh, believes the government had been unmindful to the plight of small-scale industries when it imposed the lockdown. Gagandeep, 38, runs a casting unit on Dabba Road with his father Tarlochan Singh. They have 12 employees most of whom hail from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. “The government has asked us to pay workers’ salaries and provide them with groceries but they have hardly taken into account our financial condition. We have our own expenses to meet and with operations shut we are struggling,” he says. Ask him what should be done to alleviate industrialists’ concerns, Gagandeep says, “The government should exempt electricity bills, waive interest on cash credit (CC) limits, overdraft (OD) limits and clear pending GST refunds so that we are able to survive these difficult times and also help our workers.” Gagandeep, a father of two, says he has been in constant contact with all his workers and had already provided them with grocery supply for a month.“I have been trying to help them as much as I can but I do not know how long I will be able continue. Small-scale industrialists like me are in the dire need of some relaxation as we also have our family to look after,” he said.Gagandeep, a Model Town Extension resident, says he spends the lockdown helping his wife and mother with household chores and making sure his kids catch up with school work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/govt-unsympathetic-to-small-scale-industrialists/story-w8EIxc2L7VYpA1p7vLLgTO.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||Lucrative jobs in hand, but Chandigarh graduates stare at hazy future amid Covid-19 lockdown||Even after landing lucrative offers during campus placements, students of tricity’s educational institutes are uncertain about their future amid the Covid-19 lockdown.Most of the students, who got placed before the lockdown began, are apprehensive about their joining. Also, the looming crisis has increased the fear of offers getting revoked.At University Business School (UBS), Panjab University, a total 103 students have been placed in companies such as American Express, Tolaram Group, HSBC and Infosys, during the campus placement drive this year. A 23-year-old UBS student, Parth, bagged the highest package of ₹55 lakh. He said, “I have to join in Nigeria after my examinations, but we do not know when examinations will be conducted. A lot depends on the operation of international flights.”Chairperson of UBS, Deepak Kapur, said, “So far no offer has been revoked by any company. The university is yet to decide on how and when to conduct the examinations.”Over 5 lakh students are enrolled in Panjab University (PU), Chandigarh University (CU), Punjab Engineering College (PEC), Chitkara University, over 10 PU affiliated colleges and other technical institutes in the city.Students, who are already placed, have not received the final offer letters. At PU’s University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET), around 300 students were placed this year. “Due to the lockdown, many students have not received final offer letters from the companies,” said Shagun Priya, placement coordinator at UIET.Dheeraj Sanghi, director of Punjab Engineering College (PEC), said, “We are in touch with the companies and no withdrawal of job offers has happened so far.”Himani Sood, director of placements at Chandigarh University, Mohali, said, “We have not stopped our placement drive. There could be deferred joining and I think few offers may even get cancelled.”An official from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali, said, “A large number of our students have received offers for research from institutions around the world. Because of the Covid-19 outbreak and the consequent measures implemented by various countries, there has been an effect on the operationalisation of many of these offers. The PhD and master’s thesis research offers received by students still stand. However, students have been informed that the start of their respective programmes may be delayed.”Around 150 students were placed this year at Goswami Ganesh Dutta Sanatan Dharma College in Sector 32. “There would be a delayed joining of those students who have been placed. And chances are that those companies may cancel the placements, which were underway before the lockdown began,” said Kapil Dev, training and placement officer of the college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lucrative-jobs-in-hand-but-chandigarh-graduates-stare-at-hazy-future-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-Sz3Kw3cGzixvUKztYsVSBI.html

Often, by the time police teams reach, the violator has already gone back inside,” said a police official, familiar with many such situations.The official added most residents called only to alert the control room, but didn’t give a formal complaint to avoid conflicts with neighbours. It’s difficult to take action in the absence of a complaint or photographic proof, he said.Helpline number 112 provides collective services of police, ambulance and fire department.Residents also took it upon themselves to notify police about their neighbours who had returned from abroad before the international flights were suspended on March 23. “Although an official list of foreign travellers was maintained by us, we still got many calls about such people. On a few occasions, the information proved vital for us,” said Nilambari Jagadale, senior superintendent of police (SSP).PEOPLE CALLING FOR ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES AS WELLWith UT police supplying daily ration and cooked food to people in the city regularly, the control room received 1,456 calls for essential commodities.“Desperate people in dire need of essential commodities call the control room. We respond swiftly and make sure that anybody, who genuinely doesn’t have food or essentials, is taken care of,” Jagadale added.There were 426 calls for queries on Covid-19, 326 by senior citizens seeking help and 200 by residents curious about the lockdown.Several residents also called for details of testing laboratories, quarantine centres and treatment facilities in their vicinity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pcr-lines-ringing-most-about-curfew-quarantine-violators-in-chandigarh/story-eilaNF1xxDbKCuDYIf5WoL.html
12-04-2020||City||Mansa: Cotton purchase starts, mandi board to test staggered procurement model||To test the working of the staggered wheat procurement plan, the Punjab State Agricultural Marketing Board authorities have decided to resume cotton purchase in Mansa district from Monday on a similar pattern.Under the plan, farmers will be issued coupons to enter the mandi premises to sell their pending stock of raw cotton.State cotton coordinator Rajnish Goel told HT that arhtiyas have been roped in to invite 20 farmers in a day to ensure adherence of the pandemic safety protocol.He said the stock will be purchased by the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) at the minimum support price (MSP).“Coupons issued to farmers by the local mandi officials will serve as curfew passes. Farmers will be allowed to sell their pending stock at designated spots in the mandi. Limited arrival of farmers will be ensured to maintain social distancing during the process,” said Goel.As per the state mandi board officials, 9.40 lakh quintal of cotton has already been purchased in Mansa and an estimated 50,000 quintal is still lying with the farmers in the district. In Punjab, an estimated 5 lakh quintal of cotton is yet to arrive in the mandis.Cotton purchase was suspended after curfew was imposed in Punjab on March 23.Goel said the cotton purchase will help in identifying gaps for staggered wheat procurement plan.“After experimenting with 20 farmers in Mansa, we will gradually increase the allowed number to 40. In the second phase, a similar plan will be introduced to benefit cotton farmers in Bathinda, Faridkot, Fazilka and Muktsar districts,” he added.State agriculture department director Sutantar Kumar Airi, wheat harvesting in Punjab will begin from April 15 but a sizeable area in south Malwa belt will witness it after April 20.Meanwhile, sources in the CCI said the agency is ready to restart the purchase of cotton. “After CCI raised the issue of overstocking in various warehouses, the state authorities began granting permits to transport ginned cotton in Mansa and other districts. We are working to move cotton seed to buyers in Punjab and other places,” a CCI official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mansa-cotton-purchase-starts-mandi-board-to-test-staggered-procurement-model/story-aRUyKgasVotMtbJNeb5HUN.html
12-04-2020||City||Doctors, nurses of Chandigarh’s PGIMER pool in money to buy safety gear||They want to take no chances, so doctors and nurses are pooling in their money to buy Covid-19 safety gear even as the country faces a shortage and supplies ordered from abroad get delayed.Even as city hospitals have stocks of 2,903 personal protection equipment (PPE) and 39,481 N95 masks according to the health department, the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has a strict protocol to distribute protective equipment according to risk exposure in all departments.A high-risk zone includes the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) section; Covid-19 sample and testing centres; the ICU/ critical care ward where aerosol generating procedures are done; clinical management in isolation); dead body packing (Covid or suspected Covid), and mortuary- performing autopsy. Safety gear provided in these areas includes N-95 masks, gloves, gown or coverall, goggles, head and shoe cover.Moderate risk areas where only N95 masks are provided include the triage area in OPD, other patients in emergency and doctors’ chambers in the few functional OPDs. Triple layer mask and gloves are being provided in low-risk areas.Money is being pooled by faculty members, senior residents, nurses and technical staff for N95 masks and gloves in departments for cardiology, radiology and others that don’t have any safety barriers.Dr Yashpaul Sharma, head, cardiology department, said, “Mortality among heart surgeons has been reported. Since we are working with patients who are reporting to hospital with cardiac issues we do not know if the person has Covid-19. So safety is important. The PGIMER protocol does not provide the requisite protective gear in wards and CCU.” Dr Uttam Thakur of the Association of Resident Doctors, PGIMER, said they were also helping the hospital’s management stock PPEs.“The supply is short. But dedicated Covid-19 hospitals are getting it. We along with administration are trying to procure good quality PPEs and masks which are in short supply. People are contacting us with donations which we are facilitating. The administration cannot be held responsible for shortage as they are also trying hard to overcome this,” Dr Thakur said. Satyaveer Dagur, general secretary, Nurses Welfare Association at the institute, said they had procured around 60 PPEs and a few hundred masks.“Since full PPEs are not provided in the emergency ward, we have given nurses PPEs to use when they have doubts regarding the status of patient. At least some protection is better than nothing,” he said.HOW MUCH CAN THEY DONATEA faculty member from the cardiology department can donate Rs 5,000, and a senior resident Rs 2,000, with Rs 1,000 fixed for nurses and technicians. Though PGIMER is accepting donations through its bank account as well as other material, there is no bar on the procurement of safety equipment by any healthcare worker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/doctors-nurses-of-chandigarh-s-pgimer-pool-in-money-to-buy-safety-gear/story-SjTomH4mcNhGOyiKJIyyzI.html
12-04-2020||City||Amid corona curfew, plumbing, electricity repairs may soon be essential services in Chandigarh||With curfew in the city all set for extension, the UT administration may soon include “emergency at home” under essential services.Confirming the development, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said: “The essential service definition may be expanded to include ‘emergency at home’. We are awaiting the Government of India’s instructions to finalise it.”Giving more clarity on what this means, a senior UT official, requesting anonymity, said: “People are facing problems at home relating to electricity, plumbing and other things that require urgent repairs.As the period of curfew extends beyond three weeks, more and more such issues would crop up, creating lots of problems for the people. A plan is being worked out so that such problems can be attended to.”As per the curfew order of March 24, only those shops providing essential commodities, such as ration, food, groceries, fruits and vegetables, dairy and milk, meat and fish, and animal fodder, are allowed to be opened for a limited period of time during the day.Meanwhile, the administration will continue with strict restrictions on the staff allowed to attend its offices. Only a skeleton staff will be allowed in UT offices, as being currently done. The administration is also against opening up public dealing offices, such as the Registration and Licensing Authority and Sampark centres.“The administration is waiting for detailed orders from the central government regarding functioning of offices. We will follow the Centre’s pattern for operating important offices only with skeleton staff,” said Parida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-corona-curfew-plumbing-electricity-repairs-may-soon-be-essential-services-in-chandigarh/story-SFq7oEcewr2vA3J39Iqn7H.html

12-04-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana industry unable to pay labourers’ salaries, seeks govt help||The owners of local industries and business establishments have expressed their inability to pay salaries of labourers due to closure of factories in the wake of coronvirus outbreak. A day after the administration issued warning to the industry, the owners of these units rued that the government cannot legally force the employers to pay salaries and stop them from layoffs as there is no such provision in either the Disaster Management Act or Epidemic Control Act. Further, the separate provisions for Industrial Dispute Act also overrule this order.The industry was of the view that the government should use the unutilised funds lying under different government departments/schemes, including ESIC, MGNREGA, Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana etc, for payment of wages and salaries to the staff. National president of All Industries and Trade Forum, Badish Jindal, said that around 1.70 lakh crore is lying unutilised with the government under different schemes and it should be used to pay the labourers. Rather than putting an extra burden on the industry, the government should step forward to help it come out of this crisis. President of Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association, Jaswinder Singh Thukral, president of Dhandari Industrial Welfare Association, Satnam Singh Makkar and president of Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO), Gurmeet Singh Kular, also opposed the administration’s decision saying that the industry is already burdened with bank installments, property tax, water-sewer charges and fixed charges on electricity bills.If the sector does not receives any payment then how it is supposed to pay workers, said Thukral, adding that they are already giving ration and subsistence allowance to the labour.President of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, Arvinder Pal Singh Makkar, said that small businessmen are already facing losses as the establishment are closed due to the lockdown and there is no clarity when the restriction will be lifted. The government and the administration should not cause panic among the industrialists, who already suffering losses.The industrialists rued that even the government departments, including Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), have capped the salary of its employees and have fixed a certain amount, which would be paid to then rather than full salary for the lockdown period. President of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturer Association, DS Chawla, asked how the government can force the industry even when its own departments are not making full payments to their employees. They understand that everyone, including the government, is facing crisis, then why would they expect the industry to pay salaries, said Chawla.Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal said the decision has been taken by the central government and if the industrialists are unable to make full payments to the labour, they can give subsistence allowance to the labour for now, so that they can cater to their daily needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-industry-unable-to-pay-labourers-salaries-seeks-govt-help/story-2jCgSkPaGqm52NrUI9hLRL.html

The most-affected ward, G south (covering areas like Worli and Lower Parel), saw a marginal rise of three Covid-19 positive patients on Sunday. Civic officials said the rise in the number of cases in Dharavi is becoming a cause for concern. Of the 15 new cases in the country’s largest slum, nine were already quarantined at a facility set up by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as they were high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients from Madina Nagar, Muslim Nagar, and Social Nagar.Apart from these, six cases were found from a fresh slum pocket, Shastri Nagar, where no previous case of Covid-19 was reported. The remaining two cases have been reported from Janata housing society. All 15 new patients (13 men, 2 women) are aged between 18 and 66. In all, there are 13 areas of Dharavi where 43 positive cases have been found. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G North ward, said, “Our health staff is visiting slums in Dharavi and conducting door-to-door surveys of residents.”Since Saturday, the BMC has screened 7,135 residents of Dharavi, of which 82 were referred for testing and swab samples of 40 people have been collected. Meanwhile, in G South ward, only three new cases were reported, taking the count to 246. On April 7, the total number of cases in G South ward was 133, which rose to 184 the next day (increase of 51 cases), followed by 199 cases on April 9 (increase of 15 cases) and 243 cases on April 10 (increase of 44 cases).

The three cases are from the houses belonging to the extended family of the 42-year-old panch, who was the first to test positive on April 4.An 81-year-old man from Mundi Kharar also tested positive on Saturday after his 78-year-old wife’s reports came out positive following her death on April 7. Other family members, however, have been given the all-clear.The first case in the district was reported on March 20. The district has witnessed two deaths while five people have been cured so far. The active cases as of now are 47.Amid the developments, the Punjab government declared six areas in the district as Covid-19 hotspots, including Jawaharpur, Phases 3A, 5 and 9 besides Sectors 69 and 91.

Around 23 reports, some of them from Jawaharpur, were awaited. On a positive note, Dr Singh added that all the patients in various Mohali hospitals were responding well to treatment. One was likely to be discharged soon as her first report had been negative.Commenting on a mix-up of samples on Saturday of two women with identical names, one a policewoman on duty at Jawaharpur and another a resident of the village, deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said they would be retested. Both had tested positive. He said the count would be included in the total tally only after the confusion gets cleared by Monday.Jawaharpur village has emerged as the biggest Covid-19 cluster in Punjab, with most patients from the extended family of the sarpanch and two panches. The district administration has already declared the village, having a population of 3,000, a containment zone, completely banning the movement of people.

12-04-2020||City||Humanity thrives in the face of Covid crisis||Thousand kilometers away from his home in Nepal, Mohammad Bhoj Ray spent 11 days at the Ambala civil hospital before he tested negative for Covid-19 in subsequent reports and got discharged on Saturday.The 65-year-old man had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi last month, and was admitted to the isolation ward after he was found to be infected. Though meals to several patients and their attendants were being provided through a food bank set up by an NGO, its services were suspended during the initial days of the local outbreak. At that time, doctors and nurses rose to the occasion and brought homemade food for Ray, said civil hospital senior medical officer Dr Sheelkant Pajni. “As he didn’t have an operational mobile phone, the medics on duty would even lend him their phones to contact his family in Nepal or friends in Ambala,” he added. In March, Ray, along with his friends, had travelled from Beergunj in Nepal to Nizamuddin Markaz for the first time. After spending a week in Delhi, he proceeded to Ambala. On March 31, the local administration traced at least three dozen jamaat attendees and asked them to isolate themselves inside mosques where they had been putting up.Dr Tulit Chhabra, a general surgeon at the civil hospital, who was the first to examine Ray, said, “About 15 people were lodged in a masjid in cantonment, three of whom showed flu-like symptoms, including Ray.”They were brought to the hospital, where two of them were found infected, he added. “Ray, whose age made him more vulnerable to complications, was already missing his family. From taking care of his diet to helping him in speaking with his family and friends, the hospital staff did everything possible for his quick recovery,” SMO Pajni said. Being a senior citizen, he panicked often, but our doctors counselled him regularly, he added. Ray is, however, one of the nine foreigners booked under the Foreigners Act besides sections of the IPC. Ambala SP Abhishek Jorwal said, “He has now been quarantined at a school in cantonment. The decision on his deportation will be taken after his 14-day quarantine period ends.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/humanity-thrives-in-the-face-of-covid-crisis/story-KMgXemU33iDomlZcZuFRWL.html
12-04-2020||Mumbai||Red, orange, green: Zones based on coronavirus cases likely in Maharashtra||State health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday hinted that districts in Maharashtra could be divided into three zones –red, orange and green – depending on the number of cases to decide on the rules to be imposed during the lockdown which has now been extended further.Districts where there are no Covid-19 cases will fall under green zone, while those with up to 15 cases will fall under the orange zone, and districts, where there are over 15 cases, will fall under the red zone. According to Tope, Mumbai city, Mumbai suburban, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Aurangabad, Pune, Sangli, Nashik, Ahmednagar and Raigad districts would be in the red zone, as they have a high number of cases. As per April 11 data, Mumbai, MMR, Pune have 91% of the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. Bhandara, Gadhchiroli, Chandrapur, Wardha, Parbhani, Nanded, Nandurbar, and Solapur districts have recorded no cases and could fall in the green zone. Amravati, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Kolhapur, Satara, Osmanabad, Hingoli, Jalna, Washim, Beed, Dhule, Gondhiya, Yavatmal districts can come under the orange zone, where certain activities, including opening up of minimum public transport, etc, could be allowed.The state government intends to start some industrial activities, basic movement within districts that are so far unaffected by the coronavirus. A senior Mantralaya official said that no decision has been taken on the zones yet as they are awaiting an advisory from the Centre on what exactly can be allowed in the green and orange zones. “Besides, the political class and even bureaucrats are divided over it. Some have a cautious and conservative approach, while others are asking how long can we remain under lockdown and let the economy suffer,” he said requesting anonymity.The relief and rehabilitation department and the industries department are chalking out a proposal to allow micro, small and medium enterprises to start operations in green and orange zones. Besides, the large industries can start their production provided they keep their employees in a “lock-in”, follow social distancing, and carry out basic medical check-ups on employees on the premises.A senior bureaucrat said the state government could reach a decision by Monday evening on what can be allowed. The boundaries of the orange and green zones will, however, be sealed and inter-district travel will not be allowed. “It is a complex decision. Most senior decision-makers have made up their mind [to allow relaxation], but how much can be accommodated is being discussed. The chief minister is weighing the pros and cons,” he said.A third bureaucrat said the state should start industries and businesses in Maharashtra as a prolonged shutdown would impact the economy for the third time in the past four years after demonetisation, roll out of goods and services and now coronavirus outbreak. “We cannot keep businesses shut and choke the economy. Look at what Germany has done. We are looking at preventive measures to be taken where production can start. From lockdown, we can go to lock-in by having fewer people. They can house people on-site, have doctors, monitor health, avoid crowding and decentralise systems. It is not always a conveyor belt system in production; component processing can geographically be segregated, while integration can happen in one place. All options are being studied,” the officer said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/red-orange-green-zones-based-on-coronavirus-cases-likely-in-maharashtra/story-U3pKo9jKMghUdPNI3EIY1I.html

After he was stopped at a check post, he revealed that he had stored more liquor at home,” said DSP Varinderjit Singh Thind, adding that later 32 boxes containing 384 liquor bottles were seized from his house.VILLAGERS WORRIED OVER BOOZE SUPPLYMeanwhile, the villagers have expressed concern over the “unmonitored movement of liquor suppliers”. They claimed that at a time when the district administration is “struggling to streamline” the delivery of essentials, they feared that seeking out liquor would result in the spread of coronavirus.Irked by the booze supply, Lubana villagers had been complaining about the issue for the past many days. “Amid no employment, my husband has brought suffering to the children and embarrassment by selling wheat donated by an NGO to buy liquor,” said a distressed woman from Sangatpura village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nabha-cops-say-booze-being-home-delivered-seize-564-bottles/story-qvlxkSKGTYULMkXP2gpllJ.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana divided over delivery of cooked food by restaurants via mobile apps||The administration’s decision to allow the delivery of cooked food from restaurants through mobile app orders has divided the city with a majority of residents, including a few councillors, opposing the move.Even restaurant owners stand divided over the issue with the president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association, Amarvir Singh, opposing the decision, citing that the home delivery of food might also increase chances of infection.However, the restaurant owners, who have started supplying food, said all precautions were being taken while preparing and delivering food.Restaurants and eateries, which have commenced the delivery of cooked food through apps, are situated in Sarabha Nagar, the Ferozepur Road, College Road, Feroze Gandhi Market, Dugri areas, etc. Their opponents, however, have taken to the social media stating that cooked food of restaurants was not an essential commodity.Congress councillor Parvinder Lapran has also opposed the move in one of the videos shared on social networks. Lapran said, “A complete lockdown has been announced and the administration is issuing strict guidelines every day. But, on the other hand, restaurants have been allowed to deliver food through mobile apps. Even ice-cream parlours are being allowed to operate.”Lapran questioned who was there to keep a check on the delivery boys and the health of cooks in restaurants. He said the virus might find an entry to houses through this system and the government should roll back the decision as lives of people were at stake.A resident of Model Town Extension, Gurkaran Singh, said, “On one hand, the administration is stopping residents from coming out and, on the other, the food packed in plastic bags, which can carry the virus, are getting entry into houses of residents.”Owners of restaurants, however, claimed that all precautions were being taken and the delivery was being made through Zomato and Swiggy only, as these companies have been allowed to operate by the administration.Bhupinder Basant, owner of Basant Restaurant, delivering food from three outlets, situated at the Foundation Chowk, Dugri and Feroze Gandhi Market, said all precautions were being taken while preparing and delivering food.The health of the staff working in restaurants was also being continuously monitored, he added.He said they had received a good response from residents as there are many people, including students in hostels, who needed cooked food.Basant said, “The Ice Cream Studio on the Malhar Road has been operating with all precautions. Zomato and Swiggy are also keeping a check on the health of delivery boys.”A resident of Kitchlu Nagar, Gurbir Singh, said, “There is no harm in allowing the restaurants to operate and deliver food. But, owners and the staff should take all the precautions. Even the ration and vegetables are being supplied in plastic packs.”Deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said, “Permission has been given to those restaurant owners, who had applied online in the past and the service has been initiated on a trial basis. Regular inspections are being carried out at these establishments to keep a check on hygiene and health of the staff. If we find any anomalies in the system, then the system will be scrapped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-divided-over-delivery-of-cooked-food-by-restaurants-via-mobile-apps/story-ax4YWT82gmzoR9t5KP8uPO.html

12-04-2020||City||Risky to treat patients sans gear, say dentists||Tarn Taran: God forbid, if you needed dental treatment, other than those ailments that antibiotics can cure. Dentists say they cannot do any physical treatment of teeth, until the threat of the virus subsides. Some doctors are even going on to say that they can work only after a vaccine is invented. Dr Sanjeev Sharma, general secretary of Indian Dental Association, Amritsar, said, “We have asked all dentists not to open clinics, but continue giving free consultation to patients on phone. There is no way we can offer treatment physically until a vaccine for the virus is invented. When physical therapy, like teeth cutting, extraction and RCT, is done, droplets from the patient’s mouth and nose fly in the air. Such particles can be dangerous for the health of all concerned, if there is infection.” “We are not supposed to treat patients physically, though, I am receiving calls from patients in excruciating pain. This is only for the health and safety of patients. Suppose a coronavirus patient comes to us for treatment, he or she can infect the whole clinic,” says a dentist Sher Singh, an endodontist (dentist specialising in treatments like root canal etc). He added, “We can’t even treat emergency patients as the danger is so real. Even if we attempted, the logistical challenges and demand for PPEs and sanitisation just makes it near impossible for us to work.” Dr Sharma added that if a dentist was still giving physical treatment to dental patients, he or she was playing with lives. Dr Pankaj, medical officer (dental) at Patti Civil hospital in Tarn Taran, said, “The situation is very serious. Even machines used in dental care can be a source of infection that even PPE kits might not be a good defence against. Except severe emergency, we are not giving any dental treatment requiring physical contact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/risky-to-treat-patients-sans-gear-say-dentists/story-8rYnmROFVMGniHvsuZRsUI.html
12-04-2020||City||Start, stay on fitness habit||Amid the nationwide lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, people have become prone to developing a sedentary lifestyle. Most residents sit at one place as they watch television or use their mobile phones or read books. Experts say that staying in such conditions for long periods may even lead to an increase in appetite. What steps are you taking to stay fit during the lockdown period? EXPERT TAKEKeep yourself occupied The best way to remain fit while staying at home is to keep yourself occupied with some activity. When a person is sitting idle or feels bored, the stress level increases which further increases hunger. To avoid consuming more food, one should indulge in different activities such as kitchen gardening, cooking, etc. Also, consume vitamin C enriched food. Considering the upcoming economic recession, one should start utilising this time to prepare for the future. Make plans how one can work and earn using technology. It will keep you occupied. Further, do exercise, perform yoga, meditation and develop new hobbies. One should avoid thinking negative as it affects the health. Spend quality time with your family, call your relatives and friends, and recite prayers to stay positive and spread positivity among others as well. Dr SS Sibia, doctor of medicineREADER OF THE WEEKFollow health videos on YouTube Quarantine has made everyone realise the importance of time, health, family and work. This is a time to explore your own creative self. Staying healthy and fit is of utmost importance as staying home can make anyone lazy. I follow my normal routine for diet and workout. In the morning, I take a glass of hot water and lemon and walk in my garden for fifteen minutes to freshen up. For breakfast, I take oats and some fruits. Fruits are a must to stay healthy, especially during this time. In the evening, I play badminton and do some workout like aerobics and exercises which I watch on YouTube. Also remember to drink plenty of water during this time. Build a routine which is beneficial not only during the lockdown but also after that. Shivani Aggarwal, via emailMental, physical health go hand in handI am a 62-year-old retired banker. After the lockdown began, I made slight changes in my daily routine to keep myself fit. I aim to reduce the extra fat and lose around 10kg. Every day, I wake up at 4am and the first thing I do is drink hot water. Then I go to my roof top for the morning walk and exercise for 90 minutes. Around 8am, I drink tea and read the newspaper for around half-an-hour. I solve sudoko in the newspaper, which is a good brain exercise. I have been involved with different social circles since my retirement. As a curfew has been imposed, we have formed groups and pray at our houses. I make sure to watch one Punjabi movie every day and read books. Virender Jit Singh, DugriDon’t waste your time on the phoneDuring this lockdown, many children and older people are spending more time on the mobile phones, which is not a good habit. In our free time, we can read books to remain emotionally stable amid the crisis. A variety of combat strategies can be adopted by the government to keep the people occupied. For instance, bringing back the shows of Ramayana and Mahabharta was a good move. The children and the elderly can watch it together and learn more about these epics. Srishty, via emailDrink lemon waterAmid this lockdown, there is fair chance that we all can turn into a sluggard. To avoid this and stay healthy, I started doing yoga in the garden as the air is very clean now. This is followed by a glass of lemon water for detox. I make it a point to have at least four to five glasses of hot water and serve it to the rest of my family members too. Next, whenever I get a phone call, I adopt Idea’s mantra of “Walk n Talk”, and unconsciously cover a lot of steps. Ishita Mittal, via emailTime to adopt a healthy lifestyleThis home quarantine is a blessing in disguise as it can be utilised to adopt a healthy lifestyle. In the morning, I enjoy fresh air on the terrace and do yoga. I regularly practice Pranayaam and Surya Namaskaar and eat almonds soaked in water daily. Due to the lockdown, there is no intake of fried or junk food, which is good for the health. For me, playing card games with my family is a stress buster. After my dinner, I also prefer a light walk of 20 minutes on my terrace.Mandeep Rawat, Joshi NagarDo household work to remain busyMost of the time during the lockdown is spent eating, sleeping, watching TV and on the phone during the lockdown. As there are less physical activities, every evening, I walk or do jogging for at least 45 minutes on the terrace to maintain the balance. Sometimes I wake up early and do some household work to remain active.Nalini Nayyar, via emailTry doing squats in your houseThe problem isn’t in adopting a new routine, the problem is in maintaining it. To remain active in this lockdown, one can dance with his or her children, take out that old skipping rope and use it, do squats and push ups against the kitchen counter or walk briskly up and down the stairs. As the pollution level has decreased, one can go to the balcony. Also, don’t keep yourself too much updated with the news as it can depress you.Vincy Trehan, via emailAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boyAmid this lockdown, people are leading a sedentary lifestyle. Instead of being lazy, people should work upon themselves and stay fit and fine. A time management chart can help them achieve their procrastinated goals. Also, many gym enthusiasts have started their online workout programmes that can be easily followed at home. Some leading personalities are not using the lockdown as an excuse to slack off, instead, they’re inspiring their followers to get up and keep moving.Yuvika Sood, via emailTry new healthy recipesThis pandemic is affecting our physical and mental well being. As this lockdown has disturbed our regular schedule, I am trying to stay fit in this lockdown by exercising regularly at home, doing yoga and skipping rope. I wash my hands, sanitise the switches, mobile phones and other things more frequently than I used to. Good nutrition is an important part of leading a healthy lifestyle. I’m drinking plenty of water and trying new sugar-free and less-fat recipes to stay fit. Rajni Matta, Atam ParkBoost your immunityTo remain healthy, go for a walk, run or exercise at home. Boost your immunity by eating a vitamin-enriched diet and practice yoga everyday.Shivani Kumari, via emailEnsure your family is exercisingI exercise in my back garden and climb the stairs in my building to stay fit. Calling up family and friends has become a priority nowadays. I ensure that my father, who is 94-year-old, walks with his walker daily. After I finish all the household chores, I take a short break and tend to my flowers and vegetable plants. Gardening has become my source of immense pleasure and contact with nature. I’ve realised that it is extremely important to maintain your inner strength and sanity in a difficult time.Preeti Kaur, via emailDance to stay fitWith most of us stuck inside, understanding the different ways to keep active is vital for our wellbeing, especially for someone like me, who usually spends most of the time outside the house. Since two years, my life has been so hectic that I stopped paying attention to my fitness. This lockdown period has given me an opportunity to get back to it. I walk around briskly in my house. It is good to walk on the terrace when one is on the phone, rather than sitting down. These days, the weather in the evening is so pleasant that I spend around an hour on the terrace. Dancing is also a great way to stay fit and I have made an alternate-day plan for yoga and dance sessions.Mehak Arora, via emailHealth is wealthFor some people, this lockdown is boring and many feel like they are trapped in their houses. But this is not the case with children as they play all day. I also play badminton in the evening as it keeps me fit and is a good way to pass the time. I exercise for at least an hour and dance too. It’s the most entertaining time of the day for me. Everyone should be cautious regarding their health. This lockdown is to save us from a disease and not meant to get prone to any other disease. Dance is the best form of physical activity because it is entertaining and energetic. Simranjeet Kaur, Dugri Meditate for mental well-beingIn this crucial time of lockdown, it becomes mandatory for everyone to be mentally and physically fit. I do stretching exercises daily for my physical fitness and meditation for mental fitness. As people are becoming more prone to depression these days, it is important to take care of mental health also. Otherwise, routine work after this lockdown will become difficult. It is said that a sound mind lives in a sound body. Ishmanpreet Kaur, via emailMake most of this timeMost people are enjoying a sedentary lifestyle but it is giving rise to other diseases such as obesity. We can utilise our free time in doing those things which we were not able to do during our routine life. It’s the best time to make our body active and increase our stamina. I exercise lightly in the morning but heavily in the evening. I also make my family exercise along with me as it’s also a source of entertainment. I am following a strict diet and eat light. It’s also a great method to save money. Mansimran Singh, DugriDo yoga dailyIn this lockdown, I have got a lot of time to prepare for my higher studies. I try to eat less and work more. I am maintaining my fitness by skipping rope and doing yoga on a daily basis. For mental fitness, I and my family recite the Gurbani every evening. Mishpreet Kaur, via emailInvolve the whole family in exerciseThe best way to stay active in these times is to keep moving in the house. One can indulge themselves in household chores, walk when they are on the phone and involve the whole family in some physical exercise. I have made a fifteen-minute workout plan which I practice daily. With many workout videos surfacing online, you can access different types of plans and exercises that can be done in a limited space. One should also take care of the diet these days and not binge eat.Sanskriti Verma, via emailJoin an online gymCovid-19 has put a pause on everyone’s life. This lockdown makes everyone lazy and the sleeping schedule of many has been ruined due to Netflix and Amazon. This needs to be cured as when the lockdown is lifted, one may not be able to function properly. This lockdown can be a cause of obesity and diseases such as heart attack, sleeping issues, liver and gastrointestinal problems. Instead, people should make the most of this time and exercise daily. One can practice yoga, join an online gym wherein a trainer is on standby. Laveena Sharma, Haibowal KalanLimit food intakeExercise is very important in our life. If we keep sitting in one place, we tend to develop a bad posture and our blood circulation decreases. This can further lead up to depressive thoughts. One can opt for yoga, meditation, a walk on the terrace, indoor sports and exercises such as badminton and chess to be physically and mentally fit. Or one can just put on some music and dance. It releases endorphins and elevates the mood. As we are not that physically active the way we used to be, we should consider limiting our food intake. Also, eating food while watching the television is detrimental to our health and we end up having no control over the intake. Hence, it should be avoided. Mankamal Malhi, via emailOpportunity for personal growthNot only is the lockdown impacting people’s physical health but is also taking a toll on their mental health. We have the choice to either succumb to psychological pressure of the pandemic or use the opportunity for personal growth. One must ensure that he/she is in living in a well-ventilated room and is eating healthy, getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and maintaining a routine. Writing down thoughts and feelings can help offload any worries and fears that one may have. It’s also important to stay busy, whether that means going for a walk or learning a new skill. Exercising, practising yoga and meditating help one stay fit mentally as well as physically.Khushboo Singla, via emailDanger of developing sedentary lifestyleThis forced vacation period should be utilised for constructive purposes. At this crucial time, there is a danger of developing a sedentary life style. Most people are always glued to the television or their mobile phones. According to health experts, such a lifestyle results into unhealthy dietary patterns. People do not do any physical exercise to burn calories. To stay fit, people should go for a morning walk daily and perform yoga under the guidance of an expert. Reading good literature at this time is a good option to stay mentally healthy.JBS Nanda, Model Town ExtensionStart your day with a walkTo keep one’s body fit during the lockdown period, he/she must start the day with a 20-minute walk and 10 minutes of breathing exercises. He/she must consume some warm turmeric-induced water which helps boost the immune system, before having a healthy breakfast. One must also have a wholesome lunch comprising vegetables and curd and have a glass of warm water after dinner to aid digestion.Tajinder Kaur, via emailMental fitness equally importantThis lockdown offers an opportunity for us to set a personalised physical fitness routine which may be continued even afterwards. Skipping rope, stretching, performing yoga and body weight exercises can do the trick. The mental fitness of an individual is equally important which may be strengthened by reading holy scriptures and books of one’s taste. Too much screen time would prove to be detrimental.Gurkirat Singh, Model Town ExtensionGymming at homeThe lockdown is crucial but it can have an impact on our well-being and health. Being inactive is bad for your health, both physically and mentally. Firstly, one should accept that the body is a gift given by god and respect it by taking care of it. One can engage in their favourite hobbies and utilise this time. For me, the best way to stay fit is by gymming at home, which includes weight training. To make it more interesting, I follow body workouts, functional workout and dumble dancing with good music. Physical activity boosts the immune system and flushes bacteria from lungs, airways and increases white blood cells count.Kyna Jagota, via emailYoga is the solutionDue to prolonged sitting, people these days are becoming more prone to a sedentary lifestyle. There are numerous ways by which we can all stay fit. Performing various indoor exercises will prove to be a boon in the long run. Also, Pranayam and yoga are the best solution to the problem. Staying updated is important, but an overdose of information can be harmful for your mental health.Ishita Katyal, via emailConsistency is keyBefore the lockdown, everyone was eating fast food. But now, as no food outlets are available, people have started enjoying the food cooked at their homes, which is good for health. I workout everyday to stay fit and also try to meditate as it is important to keep the mind positive. Swarika Garg, via emailLook at the silver liningThe lockdown has led to anxieties, but we must look at the silver lining and exploit the time in the best way we can. We can overcome mental and physical stress through meditation and spiritual inclinations. Exercising, yoga and acrobatics are effective aids to combat the physical strain. One must indulge in productive activities such as learning a new language, photography or working on one’s hobbies. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, eating healthy, making a daily routine will help in preventing us to become couch potatoes.Maan Kaur, via emailGardening for mental well-being Depression and anxiety are scourges of the modern world. Lockdown due to corona has badly affected our physical and mental health. Every gardener knows that puttering around with your plants can have an uplifting effect. Anyone of any age and skill can enjoy the benefits of gardening by surrounding himself or herself with nature. Gardening improves your physical health and releases mood-enhancing endorphins. Watering plants, growing plant buds, seeing flowers bloom and listening to the birds uplifts your mood.Nikhil Mahendru, via emailDance to stay fitTo stay healthy, one can walk around the house while using the phone. Another option is to dance with your favourite music playing in the background. You can do this with your whole family.Ramandeep Kaur, DugriBoost your immunityEveryone is scared of the coronavirus, but it is important to stay calm and take care of your health. Increase your immunity and eat vegetables, fruits and most importantly, exercise everyday. We can also stay fit without going to the gym by walking, doing yoga and meditation.Simarjot Singh, via emailEat nutritious food, exerciseIt is best to read books, eat nutritious food and exercise to keep your mind and body healthy during the lockdown. Moreover, this is a great chance to introspect, spend quality time with your family and learn cooking. You could even take up gardening as a hobby. In this way, you will be able to stay healthy and happy.Deepnayan Bahl, via emailHave a vitamin c-based dietYour health needs to be a priority, not just during the lockdown but at all times. To stay fit, make sure that you follow the rest of the usual daily routine, with the only change being that you are working from home instead of going to an office. Eat food that is light on the stomach and try to have a Vitamin C-based diet. This will also increase your immunity against Covid-19.PK Chhabra, via emailDo yoga, think positiveExercise or do yoga every morning in fresh air. In this way, you will also get your daily quota of adequate sunlight essential for staying fit. Take a nutritious diet. Use these immunity boosting ingredients in your diet-Tulsi, turmeric, black pepper, and ginger. Have Vitamin-C based fruits including oranges and lemons. Most importantly, think positive.Charvi Mahajan, Chandigarh Road, LudhianaHelp each other in doing choresThose who are not being able to go to the gym due to the lockdown can stay fit by walking briskly for about 40 minutes. Help each other in doing household chores. This will not only reduce your loved ones’ workload but also keep you busy and fit.Neeraj Dhir, Rishi Nagar, LudhianaDon’t become lethargic, meditateThe lockdown is an opportunity to give rest to our mind and body. So make sure that you don’t become lethargic, given the ample time at your disposal. Don’t waste time on social media. Instead, meditate for at least 15 minutes a day to keep your mind calm. Read books to keep your mind active. Indulge in those things which you were not able to do during your busy schedule-learn to cook new cuisines or just simply clean your closet.Harshpreet Kaur, New Tagore NagarThe idea is to keep movingIn days like these, it’s important that we move out of our virtual realm and connect to our true self. The pandemic is a reality check for all, proving the Darwinian Evolution Theory “Survival of the Fittest”. Although the future is unknown, but we all should make an effort and boost our immunity. Make workout a part of your routine. Tire yourself not just mentally but physically also for a sound sleep. You may find it difficult in the initial few days, but it will gradually become a part of your routine. Try different workouts and see which sport channelises your energy. Dance it out, lift some weights, kick it hard, go for walk, do yoga or play badminton- the idea is to keep moving and not to let yourself rust. Garima Jain, via emailHousehold chores to stay fitThere are numerous ways to stay fit during the quarantine if you have the will power. Sweeping and mopping are effective physical exercises, which I do regularly because the house help is on leave. I love being on the terrace in fresh air and prefer listening to audio books during my evening walks. Also, I attend free live sessions of various dance styles. Some indoor games such as ludo, carrom, tambola, dumb charades help me spend quality time with my family. Arushi Puri, via emailUse home equipment to exerciseStarting the day with exercises is always a good idea for me. I spend around 30 to 40 minutes in workout during the morning. It helps me relax and clear my mind of stressful thoughts. One can perform open air workout at terrace to stay fit during the lockdown. People can also use home equipment such as skipping ropes to make the exercise session bit interesting. At evening, one can play badminton as the sport involves distance and no large numberof players are needed. Neha Chaurasia, via emailPass time by cleaning your houseIt’s best to stay indoors amid coronavirus outbreak. As there is a lot of free time at hand for everyone these days, people can think about cleaning their houses to pass time. It will not only engage them but also clean their surroundings. I spend most of my time practicing self cleanliness by washing hands and using sanitisers. Meanwhile, I also ensure that my home is not dirty to house any infections. People must take precautions and isolate themselves to prevent the virus from spreading.Prabhdeep Kaur, via emailDitch sedentary lifestyleStaying healthy and in shape during lockdown can be challenging. However, it is not unattainable. All you have to do is to ditch your sedentary lifestyle and keep the body active. They are so many activities, including yoga, skipping, running on the treadmill and cycling, that can be performed and can be a part of your everyday workout. Above all, keep your mind calm by meditating and body healthy by eating clean and green food in these times when you are homebound.Loveleen Kaur Sarao, via emailHealth should always be a priorityPeople usually tend to ignore their health and fitness due to work commitments. However, this lockdown has given us a chance to improve lifestyle and strengthen our body. These days, I spend my time doing exercises and performing meditation in the morning while in the evening, I take a walk on the terrace. Good health and a fit body not only keeps you in shape but also you build a strong immune system. Regular exercises will also solve the problem of weight gain in the lockdown. There are a number of workout sessions available on YouTube that can be adopted at home. People should always make their health a priority as it is the biggest asset they can possess. Vivek Marwaha, via emailIt’s a blessing in disguiseThis lockdown is a blessing in disguise for many of us who were caught up in our hectic lives. Today, we have enough time to think about our physical, mental and emotional well being. It’s the time when we can transform ourselves, undertake new activities and approach our problems a little differently. We have got a collective opportunity to build our love for nature and to correct our wrong doings in the past. I am thoroughly using this time developing new habits such as taking a morning walk and practicing yoga besides renergising myself with positive vibes.Mona, GiaspuraRead good books for positive mindsetIt is important to avoid over thinking and to keep your mind positive in these difficult times. To make yourself happy, you must spend quality time with your loves ones. Meditation will help you control your racing and negative thoughts. Talk about your good experiences with others experiences and build a positive network around. As they say that books are the best companion, you should get yourself hooked onto books that give your positive encouragement and boost your energy. Also, reading will give you knowledge about so many new things and will add to your skills.Khushleen Arneja, via emailRelax, but stay healthyDuring this time of lockdown, people are finding it difficult to pass their time, and even after so many ideas floating around the social media, all they end up doing is scrolling the internet, in turn compromising their personal health. People have enough time these days and hence should use it productively and do things they did not get to do during their normal days. They are getting time to spend with their families, which is a benefit. This lockdown can be utilised to let our bodies relax and detoxify. Physical fitness too should not be neglected as there are many ways online to keep one fit. I urge all to stay positive and optimistic.Prabhleen, via emailExploring my own house during the lockdownWhen the going gets tough, the tough gets going. With unlimited time and limited space at my disposal, I have tried to be innovative in my approach to keep my body and mind relaxed to avoid anxiety during the lockdown. I am following a strict diet regimen for my physical wellbeing. Regular workout and yoga are keeping me occupied for a few hours each week. This lockdown has made me realise the importance of space in my own house like a vast area to walk in the evenings (without the need to step out of my home). Helping in the household chores such as mopping floors, dusting and occasional car washing also diverts attention and reduces work stress of other members of the family. Another place I have started using more often is the terrace on my first floor. It offers a relaxing corner fit for reading the newspaper or a book while sipping tea or coffee. This terrace also acts as my part-time yoga studio due to the peaceful ambience here. Sachin Jain, via emailGood times with the familyThis lockdown has given me the opportunity to do things which hitherto, I was not able to do. I get a lot of time with my family, honing my cooking skills by trying various recipes, etc. Further, this time has allowed me to relax both mentally and physically.Bhavya, via emailLockdown no bar for educationIn this testing time, physical and mental health play a crucial role in combating the life threatening disease. I begin my day with meditation. Yoga and aerobic exercises keep my body fit and full of energy for the whole day. Other activities such as reading books, playing indoor games and gossips with my family further strengthen my mental status. Routine school work assigned by the school teachers online aids me to cope up with my academics.Parneet Singh Grewal, DugriTime to pick up skillsStaying healthy, both physically and mentally, is an important part of growing up. Ever since the lockdown has been imposed, I have been exercising daily. I play outdoor games with my family. I have now got enough time to pick up skills that I couldn’t earlier such as cooking. I know that most people spend their time watching television and using their mobile phones, which is not bad, but we all must limit the use of electronic gadgets.Tanya Bajaj, New Janta NagarBegin the day with yogaI begin my day with yoga after which my sister and I learn to dance. I have incorporated green, leafy vegetables in my diet. Healthy cooking competitions are organised in my family. The whole family cooks healthy dishes and then shares pictures and recipes via the internet. In the evenings, we all indulge in laughter therapy.Vishali Kalra, via emailPractice meditationAmid the curfew, we all can stay fit by indulging in some physical activity. I introspect daily by practicing meditation. I spend quality time with family members, detoxify my thoughts and encourage myself to evolve and overcome challenges. Following the same routine that I used to in the gym, I workout in the midst of nature and take a healthy diet.Harpreet Sandhu, via emailTaking proper diet to stay fitDuring the lockdown, I have been exercising, dancing and practicing yoga. In order to stay fit and healthy, I have also been taking a proper diet. I have also been listening to motivational speeches which help me stay positive and mentally fit. Lavisha, via emailImportant to take regular breaks My routine starts with some basic exercises. I prefer eating light healthy meals as despite all the exercises and activities we perform, we spend most of our day relaxing. During the afternoon, I play badminton with my family members. Since due to the lockdown, a lot of professionals are working from home, which involves sitting in the same position for long hours, it is important to take regular breaks. Raghu Mahendru, via emailOpportunity to invest in selfWe spend most of our lives living for others; this is an opportunity for us to invest in ourselves. We must workout on a daily basis. Besides physical well-being, one must focus on emotional wellness which is also important. We must embrace each and every breath that we take.Kartika Singh, via emailCreate your own mini gardenStaying inside for the whole day is tough and can lead to health issues. It can be made fun by doing some simple and easy tasks such as jumping, climbing, running and sit-ups. Eating seasonal fruits and vegetables by washing them properly is essential to stay healthy. One can also help in household chores and cook food. For mental health, create your own mini-garden of flowers and vegetables. Jyoti Gupta, via emailIt’s our duty to take good care of our body as it stays with us forever. These days, people who are fond of fitness can be seen walking in their gardens, rooftops or lobbies. Some have their own private gym in their house and those who used to go to the gym are now working out at their homes with the help of online classes. Sweeping the floor is a very good exercise and so is washing clothes and utensils. The family members can divide the household work load among themselves. The most important tip during the lockdown is that we should eat healthy food and excess use of sugar and consumption of fried food must be avoided.

The administration’s target is to screen 11,000 houses of the area in the next three days.“The medical teams covered 3,438 houses on the first day. In the Amarkot area, a man was found suffering from fever and cough. He did not want to reveal his illness but his wife admitted that he had fever and cough for the last few days. His samples were taken for testing. Amarkot locality is near to Krishna Nagar, where a 67-year-old man was tested positive on April 3,” said Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore.“Also, a woman from same area was found suffering from mild fever. Since she was not found suffering from any other Covid-19 symptom, medication was provided to her and was told to home quarantine. Our medical teams will keep a close watch on her and if found symptomatic, she will also be admitted to GNDH,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-outbreak-15-568-screened-in-amritsar-on-day-1-one-isolated-at-gndh/story-g7LjpunmCsAq91nPLjbQmL.html
12-04-2020||City||20% corona patients above 60 in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: One in five persons infected with novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in Punjab is above 60 years of age, but they are the most high-risk group, accounting for a majority of infection-related deaths in the state.Of the 151 Covid-19 patients as on April 10, 35% are between the age of 41 and 60 years, according to information shared by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Saturday. The next most-hit age bunch is between ages 21 and 40 comprising 32% of the coronavirus-infected persons in the state, followed by senior citizens who are above 60 and constitute 20% of the coronavirus patient group. Twenty-three patients, or 15%, of the infected persons are below 20 in the state with eight of them being below 10 years. A total of 23 corona patients have recovered so far in the state. An analysis of age-wise fatality or death rate (deaths as a percentage of who tested positive) shows that senior citizens fall in the maximum risk category due to their underlying medical ailments. This elderly lot accounts for 8, or 67%, of the 12 coronavirus-related deaths in Punjab. Of them, two are above the age of 70, with Raj Kumari of Mundi Kharar area of Mohali being the oldest victim of the infection.The 78-year-old woman had died at the civil hospital in Kharar on April 7, but samples taken after her death confirmed the infection on Friday. The average age of the patients who have died from Covid-19 so far is 64. Of the coronavirus patients, 56% are men while 44% are women whose proportion is quite high as compared to the all-India figure.Punjab health department’s Covid-19 official spokesperson Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the main reason for high death rate among the elderly patients was the co-morbidities (pre-existing disease conditions) which along with coronavirus proved fatal.The most common co-ailments reported among those who died of novel coronavirus so far were hypertension, heart diseases and diabetes.CASES DOUBLED TO 150 IN 5 DAYSThe state’s coronavirus cases doubled in five days last week. The count of positive cases took 20 days to reach 75, but then doubled very quickly following a sudden surge in number of cases in Mohali’s Jawaharpur village with a population of 3,000, which is the latest hotspot in Punjab with 37 cases so far. There was a strong suspicion of Tablighi Jamaat connection, but nothing is confirmed so far. There are about 20 positive cases with jamaat link in the state, though.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/20-corona-patients-above-60-in-punjab/story-0uwoiHCv4jujduSqbYuIuM.html
12-04-2020||City||Loneliness deepens at old age homes, anxiety constant companion||Ludhiana: Lonely dinners with only two (from the earlier three) on a large table, a cut in the number of attendants, emotional turmoil, anxiety and desperately trying to find some solace in epics being re-telecast, these have come to define the lives of around 600 senior citizens putting up across 10 old age homes of the city. The managements of some of these homes also claim to be short of funds, as they had stocked up only till April 14, the original last day of the curfew in the state. “We try to maintain our spirit by singing songs and reciting poems, but boredom creeps in. We have been unable to take a walk and talk to people, our favourite pastime,” says a 72-year-old at one such facility, not wanting to be named. He adds that watching news channels scared him. A 77-year-old says, “The re-telecast of serials like Ramayana and Mahabharata is a solace.”Shruti Bansal, an office-bearer at Nishkam Sewa Ashram, Daad village, on Pakhowal Road, says, “We house 35 elderly. With visits to and fro the facility closed, we may fall short of funds, as we had made arrangements only till April 14.” Major general Hemant Joneja (retd), 60, general manager at Dreams and Beauty Charitable Trust, keeping the elderly engaged is a challenge. Joneja is looking after 300 elderly and 50 orphans at the facility named, Heavenly Palace in Doraha. “We used to celebrate collective birthdays, that practice has been curtailed. At meals, we have reduced the number of people to two from three. The number of attendants has also been cut. Inmates are very cooperative.” He added all persons and vehicles moving out for essential services were being disinfected upon re-entry. At the Swami Vivekananda Old Age Home in Model Town there are 60 inmates that Vivekananad Swarg Ashram Trust manages. Trust vice-president Sanjiv Bharti says apart from following all social distancing norms, two nurses were always available. ‘No one will come to hospital to care for me’Tarn Taran/Amritsar The fear of having no blood relative to take care of her of is what gnaws constantly at 71-year-old Kailash Kaur, one of the 65 inmates at Chief Khalsa Diwan-run Bhai Vir Singh Vridh Ghar (old-age home) in Tarn Taran for 15 years. “I am not afraid of dying. I don’t want to go to hospital because no one will come after me for my care,” says Kaur, adding that her husband had abandoned her as she could not bear a child. “Before the curfew was enforced in Punjab, seven inmates had gone to meet their relatives. They are not being allowed to return, till they get tested for covid-19 and are found negative,” said Gurbax Singh, 65, the superintendent of the home. “We have also instructed inmates not to come out of rooms, unless there is an emergency. Meals are delivered to their rooms. We have provided masks and sanitisers. Only three to four elderly persons are allowed at a time to go to the community hall for reading newspaper and books,” he adds. In Amritsar, none of the old age homes allowed access to HT. Col Darshan Singh Bawa (retd), administrator of one such institute running under the Pingalwara Charitable Society, told HT over phone, “No one is allowed inside and the inmates cannot go out. We allow the elderly to walk only within the Manawala campus.” He added, “Chairs in the common room have been rearranged and we take special concern for their diet.

12-04-2020||City||Attack on cops: Nihang group head has a criminal past||PATIALAThe leader of the self-styled Nihangs group involved in the murderous attack on cops at the Sanaur vegetable market in Patiala early Sunday morning, in which an ASI’s hand was cut off, had unleashed a reign of terror at Balbera village. Baba Balwinder Singh had illegally occupied the village land for the past 20 years and had built a gurdwara, named Khichdi Sahib on it, say area residents. “It was a village pond and about 20 years back, Baba Balwinder, donning robes of a Nihang, emerged and propagated that a Sikh guru partook of khichdi at this place while he was on his way to Delhi. He took over village pond and set up the gurdwara,” said Thakur Singh Mann, a native of village Balbera. He said that the villagers opposed the move, but he managed to browbeat his opponents. Balwinder has a criminal background. He also grabbed land of a commission agent by terrorising and assaulting his family members, and later even struck compromise after an FIR was registered against him.Patiala senior superintendent of police Mandeep Singh Sidhu said three FIRs are already registered against Balwinder and his associates. “Balwinder and his aides were booked for attempt to murder in 2013 and a theft case was registered against him in 2010, in which untraceable report was filed. Similarly, in 2000, an FIR was registered against him for land grabbing and murder bid, in which he managed to strike a compromise with the opposite party. Police is ascertaining facts why the cases against him did not reach logical conclusion,” he said, adding that he might have threatened the witnesses and opposite parties to strike a compromise.“He also threatened me today when I asked him to surrender,” said the SSP. The police will also ask the revenue department to do demarcation of land of the gurdwara to ascertain the ownership.Area residents say Balwinder and his associates use to set their cattle free for grazing in agricultural fields of the people. They used to threaten and beat up people to crush opposing voices. “It is strange from where Balwinder and his aides were getting funds as Rs 37 lakh was recovered from the gurdwara. Police must probe this angle,” said an area resident. Meanwhile, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal, former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal among others have condemned the attack on cops. Nihang organisation Budha Dal chief Baba Balbir Singh said the attackers were not Nihangs, but anti- social elements .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/attack-on-cops-nihang-group-head-has-a-criminal-past/story-kMbCxTAixu1Spy1BLdX9MJ.html

The health department will carry out extensive testing with RT-PCR and rapid testing kits in these areas to break the chain of transmission, if any.Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, official spokesperson of health department for Covid-19, said screening of the entire population would be carried out in these hotspots for symptoms. “Testing with RT-PCR will be done for those who are symptomatic for less than seven days whereas rapid testing kits will be used to test those who are symptomatic for more than seven days,” he said.The state has been using the RT-PCR, or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, test on nasal or throat swab samples of suspected patients. Dr Bhaskar said the list of hotspots would keep changing depending on new positive cases and completion of screening in certain areas. These hotspots will be in addition to the containment zones identified by the district authorities.The rapid testing kits are, however, still not available. The state had requested the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for 10 lakh rapid testing kits and floated an inquiry in the open market for another 10,000 for extensive screening of people for coronavirus but these have not arrived so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/17-hotspots-identified-in-9-districts/story-ypklVS8PEghvjeblu4FK9L.html

12-04-2020||Lucknow||UP to explore partial resumption of activities, Yogi sets up panels||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday evening announced that the state was looking for a partial resumption of construction, agriculture, drinking water consolidation, revenue, MSME, industrial and education activities from April 15 onwards following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stress on ‘jaan bhi, jahan bhi’ (both life and livelihood). The chief minister, however, made it quite clear that educational institutions will not reopen anytime soon. The prime minister had announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown, which began on March 25 and would end on April 14, unless it is extended.The chief minister also announced several committees under ministers that will think and draw a roadmap for resumption of activities.“The ministers will start sitting in their respective offices and all officers from the level of special secretary will resume going to their offices from April 15,” Adityanath said. They will also decide categories of other staff who need to begin attending office.“From April 14, we will start sending home people who are in shelter homes completing the 14-day isolation. They will be medically checked for symptoms once again and if cleared medically, we will send them home with an advisory of another 14-day isolation at their homes. Considering that these people should not face any problem for food for their 14-day home quarantine, we will give them food packets of grains,” the chief minister said.“After the lockdown, this was the first time that the cabinet ministers, in such large number, had a meeting where they were physically present. Nineteen cabinet-level ministers met. Others could not come because of the lockdown as they are in their home districts,” he said.“At this evening’s meeting, we discussed the lockdown and what all could be after the lockdown,” the chief minister said.“We will have to continue working with the same alertness as we did till now. And we had a consensus on following PM Modi’s idea of ‘Jaan bhi, Jahan bhi (Life and livelihood--both). We not only have to contain coronavirus and save lives, but also have to return to normalcy. We have to take steps to return to normal activities so that we don’t face problems. We have constituted a committee each under over different ministers. The committees will find ways for resumption of activities,” he said.The committee chaired by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maruya will explore to what extent resumption of activities can be allowed in construction, especially roads, expressways, and big ticket project by maintaining social distancing and safety.The committee under deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma will decide on online syllabus of various courses form school to higher education level so that education does not suffer.“For maintaining social distancing, it is important not to reopen schools and colleges,” he said. The committee headed by finance minister Suresh Khanna will think about ways to start revenue generation, MSME sector, and industrial activities.Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi’s committee will work on the problems and issues related to farmers.“We would like to explore maximise procurement from farms or through farmers and, at the same time, ensure minimum support price for farmers,” Yogi said.The committee headed by health minister Jai Pratap Singh would decide how to resume critical care and emergency services like dialysis, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, cardiac-care, neuro-related ailments. It will also work on the safety of doctors, health workers engaged in Covid-19 treatment.Jal shakti minister Mahendra Singh’s committee will work on how water supply is to be maintained to people--all the more when the temperature has begun rising, especially in the water-scarce areas like Vindhyachal or Bundelkhand.The committee chaired by labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya will look into labour welfare issues and the one under social welfare minister Ramapati Shastri will work on scholarships and pensions under his department.Similarly, the committee under the rural development minister Moti Singh will work on rural sanitation, while urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon’s committee will oversea urban sanitation. NO PUBLIC EVENTSLUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said though there were many festivities lined up this month, it was important not to have public functions.Some of the events and observances scheduled this month are Khalsa Panth foundation related to the Sikh community on April 13-14, or Baisakhi, Ambedkar Jayanti (April 14) and the beginning of Ramzan (April 23).Any public event might spread infection, he cautioned.

12-04-2020||Lucknow||34 non-Covid districts in UP may get some relaxations||Thirty-four UP districts, where no coronavirus cases have been found so far, are likely to get relaxations, but their borders with other districts or states may still remain sealed as an extra precaution.“Thirty-four of the total 75 districts have not reported any corona positive cases and we may allow relaxations to people in such districts though inter-district and inter-state borders may still remain sealed,” chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari said.Tiwari also said UP would take a call on extension of the lockdown only after the Centre made an official announcement on the nationwide curbs.“The prime minister had a video conference with states on Saturday to take their suggestions. While some states have on their own announced extension of the lockdown, we would like to wait for the Central government’s instructions in this regard before we take a call,” he said.While 41 districts of Uttar Pradesh are in the grip of the deadly Covid-19 that has already infected 483 persons there, 34 of the 75 districts have managed to keep the Sars-Cov-2 virus at bay.According to the chief secretary, the coronavirus could not spread its tentacles to 34 districts largely because none in these districts was found to have come in contact with anyone returning from abroad, unlike in other 41 districts where the disease spread after one person or the other came in close physical contact with someone with a foreign travel history.“Moreover, the lockdown and sealing of inter-state and inter-district borders helped,” he said.Additional director (communicable diseases) Dr RK Gupta made a similar observation.“Thirty-four districts have remained safe so far because no one with a foreign travel history was found to have returned to these districts,” he said.“Neither have any Tablighi Jamaatis, who attended the Nizamuddin Markaz, been found in these districts so far,” he added.Foreign travellers and the Jamaatis, Gupta pointed out, had been found to the major source of Covid-19 transmission to others.Tiwari also said the government was considering giving some relaxations to various sectors to unleash economic activities in the state.“Industries and some other commercial establishments may get an exit from the lockdown with certain conditions, including mandatory compliance of rules related to social distancing and wearing masks,” he said.“The idea is to restore economic activities in the state while at the same time containing the disease,” he said.He said the staff of some government and semi-government departments may be asked to resume duty, with certain restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/34-non-covid-districts-may-get-some-relaxations/story-oVhnfpcCwVG27gEtQrlwnK.html
12-04-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown: Special slots for elderly to buy groceries at Thane society||At Edenwoods Co-operative Housing Society Limited at Thane, biometric access at the entry of around five buildings, have been disabled for more than three weeks now. The management has also provided special slots for the elderly to buy groceries. Currently, vegetables are being ordered twice a week for all the residents. They are asked to come in slots to a particular spot near the clubhouse to purchase their essentials. However, a separate slot is allotted for senior citizens, so that they don’t have to stand in a queue.“Very few of them step out of the complex to buy groceries. We have also tied up with a supermarket to deliver products. We have kept special slots for senior citizens as we did not want to cause inconvenience to them, we have kept special slots for them,” said TN Raghunathan, secretary of the housing federation.The management has also disabled the biometric access as a precautionary measure to rule out the possibility of contracting the virus by touching the surface.“Some of the most common surfaces where people are expected to touch frequently, such as lift buttons, are being sanitised over three to four times a day. Earlier, the biometric was suspended only during the morning hours, but then we decided that it should be completely suspended,” said Raghunathan. The federation consists of 18 housing societies and one commercial building, comprising 800 flats, and more than 3,500 residents. Office bearers of the federation said that they needed to shut all the common areas such as football court, swimming pool and gymnasium, among others, as soon as the state government had asked such facilities to be shut. Currently, the residents have been requested to not even step down for walks, even though social distancing norms are being followed. “A case of a family being tested positive was reported from a nearby building, which is when we had to put in place stringent measures. Even those who had come from abroad, were asked to stay quarantined for 14 days,” said an office-bearer of the federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-special-slots-for-elderly-to-buy-groceries-at-thane-society/story-WsmTzXyn0NxuVZXnN5RupM.html

After holding a discussion with the society members, everyone readily agreed to contribute for their respective maids,” said Ruiee Kapoor, a resident of the society. She added that other than paying their house helps, society members, have also contributed money to collect safety gear for the health workers. “One of our society members has already donated 700 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits to the BMC. The rest of us have collected over ₹45,000 to donate for the cause,” she added.The Metropolis society in Four Bungalows, Andheri (W), has struck a deal with the farmers of a small village in Satara district to ensure that their yield doesn’t go waste, and at the same time, society members get all the vegetables they need without having to step out of the premises.“We first contacted the local joint registrar’s office, to find out if any farmers in the state were willing to sell vegetables directly to the society members. Later, we sent a list of requirements to the point of contact in that village. We had the vegetables reach our doorstep the next day,” said Sudha Shenoy, a resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-andheri-society-provides-essentials-to-house-help/story-ATtAmBa8oz2DmVsWlBRtxN.html

12-04-2020||City||2K in quarantine, Badholi keeping its fingers crossed||Most Uttar Pradesh villages cannot claim to have a population equal to the number of migrants who have returned to Badholi — a village in Bahriach district — before the states sealed their borders after the lockdown was imposed due to coronavirus scare.“Over 2,000 migrants have returned to their homes in Badholi and all are under home quarantine as advised by government doctors,” said Mohammed Hasib, representative of the village head.Hasib’s daughter-in-law Salma is the village head.“With such a large number of migrants under quarantine, our village is likely to remain on tenterhooks till April 15 when the isolation period for the most would end,” said Hasib, himself a migrant with a fruit and vegetable juice shop in New Delhi.He is not under quarantine as he came back to village two months back.“We are not taking any chance at all,” said Hasib, who just entered the village on his motorcycle after checking on the health status of migrants in Tipra hamlet of Badhouli village.The village has four more hamlets--Jahanpurwa, Paranpur, Kaharanpur, and Mandhatapur.“We, in coordination with the health department of the district, have twice sanitized the village by disinfectant sprays. We do not let villagers sit together in groups,” said Hasib.Soap cakes are now present at all the village handpumps, taps, and toilets.“Today, when we opened the ration distribution at this Public Distribution System (PDS) shop, of which we are the contractors, a ration card holder refused to stand in the social distance circle that we have drawn for queues. He refused to stand in the circle and dismissed the idea of washing hands before standing in the queue. He tried to play smart, calling it ‘tamasha’. We refused to give him a ration and asked him to come back on the last day of the distribution. He grumbled and went back,” said Jaseen Ahmed, 30.“Allah na karey, yeh bimari phailey (We pray to almighty to prevent the spread of the disease). I am adhering to the quarantine. But, most of the home isolation people do sit outside our houses in the sun. We understand that soaking up the sun, eating a healthy diet, and rest is healthy in these times of coronavirus,” said Tauheed Ahmed, 45, a migrant with a juice shop in Delhi.Under home quarantine, he claimed he had walked the first 250 km from Delhi and was lucky to get a lift on a goods carrier for the rest of the distance. The distance between Delhi and Bahraich is 680 km.The village is Muslim dominated.According to 2011 census, it had a total population at 5,500. “But now, we are estimated 7,000 and 5,500 of this are Muslims,” said Hasib.Because of the high number of migrants in the village, the district administration has set up a quarantine facility at the newly-built Government Girls School in nearby village Bashiya Patey in Jarwal tehsil. “The facility has been set up to lodge anyone who shows coronavirus symptoms. We have ten beds and a kitchen and have a capacity to expand it to 200 beds,” said Om Chand Verma, the Bashiya Patey village head on a visit to inspect the facility.The facility is unbelievably clean with beds complete with neat new mattresses, pillows, and quilts. The kitchen has a cooking stove, large cauldrons, ration, cooking oil, vegetables, and a lot of ‘Dettol’ soaps.Dr Nikhil Singh, superintendent doctor for Jarwal, said: “We are closely monitoring village Badholi. We send a doctor every two days, and our village level health volunteers are monitoring the migrants.”So far, the district has not reported any positive case.Laman Ahmed, 36, who has a juice shop in Alwar district of Rajasthan, is also under quarantine. He said: “When we were stranded, on March 24, requested the Alwar district administration to give us a travel permit. They permitted and then we hired a goods carrier vehicle from Alwar to Bahraich for Rs 20,300. As many as 24 people came on it.”Most of the migrants in this village have fruit-vegetable juice shops in Delhi, Rajasthan, and Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2k-in-quarantine-badholi-keeping-its-fingers-crossed/story-gRmP74qD2tfhOt979gyZuM.html

12-04-2020||City||Important to make informed choices when buying hand sanitizers||If there is one product that Covid -19 has really popularized, that is the now ubiquitous hand sanitiser. Be it elevators or grocery shops, entrances of housing colonies or police stations, sanitisers have now earned the pride of place. Yes, Covid 19 has done what no amount of advertisements could have achieved- it has made the sanitiser a product known across all sections, including the poorest of poor. The virus has also brought about considerable competition in the retail sanitiser market, where earlier just three or four FMCG brands ruled the roost. Today, many pharmaceutical companies that supplied to the health sector, have stared catering to the retail consumer too, thereby ensuring regular supply at government mandated prices.In the coming days, consumers can expect an even wider choice, with a number of manufacturers entering the expanding sanitiser market. Increased choice also makes it imperative that consumers know more about this product, so as to make an informed purchase.If you look at the label information on sanitisers in the market, you will notice that they basically fall into two categories — those with alcohol as the active ingredient and those which are non-alcohol based. Since experts advocate the use of only alcohol-based sanitisers for protection against Covid-19, let’s look at only those. Here again, you will notice that the main ingredient could be ethyl alcohol ( ethanol) or isopropyl alcohol ( isopropanol.)Both are equally effective, say pharmacologists and virologists. Some studies have indicated that ethanol has a stronger and broader virucidal activity compared to isoproponal in respect of some non-enveloped viruses. However, a more recent study comparing the virucidal activity of two World Health Organization recommended formulations — one based on ethanol and the other based on isopropanol — found the latter to have a higher virucidal activity against enveloped viruses. Covid-19 is an ‘enveloped virus’. The two formulations were tested against Zika virus , Ebola virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)The study, titled “Virucidal Activity of World Health Organization–Recommended Formulations Against Enveloped Viruses, Including Zika, Ebola, and Emerging Coronaviruses” and published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases in 2017, analyzed the virucidal efficacies of both alcohols, particularly against emerging and re-emerging viruses that caused severe epidemics. It concluded that both the WHO formulations were effective against enveloped viruses, demonstrating that both can be used in outbreaks associated with viral infections.Viruses, which come in many shapes and sizes, are enclosed in a protein coat called Capsid. In some viruses the Capsid is surrounded by an envelope composed of a lipid bylayer- the latter are called enveloped viruses. Alcohol destroys them by denaturing their proteins and dissolving the lipids . According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, alcohol concentration of 60-95 per cent are more effective than those with lower alcohol concentration or non-alcohol based hand sanitizers. It therefore recommends a minimum of 60 per cent alcohol The WHO formulation for use in health care suggests 80 per cent ethyl alcohol or 75 per cent iosopropyl alcohol . There are studies showing that enveloped viruses are extremely vulnerable to 70 per cent alcohol. So look for those with 70 per cent alcohol.Sanitisers come in liquid, gel and foam formats and you could choose any of them , based on your personal preference because a study published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in September 2017 says that there was no difference in the anti-bacterial efficacy of sanitisers in all the three formats. Alcohols are bactericidal, fungicidal and virucidal. However, they are not effective against bacterial spores and protozoan oocystsLastly, it is also important to check whether the bottle of sanitizer has a proper closure to prevent leakage and also evaporation, so that the initial concentration is preserved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/important-to-make-informed-choices-when-buying-hand-sanitizers/story-EYxCn76S36s3S1ccdK77XI.html
12-04-2020||Pune||Two fire incidents in Balewadi within 24 hours||Three people were booked and two arrested for distributing gas illegally and causing a fire incident that damaged five shops in its vicinity in Balewadi on Friday night.In a tin shed, the owner and employee of Namrata Gas Agency were filling up small gas cylinders from a bigger cylinder to gain a profit margin, according to the police.At 11:10pm on Friday, when the two were filling gas into the small cylinders, one caught fire and the entire operation went up in flames. While no casualties were reported, the blaze caused damage to five neighbouring shops and the electricity pole near it.A case under Sections 285, 286, 435 and 34 of Indian Penal Code along with Section 3 and 7 of Essential Commodity Act was registered at Chatuhshrungi police station.The gas agency blaze was the second incident in Balewadi area within 24 hours. On Saturday night, five workers of a restaurant were injured in a gas leak that led to a blaze opposite Balewadi High Street.“They were in the restaurant, where they work, to cook and eat as they did not have anything to cook at their house. They detected the gas leak and switched off the main line. However, they did not realise that the gas had already filled up the place. As one of them switched on a lighter, the room went up in flames and the one standing near the shutter was thrown out on impact,” said Hawaldar Deepak Dhabekar who was among the first people to respond to the incident.The security team of Panchshil Group who was near the Cummins building located nearby helped the police douse the fire before the fire brigade reached.“They were quick to provide us the support as we all thought there were others stuck inside. Fortunately, the four others found their way out from the back exit,” said Dhabekar.While four of the injured were from West Bengal, one was a native of Maharashtra. While one of them was rushed to Jupiter hospital, the others were taken to Mediplex Polyclinic. However, they were all later moved to Surya Sahyadri Hospital where they are undergoing treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-fire-incidents-in-balewadi-within-24-hours/story-abJW82cA2pNHwGjSMJtlrI.html

Facing issues with transportation and labour, floriculturists have no other alternative left but to give flowers as fodder to animals. “Last year, our co-operative society sold flowers worth ₹2 crore and this year, the lockdown has taken a heavy toll on our business. Flowers are just drying up in the fields and are being used as fodder for domestic animals,” said Ramgopal Thakur, a farmer in Sairi village. The villagers in and around Shimla grow flowers and off-season vegetables for their livelihood.Nearly 10,000 farmers grow flowers to earn a livelihood. Delhi’s Ghazipur is the main flower market for floriculturists in the state. The flowers are also supplied to vendors in Jawalamukhi, Brijeshwari, Chamunda in Kangra district and Chintpurni in Una district. Naina Devi shrine in Bilaspur also witnesses a heavy rush of devotees. The demand for flowers is more during Navratras. “Many members of Mahakali flowers and agricultural marketing co-operative society in Jubberhatti who are dependent on floriculture have suffered huge losses,” said Nitin Thakur, secretary of the cooperative society. Soon, stone fruits will be ready and due to unavailability of packaging materials farmers are concerned that their produce might get wasted,” said CPI( M) leader and Kisan Sabha member Sanjay Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/flower-industry-in-himachal-hit-hard-as-lockdown-dries-up-business/story-CMVQnD56IMvP3TU66tyYpK.html

Delhi has 33 containment zones, which includes lanes and localities across the city. Two of these -- Nizamuddin Basti and Dilshad Garden -- are designated virus hot spots. Officials said that the government has roped in eight medical institutes to oversee the testing process in different parts of the Capital, which is divided into 11 revenue districts.The random tests will be done using rapid antibody kits – these are capable of showing results within 20-30 minutes – and the sample size will depend on the size of each containment zones, said a senior officer in the health department who asked not to be named.While some containment zones in Delhi consist of a single building, plot or lane, few others include mazes of lanes and even arterial roads. The area of each containment zone was demarcated on the basis of cases recorded, a threat assessment, and an expected rate of transmission given the geography of the locality.By random sampling, the government intends to take the testing exercise beyond individuals who have a travel history to Covid-19 affected countries, or the direct contacts of individuals who have tested positive so far.According to Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, who is leading one team concerning the monitoring of the rapid test exercise about to start in containment zones, said that the primary objective of the scheme is “an accurate assessment of the burden of the disease” and “containment of community transmission”.“In each containment zone, patients with severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI) will be prioritised for the test. The rest of the sample size would be random in nature,” Kishore added.In an interview to HT last week, health minister Satyendar Jain had said that 100,000 rapid testing kits were ordered, and that these would be used to conduct tests starting with the two hots pots and then among health care workers, which include doctors, nurses, orderlies and sanitation employees.The government has now decided to expand this to all containment zones. Till Sunday afternoon, Delhi recorded 1,069 Covid-19 cases, including 19 deaths.In the same interview, Jain had said that the government was also looking at “pool testing”, in which the samples of several people could be mixed before testing so that the process of eliminating those who don’t have Covid-19 could be speeded up.On April 7, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the Union government had allotted 27,000 rapid testing kits for Delhi and the batch would arrive by April 10.“It has not happened yet. We checked with the ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research) because the kits have to come through them. They said that even they have not received the allotted batch. We are expecting the kits this week,” said second officer in the health department who spoke on condition of anonymity.Unlike the RT-PCR test currently in use that detects the virus’s genetic material (RNA) in throat swabs to diagnose a current Covid-19 infection, rapid antibody tests indicate if a person has been infected in the past and has developed and immunity to the virus. Experts say they can also be used as a screening test for the infection -- antibodies typically show up a week after the infection.The simple blood test (samples can be collected by just a finger prick) which takes 15-20 minutes to give results, identifies people who were infected at least a week before the test, and also those who were infected but never diagnosed, helping map undetected infections and giving the correct extent of the spread of the disease.Charoo Hans, former head of the microbiology department at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, said: “It is essential to prioritise testing of households with SARI cases and other possible contacts, such as people providing essential services in those containment areas. However, as asymptomatic individuals can also test positive for Covid-19 it is also essential to test these individuals on random basis. Data generated by such studies will help in understanding the burden of disease and the possibility of community transmission.”Community transmission is the third of the four stages of the spread of an infectious disease. The first is travel history, the second is local transmission, the third is community transmission, and the fourth is epidemic. India has so far maintained that the disease is in the second stage, or between stage two and stage three with “limited community transmission” in some clusters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-delhi-awaits-antibody-kits-to-launch-aggressive-testing/story-iKmVbzLVGOTSQdw8hwT9iI.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||HP to be divided into six zones for lockdown exit plan: Jai Ram||Himachal Pradesh will be divided into six zones as a part of the strategy to end COVID-19 lockdown, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said on Sunday.A staggered exit plan is required to restore normalcy and economic activities simultaneously while taking care of monetary and food requirements of vulnerable sections of the society, the CM said while presiding over a meeting with senior officials here. “As per the threat perception and cases found in Himachal Pradesh, the state will be divided into six zones including a red zone, four orange zones and a green zone for drafting exit plan from COVID-19 lockdown. The exit plan will be prepared keeping in view the health and economic variables,” he said.The CM said the exit plan will be initiated only when there is initial flattening of coronavirus curve followed by tapering of the curve with the tendency to reach a ‘stage zero’ infection.He said the identified hot spots will be entirely isolated from other parts. Supply of food and other essential commodities will be entrusted to the police and local administration, he added.Thakur said the capacity of the state’s health care system, number of personnel discharging essential services and medical professionals against the epidemic during the days to come and capacity to build resilience against the diseases will be taken into consideration. Similarly, on the economic front, effectiveness in preventing spread and impact of the current lockdown on the state’s economy and its likely extension, impact on poor and other vulnerable sections and fiscal capacity to compensate the vulnerable sections will also be taken into consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hp-to-be-divided-into-six-zones-for-lockdown-exit-plan-jai-ram/story-o1iFHgVozNKFCHzw7lEKXJ.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||Illegal sand mining poses threat to Uri’s oldest power project||Rampant illegal sand mining being taken up in large scale, on Jhelum River poses a grave threat to 105MW Lower Jhelum Hydroelectric Project (LJHP), officials of the electricity department said on Sunday.“The mafia is extracting the sand near the project which is posing a serious threat to the power project and the dam as well. It can lead to catastrophic damage to the project anytime,” said Abdul Rashid Bhat, executive engineer of the project.He said though they have blocked the passage leading to the project, the mining still continues on the riverbed. “We have taken up the issue with the district administration in Baramulla,” he said.In October last year, the department took up the matter with Baramulla deputy commissioner following which the DC issued the orders of banning the illegal extraction of sand and directed the police and flood control department to keep a close vigil on the illegal activities there.In December last year, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Uri constituted a three-member committee to investigate illegal sand mining and extraction of riverbed material from three villages of Uri falling close to the project after he received the complaints from the locals.In February, the SDM again issued a letter to Tehsildar Boniyar saying they have seized the extracted sand from the miners. “Taking the advantage of the dark, the sand mafia is illegally lifting the seized material from the site,” reads the letter, a copy of which is with the Hindustan Times.“Taking the advantage of Covid-19, the mafia took away the seized sand worth ₹15 lakh from the spot,” said an official of local administration, requesting anonymity.The geology and mining department in Baramulla estimated the cost of the seized 8,000 metric tonne sand to be ₹22 lakh.Boniyar Tehsildar Imran Ahmad Bhat who was to probe the matter said that the miners moved court. “The case was then handed over to the floods control department,” he said.The assistant executive officer of the department of floods control in Uri Bashir Ahmad Shah said, “Two FIRs have been registered against the sand mafia.”However, Uri SDM Reyaz Ahmad Malik denied commenting on the issue.LJHP was commissioned in 1979 and is one of the oldest power projects of Uri that supplies the electricity to the entire valley and states like Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/illegal-sand-mining-poses-threat-to-uri-s-oldest-power-project/story-uUID4m1yqv5bM0YrG2FqgM.html

12-04-2020||Chandigarh||‘We are intensifying Covid-19 testing, rapid kits are on the way’||The spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Haryana, particularly the four national capital region districts, has thrown an unprecedented challenge before the health authorities in the state. Additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora speaks to HT’s Hitender Rao about the state government’s strategy, growth trajectory and prospects of flattening the coronavirus curve. Excerpts:How do you see the current situation in Haryana including the growth trajectory of the virus?If you look at the number of coronavirus positive cases till March 31, we only had 29. As of today, if we discount the 107 coronavirus positive Tablighi Jamaat missionaries, we stand at 32 positive cases. To that extent, the new cases added to our inventory were the Jamaatis.But Jamaatis are now also a part of Haryana’s population. Is that not a sign of concern?Certainly. There was a surge in the number of cases after we started testing the Tablighis. We did intensive sampling of the Jamaati groups and their contacts. In fact, we had conducted less than 800 tests till March 31. Mainly, people who had travelled overseas or those who came in their contact were tested. But in the last 10 days we have tested 3,600 people and those tested are mainly Jamaati.How do you see the curve from here? What are the prospects of its bending?In the last two days, the number of positive cases have dipped again. Our civil surgeons are of the view that the cases may peak again as 10-12 individuals are suspected of having Covid-19. However, it is encouraging that 116 samples collected from Jamaatis were found negative. That indicates that stringent containment where habitations have been isolated in hotspots has worked. So, I am optimistic that we are on the right track.What’s the strategy of the state government to bend the curve?Intensive testing and isolation of habitations will be the key to contain the spread. We have intensified PCR testing (real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test (rRT-PCR) in hotspots of Nuh, Palwal, Gurugram and Faridabad districts. The frequency of rRT-PCR in hotspots is 450-500 tests per day and 100-125 in low Covid incidence districts.How well is the testing going to get intensified? What about the rapid antibody tests recommended by ICMR?We will use rRT-PCR testing on 6,500 samples before April 14. The purchase committee has placed orders to buy around 1.10 lakh rapid test kits for blood-based testing to screen large numbers in hotspots. We are expecting the delivery of rapid test kits within a week.How far will the rapid antibody tests help in containing the spread?The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines on rapid tests say that it should not be done indiscriminately. So we will use rapid tests in the hotspots and containment zones, where a high number of positive cases are detected, and in large migration gatherings, and evacuee centres. All symptomatic influenza-like illness (ILI) persons having fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose will be tested in the hotspots. The blood-based rapid antibody test gives an indication whether the person needs further testing.There are allegations of absenteeism in the health department and hospitals?This is not correct. Much of our healthcare staff is deputed in mobile teams. We have cut down non-essential surgeries and procedures in hospitals to reduce the chances of infections and are concentrating on Covid-19. That health staff is also being used at a number of other places to combat Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/we-are-intensifying-covid-19-testing-rapid-kits-are-on-the-way/story-gd1gKItnGD1XuBICUA9PQP.html

12-04-2020||Education||CBSE to hold BRICS math online competition from April 22 to May 22||With an aim to develop students’ logical reasoning skills and cultivate their interest in math, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has asked the affiliated schools to make students of classes 1 to 12 to participate in the BRICS Math Online Competition to be held from April 22 to May 22. It will be held for free on the website www.bricsmath.com. Students from seven countries–Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam–can take part . The project will bring together the students from various backgrounds having a passion for math on one platform. The competition will consist of 10 interactive math tasks, designed in a child-friendly game form. The tasks on logical and spatial thinking do not require any prior knowledge of math and will enable the students to think outside the box.Over 11,431 students from Punjab participated in the competition last year. Of them, 3,365 got winner certificates, 4,329 bagged certificates of appreciation and 3,737 received participation certificates. Paramjit Kaur, principal of BCM Arya Model Senior Secondary School, Shastri Nagar, said, “Our students had participated in the competition last year and even reached the next level. We will send the details of the competition on students’ profile on Monday so that those who are interested can participate.”A Class 8 student, Gurjit Singh, said, “I had participated in the competition last year. The level was tough but I was able to reach the second round. This time, I will practice more to enter the third round.”REGISTRATION PROCESSAll students must be registered by their parents or teachers, who will need to select the country, language and class to register themselves on the website and then add the students to the class list. Individual login and password credentials will then be generated for every participant to log into their profiles and solve the tasks. The competition will be held in two rounds.

They are now handling calls from people, stuck in the lockdown with no food or medicine as they have also to deal with usual crime incidents. This excess work pressure may put undue stress on the police personnel,” said a senior UP police official.Considering this, Lucknow University had approached police to assist them to let go of their stress.LU spokesperson Duregesh Srivastav said,” As per the agreement, our teachers will help police personnel, who are overstressed, due to long hours of work and are dealing with personal risk and emotional trauma every day. Coordinator of this programme will be Dr Archana Shukla from the department of psychology.”Earlier the university had started its online/ telephonic counselling for students, suffering from anxiety and other mental disorders to help them during the lockdown.According to experts, people with underlying mental health issues face several difficulties in the lockdown. Considering this, LU is offering its services through counselling of students of the entire university to empower them with right information and much needed emotional support.Teachers of the psychology department are providing counselling services to those suffering in any manner due to the isolation, experienced during the crucial period of self-quarantine in fight against Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/lucknow-university-to-provide-counselling-to-stressed-police-personnel-during-lockdown/story-6FcVIb78X1qzHbJ9GPL7iO.html
12-04-2020||Education||Patna DM instructs private schools not to pressurise parents for school fees||Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi has instructed private schools not to pressurise parents for depositing school three months’ fees at a time in the wake of coronavirus lockdown. As per the order issued on Friday evening, private schools cannot force the parents to deposit fee for more than a month during lockdown. If one expresses his inability to deposit one-month fee, schools must not burden them nor can they cancel admission of his ward. “Schools may request parents to deposit one-month tuition fee. They can make some arrangement for collecting other charges later in instalments. Besides, parents should not be forced to come to school for buying uniform and books. However, the schools can provide home delivery of study materials to the students. The administration will help to provide vehicle pass for this purpose,” the DM said in his order.The order has brought major relief to the parents who were harried by lockdown. Many parents said that lockdown crippled all business and trade activities and thereby hit their sources of income very hard.Devendra Sharma, whose daughter studies in class 9, said that depositing one-month tuition fee is not troublesome for many but the school has asked to pay hefty amount including development charge, miscellaneous fees and three-month tuition fee. Sharma, a small business man, said, “My current financial position is not good as business has suffered huge loss in the past one month. I hope the school will cooperate with parents after the government’s order.”Pankaj Singh, father of two, said, “I have received reminder from school twice for depositing fees. In April, school charges hefty fees in name of development or other activities. The relaxation will be a major relief for me. Let’s see whether private schools abide by the administration’ order or not.”On the other hand, schools have different arguments regarding fees collection on time.Principal of a private school, who wished not to be identified, said, “The operational cost of the school is met through school fee. Even when school is closed, the teachers are engaged with preparing online study material and record lecture. The management has to pay its teaching and non-teaching staffs. It would be difficult to manage if we get very low fee collection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/patna-dm-instructs-private-schools-not-to-pressurise-parents-for-school-fees/story-K4qtOrYG1meeM3g0af7e2O.html

12-04-2020||Bhopal||Two dead as ash dam collapses in Madhya Pradesh||Two persons died and four others were missing and feared dead after a fly ash dyke gave way at a coal-fired power plant in the Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh on Friday evening, the third such incident in the district in a year, a local official said on Saturday.Five villagers and a worker at the site owned by Reliance Power were swept up in a flow of fly ash - a powdery by-product of burning pulverised coal - which travelled at least six kilometres, said district collector KVS Chaudhary. The flow of fly ash swallowed up whole fields in its path in Sasan, district officials said.It was not clear how the dyke broke. Reliance Power said it was investigating the causes of the incident, adding the 4,000 megawatt (MW) power plant would continue to operate normally independent of relief operations.Its unit Sasan Power Limited said, “We are deeply anguished by the incident involving the break in the ash dump yard wall at our Sasan Power Plant. The break in ash dump yard wall pushed the water leading to break in the boundary wall affecting some thatched houses and minor land parcel. We are investigating the reasons underlying the incident,” it said.Bhaiya Ram, a resident of village Siddhikala, whose wife and two children were swept away, said: “It was all because of the power plant management that the incident took place. The administration should lodge an FIR.” The breach is the third ash pond disaster in a year in Singrauli which is “severely polluted”, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’ (CPCB).“We have asked the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board to investigate the case. What we know till now is that there was an ash dyke leakage and low-lying areas were flooded with slurry. Whether any negligence was involved we will know after the investigation,” said Prashant Gargava, member secretary, Central Pollution Control Board.In August last year, a fly ash pond breach took place at Essar’s Mahan Power Plant, leading to damage to crops of about 500 farmers in three villages.In October, a fly ash pond of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) was breached, leading to damage in 30 acres of land and leaving several cattle missing.“This time the damage is extensive. The ash pond broke around 5.30 PM and the slurry entered 30 to 40 houses. Those missing may have died. The mud wall around the pond was weak and gave way. It is negligence,” asked Jagat Narayan Vishwakarma, an environmental activist.“Singrauli as a region has nearly 23 GW installed coal-based capacity which more than 11% of the total installed capacity in India... The air they breathe is polluted, water they drink is contaminated and their traditional livelihood has been destroyed by coal mining,” said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.(Reuters contributed to the story)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/two-dead-as-ash-dam-collapses-in-madhya-pradesh/story-GQRUb7c9EEjbUiKrczVuzI.html

12-04-2020||Delhi||Two shelter homes gutted in Kashmere Gate clashes||A day after a group of homeless people pelted stones at civil defence volunteers during food distribution and three of them allegedly jumping into the Yamuna to escape the resultant police action, at least 200 residents of the same shelter clashed with the police and set two porta cabin shelters on fire after a body was recovered from the river on Saturday, police officers said. A senior police officer, privy to the case details, said three shelter residents had jumped into the river after police had to resort to mild lathicharge to disperse the agitated shelter inmates on Friday. After a body was recovered on Saturday, the residents claimed that it is one of the same persons who had jumped into the river on Friday. Two others had been rescued on Friday itself. Delhi Fire Service chief Atul Garg said five fire tenders were used to douse the blaze that gutted two shelters that accommodated 130 and 40 people respectively. “No casualty was reported in the fire that broke out around 6pm and was brought into control within half an hour,” Garg said. A case of rioting, obstructing public servant from doing duty, and arson was registered and six homeless persons were detained till late evening, said joint commissioner of police (central) Suvashis Choudhary. The joint CP said that a decomposed body was recovered from the Yamuna on Saturday evening. While the body was being taken out, the shelter residents claimed that the body was of the same man whose body could not be fished out from the river on Friday. The other two men were rescued by the local divers on Friday itself, the officer said.Around 5 pm, Choudhary said, the police control room received information about the body. Police were also told that around 150-200 homeless people had gathered outside the Tibetan market near the Kashmere Gate Interstate Bus Terminal. The crowd was agitated and soon began pelting stones on some civil defence volunteers and the police personnel present there.The incident was flashed on the wireless sets and soon the north district DCP, Monika Bhardwaj, along with other officers reached there with additional force. As the crowd had turned violent, the police personnel used mild force to chase them away. The agitators fled towards Yamuna Khadar.“Some of them went towards the shelter homes and set two of the shelters on fire. Luckily, nobody was inside the shelters when they were set ablaze. Nobody was hurt in the fire incident. We have registered a case and are trying to identify the persons who were involved in arson,” added the joint CP.A police officer who did not want to be named said that on Friday some civil defence volunteers and police personnel were deployed near the shelter homes to ensure that the residents maintained social distancing and discipline during food distribution. An altercation broke out between the homeless people and the volunteers when the residents were asked to main distance. Following the altercation, the homeless people started pelting stones on the volunteers. “The volunteers and police personnel used mild force to disperse the crowd and control the situation. During the lathicharge, three homeless men plunged into the river. Two of them were rescued while the third man could not be found,” the officer said, adding that the issue was resolved after senior police officers intervened.On Saturday, the agitation resumed after a body was found in the river and people claimed that it was of the same man who went missing on Friday. “We will write to the Delhi administration to relocate the homeless people living in Kashmere Gate area. Around 3,000 homeless are staying beyond capacity in such shelters. It becomes difficult to discipline them or make them maintain the social distancing to avoid the spread of Covid-19,” said Choudhary.Maximum number of Delhi’s homeless live in the shelters near Kashmere Gate. Several migrants who were left jobless after their factories shut because of the nation-wide lockdown have also shifted to the shelters in Kashmere Gate. Bipin Rai, member, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), also confirmed that two shelters have been destroyed. At least 6,000 people from 12 shelter homes and those from surrounding slum clusters and adjoining areas were fed in the area by DUSIB daily.“We will order an internal inquiry. So far we have got to know that there was some conflict among vagabonds over a rumour of a body being found in the Yamuna, who they believed was one of them. They got agitated and set the shelters on fire. There were no inmates inside and there are no casualties reported,” said Rai.District magistrate (Central) Nidhi Srivastava, said, “As per a preliminary report there was a conflict among some vagabonds in the area, which led to the incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-shelter-homes-gutted-in-kashmere-gate-clashes/story-oZduQFD6jS3eIsiZq7QwJM.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Senior Women’s Cricket Team coach is happy the team is recovering, focussed||The Chandigarh Senior Women’s Cricket Team had been on a roll, winning nine out of nine matches in the Plate Group stage of the Senior Women’s One-Day League at Puducherry, to qualify for the quarter-finals last month.The team led by Amanjot Kaur and coached by Khyati Gulani had reached Baroda with an aim to put up a great show against the mighty Mithali Raj-led Railways team. However, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) postponed the tournament and the teams had to head home.Since then, Delhi-based coach Gulani, along with the team in Chandigarh, have been under lockdown. The 36-year-old thinks the momentum has definitely been broken, but at the same time it has given time to the exhausted cricketers to take care of their bodies.“Almost the same cricketers played in the U-23 Trophy and the One-Day League. Playing 18 matches of two tournaments in the heat takes a toll on players’ bodies. With this break they can rest and recover. For example Shivangi Yadav, who kept wickets for Chandigarh in both tournaments, was worn out,” said Gulani, who is keeping a strict watch on the Chandigarh team telephonically from Delhi. Gulani is a Level-2 coach and a former first-class cricketer. She had been coaching Delhi women’s teams in the last decade before taking charge of Nagaland senior women’s team last season. This season, however, the Union Territory Cricket Association roped her in for the Chandigarh team.“It is difficult to limit and confine the movement of young sportspersons. This lockdown is definitely challenging, but I am trying to make them feel motivated. I am taking this time to watch their practice and game videos to identify their weaknesses. Accordingly, I assign separate drills to batters and bowlers.“Bowlers have been asked to break the process into run-up, loading, delivery and follow-through. Now, they can do shadow practice in front of the mirror,” she said, adding that it is the coach’s job not only to improve players’ game, but also keep them motivated.Lockdown scheduleAs far as Gulani’s lockdown goes, she is keeping herself busy with exercise, meditation, cooking and cleaning of the house. “My day begins with a prayer, followed by exercise and watering the plants. I do one-hour floor exercises, which include yoga asanas, planks and surya namaskar. Also, I am deliberately trying to eat healthy meals at home now that I am not travelling. It is the best time to drink plenty of water and detox the body,” shared Gulani, who does one hour of meditation in the evening daily to maintain mental strength.“I don’t really enjoy cooking, but somehow I have tried my hand at some recipes in the last few days and to my surprise, they have come out well,” she added.Even though the BCCI hasn’t decided on a fixed date for conducting the Senior Women’s One Day League quarter final matches, the Chandigarh Senior Women’s team is in good hands and will emerge prepared whenever the call for the game comes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-senior-women-s-cricket-team-coach-is-happy-the-team-is-recovering-focussed/story-2klz9ve4ynYhPJkZuGTmkN.html

Over the years, without any formal education and just on the basis of sheer experience and hard work, he rose to a rank of assistant course manager. His area of work is to oversee the maintenance of the greens and fairways of the country’s busiest golf course spread at 132 acres. With the countrywide lockdown because of the fear of COVID-19 spread, all the sporting activities were stopped and all the sports facilities have been closed, but even at this time of crisis the unsung heroes of golf, Surjit & co, are on the job, so that as and when things get normalize, course will be ready to felicitate the regions’ top golfers, including some of the country’s top names Jeev Milkha Singh, Shubhankar Sharma and Ajeetesh Sandhu.Five of the course maintenance staff is staying inside the premises of the golf course, and as usual their day starts at 5am.“We cannot leave the course, especially the greens, unattended even for a day and that too at the time of the March-April, when the pace of the growth is at the peak. All the 18 greens need to be dressed properly on the daily basis, otherwise if left unattended even for couple of days, the runners (stem) of the grass will start coming and this will create a hindrance on the movement of the ball. We have to maintain the greens in such a way that every day, every time, there should be prefect rolling of the ball. Chandigarh Golf Course has a name in the country and to live up the reputation, we have to maintain the course at its best,” says Surjit, 50, whose family stays in nearby Bhagwanpur area. “Because of the fear of virus (referring to Coronavirus) spread, it’s not advisable to daily commute from our houses to the golf course. Otherwise, we will be unnecessary exposing ourselves and subsequently our family to the outer world. So, we decided to stay within the premises of the club. The club management has provided us ration and we have a kitchen. We are taking care of all the precautions, including using sanitizers and mask,” adds Surjit.The Chandigarh Golf Club has a team of over 70 staff to look after the course, but currently only the minimum required work has been carried out on daily basis.The watering of the entire course is computerized. Surjit and his team are focusing mainly on greens and fairways.“Ours is one of the busiest courses of the world. We were having a record breaking footfall of the golfers on the daily basis. Now, as the club is closed, it’s a breather for the greens and we can focus on maintaining and repairing the greens, wherever it’s required,” says Sandeep Singh Sandhu (Bobby), president of the Chandigarh Golf Club. “The time frame for which the course remains unattended, it would require double of the time to get back into the shape. The course maintenance is quite a technical work and Surjit and his team are doing a commendable job in maintaining the course,” adds Sandhu.Apart from giving salaries to their entire work force during the time of the lockdown, the club is also taking care of all the caddies registered with them. Apart from ration, the management is giving Rs 200 daily to the caddies and the first installment of payment for 10 days has already been made. “They all are part of the golf fraternity and it’s the responsibility of the club to take care of them. Very shortly we will be releasing the second installment of the caddies’ payment,” said Sandhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unsung-heroes-braving-virus-surjit-co-maintain-the-greens-at-chandigarh-golf-club-on-daily-basis/story-ad0v2spf3Ga449eXbxxktO.html

12-04-2020||City||Market committee issues rate list for Ludhiana vendors||Amid complaints of fleecing by fruit and vegetable vendors, the market committee has issued a rate list for supply of vegetables in the city. While the vendors at the ward-level can keep a margin of 10% on the wholesale price, street vendors can keep 25% margin on the wholesale price (15 per cent profit). The vendors have also been asked to display the rate list of vegetables and fruits on their trucks and carts. Earlier, the department had failed to announce the rate list for ward-wise suppliers, leading to confusion which in turn led to residents being fleeced.In the first week of April, the administration had introduced ward-wise supply of vegetables and fruits to avoid crowding at the main vegetable market. Following this, it was announced that the market committee would finalise a certain margin for the ward and street vendors.However, the committee failed to finalise their rates and only the wholesale rates for ahrtiyas and retail rates for street vendors were announced. This allowed the ward-wise vendors to supply vegetables at exorbitant prices. Rehri Fadi association president Tiger Singh said the market committee has finally released the list for all three sectors which is good for street vendors as they were being accused of selling the vegetables at higher rates. There are still some issues related to the rate list and these will be taken up with the market committee, he said.Ward suppliers say ahrtiyas overchargingMeanwhile, ward-level vendors say that ahrtiyas are still overcharging them in the absence of any check by the market committee. One of the vendors said that the committee hands them over the rate list while they move out of the market after purchasing vegetables from the ahrtiyas. If we are given the rate list at the entry, we can raise the issue of rates with ahrtiyas.Market committee chairman Darshan Lal (Laddoo) Baweja said the rate list as per the margin would be released by the mandi. The councillors and the administration officials have the duty of checking whether vendors are putting up the rate list on their carts or not. On Saturday, the market committee caught a shopkeeper in Amarpura area for fleecing residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/market-committee-issues-rate-list-for-ludhiana-vendors/story-ofqDYjEog6L4meD8pcpUlO.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn’s lockdown orders no dampener for morning walkers||Two days after the UT administration asked the police to take to task people coming out of their houses for morning and evening walks, residents on Saturday were seen blatantly ignoring the administration’s orders to get their bi-daily dose of exercise.Vice-president of the Sector-49 residents’ welfare association (RWA) Jatinder Mehta said, “When the curfew was imposed on March 24, hardly anyone could be seen outside, but after no positive cases were reported in the city in the last week, walkers became more frequent and started accumulating in neighbourhood parks. They rarely wear masks. The government needs to remind the residents that the threat is still present and still real.”President of the Sector-38 (West) RWA Pankaj Gupta said their association has been working with the police to discourage people from coming out, but many still persist. “People make excuses like they will wear masks or maintain social distancing. We have a strict policy of no tolerance and any information about such walkers is passed on to the police.”As many as 11,789 people have been detained for violating curfew orders in the city while action under Section 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code has been initiated in 170 cases till now. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, PRO) Charanjit Singh Virk said, “We had only been warning walkers, and issuing first information reports (FIRs) only in extreme cases, but now, a drive is being launched to register cases against people going out for walks.”Many dog owners are still taking their pets for a walk even as senior police officers confirmed that it amounts to breaking curfew. President of the Sector-8C residents’ welfare association, RS Gill said, “People take their dogs out for walks in the morning and evening. Keeping a dog in a small house can be problematic, but the police should take note as they are breaking curfew orders.” He added that the police need to deploy police officers in civil clothes to establish where the violations are taking place before taking action.Reshamjit Kaur Dhaliwal, who runs a tricity based animal welfare NGO said that going out for walks is essential for dogs to stay healthy and the administration must find alternatives to facilitate this.Police rounded up 375 people on Saturday for curfew violations. Of this, 180 were detained and then let go while four were booked under Section 188 of the IPC. Police also impounded 236 vehicles, including 182 two-wheelers, four three-wheelers and 50 four-wheelers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-s-lockdown-orders-no-dampener-for-morning-walkers/story-Agsb4gmTb6kDzqATI2zXtJ.html

12-04-2020||City||Ludhiana police chief goes live on Facebook, gets bombarded with questions||Are we allowed to go out for a walk during early morning hours? Is it safe to consume food being served by NGOs and some restaurants? Can I go to a bank or an ATM to withdraw cash? Can I repair laptops or mobiles from home? These and a number of other questions and suggestions were placed by residents before police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal when he went live on Facebook to interact with people on Saturday afternoon.It was an hour-long interaction and as soon as Agrawal started it at 4pm, thousands of residents bombarded him with questions related to curfew. Over 32,000 viewers participated in the session. However, residents circulated the video on social media after the session was over and residents continued to add questions and suggestions in the comments section.250 FIRS LODGED, 410 ARRESTED IN 18 DAYSDuring the session, a number of residents brought up some common issues. The residents informed the police chief that many people come out of their homes during early morning and evening hours for a walk. “Is it allowed during the curfew?,” they asked.Replying to the questions, Agrawal, who started with the issue of people going for a walk, said, “We are now tired of making people understand that they have to stay home. Several awareness drives have been conducted, warnings have been given, but still people are not listening. Residents do not understand that this curfew is not imposed due to a law and order situation, but due to a medical emergency.”He added, “There is no relaxation to residents for morning walks. In the last 18 days, as many as 250 cases have been registered in which 410 people have been arrested for violating curfew. Besides, over 9,000 people have been detained and kept in open jails. “People should understand that police are working for people’s safety and not just to put them in jails. How, will we justify our work? So, please co-operate with us and don’t make us to take legal action against you,” Agrawal appealed.NGOs SHOULD REPLACE COOKED FOOD WITH RATIONWhile asking members of the NGOs to ensure proper safety while distributing cooked food among people, the police chief suggested that the NGOs should replace the cooked food with dry ration as it will avoid wastage of food as well as time.Agrawal said any person engaged in the repair work of mobile, laptops or other electronic products, can apply for a pass at https://epasscovid19.pais.net.in/ and go to the residents’ homes to collect product to be repaired. He added medical store owners, who need the pass, can either apply to the zonal licensing authority or can apply for an e-pass on the link.“Residents, who want to go to bank or ATM to withdraw cash, can also apply for e-pass on this link,” he said.During the session, the police chief also highlighted the helpline numbers where residents can lodge complain or can flag their concerns.CP’S TAKE ON IMPORTANT ISSUES:1. Volunteers deployed as curfew enforcement officers (CEOs) misbehave with residents.Answer: No volunteer is allowed to misbehave with residents. I am sorry on behalf of the volunteers. But, I will like to say that we have enrolled 2,000 volunteers as CEOs. These volunteers are not getting any renumeration from the department. They are just helping us. However, they are being counselled daily. If anyone is interested in volunteering his/her services as an CEO, he/she can apply for the same with the ACP (traffic), nodal officer.2. Many residents are posting fake news on social media.Answer: Police have already registered cases against five persons for posting fake news on social media. Residents should confirm the news before sharing it with others. One can contact the helpline numbers to confirm whether a particular news is true or not.3. Social distancing not being followed in labour quartersAnswer: As there are a number of labourers residing in one quarter, it has become a tough task to ensure social distancing within the quarters. However, we are planning to shift some labourers to shelter homes to reduce the number of people in quarters. There are 57 shelter homes with a capacity of 35,000 people and free food and medical services are being provided there by residents.4. People have barricaded roads on their own, causing difficulty in movement in case of some emergencyAnswer: There are multiple entry and exit points to a colony, therefore, some of the points have been closed to prevent the regular movement of traffic. A person, who wants to travel due to some emergency, will have to take a detour to reach his destination.5. Some restaurants are providing cooked food from door to door. Should it be allowed?Answer: We started this service on a trial basis. However, restaurants are being given instructions to take all precautions while preparing food. However, we will review this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-police-chief-goes-live-on-facebook-gets-bombarded-with-questions/story-SyqPxLgyl2xze7JiufXAHN.html

But, special municipal corporation (MC) teams will continue to supply them essentials and pick up their household waste since they have been told remain in isolation for another 15 days.MC additional commissioner Anil Garg, who is heading the teams quarantining people, said the total number of those in quarantine had reduced to approximately 500 now. However, those who had completed the quarantine period had yet not been allowed to step out of their houses.“We have asked them to stay in self-isolation for another two weeks as per government directions to completely rule out the threat perception. I appreciate residents for complying with the instructions,” Garg said, adding that posters were being removed from houses of people released from quarantine.GARBAGE, ESSENTIALS TO CONTINUEMC executive engineer Rajinder Singh said their special garbage teams will remain operational for all quarantined houses till they get the instructions to stop. MC junior engineer Angrez Singh, who is looking after essential supplies, said they had stopped the supply, but will consult seniors for further course of action. MORE TO BE QUARANTINEDMeanwhile, people under quarantine are likely to increase after the fresh case in Sector 37 on Friday.“Multiple teams have been deployed to trace the source of infection. A total of 50 contacts of the latest patient have been quarantined in the last 24 hours. Further contact tracing is underway,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/1-000-released-from-quarantine-in-chandigarh-advised-self-isolation-for-15-more-days/story-KQmNKlPtT8y0mQelnL3UYL.html

12-04-2020||Chandigarh||Masks vanish from shelves after Chandigarh admn makes them mandatory||As soon as the UT administration made it mandatory for everyone to wear masks in public, most pharmacies have sold out their stock in Chandigarh. A check by this Hindustan Times correspondent found that masks are out of stock with most pharmacies, while others are selling them at twice or thrice the rates mandated by the government. In March, after a notification of Government of India, prices of masks and sanitisers were capped in the UT. The move aimed at making products of personal care and sanitation more affordable as they are crucial to combat the rapidly spreading coronavirus. The consumer affairs ministry had notified the MRP for 2-ply and 3-ply surgical face masks at ₹8 and ₹10 per piece, respectively.However, when this correspondent tried to buy masks and sanitiser from Sector 36, 37 and 38 pharmacists, none of them were ready to sell at the price decided by UT. Kushaldeep Kaur, a resident of Sector 19, said, “I went to many shops, but they are out of stock. I will have to make my own mask at home now.”Vivek Mehra, who distributes masks in Chandigarh slums, said, “Barring a handful of places, the 3-ply and 2-ply masks are available at ₹20 to ₹25 and the black cloth mask is priced between ₹30 and ₹80.”VENDORS USING SAME MASKS, GLOVES FOR DAYS Hitesh Puri, chairman of CRAWFED, said, “Just yesterday, I asked a vegetable vendor about how many days he had been using the same mask and gloves, and he replied that it was more than four days.” With limited money, of course, a vendor will not think of changing his mask and gloves every day, he added. Baljinder Bittu, chairman of FOSWAC, said, “The repeated use of same masks and gloves by vendors is frightful. They meet several people everyday, go to crowded mandis and exchange currency notes,too. To help them, we have also decided to donate 25,000 masks.”“Frontline workers should be given masks by the government. Even if the lockdown is extended for the next 15 days, the government can afford them ₹8 per mask,” said Puri.He added, “Moreover, pharmacists should display the rate list of mask and sanitisers outside the shop and there should be an inspection to check implementation. Administration can also take the help of NGOs for this.”Vinay Jain, secretary of Chandigarh chemist association, while rejecting the charges said, “Masks are plentiful in supply. Some pharmacists are selling them at higher rates but they do not belong to our association.”UT health secretary, Arun Kumar Gupta, “There is no need to buy masks, people can make them at home. They are reusable and adequate against infection. But except for home made masks, its dangerous to wear same masks again and again. We are trying to make people aware of it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/masks-vanish-from-shelves-after-chandigarh-admn-makes-them-mandatory/story-I7n8yJsAeCntDrNN97oYSO.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn launches app to alert public about Covid zones||In another move aimed at containing the epidemic, the Chandigarh administration has launched a mobile application on Saturday to alert the public about quarantined spaces or areas with suspected Covid-19 patients.The app called ‘CVD Tracker’ has been developed to identify and geo-fence specific areas around people who have been placed under quarantine.Explaining its function, Anil Garg, additional commissioner of UT’s municipal corporation, said it was mandatory for people placed under quarantine to download the app on their cellphones. “But the general public can also download it and see all the red zones— the quarantined or suspected areas. If any person reaches near it, an alert in shape of beep or siren will appear in their mobile,” said Garg, who is also incharge of contact tracing and quarantine teams.He said this would greatly help the public as a preventive measure.QUARANTINED TO UPLOAD SELFIE EVERY HOUR As per government directions, it has been made mandatory for quarantined persons to upload their selfies every hour on this app, to enable regular tracking their location and their health condition.Every quarantined person will be fenced within 50 metre radius of his place of quarantine. If the user breaches the geo-fence, he will get a warning message and the UT will be alerted in the control room that the user has jumped the fence. An FIR under relevant sections will be registered against violators of quarantine, Garg said.The control room will be alerted even if the phone of the quarantined person is switched off, which is not recommended, he said.A 24X7 control room has been set up to monitor quarantined persons. While all freshly quarantined persons will be made to add download the app on the spot, the previous 500 active cases will also be made to download it.Since the number of quarantined persons may increase, the app will make it easier for health and police department to track them. The general public will also benefit by this move.Box:How to download it--Go to Playstore and search for CVD tracker App. Download it. --Or use the link http://uen.io/6v4y||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-launches-app-to-alert-public-about-covid-zones/story-UpS26Xwet3BKs0U2Qfs8yK.html

12-04-2020||City||Chandigarh to go with Centre’s decision on lockdown to extend Covid-19 curfew||In the wake of extension of Covid-19 lockdown in Punjab and several other states, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Saturday decided that the curfew in Chandigarh will continue as long as the nationwide lockdown is in place.According to media reports, the central government is considering to extend the lockdown by two more weeks, till April 30. Although there is no official announcement yet, UT adviser Manoj Parida after the daily review meeting, chaired by Badnore, shared on Twitter that Chandigarh will follow the Union government in extending the curfew.Badnore, who attended a video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier in the day, said Chandigarh so far has fared well in the first phase of curfew. For the second phase, he has already directed Parida to formulate a scheme for utilising the services of idle workers. According to the latest health bulletin, the city so far has recorded 19 positive cases, out of which seven patients have been discharged after recovery. The UT has also started door-to-door screening of its entire population to further curb the outbreak.Need stricter implementation: DCDuring the meeting, deputy commissioner Mandip Brar told Badnore that curfew implementation needs to be strengthened in the city and violators punished strictly. Brar raised concern over people walking in parks during morning and evening hours, even as curfew relaxation is between 11am and 3pm, and that too limited to buying of essentials from neighbourhood markets.The administrator directed the director general of police, Sanjay Baniwal, to work on it. Baniwal informed Badnore that a mechanism is being developed to streamline impounding and releasing of vehicles.Municipal commissioner KK Yadav said a new pass system has been introduced in the wholesale market of Sector 26 to reduce the entry of unauthorised people.Contingency plan in placeThe UT has also prepared a contingency plan to deal with any surge in cases. Several government and private institutions, such as Sood Dharamshala in Sector 22, Panchayat Bhawan in Sector 18, Panjab University hostels, and Hotel Parkview, Sector 24, have been turned into Covid care centres with provision of 2,700 beds for people with mild symptoms. Severe positive cases will be admitted to the PGIMER’s Nehru Hospital Extension Block and the civil hospital in Sector 48.Meanwhile, Badnore directed the adviser to ensure that all students from the Northeast, Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir in the city are taken care of. A designated officer should look into their needs, he said.He also directed Parida that farmers going for harvesting and marketing of their produce should be facilitated during the curfew. He also directed the education department to devise a mechanism, through which 40 book stores of Chandigarh could arrange home delivery of books to students so that their studies are not affected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-to-go-with-centre-s-decision-on-lockdown-to-extend-covid-19-curfew/story-WUBRbgV84Hs7qbHc1QEVrK.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||No travel or contact history, Chandigarh health dept clueless how PU teacher got infected||Tracking the source of infection of the city’s 19th positive case – a Panjab University teacher - has become a challenge for the UT health department, as the patient has no travel or contact history.So far, seven contacts have been tested, of which two – a friend and a milkman — have come out clean.Results of his wife, 32, mother-in-law, 64, two daughters (an eight-year-old and a 22-day-old infant) and a man, who works at a booth in Sector 37, are awaited.The 40-year-old man, a resident of Sector 37, was tested positive on Friday and is admitted at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).“We have not traced the source yet. It’s difficult in this case because the patient says he did not come in contact with any person with travel history or any other positive patient. So, how do we establish where he got the infection from?” said UT health secretary Arun Gupta, while refusing to comment on whether this was a case of community transmission.An MC official said they had traced 113 primary and secondary contacts, including residents of two neighbouring houses, and placed them under home quarantine.“We are trying our best to find more contacts to trace the source of infection. It will be quite worrisome if the source is not ascertained,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.The patient’s wife had delivered a daughter at a private hospital in Sector 38 on March 20. On this, Gupta said, “The patient last visited the hospital on March 23 and it has been 18 days since. Had he contracted the infection from there, he should have shown symptoms within 14 days, which did not happen. But, we have still advised the hospital to quarantine the staff who came in contact with him on March 23.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-travel-or-contact-history-chandigarh-health-dept-clueless-how-pu-teacher-got-infected/story-uIJxMJgkP57JoozhQsuU9K.html
12-04-2020||City||Panchkula’s first two Covid patients recover, no fresh case for two days||The first two positive patients in Panchkula, a woman salon worker and a staff nurse, have recovered from the disease. The women, 38 and 36, respectively, were discharged from the civil hospital in Sector 6, bringing down the active coronavirus cases from five to three.Also, the district reported no new Covid-19 case for the second day in a row after three men, who attended a Tablighi Jamaat event in Rajasthan, tested positive on Thursday. District Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajiv Narwal said, “We are glad both the women have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. They were given a farewell by the health team at the hospital’s isolation ward after their second samples returned negative results on Saturday evening.”“It is their sheer determination that helped them recover speedily. The health staff also worked round-the-clock for their treatment. We hope the remaining three patients also recover soon,” he added. The salon worker’s family members, who were under quarantine at Nada Sahib gurdwara since she tested positive on March 21, were also allowed to go back home on Saturday.The first patient, a 38-year-old salon worker, who lives in Kharak Mangoli village, had tested positive after she came in contact with Chandigarh’s first coronavirus patient. The 23-year-old woman from Chandigarh’s Sector 21 had visited her at a salon on returning from London. The 36-year-old staff nurse at the civil hospital was tested on March 31 after she reportedly attended to the salon worker.‘THINK OF OTHERS’ WELLBEING’Speaking after her discharge, the nurse said, “Emotional strength helped me fight this disease. Don’t let negativity overpower you. As they say, wishing for something changes nothing, one has to be determined.”“Along with your safety, think of the wellbeing of others as well. This will help Haryana residents fight the pandemic,” she added.For the salon worker, it was a difficult time as she missed her children and couldn’t stop worrying about them. “I felt low many times, but did not lose hope. It was my resolve for a speedy recovery to return to my family and the health staff’s devotion that helped me get better,” she said.8 CONTACTS OF POSITIVE JAMAAT MEN TEST NEGATIVETwo days after three Panchkula men, who attended a Tablighi Jamaat event in Sikar, Rajasthan, last month, tested positive for Covid-19, eight of their family members tested negative.Reports of eight others are awaited. Samples of five family members of the 18-year-old man and 11 contacts of the 37-year-old man were taken for testing. The third patient is aged 80. The health department has also cordoned off their village, Banoi Khuda Baksh in Pinjore, and is undertaking screening of locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-s-first-two-covid-patients-recover-no-fresh-case-for-two-days/story-ueSIYlKfW9GcsSo92yHOeJ.html
12-04-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus: Lockdown may continue, Delhi seeks share in relief fund||The Delhi government has suggested the nationwide lockdown in force since March 25 may continue in the national capital till the end of April, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Saturday hours after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a video conference along with chief ministers of all other states. Kejriwal conveyed this opinion to the PM, who is scheduled to make an announcement over the issue within a few days. In a tweet later, Kejriwal said the PM was open to extending the shutdown for the 15-day period after April 14, when the curb is scheduled to end.Delhi’s tally of coronavirus cases crossed the 1,000 mark on Saturday. The national Capital had registered a total of 1,069 positive cases, including 19 deaths and 26 recoveries.During the meeting, Kejriwal also urged the PM to allocate funds for Delhi to fight Covid-19. “The chief minister requested that Delhi be given funds like other states are being given by the Centre. He reasoned that Delhi is under ‘dual pressure’ as it not only has to take care of its own 2 crore people, but also lakhs of other people who do not reside in the Capital but are (taking shelter) in the city due to the lockdown,” said a senior official in the chief minister’s office. On April 4, Sisodia had written to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman expressing disappointment for not giving “a single penny” to the national Capital from the ₹17,000 crore-worth emergency assistance given to different state governments. NO INDIVIDUAL CALL YETMinutes after the PM’s meeting got over Kejriwal took to Twitter where he said the Central government has decided to extend national lockdown by two more weeks. “PM has taken the correct decision to extend lockdown. Today, India’s position is better than many developed countries because we started lockdown early. If it is stopped now, all gains would be lost. To consolidate, it is imp to extend it,” Kejriwal tweeted in support of the lockdown.This came at a time when high-Covid spread states of Odisha, Maharasthra and Punjab, among others, have already extended the lockdown in their respective states.Delhi’s deputy chief minister later told HT that seeing the increasing number of coronavirus cases in the national Capital, lifting the lockdown now would be like setting off a ticking time bomb. When asked if the Delhi government will issue an order on its own on extending the lockdown, like some states did, Sisodia said such a need would not arise. “We have requested the PM that the extension has to be a ‘nation-wide’ lockdown. We do not see any possibility of the lockdown being lifted. The PM also agreed on continuing with the lockdown,” said Sisodia. While the PM announced the nation-wide shut down on March 24, Delhi chief minister Kejriwal had imposed the pan-city lockdown a day in advance. MANDIS TO ENSURE SOCIAL DISTANCING To ensure strict implementation of social distancing and mask-wearing in places which have a tendency to be crowded, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev on Saturday directed district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police to launch a crackdown at all the mandis (big markets) of the Capital. “The chief secretary warned that responsibility will be fixed in case of non-compliance of the order. He also directed officials that the upcoming festivals, celebrations are closely regulated. Social distancing and protocols of coronavirus prevention must be strictly observed,” a senior government official said.Soon after Dev’s directive, Najafgarh sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Saumya Sharma ordered shifting the Najafgarh wholesale vegetable market to Haibatpura village to prevent crowding.

12-04-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus: In Nabi Karim, Chandni Mahal sealed zones, keeping people indoors a challenge||From flying drones for surveillance, to making announcements from mosques and police pickets asking people to remain indoors -- the Delhi government has worked out different ways to ensure residents remain indoors and follow social distancing norms in the Walled City’s Chandni Mahal and Nabi Karim containment zones. The two places in Old and Central Delhi are among the most densely packed areas of the national Capital. They were declared containment zones, along with five others, by the Delhi government on Friday, taking the number of zones under hard lockdown to 30 in the city.Delhi has so far has recorded 1,068 Covid-19 positive cases with 19 deaths.On Saturday, three new containment zones were identified by the Dehi government, taking the total number of zones under lockdown in the national Capital to 33. The three new areas of containment zones were Deoli Extension, A-Block Mansarovar Garden (one house) and Gali Number 1-10 (house numbers 1-1,000) in C-Block Jahangirpuri.District Magistrate (south) BM Mishra said the containment plan in Deoli Extension was initiated after 8 members of a family tested positive for Covid-19. As per the order, house no-A 176, Deoli Extension and the area around it have been identified as the containment area.After an area is declared as a containment zone, police seal the area and do not allow anyone to step out, even to buy essential goods such as milk, vegetables, fruits, etc. All entry and exit points and even internal lanes are barricaded . The authorities allow only a number of selected vendors to supply groceries and other essentials to the neighbourhood with the help of RWA and civil defence volunteers. The essential items are then delivered at the doorstep of homes inside the zones. Every person who steps out of the zone in case of an emergency or whose work comes under list of essential services is scanned at the gates. Residents, however, complained that till Saturday evening, they were not provided any help by authorities in procuring essential items, such as milk and vegetables. According to the district administration officials, keeping people indoors and ensuring that everyone gets delivery of essential items has been challenging for them, especially in densely populated areas such as Chandni Mahal and Nabi Karim.The officials explained that Nabi Karim and Chandni Mahal areas are congested and are full of narrow alleys. All major stretches leading to these areas, along with all the internal roads, have been barricaded. “We have barricaded the hot spots and also used drones to check if people are roaming around in narrow alleys of Chandni Mahal and Nabi Karim. Announcements are being made to make people aware of the help available and that they must not panic and just stay put in their houses,” said Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (Central).Mohammad Shehzad, 32, a resident of Nabi Karim, however, said so far nobody from the local administration or other agencies had reached out to them for help. “Families are helping each other out here. Nobody has come from outside for help,” he said.Till Saturday evening, residents in Chandni Mahal claimed they did not even have the contact number or details of any agency that they could reach out for help in procuring essentials.“The area was sealed in the night. In the morning people who had stepped out to buy milk and vegetables were asked to go back home. There were no vendors, while the milk booth too didn’t have any stock. We waited the whole day for some announcement regarding door-to-door supply, but nothing happened,” said Mujeeb-ur-Rehman, a local resident, who is also a doctor.Anwar Ullah, general secretary of the Chandni Mahal RWA , agreed that there were concerns. “We have been waiting for the door-to-door delivery of essentials. While some people have some stock, many others remained without essentials such as milk and bread. We appeal to local authorities to arrange a mechanism for supply,” he said.Meanwhile, Prahlad Singh Sawhney, MLA Chandni Chowk said, he had received a complaint regarding milk booths running out of supply. “I have got a few complaints regarding milk and other supplies not reaching the sealed areas. I have asked the area SDM to address the situation on an urgent basis,” he said.District magistrate (central) Nidhi Srivastava said they had deployed civil defence volunteers to rush to people in need of essentials and home deliver goods.“Surveillance teams are still on the ground. We have circulated pamphlets with the contact numbers of grocers and other service providers. The volunteers will receive items on order and deliver it to doorsteps,” she said. She said that the efforts to screen households have been stepped up in these areas.Nabi Karim and Chandni Mahal were declared containment zones after three new Covid-19 cases were reported from Nabi Karim, and seven cases were recorded from Chandni Mahal in the last three days. Three deaths were also reported from Chandni Mahal in the last couple of weeks.DM (central), Srivastava, in her order, said there were 102 people staying in 13 locations in Chandni Mahal area, out of which 52 have tested positive. “Those who had tested positive have been sent to quarantine centres. However, they might have come in contact with residents of the area. Screening of the houses in the area is being done,” Srivastava said.The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has sanitised the entire area by using knapsack and rickshaw-mounted sprayer machines. “Six teams, each with three workers and one motorised knapsack pump, were pressed into service for the sanitisation exercise. Around 250 litres of diluted Sodium Hypochlorite disinfectant was used,” an official of the north civic body said.Apart from Nabi Karim and Chandni Mahal, the other five areas that were declared containment zones include Zakir Nagar in south-east Delhi, upscale residential area DLF Capital Greens in west Delhi’s Moti Nagar, Block B in Paschim Vihar, areas around a property in Ashok Nagar and pocket E of GTB Enclave. In Zakir Nagar, residents complained about the scarcity of drinking water supply in the locality.At west Delhi’s new Moti Nagar’s upscale Capital Greens residential complex, where a single tower has been sealed, the housing colony’s management has been helping in delivery of essentials to those under containment. According to officials, three cases were reported from the society’s G-tower, which has been cordoned off. “We have tied up with the management of the society to deploy two persons in shifts to deliver essentials. Also, the security staff of the complex has been put on vigil to ensure that nobody steps out of their homes,” said a senior Delhi government official, who did not wish to be named.In Pashchim Vihar, where only one case was found positive, an area covering at least 15-20 houses has been sealed. Similarly, at Ashok Nagar, area covering 40-50 houses has been turned into a containment zone. “Taking abundant precaution, we have sealed the houses in the vicinity for future containment. We have roped in RWAs to supply essentials to the sealed zones,” said an officer of the district magistrate (West)’s office.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Saturday conducted disinfectant spray drive to prevent spread of Covid in all the containment zones. SDMC has deployed over 200 sanitation employees, 20 tankers, 8 fire tenders and 16 jetting machines for sanitisation and disinfection in the containment zones.SDM Vivek Vihar on Saturday issued a list of vegetables, grocery and milk suppliers. For two hours between 7 and 9 in the morning, people would be allowed to buy their essentials, as per the order. Sadar Bazar witnessed a rush of people at a local vegetable market on Saturday.In Ashok Nagar around 400 houses were sanitised around the area by using motorized pumps. In Zakir Nagar, 35 sanitation employees were deployed for spraying disinfectant in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-nabi-karim-chandni-mahal-sealed-zones-keeping-people-indoors-a-challenge/story-8bx6AXK8DBD1cGuUGg6nOL.html

12-04-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19: Gurugram containment zones wear deserted look as cops restrict movement||Residential areas covered under the city’s nine containment zones wore a deserted look on Saturday, with police barricading almost all entry and exits in these localities. Heavy police presence was seen across all sealed areas as they spearheaded containment measures, while officials from the administration went around making important announcements regarding the Do’s and Dont’s of the containment exercise on loudspeakers. The administration, on Friday, had shared a revised list of containment zones — which included Palam Vihar, Laburnum Society in Sushant Lok Phase 1, Emaar Palm Gardens, sector 83, Sector 54 and Nirvana Country, Sector 9, Sector 39, Village Fazilpur Jharsa, village Raipur, Sohna, and Ward no.11, Pataudi. While the order mentioned Sector 54 and Palam Vihar, barricading was only done in limited areas in both zones. While Suncity Township was sealed in Sector 54, Bestech Park View condominium and C block were sealed in Palam Vihar. The district administration has sealed the epicentres from where the Covid-19 cases have been reported, while the remaining area within the 3kilometre radius of the epicentre is allowed restricted movement.By Saturday, police had completed the barricading of all the nine zones with the help of MCG and the PWD. Sixty-four police pickets have been set up outside the containment zones where a total of 1,342 personnel have been deployed in three shifts. “We have closed all entry points, except one in each area and teams have been deployed at all locations. No vehicular movement is allowed except for doctors, nurses, essential good vehicles or for any medical emergency. All essential goods are being supplied in the residential areas so there is no reason for people to move outside ,” said police commissioner Muhammad Akil.He added that all the deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) and assistant commissioners of police (ACPs) had been asked to patrol the area thrice a day and ensure that all personnel deployed in the ground were taken care of.Nirvana CountryWhile essential supplies were available in most of the areas, residents raised concerns about minor inconveniences. Residents said that they were being compelled to cover long distances till the entry gate of the Nirvana Country Township for collecting supplies. Some residents of Nirvana Country-located condominiums, Close South and Fresco Apartments, said that they were unhappy with the new plan as they were now required to walk for at least a kilometre just to collect deliveries, which are only taking place at the main gate.Nidhi Kapoor, a resident of Fresco Apartment, said that the administration had not shared clear instructions. “The administration should send a clear message so that residents know what all can be ordered. Walking for more than a kilometre is not possible for everyone and it takes more than half an hour to complete the task,” said Kapoor. People who ordered from app-based food services were also seen arguing with police personnel seeking entry of delivery persons in Nirvana Country.Shiv Kumar, another Nirvana Country resident, said that there was confusion regarding the entry of vendors in the locality. “Every hour, rules for vendors are changing. Until today afternoon, vendors were allowed. But post that they suddenly stopped the entry of all vendors, except MCG bus, gas connection vendors and milk vans. Even chemist delivery boys are not being given entry and we are being asked to come to the gate, which is at a distance of over 1 km since Nirvana is spread over 300 acres,” said Kumar.Nilesh Tandon, RWA president of Fresco Apartments, said that the condominium had received supplies from MCG and no major disruption took place in the area. “We are receiving essentials such as fruits and vegetables through MCG. Further, we have three grocery shops within the complex to meet the demands. Residents who ordered food from outside did face issues since the area was locked down, said Tandon.Palam ViharPalam Vihar containment zone witnessed a partial lockdown with only specific areas—Bestech Park View condominium and C block —being sealed. Markets were open and vendors moved about in the colony but in block C, the movement was restricted. In Park View condominium, the authorities sealed only one tower. But in the entire complex residents have been asked to stay inside their flats and no movement is allowed in common areas. People moved around in masks and teams of MCG were also seen sanitizing the area.SC Kumar, president, Park View RWA, said that officials from the health department had started screening and checking the condominium complex and a team of four to five officials had visited the complex. “We are trying to ensure that all rules for the lockdown are followed and the spread of the virus is contained,” said Kumar. Shops in Palam Vihar market complex selling essential commodities remained open and most roads were operational.Laburnum Society, Sushant Lok-IAt Laburnum Society, residents said that some inconveniences had been caused due to the new restrictions. Vijay Sood, member of the committee formed to deal with Covid-19 related issue, said that restrictions on the movement of pets had caused inconvenience. “We are not allowed to step out and we don’t have a separate area for the pets in our complex . We had private space outside the gates where we used to take the pets for walk, but even that is not being permitted now,” said Sood. The supply of essential also took place without any major disruptions and needs were met through the shops located within the complex. “We have a provisions store, vegetable and chemist shop on-premises. We don’t need to depend on the administration for essentials here,” said Sood.Residents at Laburnum, however, said that the shops within the complex were selling all items above the MRP. “I bought a packet of rice which sold at double the price,” said Manu Sharma, a resident.Six police posts have been set up in Sushank Lok, including two in front of Laburnum Society. Police is allowing delivery boys till the gate of the condominium since the complex is hardly half a kilometre away from the main Sushant Lok road.Sector 9At Sector 9, two security guards along and two policemen were deployed at the common entry/exit point for keeping a check on vehicles entering the sector. People were only being allowed to pass after showing their IDs or passes. Vegetable vendors, who had passes, were also being allowed to move through . As gates within the area were closed, the elderly were seen buying it from behind the iron grilles of the gates. “We have been purchasing vegetables from behind closed gates since the lockdown has been imposed,” said Naresh Kumar, an elderly. The road connecting sector 9 with Devi Lal Colony, where a 38-year-old man was confirmed Covid-19 positive, was also sealed.Emaar Palm Gardens, sector 83All the gates of Palm Gardens condominium in sector 83 were closed by the police on Saturday morning and entry and exit inside the complex stopped. The residents said that they were dependent on maintenance staff for the supply of essentials for delivery till the doors of their flats. “The movement of people inside the complex has been completely banned and we are ordering food and other requirements over the phone and getting it through the maintenance of staff. The staff delivers it to the apartment.

12-04-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19: Gurugram district administration defines boundary of containment zones||The Gurugram administration officials on Saturday clarified that the perimeter of the containment zone in nine areas of the city is restricted to three kilometre radius from the point where Covid-19 cases has been reported. Officials said it will be difficult to turn entire sector or area into containment zone as providing access to essential services might get tough. The district administration on Friday had issued an order declaring nine containment zones and authorising the sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) and police to define the perimeter of the containment zones.The decision of declaring the containment zone was taken to prevent the clustering of Covid-19 cases in areas from where the cases have been reported. Since March 16, 32 cases have been reported from Gurugram, including 15 Jamaat attendees from Pataudi and Sohna. A 65-year- old man from Fazilpur Jharsa, who was Covid-19 positive died on April 7. Officials, however, said the main cause of death was heart attack and septicemia.Amit Khatri, the Gurugram deputy commissioner, said, “As per the guideline, the perimeter of a containment zone covers 3-kilometre radius from the point where a case has been reported. We are demarcating the perimeter by barricading and sealing the entry and exit points falling under the 3km radius. We are trying to create awareness about the perimeter control through announcements. Also, teams will be posting signs to inform about the specific areas under the nine containment zones.”The nine containment zones are sector 9, 83, 39, 54 and Nirvana Country, Laburnum Sushant Lok Phase 1, Fazilpur Jharsa, Pataudi and village Raipur, Sohna. Though the order identified Palam Vihar as a containment zone, only Bestech Apartment and C block has been sealed, where four of a family were confirmed Covid-19 positive. They have recovered since and were discharged from hospital in the last week of March. Likewise, Sushant Lok phase 1 Laburnum, where a 50-year-old woman was detected Covid-19 positive, has been sealed . The residents of the adjoining condos are allowed restricted movement. As per the health department guidelines, the containment zone covers a radius of 3-kilometre and the adjoining buffer zone covers a seven-kilometre radius. The police is using the road distance from the epicentre to map the radius and placing the barricades. Hitender Kumar, SDM, Badhshahpur, who is handling containment zones in sector 54, Laburnum society, sector 39, Nirvana South Close and Fazilpur Jharsa, said, “In certain sectors, largely populated by condominiums, it is difficult to seal the entire area. If we do so, the number of households increase which will create trouble in providing essential services. Therefore, the epicentre from where the case has been reported is getting sealed with no public or vehicular movement, while the remaining 3 kilometre area having restricted movement. We are creating awareness about the perimeter by making announcements, asking people not to move out.” According to him, it will take some time for residents to realise which residential houses are covered in the perimeter. “Barricades have been put up. Specific entry and exit points have been closed so that households who are not falling under the perimeter should not enter these areas,” said Hatinder. Rajesh Kumar, SDM, Pataudi said that the administration’s attempt was to control the perimeter around which the cases have been reported. We have covered only wards 11 and 13 in Pataudi, where coronavirus cases have been reported. Within the 3kilomtre radius, we have put eight nakas — five in Pataudi and three in Hailey Mandi. The perimeter covers almost 3000 houses.” Following the guidelines, all roads connecting the containment zones are been guarded by the police. In certain areas, details of all the persons moving out of the perimeter for essential or emergency service is being recorded, especially in condominiums. “The perimeter of the containment depends on the risk assessment of the area. It can be revised based on the epidemiological investigation. In the containment zones, it must be ensured there is no unchecked outward movement of population, except for essential services and medical emergencies,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-district-administration-defines-boundary-of-containment-zones/story-6U646KbGLX4DSVqyjDbHeK.html

The district magistrate has allotted ₹46.22 lakh to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences in Greater Noida and ₹65 lakh to the Super Speciality Children Hospital in Sector 39 for developing Covid-19 laboratories so that these delays can be avoided.“It is important to get faster results to ensure quick containment and surveillance drives in affected areas. On Friday, a woman who was operated on at private hospital tested positive for Covid-19 following which medical and paramedical staff of the hospital were put in quarantine. Currently, the medical staff are playing the most important role so we have to ensure their safety. We are also trying to come up with a way to ensure that the emergency patients who come for surgeries are tested in advance in their respective districts before they reach here,” Suhas LY, district magistrate, said.Till now, the staff of two hospitals in the district have been put in quarantine following the Covid-19 outbreak.By Saturday night, the health department had notified 1,895 travellers and put 1,423 people under surveillance. A total of 1,224 samples have been collected. A total of 64 cases have come out positive and 13 of them have been discharged. There are 51 active cases in the district at present.Another problem faced by the district administration is of industries firing their junior employees. There are instances wherein despite the order of the district magistrate, a few organisations haven’t paid the labourers their salaries this month even after April 7, the deadline by which they were meant to be paid.“We are continuously holding meetings with industries in the district to convince them to not fire any employee. We are also trying to look for firms which haven’t paid their employees yet,” Suhas said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-more-areas-declared-hot-spots-and-sealed-in-gb-nagar-after-more-cases-emerge/story-s9rwbEHQlZYCLHre9mROrM.html
12-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: IIT-Delhi may restart session in July, fast-track a finish by month-end||The Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, (IIT-D) said it is considering restarting the current academic session from the first week of July, and concluding by the end of the month. The institute is also mooting reopening hostel facilities around the same time, officials privy to the matter said. The 2019-20 academic session was suspended on March 12 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The suggestions were made by IIT-D officials during an online interactive session with students on Saturday, chaired by the institute’s director V Ramgopal Rao. The considerations will be sent to the senate — the highest decision making body of the institute — for approval. “We have discussed the possible steps that can be taken to complete the session with our students. We will send these considerations to the senate for the final decision. We intend to complete the session by July 31,” Rao said.Meanwhile, the institute will continue holding online classes and uploading course material online. “Online content will be shared for all the courses. We are considering holding classes for two weeks in July to catch up the uploaded material before taking exams,” officials said during the interaction. The institute has also asked all course coordinators for a plan on conducting examinations. “We are examining the possibility of conducting exams by the end of July. The course coordinators have been asked to decide on their major and minor exams. If the need arises, they can either take the minor exams on an internal level, or merge it with the major exams,” they said.IIT-D is planning to reopen the hostel facility from July 6 only. “As a precautionary measure, we are thinking of reopening hostel facilities only a month after the lockdown is withdrawn. We are also planning to screen all students before they rejoin the hostel,” the official said. The nationwide lockdown is so far scheduled to end from April 15 onwards. However, some states like Punjab, Maharashtra and Karnataka have extended the curbs till April 30. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday also held a video meeting with all chief ministers, most of whom were in favour of extending the lockdown beyond Tuesday.The institute had vacated all hostels last month, due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease.During the interaction, officials also said the institution is planning to hold a special placement drive for those the final-year students who lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic either in June or July. The institute, meanwhile, said that it might allow PhD and MTech students to return to the campus immediately after the lockdown. “If the senate approves, they might be allowed to attend the labs and complete their projects immediately after the lockdown,” officials said.IIT-D has also promised MTech and PhD students it will continue issuing their research stipends during the lockdown. Besides, the students who have job commitments in May have been asked to contact their departmental heads and deans. Officials said they will be issued provisional certificates to facilitate their joining the respective firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/iit-d-may-restart-session-in-july-fast-track-a-finish-by-month-end/story-E96pFv4p8n2tZjHwmtkssM.html
12-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Happiness classes, Mission Buniyad to reach students’ homes via recorded voice messages||Addressing the second session of ‘Parenting In The Time Of Corona’ on Saturday, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said government schools will take ‘happiness classes’ and ‘Mission Buniyad’ activities to students’ homes so they can continue learning even while the lockdown remains in force. He launched the ‘Every Home A School, Every Parent A Teacher’ initiative, under which the government has requested parents to tutor their children at home. The first session was addressed by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on April 4.“Starting Sunday, parents of students in government schools up to class 8 will receive audio calls (IVR) from the education department to guide them on how to take on the role of teachers at home. Step-by-step activities will be shared through pre-recorded audio messages on how to conduct Happiness Classes and Mission Buniyaad at home,” the deputy CM said.Sisodia said the purpose of guiding parents on ‘happiness classes’ was to create a positive environment for students at home. “We are all gripped with anxiety. We do not know what to do as a fun activity. We cannot go out or sit in the parks; we are confined to our homes. In such situations, it is possible to get irritated with one another.”“The activities (in happiness classes) would be conducted at home every day by parents. We will support around 8 lakh students and their families to practice mindful meditation from Sunday with the help of our teachers,” he said.Happiness Class is unique curriculum to help students develop self-awareness and mindfulness. Director of the Directorate of Education (DoE) Binay Bhushan, who accompanied the education minister, requested parents to use the lockdown as an opportunity to tutor kids at homes. “We had planned to start Mission Buniyaad in April. So, we request parents to start coaching their kids to make them start reading and writing few lines every day and solve basic math problems. It is also a good way to help tackle boredom,” Bhushan said. Under the Mission Buniyad initiative, the government schools work towards ensuring that every student of classes 3 to 9 is able to read, write and do basic mathematics. During the interaction, Bhavna Sawnani, a member of the Delhi government’s team Mission Buniyaad, also gave tips on how to practice the initiative creatively at home. “Parents can try teaching their kids by making games out of the process and engage them creatively. They can play ‘shabdo ki antakshari’ with their kids, which will improve their vocabulary or talk about their thoughts and ask their kids how they feel and ask them to write it down,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/happiness-classes-mission-buniyad-to-reach-students-homes-through-recorded-voice-messages/story-89CQJiEN6Qu4N0qckIpyQL.html
12-04-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus: Nurses ask for rotation of duty after 14-day shift in Covid wards||Nurses who have completed one rotation of the 14-day duty in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) wards and 14 days’ quarantine should be moved to other duties so that they can go home, said a letter written to Delhi’s health secretary by the All India Government Nurses Federation.The letter was written after 22 nurses who had completed one rotation were asked to report for the second round of duty Tuesday onwards at Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital, the second-largest Covid-19 hospital in the city.These nurses had been drawn from various hospitals in the city to staff the 200-bed hospital.“If the same batch of nursing officers are posted to the Covid-19 wards for many months continuously then their children and family will suffer. The families (of the nurses being posted again) have to wait for another month or maybe more if a proper policy is not framed. This will lead to stress and mental agony among the nursing personnel,” says the letter, a copy of which is with the HT.Around 47 doctors, nurses and technicians posted for the first 28-day cycle in the Covid-19 ward at Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital in mid-March were from other Delhi government hospitals.“The government should create several such teams of nurses. Once they work in the Covid-19 ward they should go back to their original postings so that they can be with their families while the next team takes over,” said nurse GK Khurana, Secretary-General of All India Government Nurses Federation.The hospital administrator, BL Sherwal, said “The postings are done by the government. They are not our staff and we are just utilising their services. If the government sends us another batch of nurses, technicians and doctors then we will be happy to arrange such rotations. Our own staff have also been given a similar shift.”The organisation, in another letter to the union health secretary, has asked the government to reserve beds in Covid-19 hospitals for healthcare workers.“We have been receiving reports from across the country of healthcare workers testing positive for the infection. The government must ensure that they receive proper care and we have suggested reserving around six or eight beds in Covid-19 hospitals for healthcare workers,” said nurse Khurana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nurses-ask-for-rotation-of-duty-after-14-day-shift-in-covid-wards/story-8NWsAOnigNelmVRvimhyKJ.html

The waste and recycling industry’s essential services continue, but for frontline workers it is no longer business as usual. For Pune-based Swach (Solid waste collection and handling- a cooperative of self-employed waste collectors) which has a team of 3,500 sanitation workers on ground, less number of safety kits containing masks,gloves and other essential items, is a major worry.According to Harshad Barde, director, Swach, the organisation has 95 per cent of its staff on ground. Though the access to sealed areas is limited, garbage collection from other areas is fully functioning.“The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has provided us with 6,500 gloves, masks and soaps and are also making arrangements for additional 35,000 soaps (10 per member). We also have 7,000 gloves and scarves (2 per member) which we received from another organisation.However, these resources are not sufficient,” said Barde.In the coming months, Swach members will need six gloves per member, that is 21,000 gloves, 70,000 soaps (2 per member) and 7,000 scarves (2 per member) in order to remain safe, according to Barde.Though the PMC is trying to procure more safety kits, Swach has appealed for assistance from individuals and groups too for gloves and masks.The masks that the Swach workers wear are washable. For Mangal Gaikwad who works in Kotbagi lane in Aundh, mask is a new thing,however, she wears it duly without fail. “Earlier, we used to wear gloves, but now ever since Covid-19, we have been told to wear the mask as well. We have received two of these. Initially it was uncomfortable, but since we have no choice and I don’t want to fall sick, I have to wear it,’ she said.Kalyani Patil, who oversees the operations across PMC, said, “It is difficult for us to train the waste pickers about Covid-19 in such a short time. We trained the Prabhag (ward) coordinators with help of pamphlets and distributed the same to everyone explaining them the proper ways of sanitising and the importance of wearing masks and gloves. Initially, a lot of them were averse to the idea of masks, but with neighbours and the areas they visited all following protocol, they all began wearing a mask or even a scarf or handkerchief without any complaints.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/swach-warriors-in-pune-equipped-with-masks-and-gloves-but-need-more-in-fight-against-covid-19/story-qSKwu0mO3NnNoMqaLvtl0J.html

The two others discharged were two housemaids working for the family. The family has been kept in institutional quarantine in Miraj itself. Of the four remaining people, one is a relative of one of the housemaids while three others include a two-year-old child and his parents. “The two-year-old child and the housemaid’s sister were found later and are still under treatment. The parents of the child have both tested negative but not discharged,” said Dr Saket Patil, taluka health officer of Uram Islampur.While the child was tested positive on March 29, the relative of the housemaid was tested positive on April 6.“It has been days since we saw our family members.

He said with exposure to industry and academic research, the group made their first face shield prototype with readily available material at their disposal.One drawback they found in most face shields in the market was that they all were based on A4 size lamination sheets of about 100 microns to 150 microns in thickness which didn’t cover the full face and was also easily damaged.The group addressed these issues in their design and manufacture and has received good reviews from users.Made of high quality material with 0.8mm thickness, the shields are being offered in two designs- with and without foam support. Targeting a price of Rs 100, plans are afoot to raise increase the current production capacity of 2,000 units per day to 5,000 units per day, said Magnani.Aruna M Katara, managing committee president of I2IT and Hope Foundation and research centre appreciated the efforts of the alumni. She said her late father Pralhad P Chhabria, founder chairman of Finolex Group and founder president of Hope Foundation, firmly believed that the Indian youth have the potential and capability to transform the country into a superpower. All that they needed was a platform and an opportunity.“I am extremely proud of our team on campus who have come up with this indigenous solution to help the backbone of our country – our police force, our medical teams and our community workers,” she said. Hope Foundation plans to donate the shields to the Pune Police Force even as many city hospitals have shown interest in stocking them, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-i2it-alumni-develop-low-cost-face-shields-for-police-health-workers/story-arpuMN7pF92g3gKMpuby2K.html
12-04-2020||Pune||Yourspace: Punekars look at the brighter side of the Covid-19 lockdown||The lockdown due to the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has kept everyone indoors. HT finds out how residents of Pune are managing to stay safe and positive during these times. More time to read, watch TVWhen the lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 I was feeling tensed as the construction material was lying on the spots and the labourers were returning to their hometowns. I prepared myself to accept the present situation and understood that the steps have been taken for the benefit of the society and our own family members and near and dear ones. As the domestic worker stopped coming to work, I started helping in household work. Most of the time during the day, I read a book and thanks to Doordarshan, I am able to recollect old memories by watching Ramayana and Mahabharat. Sandeep Shah Keeping in touch with friends and family through technologyI am missing my morning routine of going out for walks and socialising with my friends. I keep myself busy by completing the household chores and reading old magazines. I keep in touch with my friends and relatives by calling them up regularly. I also do yoga every day at home to stay fit. Vijay VaidyaBonding with familyThe maximum amount of time is spent trying out new recipes as everyone is at home. We bond with each other by cooking different meals and even children help in the process. I discourage children from spending a lot of time in front of the TV and instead involve them in some hobby. To stay fit, I exercise on the terrace of my building twice a day.Vaishali KhairnarVirtual classroomsAs the classes are closed due to the lockdown, I keep in touch with the students via technology. I am also posting notes about the classes on WhatsApp and help students solve problems or their queries about various subjects through virtual classrooms by using applications like Zoom. I am also spending time with my family and reading books.Sachin HishwankarGetting tech-savvyI am posting videos of arts and crafts on different social media platforms which can be helpful for parents to keep their children busy as they are not going to school. This helps me know more about technology and how to get in touch with today’s youth. I am also trying out new recipes as all the family members are at home.

12-04-2020||Pune||On the Frontline: I have been told to keep a distance from my family at home, Prashant Ranpise, chief fire officer, PMC||Prashant Ranpise, chief fire officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), a recipient of the President’s Fire Safety Medal in 2010, spoke of the role of the Pune fire brigade in battling the coronavirus pandemic. Firemen in the city are helping with spraying the disinfectant sodium hypochlorite solution in contaminated areas and transportation and cremation of Covid-19 (coronavirus) patients. More than 25 people have died of this deadly disease so far.What is your role in this pandemic?Ever since this coronavirus crisis began, the fire brigade has been working in close coordination with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) staff. We have two roles- we help with the spraying of the disinfectant sodium hypochlorite solution using the quick relief vehicle with a capacity of 500 litres. We take up various areas which are contaminated.Our second role is to provide assistance after the death of a Covid-19 patient is announced. When no one is willing to carry the dead and relatives refuse to take the bodies, then it is for us to do the needful.We were all scared when such a call came for the first time. The doctors advised us to wear PPE (personal protective equipment) and now we have three shifts with a van on standby at Sassoon Hospital every day. There are 55 to 60 people working in one shift.How does your day begin and roll out?We are working continuously, where my job is to coordinate with Sassoon Hospital as well the cremation places in the city. The hospital provides 4 people to go along with us, to help load the body. Besides this, we have regular fire fighting calls as well as rescue and other calls which include tree collapse, animal rescue, and other such. We get around 13 to 14 calls per day.In spite of the Lockdown, the emergency calls range from garbage burning gone out of control to rescuing animals from tree or from terraces, and even birds trapped in life-threatening situation. We work round-the-clock, although on a typical day, our work begins at 7 am and goes on till midnight.What precautions are you taking?We have been given sanitizers, masks, hand gloves, gumboots, among others. The first thing I do is get into the bath the moment I reach home. There is a lot of tension in my family because of this work,I am often scolded by my wife, especially if I am coming from a duty in Sassoon Hospital. I try to explain that we are well protected, but there is fear in their mind.I have three college-going children but even they are afraid as they watch news daily showing the unfolding crisis, I have been told to keep distance at home from them too. What is your view of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune? How do you see it unfolding?I feel, as compared to the other states and cities, Pune has done a remarkable job, and it is for the first time that we are facing such a big crisis. It is taking people time to become used to the idea of staying at home. What gaps do you see in health and relief work?PMC has shown remarkable readiness from the first day of this crisis. The way they cordoned off Naidu Hospital and the smooth coordination between so many departments, I don’t see any gaps in the health work or relief work; it is going very smoothly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-the-frontline-i-have-been-told-to-keep-a-distance-from-my-family-at-home-prashant-ranpise-chief-fire-officer-pmc/story-8vgiONhPccCbqjm7nE4L6N.html
12-04-2020||Pune||Pune civic body addresses delays in cremating Covid-19 patients||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) authorities have taken steps to prevent inordinate delays in cremating the bodies of patients who have died of the Coid-19 (coronavirus) in the city. While 26 patients have so far died of Covid-19 in Pune, the civic body has designated six gas-fired furnaces in different parts of the city for the cremation.Delays of about four hours occurred at the Yerawada and Vaikunth Road crematoria due to manpower shortage and unavailability of personal protective equipment (PPEs) for the staff.“Even I received the complaint about shortage of safety equipment,” said Shrinivas Kandul, head of PMC’s electrical department and incharge of the city’s 31 crematoria.Vaikunth crematorium’s health inspector Kishor Thorat said, on Friday, a body had arrived from Sassoon Hospital and the cremation was delayed by about four hours due to manpower shortage. “It is true that we are facing manpower shortage at our gas-fired furnace. At the Vaikunth crematorium, we have three electric furnaces for non-coronavirus dead bodies and one gas-fired furnace exclusively for coronavirus patients. On Friday, the staff working on the electric furnaces was busy and there was no one to attend to the dead body at the gas furnace,” he said.Thorat pointed out that previously the relatives of the dead would help with lifting the body and taking it to the furnace. That however, is not allowed in the case of patients who have died of the coronavirus disease. There was thus a delay in cremating the body that had arrived at Sassoon Hospital, he said.A similar delay in cremating the body of another Covid-19 patient occurred at the crematorium in Yerawada.Electric department head Shrinivas Kandul who is head for all the 31 crematoriums in the city acknowledged that there was some mismanagement in ensuring stocks of personal protective equipment (PPEs) for the crematorium staff, which was another reason for the delay in cremating the bodies. He said a special supply of PPEs and additional staff has been organised at the six, designated crematoriums for coronavirus patients. “The PPEs for crematorium staff will be delivered by Saturday or Sunday evening,” he said.Thorat said the Vaikunth crematorium had adequate stock of PPEs which included 15 full-length aprons, 100 pairs of gloves and 100 disposable masks.The civic body has designated six gas-fired crematoriums for the cremation of the bodies of coronavirus patients as there is comparatively less handling of the body at the gas fired crematoriums. However, with just one or two operators at the gas furnaces, the crematoriums started encountering shortage of personnel to handle the bodies.“We are recruiting more manpower for this and additional staff will be available by Saturday evening or Sunday,’ Kandul said.Designated crematoriums6 gas-fired crematoriums designated for Covid-19 patients in Pune .These are located at Aundh, Bopodi, Katraj, Mundhwa and VaikunthPPEs for staff at crematorium:* Full-length aprons, hand gloves, mask, shoes, cap* Disinfectant Sodium Chlorite solution* Hand pump for sanitising the area||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-civic-body-addresses-delays-in-cremating-covid-19-patients/story-QD9K2Sc1tyUVekaBQPvc4K.html

12-04-2020||City||Two more men test positive in Punjab’s Covid-19 cluster, taking Mohali district count up to 50||MOHALIWith two more persons testing positive for Covid-19 at Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi town on Saturday, the total count of coronavirus cases in Mohali district touched 50.The first case in the district was reported on March 20. The district has witnessed two deaths while five people have been cured in these 22 days. The active cases as of now are 43.A 38-year-old man and a 58-year-old man, who works as barber, have tested positive. “They are neighbours of the first positive case of the village and had been in touch with him. They were tested after contact tracing,” said Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh. The two have been shifted to Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur. Samples of their family members and other contacts are being collected for testing, said the civil surgeon. In all, 244 samples have been collected from the village, of which reports in 41, including 38 new ones collected on Saturday, are awaited. “The district administration is undertaking extensive contact tracing and sampling, which is leading to the identification of more cases. This would lead to their isolation in time and help in combating the coronavirus,” said Girish Dayalan, deputy commissioner, Mohali.With this, the total number of positive cases at Jawaharpur village, which has emerged as the biggest Covid-19 cluster in Punjab, has gone up to 34, with most patients from the extended family of a 42-year-old panch, who was the first to test positive on April 4. The district administration has already declared the village, having a population of 3,000, a containment zone, completely banning the movement of people. Three neighbouring villages of Devi Naga, Mehmudpur and Haripur Kurha have also been sealed. As a precautionary measure, the health authorities have also isolated a shopkeeper of Trivedi Camp in Dera Bassi, who was in touch with the positive cases in Jawaharpur. His report is awaited. A densely populated area, Trivedi Camp was set up initially for refugees at the time of Partition and houses about 5,000 people, mostly families of wholesale traders.Eyes on PGI corona ward workerThe district administration has collected blood and throat swab samples of a man employed as a contractual labourer at the dedicate Covid-19 ward of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), suspecting him to be the coronavirus carrier, who led to the outbreak in Jawaharpur village.Contact tracing of the first positive case in the village Jawaharpur – the 42-year-old panch — led them to this man, who is his cousin and stays in the same village. “The person so far is asymptomatic and we are getting his tests conducted on urgent basis. The reports are awaited,” said Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan. The panch had no travel history and all employees of his factory who had been in touch with the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz attendees had tested negative.Visiting the ground zeroIt’s silent, no one’s around as drones fly over Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi, now a Covid-19 positive cluster with 34 persons infected. The villagers are huddled inside their homes. Some say they have thrown excess milk into drains with no one to buy it.The district authorities come for patrolling thrice a day and apart from the drones to check movement, a station house officer has been stationed at the entry point to ensure no one comes into or leaves the village. “There is no fodder for the cattle, they are dying of hunger. Each animal costs about Rs 1 lakh,” laments said Joga Singh, a former sarpanch of the village.Though fodder is being sold in the village, people don’t have money. No one’s allowed to even go to an ATM, he adds.Curiously however, even though there are claims of milk being “thrown away”, a helpline set up by the administration for the villagers to ask for essential items being sent to their doorsteps received requests for a packet of Verka milk and cold drinks.The village, with a population of about 3,000 has 10 dairy farming families supplying milk to different houses in the Mohali and neighbouring areas.“We have to destroy the milk as we cannot supply it to our customers,” says Manish, a local.Avtaar Singh, also a resident, says no medicines are available and rations are running out. “We are not allowed to go into the fields.”There are about 150 cattle in the village for which the administration claims to have provided fodder.“No movement will be allowed at any cost in the village to contain the spread of the disease,” says Kuldeep Bawa, sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Dera Bassi. People can call the helpline if they want anything, he adds.As for milk, he says people are throwing it away instead of drinking it. A volunteer was also making the rounds of the village to check if people required essential items.The administration had distributed 90 packets of dry ration in the last 15 days to underprivileged families before sealing the village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-more-men-test-positive-in-punjab-s-covid-19-cluster-taking-mohali-district-count-up-to-50/story-iSaFbVZuDzAHrVF2140BIP.html
12-04-2020||Education||Bihar Teachers’ Association releases list of 42 striking teachers who died unpaid||Chandrakala Mishra, 40, is now a single parent who is responsible for her three children after the death of her husband Arvind Kumar, who was a contractual teacher at Girls’ Upgraded Middle School in Vaishali. The eldest among them, a son, took the matriculation exam this year. Kumar passed away on March 20.“My husband died unpaid and now, we have to fend for ourselves. We have been facing several difficulties since last month after the government suspended him, as he had joined the indefinite strike for justice. He suffered brain haemorrhage a couple of days after the suspension and could not recover,” said Chandrakala.Mala Devi, mother of a teenage daughter, is also suffering from the same agony after her husband, Ram Sanyog Sada, died untimely on April 1 in Sitamarhi. “My husband was the lone bread earner in the family. As he was on strike with his colleagues, he didn’t receive the salary of previous months. I am clueless as how to sustain the family,” she said.The cases of Chandrakala Mishra and Mala Devi are among the 42 other teacher families, who have met untimely deaths and died without being paid.“The state government has turned apathetic towards the families. It is not only about the payment of salary, the bereaved families are not being paid even the ex-gratia compensation of ₹4 lakh as per their service condition,” alleged the Bihar Secondary School Teachers’ Association (BSSTA).The BSSTA released the list of all 42 teachers along with their addresses and personal details, who lost their lives during the strike period. Majority of them suffered brain haemorrhage, heart attack due to the action taken against them, while several others died due to lack of proper treatment owing to poor financial condition and non-availability of general medical facility that had turned scarce due to outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic.General secretary of BSSTA Shatrughan Prasad Singh said, “The strike stretched for too long as the government did not want to interfere. How many more lives it wants to take.”The BSSTA also condemned the government decision to withhold salary of striking teachers for the period they worked and claimed that the education department was disobeying its own order passed in 2015, in which it was stipulated that the salary of teachers would not be stopped without any solid reason.“When the entire world is in distress due to Coronavirus pandemic, the rigidness of government towards the teachers is insensitive. The teachers have always come forward to extend support to the chief minister (CM). They have accepted duty at schools which are converted into quarantine centres along with contribution of a day’s salary which sums around ₹3 crore to the CM relief fund. It’s high time that the government steps forward and take steps to help the contractual teachers,” said Singh.Ashwini Pandey, spokesperson of TET-STET Qualified Teachers’ Association, said, “The state government is concerned for Coronavirus death but they show no empathy towards the teachers who died untimely. I appeal to the government to take positive steps for negotiation and restore peace among teachers who are struggling from past two months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/bihar-teachers-association-releases-list-of-42-striking-teachers-who-died-unpaid/story-WYm26xXauOBDraJWXOZy6K.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||For PGI, another Herculean task: Soliciting blood donors||A 17-year-old travelled 140 km from Saharanpur to PGIMER Chandigarh to get two units of blood. Suffering from thalassaemia, he needs blood transfusion every 20 days. However, amid the Covid-19 contagion, the blood bank of Postgraduate Institute of Medical College and Research (PGIMER) is finding it a formidable task to meet the growing demand for blood amid diminished donation.NGO workers and staff of PGI’s blood transfusion department are making hundreds of calls every day to those in the list of volunteer blood donors and organisations. On regular days, PGI’s blood donation van goes to the field and collects blood units. But amid lockdown, the department has started bringing donors to PGIMER instead. The only silver lining is that while the collection of blood has decreased by a third, the demand for blood has also diminished for the time being.Dr RR Sharma, head of the blood transfusion department, PGIMER, said: “Blood supply has been hit because of the lockdown, but at the same time routine surgical interventions have been postponed, leading to some decline in demand, too.”“We are making hundreds of calls trying to get people to come here and donate blood. About 40% agree to donate, while the rest have apprehensions about coming here in person,” said Dr Sharma.Thalassaemia patients are their priority, he said, followed by women in gynaecology wards, cancer patients and those in emergency (trauma or urgent surgical intervention). Doctors are also worried about Covid patients, who may need blood in case their condition worsens.There are 350 people who are registered with the Thalassaemic Charitable Trust, PGIMER, and they are supplied with 20-25 blood units daily. After that comes the gynaecology department (15-20 units), followed by cancer patients and trauma.Rajinder Kalra, president of the trust, said: “Of the 350 thalassaemia patients here, 18 undergo blood transfusion daily here. We are managing with help from PGI’s blood bank and volunteers.” Advocate Ajay Gupta, who is running an NGO is a volunteer supporting PGIMER’s blood bank. “I have a data of 10,000 blood donors from tricity and we approach them daily via social media, encouraging them to donate blood. They are afraid but we win their confidence,” he said. Thrice every week, he manages to arrange for 12 donors to visit the PGIMER.Thankful of such volunteers, Dr Sharma said: “We are grateful to those who come forward and donate. I assure them that the blood collection area is completely safe.”Screening is done meticulously and once given the go ahead, a fully sanitised van with a seating capacity of 50 is sent to pick 15 blood donors, he said. “Around 40 people donate blood every day, 30 of who are voluntary donors, PGI staff and patient’s attendants and enable us to meet daily requirements,” said the doctor.Earlier, against the demand of 300 units (blood and blood components), 500 units were collected by PGIMER, but currently, demand has reduced to about 80 units, while the collection has come down to 100-150 units.“Many thalassaemia patients bring a donor with them, like the 17-year-old did on Thursday. On the coming Monday, one patient is coming from Poonch for two units of blood and we will ensure he gets it,” said Kalra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/for-pgi-another-herculean-task-soliciting-blood-donors/story-mgN4gAoqrNNfbyBbn8vpvL.html
12-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh colonies, villages don’t care two hoots about curfew||Seventeen days after the UT administration imposed a lockdown to contain the spread of novel coronavirus disease, the police have still not been able to implement the curfew in the city’s peripheral areas. Slums and villages that dot the outskirts of Chandigarh seem oblivious to the dangers posed by the disease. Even norms mandated by the administration have gone for a toss as people stroll around in groups without a care. When this correspondent visited several slums and colonies in Chandigarh on Thursday, she found people huddled in groups outside their houses and crowds gathering for the meals being distributed by Chandigarh administration.Giving two hoots about social distancing, people had opened ration shops customers were buying goods as on any other day. Several vehicles moved through the narrow streets despite the ban on vehicular movement in the UT. Children could be seen loitering the streets as the elderly lounged in the sunlight or had gathered to play cards.Not once did this correspondent find the policemen deployed on the spot, stopping commuters to check curfew passes in the villages and in sectors such as 38 and 15.A police constable who had been deployed in a peripheral area of Chandigarh said he was totally unaware of the ground plan of the locality he was assigned to. “It is a huge challenge as many of us don’t even know the streets of the colony we are to keep a check on. We are few in number while the population is huge. We need more manpower for strict implementation of the curfew.”30-year-old Ravi in Kacchi Colony, Dhanas, was sitting outside his home, soaking in the sunlight. When asked if he knew he must stay inside the house, he said, “What can we do, we are bored sitting at home all day. Our houses are already overcrowded. I just came out to soak in the sun.”Dalip Sharma, a councillor from Bapu Dham Colony, said, “Many policemen are deployed here but the population is huge. Here, each house is about 22 x 10 sq feet and has 6-8 members each. Before the lockdown, people used to go for work. But now, without work they are roaming about aimlessly.”When this correspondent spoke to a PR officer with the UT police, he refused to acknowledge there was any breach of the curfew. “The whole of Chandigarh is following lockdown norms. People are stepping out to buy only essential goods that too, during the time specified by UT administration, in colonies as well as in sectors,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-colonies-villages-don-t-care-two-hoots-about-curfew/story-cboLaKLe7f88hDYu40GXfP.html
12-04-2020||World||US health experts stress need for widespread coronavirus testing||The United States needs to ramp up testing for the coronavirus as the White House considers when and how to lift stay-at-home restrictions and lockdowns triggered by the pandemic, U.S. health experts said on Sunday.More than 2 million tests have been done in the country so far, but the tests are not available to many who need them, said Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.“We need to do more, no question about that,” Hahn said on ABC’s “This Week.”The lack of adequate testing has hampered the U.S. response to the pandemic, which has killed more than 21,300 people in the country and infected more than half a million.President Donald Trump last week played down the importance of testing, saying, “It’s not necessary but it would be a good thing to have.”Top experts on the White House coronavirus task force have made it clear testing is important, however, particularly as the country takes its first steps toward reopening, a move the Republican president has said he wants to make as soon as possible.The governors of New York and New Jersey, as well as the mayor of hard-hit New York City, pleaded for more test kits and testing capability on Sunday.“Further ramping up testing, both diagnostic as well as the antibody tests, will really be necessary as we move beyond May and into the summer months and then into the fall,” Hahn said.Diagnostic testing determines if somebody is infected with the virus and antibody testing shows who has been infected and is therefore immune. Both will be important in getting people back into the workplace and containing the virus as that happens, the experts said.“When one starts to relax some of those restrictions, we know that there will be people who will be getting infected. I mean, that is just reality,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”“The critical issue is to be able to, in real time, identify, isolate and contact trace. That’s called containment.”The FDA is working with developers around the country to try to ramp up diagnostic testing, Hahn said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “So all hands on deck to try to get more diagnostic tests in.”The FDA has approved one antibody test and Hahn warned that some other tests on the market may not be accurate.Governor Phil Murphy said New Jersey has been able to test only symptomatic patients and needs more testing to stay ahead of the virus.He told CBS “Face the Nation” he had been in intense discussions over the weekend with leaders in neighboring states “on the whole question of testing, contact tracing, what are the rules of the road going to be for things like bars and restaurants to make sure we don’t have unintended consequences on one side of the river versus the other.”His New York counterpart, Andrew Cuomo, said on Sunday they needed more tests, more federal help and a public health strategy that is consistent with an economic strategy.“The last thing we want to see is an uptick in the infection rate,” Cuomo told reporters.New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio said he was pleading with the White House and FEMA for more testing to go beyond prioritized hospitalized patients, healthcare workers and first responders.De Blasio told reporters he wanted a “Phase Two” test plan to focus on communities of color, low-income communities and immigrants and said he needed 110,000 individual testing kits this week.To reopen safely, U.S. communities must be able to verify whether anyone who has symptoms has contracted the disease, said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University.“Right now, we can’t do that in most places in the country, there’s just not enough capacity. We need to be able to have the capacity,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-experts-stress-need-for-widespread-coronavirus-testing/story-qwKD0qId1oxtR1sA74vM0J.html
12-04-2020||World||Italy coronavirus deaths rise by 431, fewest in more than three weeks||Italy reported 431 new coronavirus deaths in the past day, the fewest in more than three weeks, as declining numbers of intensive care patients pointed to a lessening severity of the country’s outbreak.The daily count is the lowest since March 19, when Italy registered 427 dead.Italy’s new deaths linked to the virus in the last 24 hours compared with 619 the day before. That brings the total number of fatalities to 19,899. Italy has had more deaths than any other country in Europe. It was surpassed globally by the United States yesterday.Italy reported 4,092 new cases of the disease, compared with 4,694 a day earlier, civil protection officials said.The thousands of new cases come as testing surges. The approximately 200,000 tests performed in the past four days comprise a fifth of the the roughly 1 million total in Italy during the outbreak, according to civil protection figures compiled by Bloomberg.Confirmed cases in the country now total 156,363.In another sign of improvement, the number of patients in intensive care declined for an ninth straight day after having risen steadily through April 3 to a peak of 4,068.“The worst of the first big wave of the epidemic is exhausting itself,” Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at Milan’s Sacco hospital, said in an interview today with Sky TG24 television. “Things are going better because fewer people need an intensive care bed.”The improvement was the result of the strict measures that have largely shut down public activity in Italy for more than a month, Galli said.On Friday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced he was extending Italy’s nationwide lockdown until May 3, rejecting pressure from businesses and opposition politicians who’ve clamored to restart the economy. His decision reflected moves across Europe, where many health officials and politicians, hoping to stem a second wave of the pandemic, are warning against letting up on restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-coronavirus-deaths-rise-by-431-fewest-in-more-than-three-weeks/story-0XbRXojpDAHky6kf6D6PGJ.html
12-04-2020||World||Covid-19 US toll grows, as do media accounts of Donald Trump’s missteps||As the United States went from one coronavirus death on February 29 to more than 20,600 Sunday, media accounts are growing of the Trump administration’s response beset by unheeded warnings, delays and the president’s own reluctance to acknowledge the seriousness of the crisis.The New York Times added to the growing litany of these accounts Saturday reporting that President Donald Trump and his administered squandered precious time over January, February and up until mid-March when mitigation efforts went into full force. He had focussed on other things, it said, in a long report, despite the fact that “an array of figures inside his government — from top White House advisers to experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies — identified the threat, sounded alarms and made clear the need for aggressive action.”.Associated Press reported Sunday a similar state of paralysis in the administration as it failed to stockpile medical supplies, impose travel restrictions in time and as the president seemed consumed by the impeachment trial and the White House was low to act, riven by infighting and turnover of personnel.The Washington Post nailed the dysfunction in the administration way back on April 4, and reported that because of the missed warnings, in echoes of the failures leading up to the 9/11 attacks, the United States “ will likely go down as the country that was supposedly best prepared to fight a pandemic but ended up catastrophically overmatched by the novel coronavirus, sustaining heavier casualties than any other nation”.The United States on Monday had the highest number of fatalities at 20,646, with 1,920 reported in the last 24 hours; and the most confirmed cases with 530,000. It now accounts for a fifth of the global toll of 110, 052 and nearly a third of all the confirmed cases, 1.7 million.New York state remained the worst hit with 1818,825 confirmed cases and 8,650 death, up by 758. The toll in New York City, the epicenter of the American outbreak, went up to 6,367. Federal and state officials have, however, pointed to a drop in hospitalization and “flattening” of other metrics to express optimism the situation may be improving. New York city mayor Bill de Blasio announced the schools and educational institutions will remain closed for the remainder of the academic year and will reopen in September. But Governor Andrew Cuomo has other ideas and told reporters there was a need for a state-wide decision on the issue.New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Louisiana were among the other states with high incidence of infections of fatalities.As a reflection of the magnitude of the crisis confronting the country, Wyoming on Saturday became the last state to go under disaster declaration, a federal measure that paves the way for enhanced federal help. All 50 states are under these disaster provisions now, for the first time in US history.Essential medical supplies such as masks, gowns and ventilators remain an issue, despite ramped up production at home and purchases abroad. The defense department is jumping in with $133 million to manufacture 40 million N-95 masks over the next three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-toll-grows-as-do-media-accounts-of-donald-trump-s-missteps/story-eMAt5BiljIkTfvErUX5KGI.html

The toll was 510 on Saturday, the lowest since March 23.But the number of new infections continued its slow, rising by 4,167 to 166,019, a smaller increase than was recorded on Saturday.Although health chiefs say the pandemic has peaked, they have urged the population to strictly follow a national lockdown which was put in place on March 14 in order to reduce the spread of the virus. “We are still far from victory, from the moment when he will recover normality in our lives,” Sanchez said during a televised address.“We are all keen to go back out on the streets... but out desire is even greater to win the war and prevent a relapse,” he added.His comments come as Spain braced for the reopening of some sectors of its economy, with some factory and construction workers set to return to work on Monday.The government on March 30 tightened the lockdown by halting all non-essential activities for two weeks but this measure is now about to be lifted, drawing criticism from some regional leaders and unions.Police will hand out face masks at metro and train stations on Monday as some companies re-open after this so-called “economic hibernation” period.‘Gradual’ left of restrictions The rest of the lockdown restrictions in the nation of around 47 million people will remain in place until April 25 although the government has made clear it expects to announce another two-week extension.They prevent people from going outside except to go to work if they can not do so from home, buy food, seek medical care and briefly walk their dog.Sanchez warned on Sunday that Spain had not entered the “second phase” in the fight against the coronavirus of a “de-escalation” of lockdown measures “which will start at the earliest in two weeks and will be very gradual and very prudent”.“Health will always be the priority,” he added.Earlier on Sunday Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto warned that rules on social distancing will remain in place this summer “even on the beach”.“Until there is a vaccine nothing will be the way it was before,” she added in an interview published in daily newspaper El Pais.Spain is the world’s second-most visited country after France and tourism is crucial for the domestic economy, making up nearly 12 percent of gross domestic product.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-far-from-victory-in-coronavirus-fight-says-pm-pedro-sanchez/story-AJRnEpUQiLWqlAfiGTAyLK.html
12-04-2020||World||PM Boris discharged from hospital, a week after being admitted for Covid-19||Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on Sunday moved from St Thomas’ hospital to the country house of Chequers in Buckinghamshire to rest and recuperate from coronavirus, as a senior government advisor admitted the UK could have the worst death rate in Europe.With Saturday figures putting the death toll at 9,875, the weekend is set to see the figure cross 10,000. The government’s medical advisors believe that if the eventual figure is below 20,000, “it will have done well”.In his first statement after emerging from ICU, Johnson thanked doctors: “I can’t thank them enough. I owe them my life.”A Downing Street spokesman later said: “The PM has been discharged from hospital to continue his recovery, at Chequers. On the advice of his medical team, the PM will not be immediately returning to work”. “He wishes to thank everybody at St Thomas’ for the brilliant care he has received. All of his thoughts are with those affected by this illness.”The UK parliament is due to reopen virtually on April 21. Queen Elizabeth continued an optimistic note to the country in a rare Easter message: “Coronavirus will not overcome us…We need Easter as much as ever…As dark as death can be - particularly for those suffering with grief - light and life are greater”.Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies said on Sunday that the UK is likely to see the worst death rate in Europe.He told BBC: “The numbers in the UK have continued to go up. I do hope we’re coming close to the number of new infections reducing … and the number of deaths plateauing and starting to come down”.“And yes, the UK is likely to be certainly one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe”.Farrar added that a second or third wave of the virus “was probably inevitable” and treatment and a vaccine was “our only true exit strategy”. A vaccine could be available by autumn but it would take longer to ramp up manufacturing to the scale required to vaccinate many millions.“I would hope we would get (that) done in 12 months but that is in itself an unprecedented ambition,” he said.As medical professionals continued to complain of lack of personal protection equipment while treating patients, new details of those contracting and dying from the virus include pharmacist Pooja Sharma, who worked at the Eastbourne General Hospital in east Sussex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-boris-discharged-uk-may-have-europe-s-worst-death-rate/story-OghXOTrD8PgdCabUUJLK9J.html

Nirav Modi, who is wanted in India to face charges of major financial offences, is due to appear by videolink from the Wandsworth prison for another remand extension hearing on April 15.Assange’s partner, Stella Moris, 37, revealed in the Mail on Sunday that Assange had watched the births of both children in London hospitals via live videolink, adding that both boys had visited him in prison, and that they were planning to marry, whether Assange is released or not.There were genuine fears of Assange’s health, the South Africa-born lawyer said. His next extradition hearing is due in the Westminster Magistrates Court on May 18.The Observer reported that as part of the bail application, Moris revealed in that they began a relationship when she interacted with him on extradition’s legal issues in 2011: “Over time Julian and I developed a strong intellectual and emotional bond. He became my best friend and I became his,” she wrote.Moris said she had gone to great lengths to protect the couple’s children, adding that she was making the statement now because their lives were “on the brink” and she feared Assange could die. According to her, Assange is in isolation for 23 hours a day and all visits have stopped.“My close relationship with Julian has been the opposite of how he is viewed – of reserve, respect for each other and attempts to shield each other from some of the nightmares that have surrounded our lives together,” Moris said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/julian-assange-seeks-bail-fearing-coronavirus-in-jail/story-01TPbIQBuUIAq1v1AdAgWK.html

People in the city of 7.4 million have made a point of wearing masks in the past months.“We always stay at home and it is quite boring,” said Banny Mak, 24, a local resident.“We are social animal(s), we need to go out for some fun. I think with proper protection (for) ourselves and to protect other people. I think it is already ok to go out.”Hong Kong has recorded 1,005 cases of COVID-19, which has killed four people in the city.It banned public gatherings of more than four people for 14 days from March 29, after recording the biggest daily increase in new COVID-19 infections, and later extended that restriction until April 23.Police have been visible in some of the popular sites, although there were no signs or reports of arrests in a city where pro-democracy activists who clashed with security forces regularly last year have paused their demonstrations.While Hong Kong, along with Singapore and Taiwan, have been held up as examples in their efforts to curb the coronavirus, the widespread flouting of social distancing rules over the weekend threatens to derail the city’s efforts so far.“I was a little bit scared when I was on the MTR (metro)... there were so many people,” said resident Irene Chong, 24. “I (am) concerned, but I wear mask and bring alcohol (disinfectant) and stuff.”In a Facebook post on Saturday, the Chinese-ruled city’s leader Carrie Lam urged citizens to comply with social distancing orders in restaurants and said the government would ramp up checks.“But the most important thing is that customers oblige by the rules. I hope everybody will feel at ease when eating, and go home early,” she wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-social-animals-hong-kong-residents-flout-coronavirus-rules-to-throng-popular-sites/story-GPW3BsdA44OkOk9zt16tOM.html
12-04-2020||World||Sri Lanka Catholic church ‘forgives’ 2019 Easter suicide bombers||Sri Lanka’s Roman Catholic Church said Sunday it had forgiven the suicide bombers behind the attacks that killed at least 279 people last Easter.Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith told an Easter mass -- broadcast from a TV studio because of the coronavirus pandemic -- that “we offered love to the enemies who tried to destroy us”.“We forgave them,” he said, adding that instead of retaliating, the nation’s Catholic minority had contemplated Jesus’ message of hope, and reduced tensions.The April 21 Easter Sunday bombers targeted three churches and three luxury hotels, killing at least 279 people and wounding 593.Last year Ranjith called for the government at-the-time to step down over its alleged failure to investigate an “international conspiracy” behind the attacks.That government, of president Maithripala Sirisena, lost November’s elections, with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s younger brother Gotabaya taking the reins.Officials charged with murder Sirisena initially blamed Islamic extremists for the bombings, but later accused international drug dealers of being behind the attacks -- supposedly to destabilise his anti-narcotics drive.The country’s then-police chief and secretary to the ministry of defence have been charged with murder for allegedly not acting on intelligence about the attacks.Police have arrested 135 people in connection with the bombings, blamed on the National Thowheeth Jama’ath extremist group.They have yet to be charged.This year’s Easter celebrations have been muted amid a nationwide indefinite curfew imposed to contain the novel coronavirus.Some 199 people have been infected, with seven deaths, the government said.Closed-door Easter services were conducted at two of the churches targetted -- St Anthony’s and St Sebastian’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-catholic-church-forgives-2019-easter-suicide-bombers/story-YW99ScISu4qcQtuu2mxcVI.html
12-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: Russian flight had half of Covid-19 infections found in China on Saturday||More than half of the coronavirus infections reported by China on Sunday stemmed from a Russian flight to Shanghai the day before, underscoring the possible severity of the outbreak in Russia.Shanghai’s Municipal Health Commission said 51 of 52 imported cases on Saturday were of Chinese nationals who were diagnosed to have Covid-19 after they landed in the city. The travellers accounted for more than half of 97 imported infections China disclosed on Sunday morning. No other information was provided about the flight.Russia has emerged as a fresh source of imported virus infections for China, which seems to have tamed its own outbreak and has now pivoted toward staving off cases from elsewhere. China has grounded all but one inbound flight per week for foreign airlines in a bid to limit imported cases, but new infections have also found their way back to the country through land borders, especially the one with Russia.China’s northeastern Heilongjiang province has reported more than 100 imported infections from Russia at its land borders so far this month. Russia is tightening a lockdown of its capital amid a worsening spread of the virus that is straining local health systems.Russia on Sunday reported the number of new coronavirus cases in the country increased by 31% overnight to 2,186. That took the total to 15,770. Twenty-four deaths related to Covid-19 were reported, double the count in the previous period and bringing the nation’s total to 130.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-russian-flight-had-half-of-covid-19-infections-found-in-china-on-saturday/story-kRS2ACz8Wp8DnCHqbj6tuO.html

The outbreak has killed more than 2,200 people since August 2018 in an area of the country where militia violence hobbled efforts to contain it.The latest victim was an 11-month-old girl, who was treated at the same health centre as the previous case, a 26-year-old electrician, said Boubacar Diallo, deputy incident manager for the WHO’s Ebola response.It is not yet clear how the electrician contracted Ebola. He had no known contacts with other Ebola patients and was not a survivor of the virus who could have relapsed, the government said on Friday.Flare-ups or one-off transmissions are common towards the end of Ebola outbreaks, and a new case does not necessarily mean that the virus will spread out of control again.The WHO has identified 215 people who came into contact with the electrician, including 53 health workers at three facilities the man visited before he died, Diallo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congo-records-second-ebola-death-in-days-who/story-kOOx0feC0h0CYw7xJ66h8L.html

12-04-2020||World||Taliban set to release first prisoners in fragile Afghan exchange||The Taliban said it would on Sunday release the first prisoners in a delayed exchange deal with the Afghan government -- a potential breakthrough after the insurgents walked out of talks with Kabul last week.The announcement comes as fears rose that an avenue for fragile peace talks between the two sides was being undercut by mounting disagreements over the prisoner swap, considered key to paving the way for negotiations.“Today, 20 prisoners of the Kabul administration will be released,” Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said on Twitter, adding that the group would be handed over to representatives of the Red Cross in the southern city of Kandahar.The Afghan government has pressed ahead with freeing hundreds of Taliban prisoners over the past week, despite complaints from the insurgent group about the piecemeal nature of the releases.Washington signed a landmark deal with the Taliban in February that promised the withdrawal of US and foreign troops from Afghanistan by next summer, provided the militants start talks with Kabul and adhere to other guarantees.The deal requires the Afghan government -- which was not a signatory to the accord -- to free up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners, and for the militants to release 1,000 pro-government captives in return.The exchange was supposed to have happened by March 10, allowing peace talks to begin, but has been beset with problems.Kabul has claimed the Taliban want 15 of their “top commanders” to be released, while the insurgents have accused Afghan authorities of needlessly wasting time.A small Taliban team met with the government to discuss a comprehensive prisoner swap last week, but walked out of the talks soon after officials offered a gradual release of the prisoners.Sunday’s announcement came after the head of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan met with insurgent leaders to discuss a reduction in violence in the war-weary country. The Taliban cautioned that their decision to release a group of prisoners did not mean that the talks with Kabul were being restarted. “No the process is not back on, but this is a good will step by the [the Taliban] to accelerate the prisoners exchange process,” insurgent spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP.Javid Faisal, the spokesman for the Afghan National Security Council, chided the insurgents for not starting the process earlier, saying a reduction in violence and subsequent ceasefire between the two sides was needed. “They should also prepare for a face-to-face meeting with the Islamic republic of Afghanistan,” said Faisal. The insurgents have also stepped up their attacks on Afghan security forces in government-controlled areas across the country and accused US forces of aiding the Afghan government with air support, causing civilian casualties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-set-to-release-first-prisoners-in-fragile-afghan-exchange/story-skn3BO8YmnlFyCnO4swLBN.html

Ri Son Gwon, who was named the North’s top diplomat in January, was also elected as an alternate member of the Political Bureau alongside Kim’s sister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-sister-rises-in-north-korea-hierarchy-reinstated-in-key-decision-making-body/story-EFd69LFjsBGGMPJuU5pE2O.html

12-04-2020||World||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fathered two kids with lawyer in Ecuador embassy: Report||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fathered two children with one of his lawyers while holed up in Ecuador’s embassy in London for much of the past decade, a report on Sunday said. The 48-year-old Australian is allegedly the dad of two boys -- aged two and one -- born to South African-born lawyer Stella Morris, the Mail on Sunday reported. The newspaper published the report alongside photographs of Assange with the toddlers and an interview with Morris who said they “fell in love” and were planning to marry. The couple have been engaged since 2017, according to the paper, which said it learned about the revelations in court papers seen last week. Assange is being held in London’s high security Belmarsh prison as he fights an extradition request by the United States to stand trial there on espionage charges. The Mail on Sunday said Morris chose to reveal their relationship and the existence of their sons because “she fears Assange’s life is at serious risk if he remains in Belmarsh”, due to the spread of coronavirus. Morris wants the one-time hacker released under British government plans to allow some prisoners temporary release, amid fears Covid-19 could sweep through jails. But Assange last month failed in a bail bid based on his risk of catching the virus, with a British judge saying there were “no grounds” for his release. Assange’s lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.WikiLeaks responded to the report on Twitter. “Julian Assange’s newly revealed partner, mother of their 2 young children, urges UK government to bail him and other vulnerable prisoners as #coronavirus sweeps prisons,” it said. The whistleblowing organisation posted its own video interview with Morris soon after, in which she detailed her purported five-year relationship with Assange. Assange faces charges under the US Espionage Act for the 2010 release of a trove of secret files detailing aspects of US military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. He ensconced himself in the Ecuadoran embassy in 2012 after skipping bail to avoid separate legal proceedings in Sweden, but was finally dragged out last year. He reportedly conceived the first child with Morris in 2016, according to the Mail on Sunday. The couple had begun a relationship the previous year while the lawyer visited him to work on his legal situation, it said. Assange watched the birth of both children in London hospitals via live video-link and met the elder boy, named Gabriel, after he was smuggled into the embassy, the paper added. Both boys are said to be British citizens and have reportedly visited their father in prison. Morris told the Mail on Sunday: “I love Julian deeply and I am looking forward to marrying him. “Julian has been fiercely protective of me and has done his best to shield me from the nightmares of his life.” She said she had lived “quietly and privately”, raising Gabriel and his brother Max, while “longing for the day we could be together as a family”. Morris added: “Now I have to speak out because I can see that his life is on the brink.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-fathered-two-kids-with-lawyer-in-ecuador-embassy-report/story-gPyAXlqP19joDcnEVhOsVP.html
12-04-2020||World||North Korea’s Kim Jong Un calls for stronger Covid-19 measures, avoids wearing mask||North Korea called for stronger measures against the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic at a meeting presided by leader Kim Jong Un, state media reported Sunday, without acknowledging whether the country had reported any infections.The already isolated, nuclear-armed North quickly shut down its borders after the virus was first detected in neighbouring China in January, and imposed strict containment measures.Officials in Pyongyang and its state media have repeatedly insisted that the North remains totally free of the virus, but Sunday’s report did not make that assertion.The coronavirus epidemic -- which has infected more than 1.7 million worldwide -- had become “a great disaster threatening the whole mankind, regardless of borders and continents”, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.“Such environment can become a condition creating some obstacles to our struggle and progress,” it said, adding Pyongyang maintained “very stable anti-epidemic situation”.The meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea on Saturday discussed changing policy tasks in the wake of the epidemic, KCNA reported, as officials called for strict and thorough check of the infiltration of the virus.A joint resolution was adopted “on more thoroughly taking national measures for protecting the life and safety of our people to cope with the worldwide epidemic disease”, it added.Photos carried by the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed none of the officials -- including Kim -- wearing masks and sitting close to each other side by side around a round table.Experts have said North Korea is particularly vulnerable to the virus because of its weak healthcare system, and defectors have accused Pyongyang of covering up an outbreak.As part of its anti-virus efforts North Korea put thousands of its own people and hundreds of foreigners -- including diplomats -- into isolation and mounted disinfection drives.The World Health Organization said 709 people -- 11 foreigners and 698 nationals -- have been tested for the virus as of April 2, while more than 24,800 people have been released from quarantine.Nearly every other country has reported coronavirus cases. Aside from China, South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the virus.Recorded cases of infection across 193 countries now exceed one 1.7 million, including more than 108,000 deaths, according to an AFP tally Sunday based on official country data and WHO figures.sh/je||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-calls-for-stronger-covid-19-measures-avoids-wearing-mask/story-eYZfixQwoOPPDXwNehSwdP.html

Watch| Pope Francis celebrates Easter vigil in empty church, delivers a ‘message of hope’ “The virus will decide” when the country can begin to reopen from state-at-home orders imposed in recent weeks across 42 states, he added.Those measures have taken a staggering toll on American commerce, with some economists forecasting job losses of up to 20 million by month’s end, raising questions about how long business closures and travel restrictions can be sustained.The Trump administration renewed talk of quickly reopening the economy after an influential university research model this week lowered its U.S. mortality forecasts to 60,000 deaths by Aug. 4, from at least 100,000, assuming that social-distancing measures remain in place. The New York Times cited separate forecasts from the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services projecting the death toll could reach 200,000 if stay-at-home orders are lifted after 30 days.The United States by far accounts for most of the world’s confirmed cases of Covid-19, the highly contagious lung ailment caused by the novel coronavirus, with at least 500,000 known infections and more than 18,600 deaths. Only Italy has recorded more fatalities.Prisons and jails, along with nursing homes and other institutions with large populations confined in close quarters, have proven especially vulnerable to outbreaks, with hundreds of infections and several deaths reported among inmates in Illinois, New York and Louisiana. On Friday, officials said 68 residents and two staff members at a San Francisco homeless shelter had tested positive, marking one of the largest known clusters of coronavirus infections yet in such a facility anywhere in the country.The outbreak there seemed at odds with promising data presented by California Governor Gavin Newsom showing that social distancing has worked so far to flatten the arc of infections in his state.New York state, the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic with some 7,800 deaths to date, likewise has seen glimmers of hope this week.After three days of record daily deaths, New York state’s Covid-19 toll from April 9 stood at 777, down from 799 deaths a day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo reported on Friday. But New York’s ICU admissions declined “for the first time since we started this journey,” he said.In Michigan, more than 200 people died from Covid-19 in the last day. “We are not out of the woods yet,” Governor Gretchen Whitmer said.GOOD FRIDAY AT A DISTANCEAt his daily White House briefing, President Donald Trump said he was receiving fewer calls from governors urgently seeking equipment and help.Meanwhile, with more than 90% of the country under stay-at-home orders, the holiest weekend on the Christian calendar began with services livestreamed or broadcast to congregants watching from home. Many churches sat empty on Good Friday, when they would typically be overflowing with worshipers.“We gather normally at Easter to worship. We gather for children’s Easter egg hunts, for family meals, with friends. We can’t do any of that this year,” said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy lamented to reporters.“I’m really missing the community aspect of being with everyone,” said Rebecca Swindle, a 26-year-old mother of two in central Florida whose church began holding virtual services five weeks ago to help curb coronavirus transmission. Swindle said she planned to watch a livestream of Good Friday evening prayers - normally “a huge gathering of worshiping God” - and to promote her church’s online Easter service on her Facebook profile.One megachurch in South Carolina turned to the model of once-popular drive-in movies, presenting services filmed live and shown on a big screen with the audio broadcast over the radio to worshipers in their cars. A handful of holdout U.S. churches planned to go ahead with in-person Easter Sunday services, saying their rights to worship outweighed public health warnings.“Satan and a virus will not stop us,” said the Reverend Tony Spell, pastor of the evangelical Life Tabernacle Church near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He expects more than 2,000 to gather at his megachurch on Sunday.FOOD DRIVE DRAWS THOUSANDSFriday also ended another week of missed paychecks for millions of Americans, with restaurants, businesses, entertainment venues and schools shuttered across the nation.In Los Angeles, some 5,000 families waited at the Forum arena to pick up food in a Good Friday donation drive.“This is slated to be our biggest distribution to date,” said Michael Flood, head of the LA Regional Food Bank. “It’s continuing to demonstrate just how many families and individuals the current economic conditions have hit.”At the other end of the food supply chain, a beef production plant in Greeley, Colorado, owned by meatpacking company JBS USA said it would spend more than $1 million for coronavirus testing kits to screen its workers after 36 employees became infected.Two employees have died of Covid-19, according to the union representing workers at the plant. The company said it was shutting down over the holiday weekend to “further enhance previously announced deep cleaning efforts at the facility.” New York plans to open coronavirus testing sites in five minority neighborhoods to improve testing in a population that has been hit disproportionately hard. Several U.S. states have reported Covid-19 deaths among blacks and Hispanics far higher than their portion of the population.African Americans comprise 70% of Louisiana’s coronavirus deaths but only a third of its population, said Governor John Bel Edwards, whose state has reported 755 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/empty-churches-food-drive-mark-start-of-easter-weekend-in-coronavirus-hit-us/story-sJ0eK2liD0YXDfO2C8bz8M.html

The number of cases was up to 529,740.Crates of Hydroxychloroquine covered in blue protective wrapping were offloaded from a cargo flight from India at the Newark international airport in New Jersey which is also among the hardest-hit states in the country. Ordered by the United States in March, the drugs were possibly headed for the federal stockpile from which they will be distributed. Supporting our partners in the fight against #Covid19. Consignment of hydroxichloroquine from India arrived at Newark airport today. pic.twitter.com/XZ6utQ6JHr“Supporting our partners in the fight against #Covid19. Consignment of hydroxychloroquine from India arrived at Newark airport today,” Taranjit Sandhu, Indian ambassador to the United States wrote in a tweet with a picture of the packages being carted away at the airport.India lifted restrictions on the export of Hydroxychloroquine and a bunch of other drugs earlier in the week at the request of President Trump in a phone call last Saturday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Thanking India for the “HCQ decision”, he has since said it “will not be forgotten”.The American president has been advocating the use of Hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus disease despite no evidence that it works. He has argued that it has been used to treat malaria for decades and is proven to be safe and patients have nothing to lose by trying it. Medical experts have warned, however, of side-effects that can be fatal.The Food and Drug Administration, the US drug regulator, first allowed it to be prescribed by physicians to severely ill patients under “compassionate use” guidance and then sanctioned a large-scale trial among the ailing in New York, the epicentre of the American outbreak.India is one of the world’s largest producers of Hydroxychloroquine but it had ordered an export ban on it and two dozen other medicines to shore up its own reserves in the wake of the epidemic. Those restrictions were removed earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-antimalarial-drug-cleared-at-trump-s-request-arrives-from-india-as-us-toll-overtakes-italy-s/story-0lYk1dNESRtJ8LbvRTt0TP.html

But, it could not deter Pakistani citizens from travelling to the coronavirus-hit Iran in large numbers for pilgrimage.Senge also said that Pakistan’s failure to impose a nationwide lockdown will result in a surge of coronavirus cases. He praised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for swift action by imposing a countrywide lockdown.Senge said: “As one of the most accomplished Indian politicians, PM Modi holds immense respect and leverage among the country’s people. This will help him take decisive actions to control the China Virus. But more important than this is cooperation from the governments of all States and Union Territories.”He added: “Pakistan, which is one of the worst-hit countries among SAARC members, should follow PM Modi and lockdown the country to minimize fatalities. PM Imran Khan’s failed policies are turning occupied Gilgit Baltistan into an epicentre of China Virus.”In Pakistan, the Covid-19 cases have sharply increased to 4,788 and the toll has reached 71, officials said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-in-gilgit-surge-as-pak-sends-iran-returned-pilgrims-to-the-region-says-activist/story-QDarUmYuttwp55ZGlrexdL.html
12-04-2020||World||Amid Covid-19 lockdown, European nations see drop in electricity consumption||An independent European think-tank called Bruegel has come up with research that shows the pattern of electricity consumption in selected countries in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown. As the Covid-19 pandemic has shut schools, schools and offices across the globe, electricity consumption by nations has witnessed a slump. With people working from home and no one really leaving the house under lockdown situations, people might think this would be bumping up their electricity cost, but keeping the bigger picture in mind, the lockdown has significantly slashed energy consumption at the macrocosmic level.The economic think tank, in its study, analysed electricity consumption in some European nations with the corresponding day (April 10) last year. It was found that Italy, which has been most badly hit by coronavirus among all European nations, witnessed as much as 27% less electricity consumption as compared to the same day in 2019. The study also factored in other European nations like Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, among others.As per the analysis, Spain had consumed 21% less electricity on April 10 this year as compared to the same day in 2019. France saw 16% less electricity this year on April 10 as compared to 2019 while the UK saw a reduction of 14%.The analysis painted a peculiar picture for Germany which saw just 8% reduction in its electricity consumption this April 10 as opposed to the same day last year. More than a million people have been infected by the deadly contagion while over 80,000 have lost their lives to Covid-19 worldwide. The US death toll from coronavirus eclipsed Italy’s for the highest in the world on Saturday, surpassing 20,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-lockdown-european-nations-see-sharp-decline-in-electricity-consumption/story-oLIPAbFwIOk8DPc3iDqPzM.html
12-04-2020||World||US Covid-19 death toll highest in world, crosses 20,000 to overtake Italy’s||The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus eclipsed Italy’s for the highest in the world Saturday, surpassing 20,000, as Chicago and other cities across the Midwest braced for a potential surge in victims and moved to snuff out smoldering hot spots of contagion before they erupt.With the New York area still deep in crisis, fear mounted over the spread of the scourge into the nation’s heartland.Twenty-four residents of an Indiana nursing home hit by COVID-19 have died, while a nursing home in Iowa saw 14 deaths. Chicago’s Cook County has set up a temporary morgue that can take more than 2,000 bodies. And Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has been going around telling groups of people to “break it up.”In Europe, countries used roadblocks, drones, helicopters, mounted patrols and the threat of fines to keep people from traveling over Easter weekend. And with infections and deaths slowing in Italy, Spain and other places on the Continent, governments took tentative steps toward loosening the weeks-long shutdowns.Glorious weather across Europe posed an extra test of people’s discipline.“Don’t do silly things,” said Domenico Arcuri, Italy’s special commissioner for the virus emergency. “Don’t go out, continue to behave responsibly as you have done until today, use your head and your sense of responsibility.”The outbreak’s center of gravity has long since shifted from China to Europe and the United States, which now has by far the largest number of confirmed cases — over a half-million — and a death toll higher than Italy’s count of nearly 19,500, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.The death rate — that is, the number of dead relative to the population — is still far higher in Italy than in U.S., which has more than five times as many people. And worldwide, the true numbers of dead and infected are believed to be much higher because of testing shortages, different counting practices and concealment by some governments.About half the deaths in the U.S. are in the New York metropolitan area, where hospitalizations are nevertheless slowing and other indicators suggest lockdowns and social distancing are “flattening the curve” of infections and staving off the doomsday scenarios of just a week or two ago.New York state on Saturday reported 783 more deaths, for a total over 8,600. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the daily number of deaths is stabilizing “but stabilizing at a horrific rate.”“What do we do now? We stay the course,” said Cuomo, who like other leaders has warned that relaxing restrictions too soon could enable the virus to come back with a vengeance.With authorities warning that the crisis in New York is far from over, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city’s 1.1 million-student school system will remain closed for the rest of the academic year. But Cuomo said the decision is up to him, and no such determination has been made.In the Midwest, pockets of contagion have alarmed state and city leaders and led to stricter enforcement.Nearly 300 inmates at the Cook County Jail have tested positive for the virus, and two have died. In Wisconsin, health officials expect to see an increase in coronavirus cases after thousands of people went to the polls during Wisconsin’s presidential primary Tuesday.Michigan’s governor extended her state’s stay-at-home order with new provisions: People with multiple homes may no longer travel between them.And in Kansas, the state Supreme Court heard arguments in a dispute Saturday between Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and Republican lawmakers who overturned her executive order banning religious services and funerals with more than 10 people.Elsewhere around the world, Italian authorities set up roadblocks around Milan to discourage people from going on Easter weekend trips. British police kept a close watch on gatherings in parks and at the seaside on one of the hottest days of the year. And France deployed some 160,000 police, including officers on horseback who patrolled beaches and parks.“It’s useless to pack your bags for a vacation,” Paris police tweeted.With religious leaders around the globe urging people to observe Easter safely at home, the archbishop of Turin, Italy, allowed a video streaming display of the Shroud of Turin, believed by the faithful to be the burial cloth of Jesus, so that they can pray in front of it during the epidemic.Pope Francis celebrated an Easter vigil Mass in an empty St. Peter’s Basilica, where the footsteps of the pontiff and his small entourage on the marble floor could be heard clearly as they walked in slow procession toward the altar. Francis likened coronavirus fears to anxiety felt by Jesus’ followers after his crucifixion.“For them, as for us, it was the darkest hour,” he said, encouraging people to “sow seeds of hope, with small gestures of care.”Meanwhile, Austria aims to reopen small shops on Tuesday. Spain, with more than 16,300 dead, plans to allow workers in some nonessential industries to return to factories and construction sites Monday. Spanish authorities said they will distribute 10 million face masks at major train and subway stations.“We think that with these measures we will prevent a jump in infections,” Health Minister Salvador Illa said.Italy continued to include all nonessential manufacturing in an extension of its national lockdown until May 3. But Premier Giuseppe Conte held out hope that some industry could re-open earlier if conditions permit.Arcuri said that the exit from the lockdown will include increased virus testing, the deployment of a voluntary contact-tracing app and mandatory blood tests as Italy seeks to set up a system of ‘’immunity passports.’’India extended its lockdown of the nation of 1.3 billion people by two more weeks. But Iran, the site of the worst outbreak in the Middle East, reopened government offices and businesses outside Tehran.In Indonesia, inmates set fire to a prison on Sulawesi island during a riot, apparently angry over restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus. There were no reports of riot-related deaths.Britain on Saturday reported 917 more deaths from the coronavirus, down from the peak of 980 recorded a day earlier. The country’s overall death toll neared 10,000. At the same time, data suggest that the number of hospital admissions in Britain is leveling off.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the first major world leader confirmed to have COVID-19, continued to recover at a London hospital, where he was able to take short walks, according to his office.Worldwide, confirmed infections rose above 1.7 million, with over 108,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. More than 400,000 people have recovered.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older people and those with health problems, it can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-death-toll-highest-in-world-crosses-20-000-to-overtake-italy-s/story-qysJETwxypWPIemr8pEFzM.html
12-04-2020||World||Pope Francis to livestream Easter mass amid Covid-19 lockdown||Pope Francis will break with centuries of tradition and livestream Easter Sunday mass to allow the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics celebrate their holiest holiday under a coronavirus lockdown.Fear and confusion in the face of a disease whose official death toll has soared past 100,000 -- but whose real one is feared to be higher still -- are reshaping society and transforming the way religion is observed.Watch| Pope Francis celebrates Easter vigil in empty church, delivers a ‘message of hope’ Even such hallowed traditions as the pope’s messages to the faithful on Saint Peter’s Square have been replaced by prayers that Francis reads into a camera from the seclusion of his private library.His only audience is the camera and the 83-year-old Argentine has admitted that the entire experience makes him feel “caged”.Life in confinement Francis cut a lonely but striking figure when he slowly entered a dark and starkly empty Vatican square in his white robe for a torch-lit Good Friday procession.It had taken place around the Roman Colosseum in the presence of at least 20,000 faithful for more than 50 years.But Rome and the rest of Italy have been living under forced confinement since early March.His Easter Sunday Mass and “Urbi et Orbi” blessing drew 70,000 to Saint Peter’s Square last year.The Vatican’s entrance is now sealed off by armed police wearing facemasks and rubber gloves.The pope has openly admitted that he was struggling along with everyone else to make sense of these extraordinary times.“We have to respond to our confinement with all our creativity,” Francis said in an interview published by several Catholic newspapers this week.“We can either get depressed and alienated ... or we can get creative.”Religious improvisation The pope’s virtual prayers are just the most vivid example of religious improvisation in the age of social distancing and confinement. The faithful have already followed his advice and found creative solutions.Thus the archbishop of Panama took to the air and blessed his tiny Central American nation from a helicopter. The faithful in Spain blasted religious music from their balconies during Holy Week.The scale of the unfolding tragedy has seen a New York City cathedral replace rows of wooden seats with hospital beds in case the surrounding emergency wards get full to overflowing.The Catholic Church in the Philippines is urging the faithful not to kiss the cross. Its Orthodox counterpart in Greece is planning to hold mass behind closed doors for its Easter on April 19.“Seven out of 10 Greeks enjoy roasting lamb for Easter,” Greek meat trader Angelos Asteriou told AFP in Paris.“That’s not happening this year.”Jews across the world did their best by using Zoom or other video conferencing apps to “seder-in-place” when the eight-day Passover holiday started on Wednesday evening.Westminster Abbey in London is following the technological trend by releasing Easter podcasts for the faithful of the Anglican Church.And priests at France’s Roman Catholic shrine in the southwestern town of Lourdes began relaying nine consecutive days of prayers on Sunday by Facebook Live and YouTube. ‘Saints next door’ The pope himself has in previous years observed Holy Thursday service marking Christ’s last supper by washing the feet of 12 inmates on the outskirts of Rome.The virus has now made this impossible.Francis instead said a prayer for the dozens of priests and health workers who have died across Italy while attending to the sick since the outbreak began in the Mediterranean country’s north in February.“They are the saints next door, the priests who gave their lives by serving,” Francis said.He invited five nurses and doctors to accompany him for the Good Friday processions in order to highlight their profession’s sacrifices over the past month.Francis himself has reportedly been tested twice for COVID-19 since coming down with a cold at the end of February.He told the Catholic newspapers that people across the world could try to spiritually escape their confinement through introspection.“So: to be in lockdown, but yearning, with that memory that yearns and begets hope,” the pope said.“This is what will help us escape our confinement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-to-livestream-easter-mass-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-YzVzI9EyHxgOIRvx0GxUWK.html
12-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Canadian Parliament passes emergency economic aid measure for workers, companies||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made his first appearance in the country’s Parliament for a sitting to pass an emergency measure to provide relief to workers and companies impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.Trudeau was in self-isolation since March 12, after his wife Sophie Gregoire was diagnosed with coronavirus infection following her return from an event in London. Trudeau returned to in-person meetings late last week and spoke during the sitting of the House of Commons in Ottawa, the country’s capital.A small number of MPs, living within easy reach of Parliament, were present in the House as it passed the legislation required to offer early wage subsidy relief by employers and employees buffeted by the economic impact of the pandemic.Only 32 MPs were present as the bill was passed, even as the Government pushes for an early arrangement wherein Canada’s parliamentary business can be conducted virtually. The session on Saturday, however, lasted for nearly six hours as MPs debated the bill tabled by the government. House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota described it as an “”exceptional day in the midst of exceptional times.”Trudeau also chose the occasion for a rousing speech with overtones of a wartime mobilisation. “Without reservation, without pause, we must fight for every inch of ground against this disease. We must be there for one another as we spare no effort to safeguard our collective future,” he said.The “frontline” in this battle, he said, was “everywhere”. “In our homes, in our hospitals and care centres, in our grocery stores and pharmacies, at our truck stops and gas stations. And the people who work in these places are our modern day heroes,” he went on to tell assembled MPs, though the message may have been directed at Canadians overall.Canada had 23,197 cases of coronavirus and 678 deaths due to the disease as of Saturday, according to news agency AFP. The Canadian economy lost more than one million jobs last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-canadian-parliament-passes-emergency-economic-aid-measure-for-workers-companies/story-U5jIczaSxYE2vaGe21KwcL.html
12-04-2020||World||France reports fall in daily coronavirus deaths, toll tops 13,800||France on Saturday reported a lower daily toll for deaths from Covid-19, declaring a “plateau” had been reached in the country’s coronavirus epidemic, albeit at a very high level.The French health authorities said in a statement that 345 more people had died in hospitals and 290 in nursing homes -- 635 over the last 24 hours -- to bring the total death toll to 13,832.The day earlier, 554 had died in hospitals and 433 in nursing homes, a total of 987.“A very high plateau for the epidemic appears to have been reached but the epidemic remains very active,” top French health official Jerome Salomon told reporters. “We must absolutely remain vigilant.” France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic, with only essential trips allowed that must be justified with a signed piece of paper.For the third consecutive day, the number of coronavirus patients in intensive care was down, with 121 fewer people in such units for a total of 6,883.France now has 90,676 confirmed cases of Covid-19 although the real number is likely far higher due to a lack of testing, the statement said.Salomon said that if the plateau trend continues it means “we have succeeded in reaching a first step together and the lockdown is showing its first effects”.But he warned: “It remains a very high plateau... there are still many hospital admissions... It is far too early -- and not reasonable -- to make predictions about the future.” French President Emmanuel Macron is due on Monday to address the nation for a third time during the crisis and is expected to announce that the lockdown will be extended beyond its current April 15 expiration date.Macron will have to steer a careful course amid the tentative signs of improvement, telling people they must still stay at home while giving indications about how the confinement may be relaxed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-reports-fall-in-daily-coronavirus-deaths-toll-tops-13-800/story-UvrRal53KglomoxnsOKLuI.html
12-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Easter gives hope in our ‘darkest hour’, despite fear, says Pope Francis||Easter offers a message of hope in people’s “darkest hour,” Pope Francis said, as he celebrated a late-night vigil Mass Saturday in St. Peter’s Basilica, with the public barred because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pontiff in his homily likened the fears of current times to those experienced by Jesus’ followers the day after his crucifixion. “They, like us, had before their eyes the drama of suffering, of an unexpected tragedy that happened all too suddenly,’‘ Francis said. “They had seen death and it weighed on their hearts. Pain was mixed with fear” about their own lives. “Then, too, there was fear about the future and all that would need to be rebuilt.” Francis added: “For them, as for us, it was the darkest hour.” Watch: Pope Francis celebrates Easter vigil in empty church, delivers a ‘message of hope’ Easter vigil Mass in the basilica is among the Vatican’s more evocative ceremonies. Celebrants enter in darkness, except for candlelight. The pontiff holds a tall Easter candle, which is lit for him. Then the basilica’s lights are turned on, in a sign of joy. But this night, when the basilica was illuminated, all its emptiness was painfully visible, and the footsteps of the pope and his small entourage on the marble floor could clearly be heard as they walked in slow procession toward the altar. Francis encouraged faithful to sow “seeds of hope, with small gestures of care, affection of prayer.” “Tonight we acquire a fundamental right that can never be taken away from us: the right to hope,’‘ Francis said. Still, he acknowledged the difficulty of obtaining optimism, saying “as the days go by and fears grow, even the boldest hope can dissipate.” Describing the Easter message as a “message of hope,’‘ Francis urged Christians to be ”messengers of life in a time of death.” During Easter vigil Mass, adults converting to Catholicism are baptized by the pope, but the pandemic containment measures forced elimination of that tradition during the ceremony. Earlier on Holy Saturday, the Turin Shroud, a burial cloth some believe covered Jesus, and which was associated with a 16th-century plague, was put on special view in a chapel in that northern city, through video streaming to inspire hope during the coronavirus outbreak. Francis hailed the initiative by the Turin archbishop, saying making it visible meets the requests of the faithful who are suffering through the COVID-19 outbreak. The linen, kept behind bulletproof glass in a Turin chapel, is shown to the public only on very special occasions. In the 16th century, Milan’s archbishop, the future St. Charles Borromeo, intensely desired to pray before the shroud while that city was ravaged by plague. The Duke of Savoy, in 1578, decided to bring the burial cloth of Christ from Chambéry, in France, to Turin, according to a Vatican account of that period. Charles made the pilgrimage to Turin on foot, praying and fasting during the journey. Skeptics say the linen bearing the figure of a crucified man is a medieval forgery. Believers regard it as one of Christianity’s most awe-inspiring reminders of Jesus’ crucifixion. The cloth belongs to the Vatican, which has allowed its scientific testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-easter-gives-hope-in-our-darkest-hour-despite-fear-says-pope-francis/story-WUQw6qeVAJ33eXOLuCmJMM.html
12-04-2020||World||Bangladesh executes ex-Army officer for assassinating founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman||Bangladesh has executed a former military captain for his involvement in the 1975 coup in which the country’s founder Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated, nearly four-and-a-half decades after the massacre.Abdul Majed was hanged at 12.01 AM (local time), Law Minister Anisul Huq told PTI.An official of the Dhaka Central Jail at Keraniganj on the outskirts of the capital said that a doctor declared Majed dead at 12.15 AM.Inspector General of Prisons Brigadier General AKM Mostafa Kamal Pasha at a media briefing in front of the jail said that the body would now be handed over to the family members for burial.“Concerned officials who were required to witness the execution under law were present,” he said, adding this was the first case of execution since the Dhaka Central Jail was relocated at the newly-built facility at Keraniganj two years ago.Jailor Mahbubul Islam later said that the officials present included Dhaka’s deputy commissioner who is the district magistrate as well, police superintendent and the civil surgeon and the deputy inspector general of prisons.A number of people gathered in front of the jail at the midnight, defying COVID-19 restrictions.He said that Mazed was executed by hanging.Majed was arrested in Dhaka on Tuesday after hiding in India for nearly two-and-a-half decades.On Friday, Majed’s wife and four other relatives met him for nearly two hours in the prison.President Abdul Hamid on Thursday rejected his mercy plea, removing the last hurdle for his hanging.A specialised police unit arrested Majed, one of the fugitive convicted Bangabandhu assassins, as he returned home after hiding for nearly two and half decades in India.Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said the “self confessed killer” was not only involved in Bangabandhu’s assassination but also took part in the subsequent killing of four national leaders in high security Dhaka Central Jail on November 3, 1975.He said previous reports indicated Majed was hiding in India but eventually he was arrested from Dhaka as he secretly returned last month.Police’s Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit arrested him in a predawn raid at Mirpur area while he was roaming around a shrine.Majed is one of the six absconding ex-army officers who were handed down capital punishment after trial in absentia.A prosecution lawyer said Majed told the court that he returned to Bangladesh on March 15 or 16.The convict, he said, claimed he managed to live secretly in Kolkata for the past 23 years.Twelve ex-military officers were sentenced to death for the August 15, 1975 killing of Father of the Nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with most of his family members. Five of them have been executed while one died of natural causes as he was on the run abroad.Bangabandhu’s elder daughter and incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and younger daughter Sheikh Rehana survived as they were on a visit to the then West Germany at the time of the putsch, which also toppled Bangladesh’s post independence government.The five convicts were hanged at Dhaka Central Jail on January 28, 2010, after a protracted legal procedure while the delayed trial process began in 1996 when an infamous indemnity law was scrapped as it was protecting the assassins from justice until then.Majed was one of the remaining fugitives believed to be hiding abroad with no confirmed whereabouts.The rest of the fugitives included the key mastermind of the coup ex-lieutenant colonel Abdur Rashid. Interpol issued red alert against the absconders believed to be hiding in several countries including Pakistan.Bangladesh confirmed two cases where two convicts took refuge in the United States and Canada, one of them is said to have shot dead Bangladesh’s founder.Dhaka said it was trying to extradite them but Canada declined to entertain the request citing provisions of the country’s laws.After the 1975 carnage, Majed was rehabilitated in civil service during the subsequent regime of former military-dictator-turned-politician Ziaur Rahman as an ex-cadre official and posted as the director of National Savings Department.He later fled the country while serving in the finance ministry along with other 1975 coup plotters as the 1996 general elections brought Awami League back to power which vowed to expose to justice Bangabandhu killers in line with its election manifesto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-executes-ex-army-officer-for-assassinating-founder-sheikh-mujibur-rahman/story-s7cfyGVrcGQC5FswWQkccM.html

The total toll touched toll topped 13,800. It reported 4,785 new infections.Italy has topped 19,000 deaths and 150,000 cases of the coronavirus. The milestones were hit Saturday, even as the country continued to see a slight decrease in numbers of people hospitalised and in intensive care.Deaths rose by 3.2% or 619, to 19,468.

12-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: US now has most Covid deaths, overtaking Italy||It was a day of tragic records for the US on Saturday, as the coronavirus pandemic continued to torment the country, forcing authorities to start digging up trenches for mass graves.With at least 19,833 deaths reported from the Covid-19 outbreak, the US has now become the most affected country in terms of fatalities - overtaking Italy, which has reported 19,468 deaths.America is already the worst-hit nation in terms of cases. It is the only country to have reported more than 500,000 infections. New York is the most affected American state, having recorded nearly 9,000 deaths and over 172,000 infections.Earlier in the day, the US also became the first country to report more than 2,000 fatalities from the coronavirus disease in a single day. By Saturday, the global death toll had gone past 106,000, while the number of cases worldwide stood at 1.73 million.Amid the deepening crisis in the country, US President Donald Trump said that he will appoint a special task force next week that will decide on when to reopen the country.Despite the rising number of cases and fatalities, US officials insist there are signs of an improvement in the situation, especially in the areas with a high incidence of cases. New York state has seen a drop in instances of hospitalisation. New Jersey and Connecticut have somewhat stabilised and although cities such as Boston and Chicago continue to report cases, the rate of increase has stabilised.But the crisis has not yet reached the peak, health officials said. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House task force for the coronavirus outbreak, said, “As encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak.” April 16 is widely believed to be the projected peak day in the US.Trump is admittedly in a hurry to reopen the country as the economy continues to take a hammering due to shutdowns . Asked if he is determined to remove the restrictions by May 1 as he had vowed earlier, he said, “I would love to open it. I’m not determined (on) anything. The facts are going to determine what I do.”‘Virus found in air up to 13 ft from patients’A study examining air samples from hospital wards with Covid-19 patients has found the virus can travel up to 13 feet, twice the distance current guidelines say people should leave between themselves in public.The preliminary results of the investigation by Chinese researchers were published on Friday in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal of the US CDC.They add to a debate on how the disease is transmitted, with the scientists cautioning that the small quantities of virus they found at this distance are not necessarily infectious. The researchers were led by a team at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-us-now-has-most-covid-deaths-overtaking-italy/story-2Wo2gbPhtoN1fGo6AXzK1H.html
12-04-2020||India||Telangana reports 2 more deaths, 28 new Covid-19 cases; state count at 531||With Telangana reporting two more deaths and 28 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao called upon people to be more cautious and urged the official machinery to be more vigilant to prevent the spread of the virus.“If we observe development world wise, country-wise and state-wise, it is clear that the coronavirus is spreading and not stopping. On Sunday, the number of positive cases has increased considerably. In Telangana, besides 28 new cases, two people have died. The death toll in the state has gone up to 16 and the total number of positive cases to 531,” KCR said.He said the situation was scary in neighbouring Maharashtra. There is an increase in positive cases all over the country and death toll has also increased. “It is precisely for this reason that we have decided to extend the lockdown. People should understand the intensity of the situation. They should confine themselves to their homes as much as possible,” the chief minister said.Stating that personal hygiene is a must, KCR said in case anyone had any doubts, one should go for tests. “The government has identified the places where there were coronavirus positive cases and special measures have been taken in those places. People should cooperate with these measures. They should realize that coronavirus is real and they should be more vigilant and cautious than before,” the chief minister said.He directed that the official machinery should also be on high alert. “Conduct tests whenever there are symptoms. Collect data of the people whom all the Covid-19 positive patients had met and interacted with and find out where they had gone. Conduct tests for them. Increase checks at the inter-state borders, step up restrictions,” he said.In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, too, one death and 15 new cases were reported on Sunday, taking the total number of deaths to seven and the total number of positive cases to 420.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-reports-2-more-deaths-28-new-covid-19-cases-state-count-at-531/story-8hpSiri1L3YGKaeliOIUvK.html
12-04-2020||India||Row over RSS workers at police post in Hyderabad||Alleged enforcement of the lockdown by volunteers of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on the outskirts of Hyderabad has triggered a controversy.Pictures of lathi-wielding RSS volunteers stopping people at a barricade on the highway and checking their documents and identity cards have been going viral on social media over the last two days.The pictures were posted by Friends of RSS. “RSS volunteers helping the police department daily for 12 hours at Yadadri Bhuvangiri district check post, Telangana,” read the caption of the pictures.On Sunday, Amzadullah Khan, president of Majlis-Bachao-Tehreek, a Hyderabad-based political outfit, questioned the propriety of the Rachakonda police (under whose jurisdiction Yadadri Bhuvanagiri falls) in engaging the RSS volunteers.In a statement, Khan sought to know whether the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government headed by chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao had nominated or officially given permission to the RSS to work for the state departments or it was mischievous conduct by pro-Hindutva officials.Tagging Telangana CMO, IT minister KT Rama Rao and the director general of police, Khan tweeted: “Sir, why are you silent on this issue of RSS workers with sticks manning police check post in Telangana, people are asking whether @TelanganaCOPs also outsourced to #RSS? Please break your silence.”RSS Prant Karyavah (state secretary) Kacham Ramesh said in a statement that there was no truth in the reports that their volunteers had checked ID cards. “It is a false allegation and motivated by narrow and vested interests,” he said.He said Swayamsevaks do not interfere with the work of the administration and perform activities only after getting proper and full concurrence from the administration.On the photographs posted in the Friends of RSS Twitter handle, RSS Telangana unit media coordinator Nadimpalli Ayush said the Sangh volunteers had participated in checking of commuters only with the consent of the police.Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagawat admitted that some RSS volunteers had visited the Alair check post. “We have stopped them and in the last two days, they have not been going there. Our police personal are effectively handling situation. We don’t want to get associated with any religious or political group while doing law enforcement. We are empowered by the government to do that,” Bhagawat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-rss-workers-at-police-post-in-hyderabad/story-02oaYqR5kgWMF23JBtj4sO.html

She belongs to Tringli village in Akhnoor sub division of Jammu district.”Soon after giving birth to her baby, the woman tested positive for Covid-19, Dr Chalotra said.“We have also sent samples of her baby and her husband for tests and their reports are awaited,” he added.“They have been shifted to the Government Hospital in Gandhi Nagar which has been converted into a Covid-19 hospital. In fact, we had five positive cases in the SMGS hospital’s isolation ward for the past ten days but then Gandhi Nagar hospital was designated as a Covid-19 hospital and therefore we shifted all of them there on Saturday,” Dr Chalotra said.The mother, her newborn and husband will be treated at the Covid-19 hospital in Gandhi Nagar and shall be discharged only after they test negative, he added.When asked how the woman contracted the disease, Dr Chalotra said that the family’s contact history needs to be traced by the police.“She or someone else in the family might have concealed their travel history and that remains a subject of investigation by the police and health teams dedicated for contact tracing. She was in labour pain and was hospitalized at the SMGS Hospital on April 9 and the next day she delivered a baby,” said Dr Chalotra.“The woman was coughing and running fever as well that aroused the suspicion of the gynaecologists inside the labour room, who went for tests after her delivery. The reports tested positive,” he added. This the first case of a Covid-19 positive patient giving birth to a child in the region.“17 new cases were reported in Jammu and Kashmir. 5 from Jammu Division and 12 from Kashmir. The total number of positive cases now stand at 224,” government spokesman Rohit Kansal tweeted on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-tests-positive-for-covid-19-minutes-after-giving-birth-in-jammu/story-uYmrXZ8Dxaj1QwwSsd68aO.html

The death toll has reached 149, state figures revealed.The state had crossed 1,000 cases just last Tuesday, but the past five days reported more than 100 per day, including three days that saw more than 200 cases. Mumbai has 1,298 positive cases and 92 deaths. The state has tested 41,109 people. It has also kept 5,064 suspected patients under government quarantine facility, while 61,247 are quarantined at home, said the health officials.Senior officials have indicated that the rate of the virus’s spread will be arrested, but it could take a couple of days. “The rise is on and for two days, the number of new cases had even crossed the 200 mark, but on Saturday, it came down to 187. We have taken adequate measures to curb the spread and are hoping that the decline in new cases will start in the next couple of days,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.The rising numbers had forced chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday to extend the lockdown till April 30, so as to prevent the state from slipping in to phase three — community spread — of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, said the official. He has also said that they may have to extend it even further if people did not co-operate. However, the state is also mulling to relax restrictions in areas where there are no cases. “There is a meeting with the chief minister on Monday where the issue is likely to be discussed. We have suggested that the areas that are completely unaffected should be given some relaxations,” said another senior official, wishing not to be named.Meanwhile, the state medical education department on Sunday directed all government and private medical colleges to send their proposals to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for starting Covid-19 tests. “There are eight government and 33 private medical colleges, where the facility is yet to be started.

The 51-year-old earns around Rs 200 a day, and had Rs 10,000 as savings. But even as the nationwide lockdown was announced to quell the spread of Covid-19 and he was gripped by worries about making ends meet, Das has, over the past few days, spent nearly Rs 8,000 to buy food for poor families.He lives alone in a mud house in Sadhutilla village near Agartala, after his wife passed away a few years ago. His children live separately. However, while Das was worried when the lockdown was announced, he said he was more struck by thoughts of people less fortunate than him, which is when he decided to help as best he could. “ I was very worried after lockdown was announced. Before the lockdown, I used to earn around Rs 200 a day, and had Rs 10,000 that I managed to save from my daily earnings. While thinking about my livelihood during the lockdown, I also thought of poor families and daily wage labourers like me. Then I thought of helping them as much as possible,” he said. After this thought, Das bought rice and pulses and poured them into small packets and started distributing them among poor families, on his rickshaw.Das said he had distributed these packets to at least 160 families so far. “ I have spent around Rs 8,000 so far to buy rice and pulses for poor people like me. I understand that many people find it tough to make arrangements for food during lockdown. I have plan to continue giving food, if the lockdown is extended,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rickshaw-puller-uses-up-savings-on-needy/story-cvS53pvu15tOPmjARmdCxN.html

12-04-2020||India||Trucks carrying essentials being detained by police in states, may lead to shortage: Govt||The Union government on Sunday said that guidelines on exemptions during lockdown were not being followed properly in some parts of the country and vehicles carrying essential and non-essential items were being detained by police that could lead to potential shortage of commodities. In a communication to chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories, Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said it has come to the notice that in some parts of the country the guidelines and clarifications on exemptions given to people and services are not being implemented in letter and spirit during the ongoing 21-day lockdown. Specifically, trucks carrying essential and non-essential goods are being detained and workers needed for operation of manufacturing units of essential goods, and other exempted categories are not getting authorisations/passes for their movement during lockdown, he said. Any restriction of activities specifically permitted by the home ministry has the potential of creating shortages of essential commodities, he said. With a view to bring clarity at the implementation level, the official listed the measures for strict observance by authorities at various levels. Inter-state and intra-state movement of all trucks and other goods/carrier vehicles with one driver and one additional person is allowed as long as the driver is carrying a valid driver’s licence. This is irrespective of the nature of the cargo, whether essential or otherwise. No further permit or approval would be required, the home secretary said.  The home secretary said inter-state movement of goods and personnel with passes and authorisations issued by authorities of one state or UT government are not being respected by the authorities of other States/ UTs. Operations of cold storage and warehouses are not being allowed. As per the guidelines issued by the home ministry, empty trucks/ goods carriers should also be allowed to operate while on way to pick up goods, or returning after completing a delivery. Hence, there is no cause to stop empty trucks provided they have valid documents such as driving license and road permit etc, Bhalla said. Local authorities should actively facilitate the movement of truck drivers and cleaners from their place of residence to location of their trucks. Local authorities should facilitate the easy to and fro movement of workers to workplace and back, in respect of all the permitted industrial/ commercial activities. The home secretary said railways, airports, seaports and customs authorities have already been authorised to issue passes for their staff and contractual labour and this should be ensured. Regarding issuance of passes to workers engaged in the manufacturing of permitted categories, the state/UT governments have been advised to expeditiously issue passes on the basis of authorisations issued by companies/ organisations.The state/UT governments shall ensure that these passes are honoured both for movement within their areas and in bordering areas of other states/UTs. Bhalla said MSMEs engaged in the manufacture of essential items like wheat flour (atta), pulses (dal) and edible oils should be allowed to function freely, without any hindrances. Warehouses/ cold storage should be allowed to freely function with allowance for to and fro movement of trucks and without regard to the nature of the goods whether essential or otherwise. These stipulations will apply to all areas other than the areas requiring containment, quarantine and surveillance measures (hotspots) as per the guidelines of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) where state governments/ local authorities have imposed restrictions for preventing the spread of COVID-19. “It is clarified that movement of persons and vehicles, as above, shall be subject to strict adherence to norms of hygienic and social distancing, as is required in the context of COVID- 19,” the letter said. Bhalla said all district authorities and field agencies must be informed of the above instructions, so that there is no ambiguity at the ground level, and activities allowed by the home ministry are carried without any hindrance. The 21-day lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 in a bid to combat coronavirus.

COVID-19 hotspots have been declared in various districts of the country by respective state governments to contain the spread of the disease. Movement of people in such areas is strictly curtailed and all activities are being monitored round-the-clock by police and civic authorities.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), she said, has again clarified to the states and UTs that there is “no restriction on inter-state and intra-state cargo movement whether it is essential goods or any other item”.Godowns and cold stores can also keep all kinds of goods. Godowns in the premises of companies are also included in the exempted category under the list that specifies allowed services during nationwide lockdown, the officer said.  All state authorities have also been directed to ensure that employees and labourers of essential goods manufacturing units are able to get passes easily so that there is no obstruction in the functioning of these units, Srivastava said.  Talking about the measures to provide food to the needy and stranded and undertaking awareness about the pandemic, Srivastava said “at some places army units have also come forward”.  Updating about the availability of essential commodities in the country, she said the situation was under control.  “In the Ministry of Home Affairs control room, representatives of ministry of consumer affairs, railways, civil aviation and other officials are resolving all kinds of logistical problems in coordination with state governments,” she said.The officer also urged people to follow the ‘cyberdost’ Twitter handle run by the MHA to obtain information about measures to combat cyber crimes, especially of the financial kind, adding that these instances have increased as a “lot of people are now doing work from home” in the wake of the ongoing lockdown in the country.She said people can also register complaints incase of encountering a cyber crime at the government portal cybercrime.gov.in.“We are sure with these measures in place we will be able to have security and safety in the cyber space,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-govts-working-to-ensure-home-delivery-of-essential-items-in-covid-19-hotspots-mha/story-CGdmQnMVDCWTPOVafFPzTI.html
12-04-2020||India||MHA gets a SOS message on reopening industries amid lockdown. It is official||The Union home ministry has been asked to look into the possibility of letting a select group of industries resume production to revive economic activity and provide liquidity in the hands of the people.The recommendation, made by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT), said the home ministry should expand the list of activities that are permitted once the Centre decides how to move on the Covid-19 lockdown. It came up with a list of 12 categories of industries that should be allowed to resume production in the first instance.Also read: For businesses, strategies to deal with the aftermath| AnalysisThe recommendation comes before the 21-day lockdown ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to end on April 14. PM Modi hasn’t indicated his mind on the subject yet but stressed at his video conference with chief ministers that the government would need to strike a balance between “jaan” (lives) and “jahan” (the outside world). It was interpreted to imply that the restrictions will continue in some form to preserve lives but with relaxations to resume economic activity and preserve livelihoods.Top government officials told Hindustan Times that while the decision on the lockdown is work in progress, the PM Modi-led government had been very clear that it should not sequester millions of people from 161 districts that do not have a single case of coronavirus disease. Not even a suspected case.The officials pointed to health ministry data that indicated the four worst-affected states are Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan. These four states account for nearly half of India’s Covid-19 cases.Also read: Tax refunds to EPF withdrawals: Govt’s economic measures to aid individuals amid coronavirus crisisIt is in this contect, one official explained, that the government is looking at a graded response to lifting the lockdown, depending on the Covid-19 cases in the district and the state.According to top government officials, around 100-odd districts are severely hit by the coronavirus disease and hence there was a need to seal these hotspots. In districts that have isolated instances of Covid-19 cases, many of the restrictions could be lifted to allow economic activity.In its decision, the Centre will also account for the stand taken by the states such as Delhi, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu that have spoken in favour of a two-week extension. For instance, in Delhi, the state administration feels they need two weeks to unearth all the contacts of the Tablighi Jamaat.Given that health is a state subject, the government may consider the demands of the chief ministers for extension.“But it will be a nuanced approach,” a senior government functionary aware of the developments, told HT.Even in these states, he explained, the game plan would be to have containment zones with no movement while allowing economic activity to pick up outside these hotspots with social distancing and masks.Officials said it was in this context that the DPIIT secretary Guruprasad Mohapatra’s communication to the home ministry had to be seen.Also read: Coronavirus crisis | ₹10 lakh crore stimulus need of the hour, experts estimateMohapatra reasoned that the industrial units which may be allowed to operate must meet five conditions. It should have a single entry points for workers, sufficient space to ensure social distancing, use of separate transport to ferry workers if they can’t be accommodated in the factory premises and high quality regular sanitisation of the premises. Also, state and district authorities, while allowing these new activities, should ensure strict observance of these conditions.The first ones to be permitted could be large industrial units that have proper sanitation and distancing norms in place such as textiles, automobiles and electronic manufacturing.

However, the next 48 hours will be crucial in determining if the surgery has been successful, said the doctors.The police officer’s left hand was chopped off by the Nihangs on Sunday when he stopped them from entering the vegetable market due to the Covid-19 curfew in Patiala. Seven Nihangs were arrested after the incident.Policeman’s hand chopped off in Punjab by group of ‘Nihangs’“First thing is the survival part of the hand. We will see whether the muscles have been repaired through this surgery. It will be too early to celebrate but we are hopeful that if everything goes well there are chances of 90 percent recovery,” Dr RK Sharma, head of plastic surgery said.The 50-year-old officer had an amputation through the proximal wrist of the left hand. The re-implantation was started around 10 am after initial preparation.“This is technically a complex and challenging surgery, which has been successfully done. It was evaluated at the end of surgery that the hand is viable and warm with good circulation,” PGIMER spokesperson, Dr Ashok Kumar said.Dr Sunil Gaba, Dr. Jerry R John and Dr Suraj Nair were among the doctors who performed the surgery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-police-officer-s-chopped-off-hand-re-implanted-after-7-hour-long-surgery/story-yuk3ucSsU0nxms0dnte9kK.html

The data also reveals that 325 positive cases of the total count have foreign travel history.According to the Delhi Health Department, among the total 1,154 cases, 746 cases are from the Nizamuddin Markaz, with 34 new cases in the last 24 hours. The health bulletin refers to the ‘Markaz’ cases as ‘Positive cases under Special Operations’.Among the total number of coronavirus patients, 27 were cured and discharged while one patient has migrated. “A total of 1,102 patients are in various hospitals. While 50 are in the ICU, six are on ventilators and 20 are on oxygen support,” the medical bulletin said.The positive cases in Delhi have seen a sharp spike after a large number of people were evacuated from the Markaz building in south Delhi’s Nizamuddin, where over 2,100 people from different parts of the world and country were staying under one roof without following any social distancing norms.Delhi Government authorities had last month carried out steps to quarantine such people who had links with the religious congregation that had taken place in Nizamuddin in mid- March.So far, 14,036 tests have been conducted in the city and 984 reports are pending. “While 1,154 reports were positive, 11,748 reports were negative,” the report said. There were 720 cases in the national capital on Thursday; the tally crossed the 900-mark on Friday, which jumped to 1,069 on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-health-bulletin-capital-s-coronavirus-cases-touch-1-154-24-dead-so-far/story-WqZTw0O6E4YxmWmrhKtijI.html
12-04-2020||India||Maximum temperature starts rising, some places record 40°C||Maximum temperatures have started rising across the country with many districts in central and west India recording over 40 degrees C. Heat wave conditions are likely to develop in Saurashtra and Kutch in Gujarat.Heat is likely to intensify at these places during the next two to three days. Heat wave is also likely to develop over southwest Madhya Pradesh and northwest Vidarbha on April 14 and 15, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD).Sunday bulletin.“Many places have started recording above normal temperatures now. This is mainly because there is no intense weather system or a western disturbance which is bringing rain. Maximum temperatures across the country are likely to rise even further next week,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.IMD’s heat bulletin for Sunday said maximum temperatures were above normal by 3.1 to 5 degrees C at a few places over Saurashtra, Kutch, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura and Nagaland; by 1.6 to 3 degrees above normal over parts of Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and over a few places of east Rajasthan, west Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, coastal Karnataka, Odisha, Goa and West Bengal.The maximum temperature in Srinagar on Saturday was 24.4 degrees C, 4 degrees above normal; Shimla also recorded a maximum temperature of 24 degrees C, 4 degrees above normal. Many towns and cities have started recording maximum temperatures of over 40 degrees C --- Ahmedabad at 42 degrees C (3 degrees above normal); Bhuj at 42.5 degrees C; Naliya at 40.8 degrees C (6.4 degrees C above normal); Gwalior at 40 degrees C (1.6 degrees C above normal); and Akola at 42 degrees C (1.3 degrees above normal), according to IMD.“There is an anti-cyclone (which causes calm weather) over Gujarat. The temperature hasn’t risen much over northwest India yet because of western disturbances that are affecting the region. But in central India, parts of Gujarat, Odisha, Telangana, which are in heat wave zone, have started recording higher temperatures. They have clear skies and less wind,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at national weather forecasting centre. He added that Delhi too could record 40 degrees C next week.According to IMD, heat wave is recorded when the departure of maximum temperature from normal is + 4 degrees C to + 5 degrees C or more for the regions where the normal maximum temperature is more than 40 degrees C. Another criterion for IMD to declare heat wave is when the departure of maximum temperature from normal is + 5 degree C to + 6 degree C for regions where the normal maximum temperature is 40 degrees C or less. (Heat Wave is declared only when the maximum temperature of a station reaches at least 40 degrees C for plains and at least 30 degree C for hilly regions).Heat wave can also declared when actual maximum temperature remains 45 degrees C or more for a day irrespective of normal maximum temperature, officials said.A Western Disturbance as a cyclonic circulation is lying over west Afghanistan. Under its influence, scattered to fairly widespread rain and snow, gusty winds and lightning is likely over the Western Himalayan region (Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) on April 14 and 15. Another WD is also expected to impact the Western Himalayan region on April 19 and again bring rain and snow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maximum-temperature-starts-rising-some-places-record-40-c/story-WlHWgbGRavawpE6WNwaGbN.html
12-04-2020||India||We need to take lockdowns, curfews seriously: Sachin Pilot||Rajasthan’s deputy chief minister and state Congress chief Sachin Pilot spoke to Aurangzeb Naqshbandi about the Bhilwara containment model, the national lockdown, raising awareness among people, and getting back to business in the time of Covidd-19. Edited excerpts: People are talking about the Bhilwara model of containment of coronavirus but there are also several other hot spots in Rajasthan, such as Ramganj in Jaipur city. How are you dealing with the situation in those areas? Every city has a different composition. In Bhilwara, all the Covid-19 positive cases have now turned negative. We were able to achieve this because the curfew and lockdown were very strictly adhered to. The local administration imposed a “super curfew” with no vehicle and person allowed to move out. But it is true that the number of cases is rising in Rajasthan, as it is in other parts of the country. We really need to take our curfews and lockdowns seriously. No lockdown can be successful without the full participation and cooperation of the people. You talked about spike in positive cases? Is it because that we have now started testing more? Certainly, the testing has been slow and we need to test more. We are now going to start doing random sampling in Rajasthan. We’re acquiring adequate number of testing kits to do that. The number of tests conducted all over India is still quite limited. We have to scale up our testing and that is the only way to get a true pictureThe spike is also attributed to Delhi’s Tablighi Jamaat congregation. Now some people are saying there is an attempt to give a communal colour to the crisis. First - authorities should explain how they allowed such a large congregation despite prohibitory orders. There should be an inquiry to fix the responsibility. Second, action should be taken against those who held that meeting and violated restrictions that were in place. This virus has shown around the world that it does not differentiate between religion, colour, race, language, ethnicity, rich and poor. Whether it is Ram Navami, Hanuman Jayanti or Shab-e-Baraat, all these should have been postponed. This is the time for all of us to come together to fight this crisis as one country, one nation, and one people.Is it important for people to know they need to come forward and get tested. How do you spread that awareness? We have to work hard in the rural areas not only in Rajasthan but across the country. Even though there is technology and mobile phones, the resistance to change is far more in rural areas as compared to urban centres. We were lucky to start as early as mid-March in rural parts of Rajasthan through the rural development, panchayati raj and activating sarpanch-level platforms. We started general awareness programmes and used the Swachh Bharat platforms to sensitise people. You said lockdown is the only way out but it has also stalled economic activity? My heart goes out to the people, especially to those who are at the bottom of the pyramid. I know the hardships and it is very important to ensure essential supplies are maintained. But one cannot prematurely lift the lockdown and allow the infection to spread rapidly in a big country like India. We don’t have the capacity to deal with a large number of infected people. There has to be a middle ground. We have to start economic activities in a gradual staggered manner and at the same time maintain all precautions.But do you have a lockdown exit strategy in place in Rajasthan? Lockdown and restrictions have to be uniform in India. There is no point in three states having the lockdown and two states not having it. What we saw in the beginning of the lockdown, lakhs of people were stranded at different state borders. We can’t have a repeat of that. In Rajasthan, we have to gradually start crucial sectors of our economy. The harvest season is on. I’m hopeful that the Centre will procure the harvest at the minimum support price (MSP). Once reserves dry up, we will need to procure foodgrains and give money in the hands of farmers and weaker sections. What are your views on the issues of CSR funding and suspending of MPLADS?I am of the opinion that if the money is given for the same cause whether to the PM Relief Fund or the CM Relief Fund, it should be treated at par. There should be parity and same exemptions and same benefits must be extended to both. About MPLADS, my view is that while the central government needs resources, it should consult the MPs on how best to use it.As Rajasthan Congress president, what role is the organisation playing in the fight against Covid-19 and do you face any coordination issues with the government? We are political workers and our job is not limited to only campaigning and contesting elections. Our primary job is to do social service that is what we are doing today. Irrespective of parties and ideologies, we have to come forward and together fight this pandemic. The Congress party has set up control centre in Jaipur and 33 district headquarters. We, as a party, are a bridge between the administration and the people.Are you satisfied with the state government’s efforts in dealing with the crisis?I think everyone is putting the best effort given the resources and conditions. We are doing the best we can. Obviously, more support from the central government would be welcomed and we will be able to do more. All hands are on deck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-need-to-take-lockdowns-curfews-seriously-sachin-pilot/story-g4aceOLkN9S6j17kG3fMWM.html

12-04-2020||India||Viral pictures of RSS workers checking documents at a Telangana check-post trigger row||The enforcement of the lockdown allegedly by volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on the outskirts of Hyderabad triggered a controversy on Sunday.Pictures of lathi-wielding RSS volunteers stopping people at a barricade on the highway and checking their documents and identity cards have been going viral on social media in Telangana for the last two days.The pictures were posted by Friends of RSS from its Twitter handle. “RSS volunteers helping the police department daily for 12 hours at Yadadri Bhuvangiri district check post, Telangana,” read the statement posted along with the pictures.On Sunday, Amzadullah Khan, president of Majlis-Bachao-Tehreek, a Hyderabad-based political outfit, questioned the propriety of the Rachakonda police (under whose jurisdiction Yadadri Bhuvanagiri falls) in engaging RSS volunteers in manning the checkposts.In a statement, Khan sought to know whether the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government headed by chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao had nominated or officially given permission to the RSS to work the state government departments. He sought to know whether it was a policy of the TRS party to work with RSS or it was some mischief done by pro-Hindutva officials.Tagging Telangana CMO, IT minister K T Rama Rao and Director General of Police, Khan tweeted: “Sir, why are you silent on this issue of RSS workers with sticks manning police checkposts in Telangana, people are asking whether @TelanganaCOPS also outsourced to #RSS? Please break your silence.”RSS State Secretary Kacham Ramesh said in a statement that there was no truth in the reports that Sangh volunteers had checked the ID cards in Telangana. “It is a false allegation and motivated by narrow and vested interests,” he said.He said Swayamsevaks do not interfere with the work of the administration and perform activities only after getting proper and full concurrence from the local administration.On the photographs posted on the Friends of RSS Twitter handle, RSS Telangana unit media coordinator Nadimpalli Ayush said the Sangh volunteers had participated in checking of commuters only with the consent of the local police.When contacted, Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagawat admitted that some RSS volunteers had indeed come to the Alair checkpost. “We have stopped them and in the last two days, they have not been coming there. Our police personal are effectively handling the situation there. We don’t want to get associated with any religious, political group while doing law enforcement. We are empowered by the government to do that,” Bhagawat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/viral-pictures-of-rss-workers-checking-documents-at-a-telangana-check-post-trigger-row/story-YLMnSk4CdOYi4scQ8FI07J.html

The free cooking gas cylinder distribution is part of the special relief measure announced by the Central government under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana to mitigate against the economic losses suffered by the poor due to coronavirus pandemic outbreak.As per the scheme, three free LPG refills will be provided to the Ujjwala beneficiaries from April to June 2020. This measure along with several others, including direct cash transfer, additional ration supply and increased wages under the national employment guarantee scheme, is meant to provide succour to the poor, who are hit hard by the disruption in economic activity due to the outbreak and resultant nationwide lockdown. “As on date, Oil Marketing Companies have initiated transfer of Rs 5,606 crore into 7.15 crore PMUY beneficiary accounts for availing the free delivery of LPG cylinder under the PMGKY,” the official release stated. The release added that booking of 1.26 crore cylinders have been done in this month by the beneficiaries, out of which about 85 lakh cylinders have been delivered to the beneficiaries under the Ujjwala scheme.According to the government data, there are 27.87 crore active LPG consumers across the country including 8 crore beneficiaries of PM Ujjwala Yojana.The government said that 50 to 60 lakh cylinders were being delivered every day ever since the lockdown began on March 25, and despite the challenges, the waiting period in most of the places was under two days. It also spared a thought for the personnel involved in the supply chain of this enormous exercise.“When there is a nationwide lockdown and the people are staying home to stay safe, LPG delivery boys and all those in the supply chain of LPG are working tirelessly to ensure that clean fuel reaches people directly at their homes,” the release added.These corona warriors have been secured with a relief package announced by the oil marketing companies which promised an ex-gratia amount of Rs 5 lakh each in case of a death reported among the show-room staff, godown-keepers, mechanics and delivery boys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-relief-around-85-lakh-people-given-free-lpg-cylinder-in-april/story-2172LpX5TCstZDqbuFB2gJ.html

12-04-2020||India||Survey, identify, quarantine: A look at the Agra model in Covid-19 fight||The “Agra Model” for tackling Covid-19 has been lauded by the central government, which plans to replicate it nationwide, even though the number of positive cases in the area has crossed the 100 mark.Officials say the local administration’s proactive approach in identifying cases, a door-to-door survey, the number of samples sent for testing, adequate quarantine measures and recovery of infected people are what makes the “Agra Model” special in the fight against the Coronavirus.Agra has recorded one death – a 76-year-old woman suffering from asthma who was infected by her grandson after he returned from abroad.District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said the first six positive cases in Agra were detected on March 3. “With this, we focused on the door-to-door survey, identification of infected cases and placing them in quarantine. The outcome is that cases testing positive now are mostly those already in quarantine,” he said.Agra listed people who had returned from abroad and identified their family members and those in contact with them. Areas with positive cases were declared “hot spots” with the area within a three-kilometre radius acting as a containment zone, and the area within a five-kilometre radius as a buffer zone.“We succeeded in curing 10 patients, including three who were treated at SN Medical College in Agra. Another aspect was the success in getting hot spots de-listed with an extensive door-to-door survey and sanitising the area with strict measures to avoid movement within hot spots,” said Singh.The authorities had designated 38 areas as hot spots and after some of them were removed from the list, the total now is 28.Chief medical officer Mukesh Kumar Vats said more than 2,000 health workers toiled round the clock alongside 3,000 Asha workers for the door-to-door survey to identify suspected cases. The survey by 1,248 two-member teams covered some 160,000 houses in Agra, checking about a million residents, he said.About 2,500 people were found symptomatic, including 36 who had a history of travel and were subjected to testing.A fool-proof quarantine approach was developed and those found to be asymptomatic were put in home quarantine while those who were symptomatic were put in quarantine in special facilities. “Thus, we are mostly testing those already in quarantine,” said Vats.The initial cases from early March were those with a history of travel and authorities focused on tracing their contacts and prepared a list of susceptible people who were tested. “In this process, we worked on clusters and got them sanitised and [removed them] from the list of hotspots, allowing us to focus on new clusters,” Vats added.Singh said 2,144 samples from Agra had been tested so far, of which 104 were found to be positive as of Sunday, when 12 more Covid-19 cases were found. Most of these new cases were staff of a private hospital and their contacts. “This hospital alone had 16 cases testing positive and has turned into a major hot spot. Our team is planning to take some drastic measures,” he said.By the end of March, Agra had only 12 cases, of whom eight had recovered and the rest were being treated. With the detection of cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in New Delhi, the overall number began rising in April.Of the 104 positive cases so far, exactly half were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat gathering, and this led to a setback for all the work done by the Agra administration, officials said.“We had to search for these Jamaat members and their contacts and extensive work was done in tracing them. This increased the number drastically,” Vats said, adding about 28 Jamaat members had travelled to Agra.A control room, established in the Agra Smart City office, has heard about 7,000 complaints and taken steps to resolve them.Officials said a fresh challenge now is positive cases being reported in rural areas such as Saiyyan, Fatehpur Sikri, Khandoli and Iradat Nagar.Vats said authorities have framed a plan for these rural areas and health staff had begun thermal screening in villages. Infected people are being included in two categories – those who had brought infections to rural areas, and those working in cities in places such as hospitals where they can be infected. Joint secretary Lav Agarwal of the Union health ministry had lauded the “Agra Model” during a news briefing in New Delhi on Saturday. “The district authorities in Agra used the Smart City Control Room as a war room and included the private sector in catering to the vulnerable sections to maintain the food chain. The focus remained on contact tracing and isolating patients, for which the Agra district administration identified all who were in contact with the first cases identified,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/survey-identify-quarantine-a-look-at-the-agra-model-in-covid-19-fight/story-mQemI8jQatmgDicZf7WNZK.html

National institutes of repute such as AIIMS and NIMHANS have also been identified to mentor other institutes in testing procedure. Our major focus is also on the proper clinical management of coronavirus positive patients,” Health Ministry’s Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said at a news briefing.On the frantic research by Indian scientists for a vaccine for the deadly pathogen, an ICMR official said that work was being carried out at various research facilities. “More than 40 vaccines are being developed but none of them have reached the next stage. As of now, there is no vaccine for the disease, “Dr Manoj Murhekar, Indian Council of Medical Research said.According to ICMR officials, a total of 1,86,906 samples have so far been tested across the country, of which 7,953 have been found positive for Covid-19.“In the last five days, on an average, 15,747 samples were tested per day and 584 of those were found to be positive per day,” an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) official said at the news briefing.A day earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had held a four-hour meet with 13 chief ministers via a video conference and indicated that the nationwide lockdown would be extended by two more weeks. PM Modi is also likely to address the nation once again to announce the extension of the lockdown, which began on March 25 to control the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-india-s-coronavirus-cases-touch-8-447-34-people-dead-since-saturday/story-85RaBO7hyepBCnYmnjHXUN.html

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Sunday that several new areas will be declared containment zones in addition to the 33 Covid-19 hotspots that have already been sealed by the state administration.Kejriwal said all the containment zones will now be brought under Operation Shield which was first implemented successfully in Dilshad Garden in East Delhi.“We had experimented at Dilshad Garden when one foreign returned woman had turned positive and infected six or seven other people who came in contact with her. We then sealed the entire area. Operation shield was implemented there,” Kejriwal said.Explaining what Operation Shield meant, chief minister Kejriwal said an area under the programme is completely sealed and the movement of people in and out of that area is banned. Administration takes over the supply of essential services including grocery in the area and an extensive sanitization drive is launched within its perimeter.“All the steps taken under Operation Shield resulted in no new cases of Coronavirus being reported from the area (Dilshad Garden) in the past 10 days,” he said.Kejriwal said all new areas in Delhi with a rising number of infections are being identified and will be soon declared containment zones where Operation Shield will come into effect.“Our team has identified several new areas apart from the existing 33 or 35 which will be declared containment zones in the next couple of days. Operation Shield will be enforced in this area in a very strict manner,” Kejriwal said.Delhi chief minister said he recognized that the containment measures had inconvenienced people a great deal but added that it was important to stop the spread of the disease.“We have seen that 2000 people have died in America in the last 24 hours, we don’t want a repeat of this horrifying situation in Delhi,” he said while presenting the rationale for bringing more and more areas into the Operation Shield fold.Click here for live and latest updates on Coronavirus||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/operation-shield-to-be-implemented-in-several-new-coronavirus-hotspots-in-delhi-kejriwal/story-MUFKFbK8kcP4MsHEZASw8J.html

12-04-2020||India||Covid-19: IT-enabled platform to keep tabs on hydroxychloroquine supply||The central government’s department of pharmaceuticals is developing a platform driven by information technology (IT) to monitor the availability of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine after allegations of supply crunch in several places, according to officials.But industry players said there is no shortage of hydroxychloroquine, which is used as a prophylaxis (a treatment to prevent a disease) for people at high risk of contracting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). They added that reports of shortages could be attributed to a popular brand running out of stock because of hoarding by patients.Hydroxychloroquine pills are prescribed to non-Covid-19 patients with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.Acting on the complaints, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), which functions under the pharmaceuticals department (ministry of chemicals and fertilizers), is working on developing the IT-driven platform to monitor hydroxychloroquine at all distribution channels starting from customs to warehouses to distributors and finally retailers.NPPA and the Drugs Controller of India, which is under the health ministry, have approached all stakeholders to ensure information on the supply of the medicine is uploaded and updated on the platform on a regular basis. This will help officials keep tabs on the medicine’s availability and address gaps as and when they surface.“…it is informed that all sellers of drugs are requested to register first in the platform to create master data, and then upload details…It is to ensure availability of these drugs to all needy people,” read a message from the drugs controller’s office to those involved in the supply chain. HT has seen the communication.Basant Goel, the president of Retailers and Distributors Chemist Association (RDCA), said there is a particular brand that is facing supply shortage though others are available in the market.“The initial shortage was reported because, when there was no restriction on the sale of hydroxychloroquine, people started hoarding a popular brand. But now we will be getting more supplies. Also, the sale of hydroxychloroquine is restricted by the government, and you need to have a valid prescription to buy it,” he said.On March 26, the Union health ministry restricted the over-the-counter sale of hydroxychloroquine. It is now available only on prescription. While health ministry says all departments are taking extra steps to ensure the supply of hydroxychloroquine, the external affairs maintains that only the surplus stock is being exported after the recent relaxations of rules.“We have adequate manufacturing capacity, today, in the country and have sufficient supply to meet both domestic and export demand,” the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance said in a statement on Sunday, adding that companies are ramping up production to ensure an uninterrupted supply for domestic and export markets.India has recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for asymptomatic (not showing symptoms of the disease) health care workers treating suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients, and asymptomatic household contacts who live in close proximity with patients. The medicine, along with antibiotic Azithromycin, is given to Covid-19 patients in intensive care units.The government has warned people against the indiscriminate use of hydroxychloroquine, which can have severe side effects in people with a history of heart and kidney ailments, among other underlying conditions.Last week, the government relaxed restrictions on the export of the medicine as several countries, including the US and Brazil, sought supplies from India, which is hydroxychloroquine’s largest producer.According to government data, against the projected requirement of 10 million tablets (including those for health workers dealing with Covid-19 patients, ICU cases and high-risk contacts), the availability is 32.8 million tablets a day. In addition, there is a buffer stock of about 20-30 million tablets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-it-enabled-platform-to-keep-tabs-on-hydroxychloroquine-supply/story-mAYNLqK6Z0QveUwLlgfnoK.html

The PhD scholar at the microbiology department of Lucknow’s King George Medical University was helping his parents farm their land in their village in Khammam district when his head of department Amita Jain phoned him. His help was needed in testing samples for the infection that was spreading rapidly.Follow latest updates on coronavirus hereAnd like a soldier called back in war-time, Ramakrishna said he immediately packed his bags and even lied to his parents, worried like everybody else about the spread of the infection. In an hour he was ready.“I initially told my parents I will be staying with my friends from the village who are studying in Hyderabad. Now, with the attention I got, they know I am working in Lucknow in this fight against coronavirus and they are fine with it,” the 29-year-old microbiologist told PTI.It was March 21 and Ramakrishna set off immediately, telling his parents that he was going to Hyderabad to write his thesis at a friend’s place. His parents were not too convinced, unwilling to let their son make even the 270 km journey to the city but finally agreed.He reached Hyderabad on March 22, the day of the ‘Janta curfew’ when all routes to Lucknow or anywhere else were blocked. Before daybreak, in the early hours of March 23, he headed to the airport.The going was not easy there either. Ramakrishna said he was stopped by police. However, when he explained his reason for heading to the airport, they helped him get there.  He caught a flight to Lucknow, much to the delight of his guide and the team at KGMU that is tirelessly working to test more and more samples each day.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Ramakrishna, who hit the public spotlight when Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted about him, insisted he was just doing his duty like all the others in the medical fraternity to fight this pandemic.The PhD scholar had completed his project six months ago and returned to his village. He was working on his thesis and also helping his parents in farming.Jain, head of department, microbiology, KGMU, said she had called four of her students for help. Two were in Lucknow and joined immediately, while Ramakrishna and one more person were away and immediately came to help.  Asked what she told Ramakrishna on the phone, Jain said, “I told him that we need him if he can help. He asked for an hour to convince his parents and within an hour, he said he is coming.” “Their research scholars helping out in testing) commitment is akin to soldiers reporting to their battalions in times of war. This time soldiers wore masks,” Jain told PTI.Ramakrishna’s contribution and commitment came into focus when Priyanka Gandhi sent him an appreciation letter last week and also tweeted about his selfless act.Hailing the microbiologist, she said they are lakhs of such “soldiers” in India who should be honoured and encouraged.Jain also appreciated the dedication of Ramakrishna and many others who have come to help at the KGMU’s microbiology department, saying all of them just came without once asking about remuneration or incentives.“All of them will be paid, but they never asked about it, such is their commitment,” the head of the microbiology department said.The virology laboratory at KGMU has been testing suspected samples for Covid-19 under the headship of Jain since February.The laboratory’s technicians, virologists and scientists, attendants and research scholars have been working on a war footing 2X7 to deal with the pandemic. Uttar Pradesh has reported 452 cases of coronavirus and five fatalities, according to Health Ministry data.

Among the 15 new cases in this slum pocket are nine contacts of a victim who succumbed to Covid-19 earlier and now the authorities have taken up a full-scale investigation of those who fall under the high-risk category.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here An 80-year-old man died at Kasturba Hospital on Saturday taking the death toll in the slum area to four. His 35-year-old daughter, too, had tested positive for Covid-19.Police, civic, and health authorities are working non-stop to implement the lockdown in the area housing nearly 800,000 people.What are the concerns?Short on space and basic amenities, residents of Dharavi are all the more vulnerable. The 240-hectare slum pocket has 850,000 residents and a population density of 66,000 per square kilometre, making it one of the most congested spaces in Mumbai. The Union health ministry on Tuesday cited an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study that claims one Covid-19 patient can infect 406 people in 30 days if preventive measures such as lockdown and social distancing are not implemented.Activists and health workers have raised concerns over how social distancing is practically impossible in an area where an average of 10-12 people live in each of the 57,000 housing units measuring around 250 sqft.Also read: As some states extend curbs, India awaits Centre’s Covid-19 lockdown decisionThey have said social distancing and self-isolation are hardly possible in slums where an average family has four to five people living in one room. Self-isolation is hardly possible.Lack of amenities, such as potable water and toilet facilities, also force these people to break the social distancing protocol.What are experts saying?They have said there is a need to revisit how social distancing is being imposed in slum clusters like Dharavi during the ongoing lockdown.Amitabh Kundu, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said the lockdown has been largely successful in urban areas, among the middle and the upper classes because of a lot of social vigilantism, but the same cannot be said for those living in slum clusters or in areas inhabited by lower-income groups.Also read| Over 35,000 abuse lockdown in Maharashtra, cases near 9000 in India: 10 points“Residents’ welfare associations are taking extra care; there is limited entry of people, quarantine notices were put up on houses with members having travel history and effective monitoring is being done, often at the irritation and violation of the privacy of the affected households. But we are really worried that the hotspots should not extend to the rural areas, low-income areas and slums in towns and cities,” he said.Kundu said the concept of social distancing is difficult in lower-income groups because of the lockdown since most of them spend more time in confined spaces.“As per Census 2011, about 25% of the people living in urban slums still have to go out for toilet and drinking water; for them, the lockdown means standing in long queues (where social distancing is not possible). About 45% of these people are workers mostly employed in the informal sector. They are not allowed to go out unless they are part of the essential services,” he said.Manoj Misra, head of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, a non-government organisation that works for the revival of the Yamuna, pointed out that the sense of hygiene maintenance in India is already compromised. “For people in slums, access to space, safe water and privacy is a daily struggle that has been heightened by the lockdown, so the immediate steps that can be taken now are focusing on the most susceptible in this group, those above 60,” Misra said.What are authorities doing?The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started screening around 700,000 residents of the cramped slum cluster of Dharavi on Saturday—an exercise that is expected to take around two weeks to complete.Door-to-door screening of people living in Dharavi is being done by a team of 150 doctors from Maharashtra Medical Association and other BMC workers.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “We have formed 10 teams to conduct screening of all residents in Dharavi. We are using 500 sets of personal protection equipment (PPE), 2,000 masks, and 18 thermal scanners for this purpose. Screenings are being done at Kalyanwadi, Mukund Nagar, Social Nagar, Muslim Nagar, Madina Nagar, etc,” Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G/North ward under which Dharavi is located, said.Mumbai Police on Sunday barricaded the Dharavi and deployed personnel in the area to keep a watch on the movement of people.The civic body has already planned a 1000-bed quarantine facility in Dharavi, where those wanting institutional quarantine will be kept. Of these, 300 beds will be available at the Rajiv Gandhi District Sports Club and the remaining 700 are being planned at the Dharavi transit camp municipal school.Dharavi has around 225 public or community toilets that are also being disinfected daily for which a special treatment solution and machine has been imported from New Zealand.Mumbai council spokesman Vijay Khabale-Patil said Sunday testing sites have also been set up in recent days to pick up on asymptomatic carriers of the virus, adding that “as a result, more positive cases have emerged”.“We have been running extensive medical camps in Dharavi and other areas of Mumbai to test more people for coronavirus and make sure carriers are not ignored just because they don’t display symptoms,” he said while speaking to wire agency AFP.All shops, except pharmacies, near so-called “containment zones” in Dharavi has been closed from Friday to limit the number of people in public spaces.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/43-covid-19-cases-4-deaths-how-coronavirus-spread-in-dharavi-has-kept-authorities-on-toes/story-EpYz64OPD8yUdzEXotpDBI.html
12-04-2020||India||‘May use it if data suggests’: Delhi AIIMS expert on plasma therapy for Covid-19||All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) Delhi director Randeep Guleria on Sunday talked about the possibility of using plasma therapy in treating Covid-19.Guleria said that blood plasma can be taken from a Covid-19 patient who has recovered from the illness. The plasma from a recovered coronavirus patient contains antibodies which, when transfused to a sick patient, can help in recovery. “Plasma from blood of a person who recovered from Covid-19 is taken and then plasma’s anti-bodies are transfused into another patient’s blood which boosts their immune system,” he said.Guleria said that there are very few studies that indicate the effectiveness of plasma therapy as the treatment of Covid-19. He added that the therapy has previously been used in other illnesses such as Ebola.  #WATCH Delhi AIIMS' Randeep Guleria explains how plasma therapy works in treatment of #COVID19 patients - Plasma from blood of a person who recovered from COVID-19 is taken & then plasma's anti-bodies are transfused into another patient's blood which boosts their immune system. pic.twitter.com/FMcuVxEvvB“If the data suggests it’s useful, then we may be able to use it in a larger number of patients but we must remember that it depends on blood being donated by Covid-19 patients who have recovered and their plasma being available to be given to the patient,” Guleria added.  Guleria also said that there is no data to suggest that pets can spread coronavirus.“The spread of Covid-19 is mainly from human to human. Chances of its spread from pets to humans are very very unlikely. So having pets at home is safe,” he said. The number of Covid-19 cases in the country climbed to to 8,356 on Sunday.

12-04-2020||India||15 Pak soldiers, 8 terrorists killed in Army’s LoC action, says intel report||The Indian Army’s artillery assault on terror launch pads at Dudhnial facing the Keran sector across the Line of Control (LoC) on April 10 killed eight terrorists and 15 Pakistan Army soldiers, two people in the security establishment told Hindustan Times.It was a message to Pakistan, one of them said, that nothing goes unpunished.On the banks of Kishanganga river, Dudhnial was targeted to retaliate to ceasefire violations by Pakistan. It was from this mountain town that the five terrorists neutralised by the Indian Army special forces in the Keran sector on April 5 had been launched.Out of five terrorists killed, three belonged to Jammu and Kashmir and the other two had trained with Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), people familiar with the development said. Efforts to establish their identity are still on.Pakistan Army has confirmed that Indian Army fired in Sharda, Dudhnial and Shahkot sectors along the LoC, the de facto border. But it had claimed that only four civilians including a 15- year- old girl sustained serious injuries. Islamabad also blamed the Indian Army of 708 ceasefire violations in 2020, that it said, killed two civilians and injured another 42.The Pakistan Army spokesperson also said the Pakistan Army countered the Indian assault by targeting Indian Army posts along the LoC with matching weapon calibre or simply put artillery guns and heavy mortars.This, according to Indian intelligence reports, was an effort to camouflage the extent of the casualties on the Pakistani side.According to these intelligence reports, 15 Pakistan army troopers were killed along with eight terrorists on April 10 when the army hit targets in the Keran sector using long-range ammunition. Some collateral damage, mostly shops where food and logistics supplies were stored, in the Dudhnial area have also been reported.Pakistan watchers say that Indian Army had no option but to target the launch pads as nearly 160 terrorists of mixed tanzeems—Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Jaish e Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen — were waiting in the area to infiltrate into Kashmir.The situation is no different in locations south of Pir Panjal in Rajouri and Jammu sector where intelligence reports pointed to the presence of 70 Jaish terrorists waiting for an opportunity to cross into India.A senior intelligence official told HT that it was not a coincidence that violations of ceasefire are being reported from Balakote and Mendhar sectors, firing mortars along LoC. “The situation along the LoC is very hot right now as we speak,” he said.Terrorists often sneak into Jammu and Kashmir under cover fire from the Pakistani army.Intelligence agencies have estimated that there are a total of about 242 terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. According to Kashmir experts, past experience shows that the moment this number crosses 300, there will be a spike in violence and targeted attacks on security forces and political leaders who speak out against Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-pak-soldiers-8-terrorists-killed-in-army-s-loc-action-says-intel-report/story-WAUDUY2MEJNLV6jFZ4qyTM.html

The panel has submitted its report to the chief minister, and it will now be sent to the Central government.O April 4, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had formed two task forces to give suggestions on the phased withdrawal of the lockdown and on bringing the economy back on track.A senior official said on condition of anonymity that the 12-member task force has recommended that the lockdown should be withdrawn in phases, and not in one go, based on the number of infections in districts.The panel has placed districts in four categories based on the number of Covid-19 cases – high risk, medium risk, low risk, and districts with no cases, such as Bundi, Jalore, Sirohi, Hanumangarh and Baran. The report recommended allowing agricultural value chain operations (production, marketing and consumption) with conditions. The task force emphasised the need to strengthen National Agriculture Marketing (eNAM), a pan-India electronic trading portal, which connects all agricultural markets (mandis), the official said.The task force also recommended allowing the transportation of goods and opening up of the services sector, including electricians, and repairs of coolers and air conditioning units, along with the supply of medicines and groceries and the continuation of banking operations, the official said.In addition, food delivery services, including by restaurants, and services such as plumbers, hair salons, laundries, cobblers and tailoring should be considered for resumption, the official said.“The report said schools, colleges and libraries should stay closed, and factories with labour staying in the premises and major mining operations may be allowed,” he said.The task force recommended that some activities should be permitted only after the return of normalcy, such as social gatherings of more than 20 people, markets in narrow lanes, cinemas, gyms, clubs and swimming pools, the official said.“The panel has suggested ensuring that those given permits are bound to follow the advisories of the health department, such as wearing masks, using sanitisers and maintaining social distancing,” he said. The report also gave details of the Covid-19 situation in Rajasthan, including hotspots and growth charts for infections.Rajasthan had imposed a lockdown on March 22, three days before the nationwide lockdown announced by the Central government. The 12-member task force comprised officials and experts such as additional chief secretary (home) Rajeeva Swaroop, additional chief secretary (health) Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (industry) Subodh Agarwal, director general of police Bhupendra Singh, additional director general of police (crime) BL Soni, the heads of the energy, agriculture, food and civil supply, and labour departments and health experts Ashok Pangariya, Virendra Singh and SD Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-covid-19-task-force-for-lockdown-withdrawal-in-phases/story-Y14I6vvgAh6Mm8iNsm7S9I.html
12-04-2020||India||Covid-19 package offers eight 5kg cooking gas refills for free till June||Poor households using 5kg cooking gas cylinders will be entitled to eight free refills in three months as a relief from the disruptions due to the Covid-19 outbreak, while the number of free refills will be limited to three for beneficiaries using 14.2kg cylinders, an oil ministry spokesperson said. The Rs 1.7 lakh crore Covid-19 welfare package that the government announced on March 26 (a day after a nationwide lockdown came into effect) specified only three free cooking gas cylinders to about 80 million poor households, which led to some confusion about the entitlement of number of refills for the beneficiaries using economical 5kg cylinders, he said.“Those who are using small cylinders will get eight free cylinders in three months – April, May and June – under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY),” he said. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageTill now, oil marketing companies have initiated a transfer of Rs 5,606 crore into the bank accounts of more than 71 million Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) beneficiaries as advance in order to ensure that they can avail free delivery of LPG cylinder under the PMGKY, he said.PMUY was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 1, 2016 in Ballia (Uttar Pradesh) to provide free cooking gas connections to 50 million poor households. Later the target was raised to 80 million households, which was achieved six months in advance on September 7, 2019.An executive of India’s biggest fuel retailer, state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), said the company has transferred about Rs 2,780 crore in the bank accounts of its 37 million PMUY customers so that they can get the first cooking gas cylinder free of cost.Along with the other two state-run companies – Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) – the public sector oil marketing companies have so far distributed 8.5 million cooking gas cylinders for free to poor households, the spokesperson said.“Booking of 1.26 crore cylinders has been done in this month by the beneficiaries, out of which about 85 lakh cylinders have been delivered to PMUY beneficiaries. This is aimed at alleviating the hardships faced by poor due to economic disruption by coronavirus (COVID-19),” he said.The number of active cooking gas customers (including beneficiaries of subsidy) in India are 27.87 crore.“Since the lockdown, 50 to 60 lakh cylinders are being delivered daily in the country. When there is nationwide lockdown and the people are staying home to stay safe, LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] delivery boys and all those in the supply chain of LPG are working tirelessly to ensure that clean fuel reaches people directly at their homes,” he said.Even in these trying times, the waiting period for cylinders at most of the places is less than two days, he added.Oil marketing companies -- IOCL, BPCL and HPCL -- have announced an ex-gratia amount of Rs 5 lakh each, as a one-time special measure, in the unfortunate case of demise of personnel (showroom staff, godown-keepers, mechanics and delivery boys) attending duty in the LPG distributorship chain due to the infection and impact of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-package-offers-eight-5kg-cooking-gas-refills-for-free-till-june/story-eGfIin2jJYEiFLWhELDhCL.html

It can have cardiac toxicity leading to irregular heartbeat. Like any other drug, this also has side effects. It can do more harm than good for the general public,” Dr Guleria told ANI.He said the data is not strong enough to support that HCQ is a cure for Covid-19 but since no other treatment is available, it was felt that the drug should be used.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.“Some lab data show that hydroxychloroquine may have some effects in Covid-19. But the data are not that strong. Experts at ICMR felt that it may be helpful in close contacts of Covid-19 patients and healthcare workers taking care of the patients. Studies in China and France say that combination of HCQ and Azithromycin may be helpful if given to Covid-19 patients with moderate to severe illness. Since, no other treatment is available, it was felt that it should be used,” Dr Guleria saidOn Thursday, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that it won’t recommend hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients unless satisfactory results are seen during tests.ICMR said hydroxychloroquine is recommended only to those asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases.India produces nearly 70 per cent of the world’s supply of HCQ. India recently agreed to export the medicine to the United States following a request by President Donald Trump who had said that the drug would be a game-changer in the battle against Covid-19 pandemic.India had banned the export of hydroxychloroquine and any formulation containing it on March 25. Earlier this month, the government expanded the ban to cover exports from special economic zones, blocking pending orders, including from the US before it decided to accede to Trump’s request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-aiims-chief-warns-against-banking-on-hydroxychloroquine-as-cure/story-MADeNBZy9X78E9BB1ovGSJ.html

Only essential services, such as health care and policing, are exempt.Several states such as Odisha, Punjab and Mahrashtra have already taken state-specific decisions to extend the curbs at least till the end of the month. There has been no announcement at the central level though.But after talks between Modi and chief ministers on Saturday, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee claimed that the PM had agreed to extend the lockdown.During the video conference, Modi told chief ministers that India will have to strike a balance between “jaan” (lives) and “jahaan” (the outside world), in a sign that the restrictions may continue in some form after April 14 but there could also be relaxations in order to kick-start economy amid grim growth projections.Central officials aware of the matter say the PM’s message meant that the government may move towards a “smart lockdown” — with severe restrictions in affected districts to tackle the health challenge, and partial lifting of restrictions in unaffected districts along with the opening up of some sectors to meet the economic challenge.While micro, small and medium enterprises Nitin Gadkari has favoured restarting manufacturing units that don’t require mass transport, others have expressed concerns about the increasing stress on prices of essentials due to supply chain disruptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-some-states-extend-curb-india-awaits-centre-s-covid-19-lockdown-call/story-8tzSfawo06blH7VbHPjFAN.html
12-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Karnataka govt studying in-depth consequences of lockdown norms relaxation||The Karnataka government is studying in-depth the consequences of possible relaxation of lockdown norms after April 14 and plans to come out with a clear roadmap in a day or two, a key Minister said on Sunday.Medical Education Minister Sudhakar K, who is in-charge of all matters related to Covid-19, told PTI that the pros and cons of any decision that the government intends to take is being looked at in detail.“We are trying to understand how the situation would be of any action that we intend to take. We need to foresee the repercussions or results of our action.That we have to keep it in mind and take a decision.After-effects of the decisions we intend to take, that is more important, he said.You will have clarity (on the possible relaxation of lockdown norms) in a day or two.For everything (government decisions) we will give reasoning for what action we would like to take; with the reasoning we will give decision” , the Minister added.Government sources said some relaxation in liquor sales, stopped during the lock-down period, is likely after the ongoing 21-day national clampdown ends on April 14.Twelve of the state’s 30 districts remain free from the Covid-19 pandemic.Till Saturday, Karnataka reported 215 Covid-19 positive cases, including six deaths and 39 discharges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-karnataka-govt-studying-in-depth-consequences-of-lockdown-norms-relaxation/story-6467keYmeJHAD178WrXvFO.html

It was obvious,” Nath said.He also said that as chief minister, he had taken some decisions to check the spread of the disease. “We ordered closure of shopping malls, schools etc on March 8. There was no lockdown, but we took measures looking at the gravity of the situation,” Nath said.“When the Speaker announced that he is adjourning the House over Covid-19 fears, he was mocked. Look what happened afterwards. The entire country was put under lockdown,” said the Congress leader.He said that all the testing is being done in cities and urban centres, and not in villages. “Madhya Pradesh borders five states, and 25-30 per cent of the state’s population has come back and is living in villages. They are not being tested, what about these people? It is a threat,” said Nath.Nath resigned from his post on March 20, hours before proving his majority on the floor of Madhya Pradesh Assembly, as ordered by the Supreme Court. He was heading a minority government after having failed in his attempts to woo back 23 rebel Congress MLAs, including six ministers, who had resigned owing allegiance to BJP leader and former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-waited-because-kamal-nath-links-lockdown-announcement-with-his-govt-s-fall/story-0FeDj3NcuFCRAaBe1BFGTP.html

12-04-2020||India||A rickshaw cart driver used his savings to feed poor in lockdown-hit Tripura||If you decide to help someone in the hour of crisis, financial constraint will not pose any roadblock to this ‘will’. Fifty-one-year-old Goutam Das of Tripura, who earns Rs 200 daily, proved this right.Das, a rickshaw cart driver, had savings of Rs 10,000, of which he spent nearly Rs 8,000 to give rice and pulses to the poor amid Covid-19 lockdown.Das’ wife passed away a few years ago; he now lives alone in a mud house at Sadhutilla village, near capital Agartala. His children live separately.Like many others, Das also got worried when a 21-day lockdown was announced. He though about its impact on the poor people and daily-wage labourers and decided to help them as per his capacity.“I was very much worried after lockdown was announced. Before lockdown, I used to earn Rs 200 on an average. I had savings of Rs 10,000 which I had managed from my small earnings. Thinking about my livelihood in lockdown, I simultaneously thought of poor families and daily wage labour like me. Then I thought to help them in whatsoever manner possible from my side,” Das said. Using the money he saved, Das bought rice and pulses and poured them into small packets. Then he took out his rickshaw cart and started distributing these packets to the poor without any cost.According to Das, he has so far distributed such packets to at least 160 families. “I spent Rs 8,000 as of now to buy rice and pulses for poor people like me. I understand that many people find it tough to arrange for food during lockdown. I have plan to continue if there is an extension of the lockdown,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-rickshaw-cart-driver-used-his-saving-to-feed-poor-in-lockdown-hit-tripura/story-iQKInMOcFCP32r0VfvRyML.html

Let us maintain all rules and safety measures. Only then we will be able to win this battle,” AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi said in a statement.Assam has recorded 29 Covid-19 cases till date. One patient, a 65-year-old from Hailakandi, died this Friday at Silchar Medical College Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-lockdown-plays-spoilsport-for-rongali-bihu-in-assam/story-kyKeIL6se5wI93BN7jraQI.html
12-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: In Bengal, smuggling through Bangladesh border drops drastically amid Covid-19 lockdown||The Covid-19 outbreak has impacted lives of everyone including contraband operators as smuggling of cattle, fake Indian currency notes (FICN) and marijuana as well as infiltration through the Indo-Bangladesh border in the West Bengal sector has dropped to an all-time low in the past few weeks, BSF officials said. For decades, the porous Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal has been notorious for smuggling and infiltration, which has also been a burning political issue in the state. “We have kept up the vigil. There has been no relaxation in that aspect. But in the South Bengal frontier region, smuggling, FICN trade, and infiltration have reached a rock bottom level. It’s negligible,” BSF IG South Bengal Frontier YB Khurania told PTI. The illegal trade of FICN, gold, and marijuana has taken a hit in south Bengal due to the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown. “The FICN trade mostly takes place at the Rajshahi sector of the Indo-Bangla border. The notes that they are throwing at this side of the fence now are of very poor quality - basically just photocopies. We can safely say the high-quality FICN trade has taken a huge hit,” another senior BSF official of Bengal frontier said. The BSF gives credit for this success to increased vigil at the border and sealing of the border with Bangladesh. “Smugglers and FICN couriers are not able to come out of their home. There has been a sense of fear due to the Covid-19 pandemic, plus there has been an increase in patrolling in the porous region,” the BSF official said. Bangladesh and West Bengal share about 2,216.7 km of border. Out of the 915 km of border in the South Bengal frontier, only 371 km is fenced. The official said infiltration from Bangladesh had already come down after passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act in December last year and apprehensions about a pan-India NRC. The outbreak of Covid-19 has added to it and infiltration is at an all-time low, he said. Only 13 Bangladeshis have been captured between March 25 when the lockdown was announced, and April 10, the official said. During the same period in 2018 and 2019, the figures were 76 and 33, he said. In terms of cattle smuggling too, there has been a significant success. “The number of cattle apprehended during this period this year is just 45. During the similar period last year, the number was around 1,700. We have broken the backbone of cattle smuggling in the past one year,” the BSF official said. Seizure of marijuana has also decreased during this period over the years. The border guards seized 154.5 kg in 2018, 41 kg in 2019 and 35 kg in this year. The picture is also similar in the North Bengal Frontier of BSF where both infiltration and smuggling are also at an all-time low. Keeping in mind the protection of its troopers in Covid-19 time, the BSF has come up with standard operating procedures while dealing with smugglers and infiltrators. “There are proper guidelines for troopers on the field while dealing with miscreants. They have been provided with protective gear including masks, gloves and suits,” a BSF official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-in-bengal-smuggling-through-bangladesh-border-drops-drastically-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-OaajbCPP7MY8QCfppqgrNO.html

12-04-2020||India||Is this Indian state close to ‘flattening’ its Covid-19 curve?||While the coronavirus cases continue to mount across the country, the southern state of Kerala seems to have reported a slump in its Covid-19 cases. A look at the number of coronavirus cases reported in the state suggests that the state administration has been able to tighten its grip on the spread of the deadly contagion. The state accounted for the second-highest coronavirus cases in the country just a few weeks back after Maharashtra and now stands way below on the Covid-19 state tally as the number of cases sharply rise in states like Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and others. Does this mean the land of coconut has managed to ‘flatten’ the Covid-19 curve? My compliments to CM @vijayanpinarayi & people of Kerala for remarkable handling of #COVID__19 It’s daily discharges far exceed daily new infections. It has restricted secondary spread & while international mortality rate is 5.75, rate in Kerala is mere 0.58 with just 2 deaths. https://t.co/L3T82tNGLAAs per the data released by the Ministry of Health on Sunday, Kerala has 471 total coronavirus which includes 346 active cases, 123 recoveries and 2 fatalities. A week back, last Sunday, the state had reported a total of 357 cases including 306 active cases, 49 recoveries and two fatalities.Earlier this week, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that recovery of more people and fewer new cases in the state are good signs but it should not let the administration “lower the guard” against Covid-19. “Recovery of many patients is a good sign. And the number of people testing positive also came down. These factors show we have a good grip on the disease and things will turn in our favour soon. But time is not ripe to lower the guard. If some lapses do take place things will change. We have examples of some the developed countries before us. So we have to keep our surveillance well,” Vijayan said.Excellent resilience shown by Kerala in dealing with #Covid_19. Best practices of leadership led by @CMOKerala, bureaucracy led by District Collectors & Health Department, ably supported by police, Local self govt, media & community as a whole. Worth emulating! @amitabhk87 pic.twitter.com/YHS8KC0tf9A look at Kerala’s Covid-19 trajectory:April 5 - 306 active cases, 49 recoveries, 2 deaths April 6 - 314 active cases, 55 recoveries, 2 deathsApril 7 - 327 active cases, 58 recoveries, 2 deathsApril 8 - 336 active cases, 70 recoveries, 2 deathsApril 9 - 345 active cases, 83 recoveries, 2 deathsApril 10 - 357 active cases, 96 recoveries, 2 deathsApril 11 - 364 active cases, 123 recoveries, 2 deathsApril 12 - 364 active cases, 123 recoveries, 2 deathsThe state has not reported any fatalities in over a week. While the number of active cases in Kerala has gone up from 306 to 346 in a week (an increase of 40 new active cases), the number of patients who have recovered from Covid-19 in the state has a dramatic rise since last Sunday (from 49 to 123).According to Johns Hopkins University, ‘flattening’ the coronavirus curve involves “reducing the number of new Covid-19 cases from one day to the next”.  If Kerala continues to maintain the trend, it would soon be able to not just flatten its Covid-19 trajectory but also free the state from the menace of coronavirus.  India on Sunday reported as many as 8,356 total cases of coronavirus infection in the country.

Team-11 refers to the committees set up to look after various aspects of the fight against Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh.He said steps should also be initiated to ensure protection of doctors and para medical staff by providing PPE kits to those deployed for treatment of coronavirus positive patients.A protocol should be worked out for hospitals before opening emergency services for patients afflicted with other ailments, he said.When officials informed him that 2350 coronavirus tests were being conducted every day in the test laboratories in UP, the chief minister said the capacity of labs should be increased and more tests should be conducted in the state. He said arrangements for training of medical and health staff should also be made.He told the officers that migrants and others living in shelter homes should be requested to stay back where they have been up to now. The state government should make an appeal to them to stay where they are now, said the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-yogi-adityanath-informs-pm-modi-about-up-govt-s-steps-to-fight-coronavirus/story-yAgvANjYKe1VVqhRkcV8CL.html
12-04-2020||India||Pandemic spells death sentence for India’s non-virus patients||Liver patient Shahjahan’s family feared the worst when a New Delhi public hospital told her to leave because her bed was needed in a coronavirus unit.The 40-year-old mother had been on a ventilator with an acute infection for almost two weeks when she left Lok Nayak hospital on Tuesday night.She died at her family home in Delhi the next morning. Other hospitals had turned her away because of the pandemic.“The authorities just left her to die. Even when they referred us to another hospital, they refused to give us an ambulance,” said Mohammad Khalid, a relative of Shahjahan.The capacity of medical facilities around the world has been stretched by the surge of Covid-19 patients as outbreaks worsen in many countries.It can cause people with other life-threatening diseases to miss out on vital care -- especially in places like India, where healthcare systems are shakier.Dozens of people with serious medical conditions are camped outside India’s national medical institute in tents set up by the Delhi government.Many of them had travelled from other cities for now-cancelled appointments and can’t go back due to transport restrictions under the nationwide lockdown that began on March 25.Outpatient departments at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) closed, forcing cancer patients and others with deadly ailments to take shelter in a grimy pedestrian subway and under canvas.Though aid groups have provided some food and medicines, it had been 12 hours since Saryu Das had eaten when AFP met him.Subway deathHis son, who had mouth cancer, lay on a thin mattress with his face covered by a scarf. Flies hovered around him. Four days later, he died.Waste littered the subway floor that is now home to more than 10 families unable to get back to their hometowns, with the mattresses so close that social distancing was impossible.The AIIMS did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the death and the patients outside. But hospitals across the vast country of 1.3 billion people have been put on alert and its virus death toll is now above 280.When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the lockdown, he gave millions of Indians taking life-saving drugs only four hours’ notice.Amulya Nidhi, a health activist based in Madhya Pradesh state, told AFP the government knew that vulnerable patients -- including those with silicosis and tuberculosis, which kills tens of thousands each year in India, as well as pregnant women -- were at risk.“I’m getting distress calls from across India over access to basic medicines and treatment,” said Nidhi.Shut out“It is important to expand healthcare facilities to fight COVID-19. At the same time, hospitals and ambulances have to be available for patients with other problems,” he said.In February, 39-year-old Maitri Lakra was found to be in the initial stages of tongue cancer. Being HIV-positive only added to her woes.Doctors at AIIMS referred her to their campus in Haryana state for pre-surgery tests, which started mid-March. But 10 days later, she was told that all radiology appointments were postponed.As her condition deteriorated -- bleeding from the tongue and in unbearable pain -- she filed a petition with the Delhi High Court and has finally been admitted to AIIMS.“Her cancer is at stage three now. Had she received treatment on time, this would not have happened,” her son Debashish Dag said.Vinay Shetty, from the Mumbai-based Think Foundation that works with people with the blood disease thalassaemia and organises blood donation camps, said those needing transfusions are among the most vulnerable.“Those needing drugs may not have a problem, but anybody needing blood will,” Shetty said, adding the government had to encourage blood donors.Public health expert Anant Bhan said India’s focus on COVID-19 could lead to other diseases such as tuberculosis spreading.“Family members in lockdown with tuberculosis patients are at risk. After the lockdown is removed and people start social interactions, it could spread the infection the same way COVID-19 patients could spread infection,” Bhan said.“Deaths because of COVID-19 and not directly of it is something that we need to worry about. We need to ensure those who need essential services have it,” he said.And time is already running out for Shahjahan’s fellow patients in the subway and tents outside AIIMS.“The doctors told me they could not do my chemotherapy session now and that they’ll call me when the lockdown is lifted. That call may take weeks,” said 25-year old Rampur resident Mohammed Shan-e-Alam.“Now I can’t go home and I can’t go to the hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-spells-death-sentence-for-india-s-non-virus-patients/story-2A3VTg1fKaL3YxDDnGBrfN.html
12-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Lift or extend lockdown, difficult situation either way, Jharkhand CM tells Modi||The Jharkhand government is on the horns of a dilemma over the coronavirus lockdown as extending it would lead to financial distress and lifting it could trigger an influx of migrants into the state, Chief Minister Hemant Soren said on Saturday.During an interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Soren said his government is expecting over 5 lakh migrant labourers to return to their villages once the lockdown is lifted, increasing the possibility of the spread of the deadly virus.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here But continuing with the lockdown will further dry up the state’s revenue, he added.“Whether the lockdown is lifted or extended, it is a difficult situation for us from both ways,” Soren told the prime minister during the video conference held with chief ministers to assess the situation in states due to the pandemic.“As per our data, a large number of labourers are stranded in states severely affected by the coronavirus outbreak. When they will return, the situation could deteriorate. They may come as carriers of the virus,” Soren said.He said over 1.5 lakh migrant workers have already returned to Jharkhand and had to be quarantined.Soren urged Modi to increase the daily wage under rural job scheme MGNREGA to Rs300. “I believe the wage under MGNREGA in the state is the lowest in the country. Therefore, a large number of people from Jharkhand migrate to other states and are earning Rs 700or Rs 900 per day. Even after the recent announcement of wage hike under the scheme, it has not crossed Rs 200 in Jharkhand... So I request you to fix the wage under the scheme at Rs 300,” Soren said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageThe increase in wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act came into effect on April 1.The chief minister also requested Modi to consider waiver of interest for existing loans for the current fiscal and urged him to consider releasing the GST compensation arrear.A large number of PSUs like DVC, CCL and SAIL are functioning in Jharkhand and they havedues to the government, he mentioned.

12-04-2020||India||PM-KISAN, Jan Dhan, Ujjawala: Govt lends Rs 30,000 crore helping hand in Covid-19 crisis||The government has released nearly Rs 30,000 crore financial assistance to different sections of the society in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced Rs 1.70 lakh crore relief package last month, days after a nationwide lockdown was announced to check the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19. In the package, the government announced free foodgrain and cash doles to women, poor senior citizens and farmers to mitigate hardship faced due to the 21-day lockdown.Here is a look at different schemes under which the government is giving financial assistance:PM-KISAN: 6.93 crore farmers were benefited through the PM-KISAN scheme to help farmers tide over the Covid-19 crisis. Under the scheme, the government transfers Rs 2,000 cash directly to the farmers’ bank accounts through direct benefit transfer or DBT. Rs 13,855 crore have gone towards payment of first installment of PM-KISAN, the finance ministry said.Jan Dhan: As many as 19.86 crore women Jan Dhan account holders received Rs 500 each in their account.

12-04-2020||India||3-week lockdown reasonable starting point to fight coronavirus in India: Ex-White House official||A three-week lockdown is a reasonable starting point to contain the coronavirus pandemic in a country like India, an eminent Indian-American epidemiologist has said, cautioning that a successful fight against the deadly virus might require some more time.Rajeev Venkayya, Special Assistant to the President for Biodefense at the White House during the Bush administration who oversaw US preparedness for bioterrorism and biological threats, told PTI it was difficult to say how much more time India would require to thwart the COVID-19 challenge. On March 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown in India to stem the spread of coronavirus in the country. “From an epidemiologic standpoint, I don’t know if three weeks will be enough. It may require more time,” said Venkayya, who was responsible for the development and implementation of the National Strategy for Influenza pandemic during the second term of the Bush administration.He currently serves as president of the Global Vaccine Business Unit of pharmaceutical company Takeda. “We will have to look at what is happening in other countries,” he said.“But if you were to ask me whether that will be enough given the size of the population, the healthcare capacity, the uniformity or lack of uniformity that is inevitable in a federated country like India where there’s a lot of State autonomy on what to do and how to do it, and varying levels of compliance, I think this could easily go much longer,” Venkayya said.A three-week lockdown is a reasonable starting point to contain the coronavirus pandemic in a country like India, he said. Since joining Takeda in 2012, he has established a high-impact vaccine pipeline that includes promising late-stage candidates for dengue and norovirus, gained through the acquisitions of LigoCyte and Inviragen Inc. As head of Special Assistant to the President for Biodefense at the White House, he was responsible for the America’s first development and implementation of the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza in 2007. The White House published this federal guidance in 2007. “It’s now called the flattening the curve strategy. At that time, we called it a targeted layered containment and then it became called community mitigation. But the first flattening the curve graph was published in our federal guidance in 2007,” he said. “When I was in the White House, we were preparing for an influenza pandemic we realized that vaccines would not be available for many months after a pandemic started. And based on the 1918 experience, we expected there would be multiple waves of the pandemic and that for at least the first wave we would not have vaccines,” he said. As such, the White House team led by him had to find other ways to protect communities from this pandemic virus. Based on some early modelling and additional modelling commissioned in 2006, they found the relevance of non-pharmaceutical interventions, community measures like closing schools and cancelling public gatherings, social distancing as well as isolation and quarantine for people that have been confirmed or suspected to have the virus. “If you put all of these things together, and importantly if you did them early in a coordinated fashion, you couldn’t have a very big impact on the transmission of the virus in a community,” he said, adding that this guidance was published in 2007. Emphasising the importance of doing these things early in the outbreak, he cautioned that else it would be much harder to prevent a large number of people from getting infected and accomplishing the goals of flattening the curve and delaying the peak of the curve. “So here I think it’s very important that India took (lockdown) action now, ….. like many countries, there isn’t widespread availability of diagnostic testing. And so it’s hard to know how much virus is in any given community in India,” he said. “We also know that the threat is greater in India than it may be in other places because of the population density. Also, there are significant portions of the population that don’t have access to the healthcare services that would be necessary to take care of large numbers of sick people. So, it (social mitigation measures) becomes even more important in India than it’s important everywhere,” Venkayya said. Observing that none of the community interventions are perfect, he said if one puts a number of imperfect interventions together, then one can have a very significant positive impact on reducing virus transmission. Prior to Takeda, Venkayya served as director of Vaccine Delivery in the Global Health Program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, where he was responsible for the Foundation’s efforts in polio eradication and new vaccine introduction. While at the foundation, he served on the Board of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). The death toll due to COVID-19 has gone up to 273 and the number of cases has climbed to 8,356 in India, according to the Health Ministry.Globally, the novel coronavirus has killed 108,862 people and infected over 1.7 million people globally. The US has the highest number of infections at 529,887, according to Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-week-lockdown-reasonable-starting-point-to-fight-coronavirus-in-india-ex-white-house-official/story-8XMuKJ4eax5VWUNhHVv9yI.html

Baghel was among the chief ministers who attended Prime Minister Modi’s video conference to discuss whether to extend the 21-day country-wide lockdown beyond next week.The Prime Minister held the video conference with chief ministers to take feedback on whether the ongoing lockdown is extended after April 14 to contain the spread of the coronavirus infection.Also read: Jamaat members hiding travel history could incur murder charges in Chhattisgarh“Some of these people met the 16 Tablighi Jamaat members who were staying at a mosque in Purani Basti locality and then spread it (Covid-19) to others. They are from a nearby locality and tested positive late on Saturday night,” Dipanshu Kabra, Bilaspur’s inspector general of police, said while speaking to HT.“These seven people who tested positive on Saturday night are not Jamaatis,” Kabra said.A 16-year-old boy from this Jamaat group had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 4, after which another eight others in the area got infected, he added.Dr Karan Peepre, All India Institute of Medical Sciences’ medical superintendent, said that all of the seven people tested positive for coronavirus late on Saturday night and were brought to AIIMS Raipur.“They are stable and their health is good,” Peepre added.Katghora, around 200km from state capital Raipur, has been sealed and samples of all people in the area are being taken for screening for Covid-19.Twenty-five people have tested positive for the infection in Chhattisgarh so far, out of which 10 have recovered and discharged from hospitals.The Chhattisgarh government has made wearing face masks mandatory in public places in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus infection. The health and family welfare department has warned of legal action against those not wearing masks in public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-7-more-cases-of-covid-19-in-chhattisgarh-25-so-far/story-GySmag8J2EbPj0Gk8PM15I.html

It was launched by the Prime Minister on February 24, 2019, when the first instalment was paid.In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the government decided to make an advance payout of its universal cash-for-farmers programme, PM-KISAN, in April rather than in June.The cash transfer under PM-KISAN is an unconditional handout, meaning that it doesn’t require any proof of how recipients use it, but payments are usually timed with sowing seasons to help finance agricultural inputs. Inputs refer to all materials needed for cultivation by farmers, from seeds to fertilisers.Eligible farmer families are identified on the basis of operational land holding data according to the agricultural Census Data 2015-16, which is then extrapolated to 2018-19, an official said. It is the job of state governments to provide accurate beneficiary data and payments are continuously updated.The country has 140 million operational land holdings, which refers to the number of land parcels owned by total households. The eligible farmer count shows that registrations of about 59 million farmers are yet to be authenticated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-7-crore-farmers-get-rs-2-000-each-under-pm-kisan-to-tide-over-covid-19-crisis/story-uyka5G0hsoPteBezBJcqFP.html

Of the four new cases, two are from Bisra area of Sundargarh district.So far, 3,551 samples have been tested in Odisha of which 3,497 have tested negative. Twelve of the 54 people have been discharged from hospitals following treatment while a 72-year-old man of Bhubaneswar, tested positive, died.National Health Mission director Shalini Pandit said just 35 cases needed hospital care as they are yet to show any of the classic symptoms of the disease even after they were tested positive. They were hospitalised purely as a preventive measure for their and the community’s safety. They would be discharged after their reports test negative twice, she said.Pandit said 80 per cent patients out of the total Covid-19 cases in Odisha were asymptomatic carriers. Therefore, surveillance is the best weapon against the disease.Meanwhile, the Covid-19 positive cases in India crossed the 8,000-mark on Sunday.

12-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: What are red, orange and green zones and how will they impact life||Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a discussion with chief ministers on extension of 21-day lockdown, which is scheduled to end on April 14. The lockdown was imposed on March 25, a day after PM Modi addressed the nation on coronavirus pandemic.During the four-hour-long discussion, PM Modi said that India will have to strike a balance between “jaan” (lives) and “jahan” (the outside world) - a sign that the restrictions will continue in some form to preserve lives as it enforces social distancing.A top government official said that the PM’s formulation meant that the government may move towards a “smart lockdown” - with severe restrictions in affected districts, and partial lifting of restrictions in unaffected districts, along with the opening up of some sectors to meet the economic challenge. A second official said that the government was also considering demarcating the country into three zones - red, yellow and green - depending on the scale of the Covid-19 outbreak.So what are these zones, and how will they impact the economic activity in the country:Red Zone: According to news agency PTI, no activity will be allowed in the red zone - the districts where sizeable number of cases were detected or areas which were declared hotspots.Orange Zone: Minimum activities like opening of limited public transport, harvesting of farm products will be allowed in orange zones where only few cases have been found in the past, PTI reported.Green Zone: It will see further relaxation. Some MSME industries falling under the green zone will be allowed to function with in-house lodging facilities for employees with proper maintenance of social distance, according to PTI.For the government, both at the central and state level, the situation clearly has posed a difficult choice. The demands of public health - which dictate that an extension of the lockdown is the best way to control the spread of the disease - and the demands of the economy - which is in crisis with supply and demand shocks, closure of factory plants, business becoming unviable, loss of jobs and incomes - have to be reconciled.It is understood that while senior officials are in agreement on the importance of the lockdown to save Indian lives, they also want economic activity to be revived, as ports are jammed with containers and major port cities such as Mumbai and Chennai are hit by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-what-are-red-orange-and-green-zones-and-how-will-they-impact-life/story-KuFHv7V125PYhZIAzF1xuJ.html

12-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Govt may divide country in red, orange and green zones||The Centre is likely to categorise the country into red, orange and green zones depending on the number of Covid-19 cases during the proposed extended period of lockdown, news agency PTI reported.Quoting government officials, PTI further reported that there will be no activity in the red zones - the districts where sizeable number of cases were detected or areas which were declared hotspots; minimum activities like opening of limited public transport, harvesting of farm products will be allowed in orange zones where only few cases have been found in the past; the green zones may see further relaxation.Tracking Covid-19 Outbreak: Full CoverageSome MSME industries falling under the green zone will be allowed to function with in-house lodging facilities for employees with proper maintenance of social distance, PTI further reported.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held meeting with the chief ministers - his third and most expansive interaction so far - where he hinted that restrictions will continue in some form to preserve lives in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. Some relaxations are, however, expected to resume economic activity.Also read: What are red, orange and green zones and how will they impact lifeThe PM said that while announcing the lockdown, he had spoken of “jaan hai toh jahaan hai” - if one is alive, there is a world - but now, for a successful and prosperous India, it was time to move to “jaan bhi, jahaan bhi” - life also, world also.In the four-hour-long interaction, several chief ministers expressed the need to extend the lockdown, and offered a review of the situation in their respective states. The CMs placed emphasis on balancing lives and livelihoods, with some asking for a major economic package to tide over the crisis. They also flagged the need for more testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPEs) for health workers.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Saturday suggested to the Centre to lift the lockdown and confine it only to the red zones which have reported a larger number of Covid-19 positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-govt-may-divide-country-in-red-orange-and-green-zones/story-KACrCEqD7u0Oz92QKNXxvI.html
12-04-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 cases cross 8000-mark, death toll at 273||India on Sunday morning reported 8,356 people have contracted the coronavirus disease and 273 have died across the country, with more than 900 cases and 34 deaths in the last 24 hours.According to the Union health ministry’s data at 8am, there are 7367 active cases, 716 people have been cured, discharged or migrated.The new numbers come a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi indicated the 21-day lockdown across the country may be extended beyond April 14.The Prime Minister stressed on Saturday that the new challenge was not only to save lives but livelihoods as well as he spoke with several chief ministers to discuss the lockdown ordered last month to stop the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus disease and other issues.PM Modi said that the government earlier motto was ‘jaan hai to jahaan hai’ [when you have life, you have the world]. “Now it is ‘jaan bhi jahaan bhi’ [save life, and livelihood],” he said, signalling a shift in the Centre’s approach. He is yet to take a decision on the extension of the three-week national lockdown but several states have independently announced an extension of the restrictions till the end of April.The government has also emphasised the importance of strict restrictions put in place on March 25.A health ministry official said on Saturday the number of Covid-19 cases in India could have even reached a figure of 820,000 by April 15 without the containment measures and nationwide lockdown. The government has said that the country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has been pre-emptive and proactive to the extent of being over-prepared, which has helped in preventing ballooning of the number of positive cases.According to Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 tracker, there are 1,776,157 cases and 108,804 fatalities worldwide as of Sunday.The United States surpassed Italy on Saturday as the country with the highest reported coronavirus death toll, recording more than 20,000 fatalities since the outbreak began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-cases-cross-8000-mark-death-toll-at-273/story-IHuP8d7lIInk9mz4uBQHeM.html
12-04-2020||India||‘May this Easter give us added strength to overcome Covid-19’: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday wished the country on Easter, hoping the occasion “gives us strength to overcome coronavirus disease Covid-19”.“Best wishes to everyone on the special occasion of Easter. We remember the noble thoughts of Lord Christ, especially his unwavering commitment to empowering the poor and needy. May this Easter give us added strength to successfully overcome COVID-19 and create a healthier planet,” PM Modi said on Twitter. Best wishes to everyone on the special occasion of Easter. We remember the noble thoughts of Lord Christ, especially his unwavering commitment to empowering the poor and needy. May this Easter give us added strength to successfully overcome COVID-19 and create a healthier planet.Easter marks the resurrection of Jesus Christ following his crucifixion on Good Friday. It also marks the culmination of Lent, a 40-day period of fasting and penance.This year, the coronavirus pandemic has muted the public cheer on Easter, with no public gathering and all the priests issuing video messages for the faithful.Pope Francis urged people to “not yield to fear” and focused on a “message of hope” as he led an Easter eve Mass in an empty St Peter’s Basilica on Saturday amid the coronavirus pandemic and called for an end to wars.The vigil, which normally takes place in a church packed with about 10,000 people, was attended by only about two dozen, including a few altar servers and a smaller-than-usual choir. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, it was scaled back to eliminate several traditional features, such as the baptism of adult converts and a long procession up the main aisle of Christendom’s largest church.In India too, the Easter midnight prayers were held without an assembled congregation keeping with the restrictions in place due to the nationwide lockdown.“Celebrating the Holy Week without a congregation of the faithful is painful. The Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown has forced us to celebrate it within the church. But we are hopeful that the resurrection of Jesus Christ will give us the hope that we will overcome this situation and we will get the remedy for it soon,” Father Walter de Sa, Parish Priest of a Goa church told news agency ANI.Churches in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state due to Covid-19 pandemic, wore a deserted look. A few of them have even locked their doors.On April 21 last year, devotees had gathered at churches across India at midnight on Easter. Churches were decked up with flowers as people attended the ceremonial midnight mass to offer prayers in devotional fervour.However, this year, live-streaming of services is being done at several churches amid 21-day Covid-19 lockdown, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/may-this-easter-give-us-added-strength-to-overcome-covid-19-pm-modi/story-MBe9Qm7HuKl65YoywyLGiL.html

There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the number of cases announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rope-in-ent-specialists-resident-docs-to-fight-covid-19-health-ministry/story-EBC64jtD6e8vwPQsff9FYO.html

His “corona foot shake” video alone has been watched four million times.“I got a message today (Friday) from someone who said his wife was a cardiologist working with COVID-19 response teams and found the videos so refreshing,” Campbell said.Another message came from a lung cancer patient who thanked him for making his quarantine more bearable.“The overwhelming response has been, ‘Hey, I work in New York City and I love seeing your video after my long day,’“ Campbell said. “Others say, ‘Hey, my family member has the virus and we watch these videos together while they recover.’“Campbell said fellow doctors and nurses at the hospital in Portland were initially reluctant to appear in the videos, but after seeing the positive reactions have joined in the fun.Hospital officials have applauded the initiative.“Dr. Campbell’s energy and charisma is infectious,” said Dr. Renee Edwards, the hospital’s chief medical officer. “A skilled physician, he’s found a unique way to incorporate the power of positivity into his daily work, helping to lift the spirits of patients and co-workers alike.”The videos have been hailed by the state’s governor and even caught the attention of popular recording artist Janet Jackson, who retweeted one of the doctor’s TikToks.Campbell, who has posted about a dozen videos since the beginning of March, said his next dance routine, currently being rehearsed, was in response to a special request from his co-workers’ kids.“It’s going to be a slow-motion challenge with one of my colleague’s daughter,” he said. “It’s multiple moves where you go slow at first then speed it up back to real time.”As for his plans once the pandemic is over, Campbell said he has no intention of stopping his dancing.“The focus will remain on connecting with the black youth,” he said. “And working to enhance diversity in medicine long-term.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dance-moves-from-tik-tok-doc-bring-welcome-relief-from-virus-blues/story-0fkNphDyMY6hD0arFZcdJO.html

12-04-2020||India||Centre should introduce new schemes like ‘food for work’ amid Covid-19 crisis: Rajasthan CM||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has urged PM Narendra Modi to introduce new schemes such as ‘food for work’, announce a big package for industries and relaxation in central GST amid the coronavirus crisis.On the ongoing lockdown, Gehlot emphasised on taking a collective decision by looking at the situation of the individual states and taking the respective states in confidence.Gehlot urged to immediately plan to launch a scheme on the lines of ‘Food for Work’ to provide relief to the ragpickers, pushcart or rickshaw-pullers, nomad and other helpless people whose livelihoods are under threat due to the Covid-19 lockdown. He said the scheme was initiated during the regime of Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2001-02 and gained much popularity as a measure of fighting drought.The Chief Minister added that the state government compensated such vulnerable population by providing a cash amount of Rs 2,500 each to more than 31 lakh families who were not covered under any other social security scheme. The centre should also bring some scheme of compensation for such people so that they could get at least some minimum economic support, he said.The Government of India has sufficient quantities of grains for such a scheme, said Gehlot, attending the PM’s video conference which was participated by the CMs of other states on Saturday. “For deciding the financial package to the states, a delegation of top officers could be sent for a discussion with the Union Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),” Gehlot said.Suggesting an incentive package for the Industries, he said former Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee had announced a big stimulus package during the 2008 economic slump. Such a package should be announced for the industries during the current crisis so that their financial situation could be strengthened.“The state government has provided relief to the hotel and tourism industry affected by the lockdown. We have decided to reimburse the state GST to the hospitality businesses for the next three months. To arrest the deteriorating situation of this industry during this challenging time, the GoI should consider giving concessions in the central GST,” Gehlot stated.He suggested that there will be a recovery at the global economic scenario after the lockdown ends and in such a situation, looking at the possibilities of new export opportunities for India, from now onwards giving interest subsidy through EXIM Bank and other incentives should be considered to encourage exports.The CM reiterated his demand to provide a grant of Rs one lakh crore to the state governments to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. The payment of the first instalment of the grant should be made, based on the population and later as per the prescribed formula of the GST Council or the Inter-state Council, he added.He further asked for an increase in the borrowing limit for a state and the treasury deficit limit mentioned in the FRBM Act to 5% of the GDP. Gehlot demanded that recently the RBI increased the Wage and Means Advance limit by 30%, but looking at the current crisis, the facility of this advance payment to the state governments should be provided free of interest so that the Covid-19 pandemic could be effectively dealt with.Gehlot demanded for grant of a moratorium of 6 months to the states by reassessing the payment of forthcoming instalments of outstanding loans due to the RBI and other financial institutions under the Government of India.Gehlot said that the crops of Rabi season were ready to be sold in the market. Under the Prime Minister Asha Scheme, 25% of the total yields of crops are procured at the MSP, which is inadequate. Farmers should be provided relief in such a tough time by increasing the purchase limit on MSP to 50%. The FCI and NAFED etc should urgently start the MSP procurement of crops in a phased manner, the chief minister suggested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-should-introduce-new-schemes-like-food-for-work-amid-covid-19-crisis-rajasthan-cm/story-WwdaEsFAJ2udhrlVHL2tXK.html

12-04-2020||India||‘Must not relent a bit’: Chhattisgarh health minister on Covid-19 fight||After a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases, the Chhattisgarh government turned its focus to check possible community spread in future. The state has detected 25 positive patients till now, out of which, 10 recovered and have been discharged from hospital. Fourteen people - seven on Thursday and seven on Saturday night - tested positive on Thursday in Katghora, a small town of Korba district.Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singhdeo, in an interview with Hindustan Times, said that the government has made an alternative arrangement in case the number of patients rise. Singhdeo said that government intends to conduct rapid testing in order to eliminate the chances of spread of the deadly virus through asymptomatic carriers.Q: With the recent increase in Covid-19 positive patients, how is the Chhattisgarh government planning to deal with the pandemic?TS Singhdeo: Advanced preparation has been the guiding principle of the government since this pandemic knocked on our door. Health and sanitation is the state subject, but we are also bound by the protocol laid down by the Centre. For example, the testing was severely restricted in the initial days and serious efforts started only after the tourists from Italy visited our country. Ensuing death and sudden surge in cases galvanised us.Despite these anomalies, the state government was always on its toes since January itself. We have been arranging for the necessary logistics to battle this pandemic since January. The whole machinery has been in action. Whatever delay has been caused, it has been on account of seeking approvals from the central government.We got rapid testing kit approval only on April 4. Immediately, a tender was floated and very soon we will have the requisite number of kits. Testing would obviate the possibility of contagion to spread at alarming rates. The factor that asymptomatic carriers can transmit the disease to others - this is the biggest challenge which can be braved by effective testing only.Q: The government statements to the media suggested that they are successful in containing the pandemic within the state. Don’t you think that it is quite an exaggeration to make such a claim at this stage?TS Singhdeo: I would not call it an exaggeration. In fact, it is reflective of our resolute preparation to fight this disease. We have made adequate arrangements in advance to meet the conditions that arise from this menace. We have around 4,700 beds ready for the patients. We have already ordered for the necessary number of PPEs for health professionals and government personnel. Moreover, we have made alternative arrangements in case the number of patients rises. If it breaches the mark of 20,000 we will start taking the help of the private hospitals also. We intend to conduct rapid testing in order to eliminate the chances of spread of the deadly virus through asymptomatic carriers.Q: Why testing has not been done? Only 3,000 people have been tested until now. Why tenders have been floated now when you claimed that government was prepared since January?TS Singhdeo: Testing has not been done solely because the Centre’s protocol did not allow us. First positive case in Chhattisgarh was reported on March 18. Since then, we have developed two testing facilities. However, the Union government has approved rapid testing as late as on April 4. We have ordered 75,000 rapid testing kits now. Tenders could not have been floated for the reasons already stated. Even at the national level, only one testing lab was there at Pune. Now, with an increase in the number of reported cases, we have around 170 testing facilities throughout the country.We could not have bought all equipment based on mere speculation. Today, we have 18 cases in the state and for that, we have enough resources. Our major challenge is to prepare for a situation where the number of infected people increases exponentially. ICMR protocols are acting as bottlenecks.Q: There is a public and bureaucratic perception that there is no unity of command during this pandemic fight and there are two power centres in the government - CM and you. What do you have to say about this perception?TS Singhdeo: This a mirage that has been created to bring a bad name to the government. I am the health minister and taking decisions related to my department. There is no dichotomy between CMO and the department I have been given charge of. For instance, the chief minister sought my opinion regarding the extension of lockdown. I gave my opinion on behalf of the department after due consultation. It is just an opinion and ultimately the chief minister will take the final call.CM is the ultimate authority and there is absolute unity of command. The whole state machinery is working in unison to combat this pandemic. I do not work beyond the mandate of my department.Q: Lastly, can you please shed light on one phenomenal step taken by the Chhattisgarh government that has helped contain the Covid-19 threat?TS Singhdeo: Our advanced preparation has been the most significant factor.

12-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Chhattisgarh makes face masks mandatory in public places||The Chhattisgarh government on Saturday made wearing face masks mandatory in public places in a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus infection. "Health experts suggested that wearing face masks is essential in the prevention and control of COVID-19. Hence, under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, Chhattisgarh Epidemic Diseases COVID-19 Regulations and Chhattisgarh Public Health Act 1949, it has been made mandatory for every person to wear a face mask in public places,” an order issued by Chhattisgarh’s health and family welfare department said.Legal action will be taken against those not wearing masks in public places in Chhattisgarh, the order stated.It said people can use triple layer masks available in the market or home-made face covers and that those made at home could be reused after washing properly.Also read: Several targets missed, still no sign of rapid testing kits"A scarf or handkerchief could also be used in place of a mask but it should cover the nose and mouth fully,” an official said.In Chhattisgarh, 18 people have tested positive for Covid-19 till now out of which ten have been discharged from hospital.On Thursday, after seven people who had come in contact with Tablighi Jamaat members tested positive for the coronavirus infection in Korba district, the Chhattisgarh government decided to test every resident of the affected area of the Kotghora town, which is about 70km from Bilaspur district of the state. Also read: One in every 25 Covid-19 patients in city is a health care workerOn Saturday, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi that essential economic activities should be allowed to function within the states in case the lockdown continues after April 14.Baghel also suggested not relaxing the existing ban on inter-state road, air and rail services in view of the increasing cases of Covid-19 in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-chhattisgarh-makes-face-masks-mandatory-in-public-places/story-O0nLz4PbGDTPO2XIFCoFSI.html
12-04-2020||India||Coronavirus in India: Historic sights, monumental silence||Tourists, both domestic and foreign, were in for a rude shock on March 17 when they were turned away from the Taj Mahal — one the country’s top ten most popular tourist destinations in 2019, according to the ministry of tourism — as the Archeological Survey of India decided to close down all monuments and protected sites in view of the global coronavirus pandemic.The last time in post Independent India that the Taj Mahal was shut down for visitors was during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. Built in the 17th century by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, the Taj is a popular pitstop for visiting international heads of states including most recently, United States President Donald Trump.An official from the ASI’s Agra circle said that even the routine repair work on the marble mausoleum was stalled. Such work is essential for the upkeep of several of these monuments. For instance, the dome of the Taj is sometimes caked with fuller’s earth to offset the damage by pollution.Tourism has come to a grinding halt in the face of the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. In states like Uttar Pradesh, which accounted for 15.4% of all domestic tourists and Maharashtra, which accounted for nearly a quarter of international tourist arrivals in 2018, the spread of disease is high.“Of all the sectors, tourism was first hit and will take the longest to recover. But we remain hopeful that once the curbs are lifted, domestic tourists will start moving; international tourism might take much longer as air travel will continue to have restrictions,” said director general (tourism) Meenakshi Sharma. Domestic tourists account for a larger share in yearly earnings.In the last few years, the tourism sector has seen marginal growth in footfall and revenue. In foreign exchange earnings, the tourism sector fetched Rs 14,667 crore in March 2017, Rs 17,222 crores in 2018 and Rs 16,125 crores in 2019. Now, industry experts estimate that at least 50 million jobs related to tourism directly and indirectly are at stake, and recovery could take months. Pranob Sarkar of the Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), an apex body of inbound tour-operators, said that there have been no new bookings since March. “It might take us anywhere from 12 to 24 months to come to normal levels of operation,” said Sarkar. “Even after curbs are lifted for both domestic and international travellers, we do not know how many people will resume travelling,” he added. South Mumbai’s bustling tourist hotspots of Colaba causeway and Apollo Bunder — home to the colonial era monument, the Gateway of India — wear a completely deserted look. Even the ferries that leave from the port to destinations like Aurangabad and Alibaug in the mainland, have stopped their rounds.Dhananjay Sawalkar, joint director, directorate of tourism, Maharashtra said, “The footfall has been low at Ajanta Ellora caves in Aurgangabad since mid-February itself. We had closed the site even before the state government had announced the lockdown.” The Gateway, a favorite spot for photographers and vistors, has been closed down since March 23, when the state announced a complete lockdown. Suhas Chatkara, co-founder of Mumbai-based tour organiser Routed India said that he had lost around Rs 40 to 50 lakh in cancellations of bookings made in April and May, usually busy months owing to summer holidays in schools and colleges.Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India said that while no major renovation work was scheduled on centrally-protected sites, routine maintenance work had to be stalled. “Special projects such as the excavation of a recently-discovered Mughal-era tunnel in Red Fort which was carried out early this year, have not been taken up,” Gunjan Kr Srivastava, Delhi ASI Circle Superintending Officer said. Even the lawns of India Gate popular among tourists and visitors, is being maintained by a skeletal staff of the Central Public Works Department. “The Amar Jawan Jyoti continues to burn every day,” the spokesperson said.(With inputs from Hemendra Chaturvedi, Mehul Thakkar and Tanushree Venkataraman)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-in-india-historic-sights-monumental-silence/story-SIIVYBm4WsXKqLoL9AxAOK.html
12-04-2020||India||Allow economic activities within states: Chhattisgarh’s Baghel to PM Modi||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow states to carry out essential economic activities in case the lockdown continues.The Prime Minister held a video conference with chief ministers to take feedback on whether the ongoing lockdown is extended after April 14 to contain the spread of the coronavirus infection.Baghel suggested not relaxing the existing ban on the inter-state road, air and rail services in view of the increasing cases of Covid-19 in the country, a release from his office said.The chief minister also sought an economic package for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector from the Centre, citing that the MSME sector which provides maximum employment to the people, has been bearing the brunt of lockdown and seeking early financial assistance in the state.During the video conference, the chief minister said that due to lack of clear instructions by the Centre for the purchase of test kits, there is a situation of apprehension and asserted on the need to issue clear guidelines in this regard, the statement said.“As many as 3,473 samples have been tested till Friday in the state. On average,135 samples are being taken per day which is very less. Due to less testing, it cannot be said with certainty whether the condition of Covid-19 virus is actually under control or not,” Baghel stated.“There is a need to take 3 to 5 thousand samples daily. Therefore a request has already been made to ensure more availability of PPE kits and testing facilities in the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allow-economic-activities-within-states-chhattisgarh-s-baghel-to-pm-modi/story-uii3cvrRzvDoJV4lZvT6xM.html
12-04-2020||India||One in every 25 Covid-19 patients in Delhi is a health care worker||One in every 25 people with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi is a health care worker, with at least 42 doctors, nurses or hospital staff infected, according to data from the state health department — a statistic that once again highlights the risks faced by front-line responders and concerns over adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) kits.Delhi reported a total of 1,069 cases till Saturday.In addition, more than 400 health care workers across the city have been quarantined after coming in contact with people who later tested positive.Two nurses tested positive for the infection Friday night — one of them was posted in Lok Nayak hospital, making her the first health care worker testing positive in what is the biggest Covid-19 treatment centre in the city, where at least 651 Covid-19 confirmed or suspected cases are admitted. Around 25 others who came in contact with the nurse have been asked to go into quarantine. “She did not come in direct contact with any of the suspected patients. She has more of a managerial role and supervises the wards. And, we make sure anyone entering the wards dons personal protective equipment,” said a hospital official who asked not to be named.The other nurse to test positive worked at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital — also the first from the centre to test positive.Doctors from across the country have been complaining about the shortage and poor quality of PPE gear, such as masks, face shields, coveralls and gloves.“When health care workers are affected, it takes away active people from the service and also results in clusters around hospitals. It can paralyse the health system in pockets, with hospital after hospital being closed down because of infections,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.With 22 of its staff testing positive, the highest number of health care workers have tested positive at the Delhi State Cancer Institute, which has now been closed. Two of the first doctors to have tested positive were from mohalla clinics in north-east Delhi.“This trend is more than worrying. And, not only in Delhi, this is happening across India. And the problem lies in government denying community transmission. There are some universal precautions to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth that must be taken by all health care workers in primary, secondary or tertiary settings. But because the government kept denying community transmission, we kept screening people depending on their history of travel or contact,” said Dr Jacob John.Community transmission is the third of the four stages of the spread of an infectious disease. The first is travel history, the second is local transmission, the third is community transmission, and the fourth is epidemic. India has so far maintained that the disease is in the second stage, or between stage two and stage three with “limited community transmission” in some clusters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-one-in-every-25-covid-19-patients-in-city-is-a-health-care-worker/story-stEtKgOvMoxmKr0z9wp9tI.html
12-04-2020||India||Coronavirus in India: New infections raise fear of community spread in states||On April 3, a sub-inspector of Bow Bazar police station saw a beggar, aged about 40, on a pavement on Jogendra Kabiraj Row in central Kolkata, suffering from fever and shortness of breath.He was immediately taken to the NRS Medical College and Hospital, where his swab samples test report came positive. He was shifted to the infectious diseases (ID) hospital, the state’s nodal hospital for Covid-19.The second incident was reported from the Tukra Patti area, where local residents noticed a 60-year-old homeless man on April 1 with symptoms of coronavirus infection. He was first taken to a local hospital and then to the ID hospital on April 6. A senior doctor of the ID hospital confirmed that the two street dwellers were referred to the hospital and that they tested positive. “I don’t want to comment anything on this,” said Siddhartha Chakraborty, officer-in-charge of Bowbazar police station. The two cases, with no history of travel or known contact with previous patients, had worried both experts and policy makers. “It is difficult to trace contact history, as beggars living on those footpaths had been provided with food by several persons over the past few days, including private volunteers and policemen,” said an expert who is part of the state’s Covid-19 team.“Going through media reports it seems that probably we are entering stage three (community transmission). However officially we are still in stage two,” said Dr Sumon Poddar, associate professor at Kolkata based Institute of Child Health.The Union health ministry has dismissed speculation about community transmission, where the source of the disease is not known, but many experts have pointed to cases where authorities have failed to trace the source of the infection.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh confirmed community transmission in his state on Friday, claiming that about 15% of Covid-19 cases in the state were of community transmission.A day later, two of the seven new cases in Punjab have no history of travel or contact. While one gardener found positive in Patiala was working in the house of a Punjab Civil Service (PCS) officer, the second is a truck-driver from Pathankot district, who had returned to his office after the lockdown.In Haryana, officials said two percent of he 162 cases were of possible community spread, which includes a 38-year-old Rohtak resident, who has tested positive along with her two children, said Dhruva Chaudhary, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak.In Ambala, a 67-year-old who died at the Chandigarh Post Graduate Institute (PGI) on April 1 and later tested positive for Covid-19, had no travel history, officials said. “In all these cases, we at least know the possible route of the contact,” said Haryana’s director general, health services, Dr S B Kamboj.In Bihar, officials have not completed the contact tracing of 10% of the 60 coronavirus cases. Of these, four are from Begusarai and one each from Nawada and Patna. “We are ascertaining their travel history,” said Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s principal secretary, health, while denying the possibility of community transmission of the virus. In Jharkhand, no contact tracking of one of the 14 Covid-19 patients could be established.In Uttarakhand, Abhishek Tripathi, chief operational officer for COVID-19, said they didn’t have exact contact history of seven of the 35 positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-in-india-new-infections-raise-fear-of-community-spread-in-states/story-emS6XdPUuQqjPi5zPLnQ9K.html
12-04-2020||India||Covid-19: How it will change individuals||When it’s over, will things go back to how they were before? And what about us, will we?If the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) had only lasted weeks, and not required a fundamental change in how we live and work, then the answer to those questions would have been in the affirmative.But that is not the case. The Sars-CoV-2 virus still continues to ravage countries; it has reached 185 of the world’s 195 countries and infected 1.7 million people, killing over 100,000. In India, as of Saturday night, it has infected 8,380 and killed 288. It has wreaked havoc on businesses. Some may never recover. Others could take years to.And so, the answer will have to be in the negative. Things will not go back to how they were before. Nor will we. On two of the three previous Sundays since this column began, this writer looked at how the Covid-19 pandemic will change countries and companies. It is only to be expected that it will change people, too.By change, I don’t mean people losing jobs and having to look for new ones. That will happen, and it’s always tragic when it does. I know a lot of people who are worried about their jobs — they aren’t sure they will have them after the Covid-19 crisis has passed. “If this lasts, and we continue to work from home, I won’t be surprised if even the parting is virtual,” a senior executive in a large finance company said when he called last week to find out how I was coping. It is going to be a rare company that doesn’t cut costs after the crisis (many are doing this even during it). It will also be a rare company that doesn’t cut jobs. Many of these people will look for other, similar jobs, and at least some of the good ones will find them — if not immediately, then after a few months. Others will change careers, some even successfully. None of this can be termed real change.The crisis has made some people ask fundamental questions of themselves — of what’s really important to them; how much money they really need to live well; whether their lives need to be as complex and consumption-intensive as they are; if they should drop everything and follow their passion because, you know, Covid-19...A few years ago, I wrote about how many CEOs I knew who had turned 50 were asking themselves the same question: “What is the purpose of my life?” Now, far younger people, including those in their 30s are asking themselves these other questions.It isn’t surprising that they are doing so. Crises, such as the one caused by the still-raging pandemic, make people, especially the ones who do not worry about their lives and livelihoods (but some of them too), look at things differently. They render irrelevant externalities such as societal norms and peer pressure and tradition. They present questions (and problems) in their purest form, shorn of all else.Is this only for the privileged? Perhaps, but I remember that when the job-guarantee scheme was rolled out in the 2000s, it caused a significant asymmetry in labour markets simply because some workers in rural areas were willing to settle for less (much less) if it meant they could stay closer home. Will at least some migrant workers who spent the lockdown in camps look for work closer home when this is over?And so, when this is over, some people will change. Some will change geographies, others will change jobs, and still others will change careers. Some will change diets, others will change other habits, and still others may decide to play Thoreau in their own Waldens (minus the mothers providing food and doing the laundry, hopefully).Different people will answer the questions raised somewhere in the middle of this column, differently — for there are no correct answers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-how-it-will-change-individuals/story-uofoiJjnDF4S1oTInJtMnK.html
12-04-2020||India||HT Salutes: Veteran of 2009 viral pandemic back at it||Dr Ravinder Kumar of Lok Nayak hospital is one of the lucky few from the hospital who gets to go home, but it is hardly without worry. He lives 15 km away in Shalimar Bagh and, as he leaves, calls his wife.“She keeps the door open and the geyser on. In the ante room I have a box. I put my wallet, mobile phone, watch, and anything else in it. From there, I directly go to take a shower,” he said. After that, he cleans his phone. He is not off duty yet. “I am on my phone all the time. This is a big hospital and something or the other keeps happening,” he said. It is his job to ensure that the hospital gets adequate beds, ventilators and the gas pipeline to run them.When the hospital was starting to convert its facilities block by block into Covid-19 isolation wards, his team and he were working at least two shifts a day.They are working on adding 800 beds to the existing 1,200. “I eat when I can, I sleep when I can,” he said“We tell people to follow all precautions – wash their hands, wear masks at all times, properly use a personal protection equipment kit when taking care of the patients. We did this at the time of H1N1 in 2009 too, but as far as I remember the symptoms were milder. More patients are experiencing breathing difficulties with this infection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-salutes-veteran-of-2009-viral-pandemic-back-at-it/story-GMvQNdQIud3Pk1U4RE47BM.html
12-04-2020||India||HT Salutes: ‘Trained to nab those in masks, now makes them for the needy’||Police constable Sunni Meena’s day at the police station begins with dialling 25 senior citizens in the area to find out how they are doing. Before she leaves the police station 12 hours later, she has also stitched nearly 90 masks for donating to the needy.In between these, the 32-year-old has performed her tasks as a guard outside the Greater Kailash police station, as an attendant at the helpdesk and as a data entry operator.Stitch masks, however, was her initiative, one that inspired her colleagues, Gudiya Devi and Neelam, to take it up too.When she returns home, she cooks for her family, ensures the children have completed their homework and are up to date with their online classes. Her husband, a railway employee, had a fractured hand and the burden of household chores has fallen on her. “I am working without weekly offs, but I shouldn’t complain at a time when the country needs me,” she says.Having joined the force in 2009, the constable from Rajasthan has been into all kinds of policing activities, be it at the barricades or while pursuing criminals. “When I was posted at Jamia Nagar police station in 2015, I had posed as a decoy to arrest a kidnapper,” says Meena who was recognised by the deputy commissioner of police for her efforts at the time.But as she embarks on fighting the virus in her own way, Meena knows what she is up against.“When I return home from work, I leave my bag outside for two hours, then spend 30 minutes washing my clothes and bathing and then go back to spraying sanitiser on my bag. My children and husband shouldn’t have to bear the brunt of my choice of work,” Meena says.She worries about her elderly mother, who lives in Rajasthan and is dependent on her financially. “I take time out to call her everyday and without hurry to make sure she is practising social distancing,” says Meena.Meena owned a stitching machine and when the thought of making masks crossed her mind last week, she sought permission of her station house officer, who helped her buy the cloth, and took it to her workplace.Her family is proud of her. “In fact, they wanted me to bring the masks for them. The masks are getting donated sooner than I make them, but I plan to make a few for them soon,” says Meena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-salutes-trained-to-nab-those-in-masks-now-makes-them-for-the-needy/story-iyzAH3BLvMdxnpwveId7xL.html
12-04-2020||India||HT Salutes: ‘Refused to take leave, works 14-hour days’||Ravi Chandran, 56, works as an assistant scrutiny officer in the recruitment cell of the Delhi government’s directorate of education (DoE). His job is to screen applications for school staff. He used to do the job from an office at a plush government building just behind the Vidhan Sabha in north Delhi.Now, from 8am until 10pm, you will find Chandran at the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in east Delhi’s Ghazipur, which has now a shelter for migrant workers since the nationwide lockdown took effect on March 25.Chandran has been deputed as warden of the shelter which houses over 400 people.Inside a tin shed equipped with a table and chair as his office, Chandran is trying to ensure meals are served on time, rooms, toilets and bathrooms disinfected frequently, and social distancing is practised at all times.He is not complaining. When the sub-divisional magistrate recently asked him to take a day off, he actually refused. “It is a scenario that has never occurred in any of our lives. I can’t think of sitting at home now. There is always so much to do,” Chandran said.Some of the inmates have no money, would have nothing to eat and nowhere to go if they were to leave the shelter, Chandran said.He is making plans to take care of that.“I have kept aside some money from my March salary. Now, I am collecting money from my friends and colleagues at a personal level. I will give them Rs 500-1,000 when they leave the facility. The end of the lockdown is haunting them and having been with them for two weeks, I know their concern is genuine,” Chandran said.Last week, he pooled money with his colleagues to buy around 450 masks for everyone in the shelter.“My wife tells me that working 14 hours every day without any offs and living in the danger of contracting the virus is a lot of public service already. I reasoned with her that the government cannot help at such a micro level. You cannot turn a blind eye to an adversity, can you,” Chandran said, stepping out to buy shampoo sachets for some inmates who refused to bathe if they didn’t get shampoo along with the usual soaps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-salutes-refused-to-take-leave-works-14-hour-days/story-UbJrTCGROseO0y4UofomSM.html
12-04-2020||India||HT Salutes: ‘My boys are scared, but I cannot say no to work; it needs me’||Her teenaged sons entreat her not to go to work, but 40-year-old Ranjita Vimal, an Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) worker, turns down their emotional pleas every day.Vimal is part of the Delhi government’s surveillance team for Covid-19 in the Central Delhi district. “My boys are scared because they love me. But I can’t say no to my work; it needs me right now,” Vimal said. “I wear my pink coat and step out every day to do my duty.”For the last few days, she has been conducting door-to-door surveys in the densely populated Sadar Bazaar and Nabi Karim areas — two of the 30 containment zones declared so far. The survey teams have been asked to collect information on people in the area, their contact details, and check if anyone is showing flu-like symptoms. “It’s not easy to extract these basic details. In some places, we face resistance. We have to spend a lot of time to convince them to share these details,” she said. For instance, in Chamelian road in Sadar Bazaar, a family refused to share information. “They wanted us to provide ration, as they had nothing to cook at home. To win their trust, I told them about the Delhi government’s policy to give ration to needy people. I also told them about the nearby school where they can go for meals. It is only then that they shared the details,” she said.At another area, Vimal said she and her co-workers were threatened. “It was scary as 40-50 people told us not to come in a colony. Thankfully, a few people came to our rescue. Many think we are surveying for the National Population Register (NPR). We have to show our ID cards to show we are the Covid-19 survey team,” she said.Every evening, she gets a message from the area’s District Surveillance Office about the area she and her co-workers have to cover the next day. They screen around 150-200 houses daily. “The workload has increased, and so has the risk. All we can do is take precautions,” she said.The risk increases in containment zones, as chances of large number of people being infected by the contagious disease are higher. Every evening, her family keeps a bucket of hot water, and sometimes food, ready before she reaches home. “I go straight to the bathroom. I wash my clothes,” she said. “The work is tiring, but it is very important.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-salutes-my-boys-are-scared-but-i-cannot-say-no-to-work-it-needs-me/story-I5L7rqbgjm0rmYXVOOchGJ.html
12-04-2020||India||Jaan, Jahan: PM Modi weighs lockdown call||Three days before the national lockdown is due to end, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India will have to strike a balance between “jaan” (lives) and “jahan” (the outside world) — a sign that the restrictions will continue in some form to preserve lives as it enforces social distancing, but with some relaxations to resume economic activity and preserve livelihoods. In his third and most expansive interaction with chief ministers since the 21-day lockdown began on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Modi acknowledged on Saturday that many CMs suggested that the lockdown be extended for a fortnight, but did not make a categorical announcement on the issue. However, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee claimed that the PM had agreed to extend the lockdown. Several states such as Odisha, Punjab and Maharashtra have already taken state-specific decisions to extend the curbs. A top government official said that the PM’s formulation meant that the government may move towards a “smart lockdown” — with severe restrictions in affected districts, and partial lifting of restrictions in unaffected districts, along with the opening up of some sectors to meet the economic challenge. A second official said that the government was also considering demarcating the country into three zones — red, yellow and green — depending on the scale of the Covid-19 outbreak.In the interaction, which spanned over four hours, Modi emphasised that he was available 24x7 to assist the states and that the next two to three weeks were critical in determining the impact of India’s efforts to tackle Covid-19 so far. He underlined the gravity of the global situation; said India has enough medicine supplies and was working to ensure adequate protective gear; condemned attacks on health care workers ; acknowledged the need to address economic concerns; and pointed to the possibility of converting the crisis into an opportunity to make India a “self-reliant” economic powerhouse. The PM said that while announcing the lockdown, he had spoken of “jaan hai toh jahaan hai” — if one is alive, there is a world — but now, for a successful and prosperous India, it was time to move to “jaan bhi, jahaan bhi” — life also, world also. Several chief ministers, for their part, expressed the need to extend the lockdown, and offered a review of the situation in their respective states. The CMs placed emphasis on balancing lives and livelihoods, with some asking for a major economic package to tide over the crisis. They also flagged the need for more testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPEs) for health workers. For the government, both at the central and state level, the situation clearly has posed a difficult choice. The demands of public health -- which dictate that an extension of the lockdown is the best way to control the spread of the disease — and the demands of the economy — which is in crisis with supply and demand shocks, closure of factory plants, business becoming unviable, loss of jobs and incomes — have to be reconciled.It is understood that while senior officials are in agreement on the importance of the lockdown to save Indian lives, they also want economic activity to be revived, as ports are jammed with containers and major port cities such as Mumbai and Chennai are hit by the pandemic.Before the interaction with the CMs, on Thursday and Friday, the PM held meetings with his key advisors and empowered committees set up to deal with the crisis. The participants included principal secretary PK Mishra, national security adviser Ajit Doval, principal advisor PK Sinha, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, NITI Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant, and additional secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office AK Sharma. An official familiar with the proceedings of the meeting said that while everyone was in complete agreement that lives had to be saved, they also wanted economic activity to be revived “The easiest call to make is to extend the lockdown, the toughest one is how to lift it so that India does not go into negative growth,” said a senior member of one of the empowered committees. It was in these meetings that a proposal came up to demarcate the country into three zones — red zones to define districts and areas which have a high number of cases and will remain under a lockdown; yellow zones to define districts with a limited number of cases but which will be monitored and where limited movement will be allowed; green zones to define areas with no cases which may see greater normalcy, said the second official cited above who is familiar with the discussions. “Remember over 400 districts are not hit by the infection yet. One must also not forget that the harvesting season begins from April 14 and India is a largely agrarian economy ,” the official added.To be sure, such a decision has not been taken -- but it is an indication of the various options being considered by the government. Explaining the possible meaning of the PM’s “jaan” and “jahan” statement, a key economic ministry official familiar with discussions in the government said: “The government’s thinking is to continue the value chain under an insulated system for essential goods and services that are the lifeline of the nation. They are medicines, medical equipment, medical care, sanitation items, farm produce, processed food and groceries.”The government is particularly focused on agriculture, with the PM telling the CMs that modifications in the Agricultural Market Produce Committee Act will enable the smoother sale of farm produce. Another official with an economic ministry said, “It is a challenge to implement social distancing and hygiene for agricultural workers. An ideal work model could be prepared soon by the agricultural ministry and the labour ministry in consultation with other stakeholders and states. Besides, a smooth logistical system — farm to fork — will also be required. The government agencies are working towards that.” Another option discussed at the meeting of the PM with CMs was the idea of “lock-in” — where select factories would resume functioning, but workers would be under strict supervision and live within the factory complex in a sanitised environment. Public health experts believe, however, that notwithstanding the economic argument, the lockdown is a necessity. NK Mehra, former dean of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said, “The positivity rate of the Sars-CoV-2 virus infection as well as the number of deaths in India has seen a consistent rise in the last one week. Under the circumstance, an extension of the lockdown for at least another two weeks is critical to drive down the virus’s reproductive numbers. The country could otherwise pay a very heavy price if the disease enters stage three.” Stage three refers to community transmission — which some experts believe India has already entered, an assertion the government rejects. The CMs outlined their views in the meeting, with the expectation of support and concessions from the Centre. Punjab CM Amarinder Singh asked for special concessions for industry and agriculture sectors, reiterated the need for ramping up testing facilities, and expediting the supply of rapid test kits. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee asked the PM to spend at least 6% of the GDP to fight the crisis, and announce a National Economic and Health Package worth ₹10 lakh crore for the state governments. Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel suggested that state goverments be allowed to decide whether to carry out economic activities in their respective states. Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray spoke of the problems faced by the migrant workers. Telangana CM K Chandrashekhar Rao underlined how revenues in his state had dipped to 10% of what it was before the lockdown, making public finance situation precarious. Many CMs asked that contributions to CM Relief Fund — like contributions to the PM-Cares fund — should be considered a part of Corporate Social Responsibility expenditure of companies, while others asked for a relaxation on deficit limits provided under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaan-jahan-pm-weighs-lockdown-call/story-64wIN6WeD4L0eenNrjmSvN.html
12-04-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis: Delhi case count over 1,000; 33 zones now under watch||Five people died due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the Capital on Saturday and the total number of infections crossed 1,000, making Delhi the second state after Maharashtra and the second city after Mumbai to cross the four-digit mark for positive patients.The number of new cases on Saturday was lower than Friday, when the city recorded its highest single-day jump in infections, driven largely by new patients who had been to the Nizamuddin area building of the Tablighi Jamaat, a religious group. The total number of infections now stands at 1,069.The government’s daily health bulletin did not give details of how many new cases were from the Nizamuddin cluster on Saturday, but added a new classification – “under special operations” – that accounted for 128 of the 166 new cases.Officials said the total “special operations” cases (712) included people who were either present in the Nizamuddin gatherings or their contacts.Among the five deaths, four were patients above the age of 60 -- a 79-year-old woman from Karol Bagh, a 60-year-old woman from Sadar Bazar, a 65-year-old man from Azad Market, and a 68-year-old man from Tamil Nadu -- with comorbid conditions such as kidney disease, heart disease, and hypertension. The fifth was a 44-year-old woman from Malkaganj with no known underlying health condition.Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the Capital leaves no room for lifting the lockdown – the nationwide curbs are scheduled to last till April 14 – and letting people move freely would lead to an “explosion of cases”.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal conveyed this position to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a video conference along with CMs from other states. The PM is likely to make an announcement on the matter soon.The Capital also added three more containment zones, taking the total number of areas with a hard lockdown to 33. Varying from as small as buildings to entire neighbourhood blocks, these are areas where people are not allowed to go outdoors and all essential needs are home-delivered by administration officials.The new containment zone were in south district’s Deoli area, west Delhi’s Mansarovar Garden in Rajouri, and north Delhi’s Jahangirpuri. In Deoli, eight cases were detected. Officials did not give details about the other two zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-case-count-over-1k-33-zones-now-under-watch/story-8K6nCfYTHN9HmNjsMad2NK.html
12-04-2020||India||Andhra deputy CM’s shocker on Jamaat members, days after Jagan’s peace appeal||Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister K Narayana Swamy on Saturday accused the members of Tablighi Jamaat of spreading the Covid-19 among others by moving freely everywhere and not cooperating with the doctors in getting treatment.Speaking to reporters in the temple town of Tirupati, Narayana Swamy allegedly pointed out some food habits and unhygienic lifestyles of the Jamaat members, based on some videos doing the rounds on social media.The deputy chief minister said there would not have been more than 25-26 Covid-19 positive cases in Andhra Pradesh, but for the Tablighi members who had come from Markaz and spread the disease in the state.“I have nothing against Muslim minorities. They can pray to their god. Allah is benevolent. But they do all sorts of dirty things, do not follow hygiene in eating and do not even maintain cleanliness. Because of their habits, they brought the Corona disease to this level,” he said.The deputy chief minister’s comments come within a week of YSR Congress party president and chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s statement defending the Tablighi Jamaat conference in Nizamuddin.“It is not correct to pin the blame on a particular religious congregation for the spread of Covid-19 in the country, as same could happen even in any such meeting in any other religious congregation like that of Ravi Shankar or Jaggi Vasudev or Mata Amritanandamayi,” Jagan said in message through electronic media.Narayana Swamy, however, alleged that Jamaat members were not cooperating for treatment. “They moved around shops and streets and spread the disease. I request them to cooperate with the doctors and get cured, so that it doesn’t spread to others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-deputy-cm-s-shocker-on-jamaat-attendees-days-after-jagan-s-appeal/story-sRPp3NGFtOZx1o1YJdz1FK.html
12-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Fisheries, marine sectors exempted from curbs; social distancing a must||The Union government has exempted fisheries and the marine food industry from the coronavirus disease (Covid-10) lockdown, recognising them as part of the farm-to-fork supply chain. according to instructions issued in a fresh list of exemptions on Saturday, Fisheries is a component of the agriculture sector and a key source of income. Fisheries and aquaculture production contribute around 1% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) and over 5% of the agricultural GDP. Exemptions include maintenance of fisheries, harvesting, processing, and packaging. They also covers cold chain storage, sales and marketing; hatcheries and movement of fish and marine food products.“As specified in the lockdown measures, social distancing and proper hygiene practices must be maintained in each of the above activities,” an order by the Union home ministry, exempting the fisheries sector, stated. Keeping in view the potential of the aquaculture, inland fisheries, coastal and marine fisheries sectors, the Centre will continue administering schemes under the umbrella “Blue Revolution Scheme” for overall development of fisheries, an official in the animal husbandry department said.The Centre has over the past week taken a series of steps to shore up the agriculture sector in the backdrop of the continuing lockdown.On Friday, the government recommended that states suspend certain provisions of their respective Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts for three months to allow farmers to sell their harvest from multiple locations and to any buyer. The APMC Act regulates buying and selling of farm produce in about 5,000 mandis, or farm markets, across the country, which fall in the domain of the state governments. The Act empowers states to notify markets to cater to a specific area and farmers can only sell in their designated markets. “Farmers should be able to sell to any buyer. Otherwise, all farmers of an area will converge on a single market, which will obstruct the principle of social distancing,” agriculture minister NS Tomar had said in a video press conference. “Therefore, states have been requested to sidestep this mandi Act for three months,” the minister said. Procurement of wheat is due to start on April 15. The Centre has also asked states to start procuring 25% of pulses and oilseeds under the Centre’s price support scheme. On April 9, the agriculture ministry issued orders, invoking the market intervention scheme, which will allow the Centre to compensate horticulture farmers for a dip in wholesale prices and damage to harvested fruit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fisheries-marine-sectors-exempted-from-curbs-social-distancing-a-must/story-SKE6Ni99X5NbAMwSB0W1DL.html
12-04-2020||India||Covid-19: IIM students to help govt panels||The government has reached out to the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) to get MBA students to help the recently-formed empowered groups of secretaries. Eleven such empowered groups have been formed to combat different aspects of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. An internal note for the secretaries of the empowered groups, prepared by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) said that the government has started discussions with the IIMs and other premier institutions of India such as IITs and IISC about “how these partnerships can be leveraged to support the efforts of the Government in fighting the Covid-19 crisis”.“One of the outcomes of these discussions is that the IIMs can provide MBA interns to support the empowered groups in data analysis and evidence-based policy inputs,” the note said.Each empowered group might be assigned two or three such interns in key supporting roles as data and evidence play a crucial role in determining India’s strategy to contain the virus.The government has also said that the empowered group will need to appoint a nodal officer on its behalf to assign tasks and get outputs as required by the group from the interns who will be working remotely on the work assigned to them.The entire collaboration will be managed through different channels created for each interested empowered group using the Slack app, which allows for group chats.The secretaries of the empowered groups have been asked to inform if they would require the support of the MBA interns. Once the DoPT gets the requirements, it will assign the shortlisted interns to the groups.The Narendra Modi government on March 29 established ten empowered groups and a key strategic task force to look into all aspects of the pandemic. The measure turns at least 68 senior bureaucrats into a consorted planning and implementing machinery as India fights against the disease that continues to kill thousands across the world.The groups have been assigned tasks such as “the medical emergency management plan” or ensuring “availability of hospitals, isolation and quarantine facilities, disease surveillance and testing and critical care training” and “facilitating supply chain and logistics management for availability of necessary items such as food and medicine”.A six-member Strategic Task Force has also been formed, which will exclusively deal with issues related to the three-week national lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 25.Afzal Amanullah, former parliamentary affairs secretary said, “It’s always good to engage management students from India’s premier institutes. They are trained for this purpose and it will help them to be a part of the government’s strategy to contain this unprecedented pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iim-students-to-help-govt-panels/story-019eUcJ4b2BL0SSZrxPwiP.html
12-04-2020||India||Coronavirus lockdown in India: CMs request extension of curbs, economic push||Prime Minister Narendra Modi told chief ministers who took part in a meeting with him by video conference on Saturday that the lockdown for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will be in force until April 30, a 16-day extension, with selective easing of curbs to revive economic activity in part, CMs who took part in the meeting said. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and her Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray said the lockdown will continue beyond April 14, when it is due to end, until the end of the month. Goa CM Pramod Sawant said the PM would address the nation and announce some guidelines aimed at reviving economic activity in part.A majority of the chief ministers on Saturday advocated an extension of the lockdown until the end of April except Andhra Pradesh’s Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, who said the emergency measure should be restricted only to so-called red zones. Some CMs said lockdown should be enforced in the red zones even beyond April 30.While I support the steps being taken by the Centre to contain the Covid-19 situation, I also feel that the wheel of the economy should continue to run, if not with full speed, but to the extent of providing basic necessities to the people and in non-red zones,” Reddy said. “Millions of workers would not get salaries due to lack of industrial operations and the revenues of the state would see a steep fall, as a result of which it cannot implement any development and welfare schemes,” the Andhra chief minister said.Red zones are areas that contain Covid-19 hotspots or containment areas, whose residents are confined indoors to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread. An area free of the virus is a yellow zone. A neighbourhood that hasn’t reported even a single Covid-19 case is designated a green zone. About half the 718 districts in India have not reported any Covid -19 case, according to data released by health ministry. “The lockdown for the next two weeks will be different from what is being implemented currently. Agricultural and industrial sectors will be given relaxation. Government offices will function with partial strength and the additional guidelines stated by the PM would be issued in the next couple of days,” said Karnataka CM B S Yediyurappa At the meeting with the PM, the CMs of some opposition-ruled states raised the issue of shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers, the adverse impact of Covid-19 on medium and small industries and also sought additional funds to fight the pandemic.Banerjee urged the PM to spend at least 6% of GDP on fighting the crisis and announce a National Economic and Health Package worth Rs 10 lakh crore for state governments; a Rs. 1.7 lakh crore package announced by the Centre was less than 1% of GDP, she said. The Rajasthan and Telangana CMs also sought similar financial assistance to the states, noting that state revenues had shrunk because of the Covid-19 lockdown. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and his Jharkhand counterpart Hemant Soren sought the immediate release of compensation for a shortfall in Goods and Service Tax (GST) revenues and increase the fiscal deficit limit from the present 3% to 4% under the Fiscal and Budget Responsibility Act (FBRM). These CMS also asked the Centre to allow agriculture and allies activities during lockdown, distribution of subsdised rationx for three months and free storage for procurement of foodgrains. They also sought the expansion of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) to include agricultural activities during the extension of lockdown till April end. Soren sought an increase in MGNREGS wages. While supporting the call for extension of lockdown, Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, suggested a “lock-in” concept whereby factory workers could perform their jobs work and stay on in the premises until the lockdown is lifted, officials in the chief minister’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cms-request-extension-of-curbs-economic-push/story-cqiH2bQLdZAHeMb6OBkroI.html
12-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: Health ministry hails timing of lockdown||Union health ministry officials defended the nationwide lockdown on Saturday and said the country would have had close to 120,000 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases by April 15 if people moved as usual, giving out data not based on any epidemiological premise, but , as the ministry put it, statistical analysis. The health ministry’s calculations were, according to joint secretary Lav Agarwal, based on the cumulative growth rate (CGR) observed prior to the lockdown – a figure the official said was 28% when the nation was forced to shut down on March 25.“This is merely health ministry’s internally done statistical rate of growth-based analysis. It is not a study done by the ICMR or any other technical body,” said Agarwal.The ministry’s projections involved other scenarios, such as taking into account the peak CGR of 41% observed till now. “If 41% CGR (which has been the highest spike in cases noticed so far) is taken into account in a no-restrictions scenario, “the number of cases would have been 8.2 lakh till April 15,” Agrawal said.The official, who made the statement during the daily briefing, did not give details about the methodology. “This goes on to prove that lockdown and other preventive measures are a must to keep the numbers low. The Indian government is working to the extent of being over prepared. All critical supplies are being assured to states, and there are already 586 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals that will give us additional 104,613 isolation beds, and 11,836 intensive care unit (ICU) beds,” said Agarwal.Disease growth rates, however, are influenced by several other factors that need to be taken into account, such as the disease’s basic reproduction number (how infectious a particular illness is), social contact patterns etc.One of the preferred methods is SIR modeling, which looks at how much of the population will fall in three categories: suspected, infected and recovered, and takes into account factors that can have an impact on the growth rates. CGR calculations take into account none of that – they are a basic calculation of a rate of growth over a period of time. “It is important to understand the assumptions behind the modeling. We do not know what is the doubling rate, what are the factors related to host, environment or agents. In the absence of these, assuming counterfactual scenarios such as depicted in this are very difficult to imagine,” said Giridhar R Babu, professor and head, Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.To be sure, the lockdown will have disrupted social contact patterns. A statistical projection – involving established epidemiological tools – using case data till March 22 by a group of academicians in three American university and the Delhi School of Economics showed that India would have had between 97,000 to 1.3 million cases by May 15 if no restrictions were put in place.The health ministry officials at Saturday’s briefing asserted the government’s containment plans were being implemented to the last detail on ground, and provided 100% result.The state, district administration and frontline workers coordinated their efforts by utilizing their existing Smart City Integrated with Command and Control Centre (ICCC) as “war rooms”, Agarwal said. “In these containment zones, Urban Primary Health centers were roped in and 1,248 teams were deployed; each team had 2 workers including ANMs/ASHA/AWW reaching out to 9.3 lakh of people through household screening… about 2,500 people were found to be symptomatic and made to under testing. The strategy adopted by Agra is being shared with other states as a best practice,” said Agarwal.The joint secretary added that the government was “ensuring there is no shortage of supplies of critical items which includes PPEs, N95 masks, testing kits, medicines and ventilators in any state”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-hails-timing-of-lockdown/story-G6fCJUQPb1Qw3cHW9LAVdL.html
12-04-2020||India||Coronavirus in India: As lockdown extension possibility looms, ministers to go to office from Monday||Union ministers and all senior officials will start attending office again from Monday, government functionaries told HT, marking a step towards the resumption of normalcy in government establishment even as the lockdown is likely to be extended.According to two officials who refused to be named, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked all ministers to start working from office from Monday, a move that is also aimed at instilling confidence among citizens about how government establishments are on their way back to normalcy even as social distancing and other health norms will remain firmly in place.Senior functionaries said that officers of joint secretary rank and above will be mandatorily working from office.“In addition, one-third of essential staff will come,” said a secretary-level officer.While the non-essential staff has not been asked to come, the essential staff who stay near the office will be asked to be present in person, according to the official. There will also be a rotation system for the essential staff to ensure everyone gets a chance to stay at home and also meet the obligation of coming to office.Since the lockdown was announced by Modi on March 24, many ministries have been working at merely 3-5% of their actual strength as employees were confined to home.While most of the staff stayed home, top officials often came to office especially since the financial year was coming to an end, the official said.Ministries had to file their expenses and submit vouchers to the virtual expenditure logbook of the finance ministry to show how much money they have actually spent in the FY19-20. “Closure of accounts is of vital importance in the government system. Otherwise, the release of money would get stuck. So, only a handful of officials would come to office—which is hardly 3-5% of our usual strength to primarily work on the annual closure of accounts,” said the official. Another officer added that while the top brass of the ministries was physically not present, all of them have been working from home and had a pressing schedule, especially with regards to handling the crisis arising out of the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak and ensuring the government’s aid reached to the right beneficiaries.Officers held their meetings through the NIA-promoted video conference platform and files were moved and cleared through the e-office tool. The e-office, which came into existence in 2015, is an online platform for clearing files and fixing accountability of bureaucrats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministers-to-go-to-office-from-monday/story-g9OULPZTrpJQFMfm8rWEmK.html
12-04-2020||India||Migrant workers’ stir turns violent||Stranded migrant workers turned violent in Surat on Friday night, allegedly torching vegetable carts and damaging vehicles while demanding the payment of wages and permission to return home, according to government officials and the city police on Saturday.At least 81 people, mostly migrant workers from Orissa, were arrested by the Surat city police on charges of rioting and violating the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. This is second such incident in Surat since the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).On March 30, over 90 migrant labourers were arrested in Surat for allegedly attacking police personnel while protesting against being barred from returning to their villages.According to police officers, at least 100 people, all migrant workers, came out on Friday night on the streets of Surat’s Laskana area, where they torched at least five vegetable carts and damaged three vehicles. “At least five hand carts were torched and stones were pelted on locals by the workers who came out on streets fearing that the lockdown would be extended. As soon as police came to know about the incident, additional police force was sent to spot and situation was brought under control by 8.15pm. Also, 35 labourers were detained,” said RB Brahmabhatt, Surat’s commissioner of police (CP).He said no one sustained injuries and, after the incident, more than 400 policemen were deployed in Laskana and adjacent localities, Diamond Nagar and Vipul Nagar, where a large number of migrant labourers live.“After the situation was brought under control, around 45 more people were detained, and a total of 81 people were arrested. They were booked under section 148 (rioting), and 270 (whoever is likely to spread infection) of Indian Penal Code and for violation of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897,” Brahmabhatt added.Bansidhar Lenaka, general secretary of Jagganathpuri Charitable Trust, which looks into the issues of migrant workers in the industrial city, said that the incident was unfortunate and showed the growing anxiety among stranded labourers due to the lockdown. “There are around 25,000 people, just form Orissa, who are working in embroidery units and textile factories. Each person earns around between Rs 8,000 to Rs 12,000 and since the lockdown, half of the workers have not got their salaries and others have got only 50% or lesser amount,” Lenaka said.He said that after 15 days of the lockdown, there is almost no money left with workers, who are struggling to meet their basic expenses. Many workers are on the verge of being thrown out of the homes as they have not paid rent for the past one month and also need money to send to their families back home, he added.The Surat factories association held a meeting with district authorities apprising them about the ground situation. “We got nothing other than assurances,” Lenaka said, adding that the administration should understand the plight of the workers, who are desperate for money.Surat district collector Dhaval Patel said food was being provided to workers free of cost in six to seven shelters and five NGOs were distributing food to more than 5,000 people, twice a day.“The issue is more psychological one.Ninety percent of the migrant workers who took to the streets are from Ganjam district of Orissa. They had booked buses in the last few days to go back home. They are afraid that if the lockdown is extended they won’t be able to reach home,” said Patel.(With inputs from HTCs and agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-stir-turns-violent/story-WIwF3Ye1YxVtlaT8U8jKiN.html
12-04-2020||India||Donation to PM-Cares, not states’ relief fund, to count as CSR: Govt||New Delhi Companies’ contributions to the chief minister’s relief fund or the state relief fund towards the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will not count as corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending, but those to the newly established Prime Minister ‘s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-CARES) fund or to the State Disaster Management Authority will, the Centre said on Saturday.A clarification to the effect by the ministry of corporate affairs triggered opposition allegations that the Centre intended to corner all the money that companies had earmarked for CAR activities -- a charge the government brushed aside.“If CM Relief Fund is included, CSR money will not flow outside of the industrial states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.Industrial states will consume about 57% of the about Rs 15,000 annual CSR funds and non-industrial states like Bihar, Bengal, Orissa and the Northeast would remain high and dry,” a government official said, requesting anonymity. Criticising the Union government, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sitaram Yechury had said: “Corner all CSR monies for his personally named fund & deny States - who are in the frontline of combatting #COVID19 -- these funds. This is “Cooperative Federalism”? Amend Schedule 7 of Companies Act to permit State govts to access these funds which could save millions of lives.” The schedule specifies government-approved CSR activities, which include eradicating hunger, poverty and malnutrition, and promoting healthcare, education and gender equality. It also covers activities related to environmental sustainability, protection of national heritage, art and culture, training to promote sports, contributing to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund and disaster management.Companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, or a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or a net profit of Rs 5 crore or more in the immediately preceding financial year are mandatorily required to spend 2% of their average net profit of the preceding three years on CSR. These activities are governed by the Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 and the government specifies activities to be undertaken by a company under CSR.In a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers, the ministry of corporate affairs said corporate donations to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund or State Relief Fund for combating Covid-19 had not been included in Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013 and contributions to the funds shall not qualify as admissible CSR expenditure.MCA said the FAQs were issued after various stakeholders sent representations seeking a clarification on what expenditure to advance the fight against the pandemic would qualify as CSR spending.There had been confusion over the eligibility of donations made towards combating Covid-19 to be counted as CSR expenditure after the Centre issued two separate circulars on the matter.“Keeping in view of the spread of novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) in India, its declaration as pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), and decision of Government of India to treat this as a notified disaster, it is hereby clarified that spending of CSR funds for COVID-19 is eligible CSR activity,” the first circular on March 23 said.On March 28, MCA issued a clarification that “any contribution made to the PM CARES Fund shall qualify as CSR expenditure” under the Companies Act 2013. The same day the government had announced the setting up of the public charitable trust under the oversight of the Prime Minister.While CSR is a board-driven process and the board of a company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor CSR activities based on the recommendation of its CSR committee, the government specifies broad areas eligible to be counted as CSR activities.According to an industry estimate, about Rs 50,000 crore has been spent on CSR since 2014-15 and around Rs 30,000 crore still remains unspent. On average, companies’ annual CSR funds are to the tune of Rs 15,000 crore.CSR funds of several companies remain unspent for lack of eligible projects. Minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Singh Thakur told Lok Sabha on March 16 that a high-level committee on CSR had recommended that unspent CSR money be transferred to a separate designated account created for the purpose. “Such unspent amount, and the interest earned thereon, be spent within a period of three to five years, failing which the same be transferred to a fund to be specified by the central government which may be used for innovative, high-impact projects related to activities listed in schedule VII,” Thakur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/donation-to-pm-cares-not-states-relief-fund-to-count-as-csr-govt/story-6EnOFfBEQPZYkqMkbs4V5J.html
12-04-2020||India||With 180 Covid-19 new cases, Rajasthan records big one-day jump||Rajasthan reported its highest single-day addition of Covid-19 cases, 180, on Saturday, with 65 of these being identified in Ramganj, Jaipur, which has become a hot spot for the infection. Curfew has been imposed in Ramganj and nine other police station areas in Jaipur from where coronavirus cases have been reported. A total of 1500 policemen including three companies of Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) and 900 home guards have been deployed and the entire walled city has been sealed.At the core of the cluster of infections is a 45-year-old resident of Ramganj who returned from Oman on March 12. He was asked by health officials to stay in home quarantine but continued to meet people and even offered prayers at a local mosque.He tested positive on March 26 and curfew was imposed in Ramganj, a crowded neighbourhood of nearly 500,000. On March 29, the number of cases in Jaipur was 10 . By March 30, the count doubled to 20, with relatives and contacts of the man testing positive. By April 6, Jaipur recorded 100 cases. As of Saturday night, the case count in Jaipur was 301. Across Rajasthan, the count is 700. The administration is racing to contain the virus. Door-to-door screening is being done in Ramganj even though health workers have complained that residents are not cooperating. To make it easy for the residents to be tested, the health department has set-up six centres. Jaipur collector Jogaram has also issued orders warning of action against those who resist testing. Since the first case, another 150 cases have been reported from Ramganj -- all have been traced back to the super-spreader who came back from Oman. Health minister Raghu Sharma has said that a spike in cases is expected as the health workers are carrying out intensive screening and testing in Ramganj. The entire area has been divided into 30 clusters. “21 samples will be taken from each cluster and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test will be done. Initially 630 samples will be taken and if situation is found to be grave, then more samples will be taken,” explained Sharma.Jogaram said this is being complemented by screening, which is being done across the district. He said that at east 1,000 teams of health workers have fanned out across the district. Till April 1, cases were reported from 11 of 33 districts in the state. Bhilwara with 26 cases and Jaipur with 21 cases were the main hot spots. The state has reported eight deaths so far.From April 1, cases of Tablighi Jamaat members testing positive for the virus started coming to the fore. The health department officials said there were around 450 Jamaatis from Rajasthan who attended the Markaz event in Delhi in March. Of the total 700, over 60% have been traced back to the Jamaatis, said a state health department official. Chief secretary DB Gupta said the Bhilwara model could not be replicated in Ramganj due to the congested area. In Bhilwara, where the group affected was urban, social distancing was meticulously followed, he said. But Ramganj with a population of 2.6 lakh presented a challenge. The walled city has a population of 15 lakh. He said the virus had spread to several other districts after the Tablighi Jamaati members returned. He said the government has appealed to Tablighi Jamaatis to not hide and come for testing and slowly they are responding.By April 1, 24 of 33 districts were showing cases. Apart from Jaipur and Bhilwara, Banswara, Bikaner, Churu, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Jhunjhunu, Tonk, Kota and Jhalawar have emerged as the new areas of concern for the government.On April 1, Banswara, Bikaner Jaisalmer, Tonk, Kota and Jhalawar reported no cases.

12-04-2020||India||Coronavirus in India: Several targets missed, still no sign of rapid testing kits||The rapid testing kits, which India was expecting to be delivered on April 5, and then April 8 or 9, will not be here at least until early next week, delaying the country’s efforts to use these to test widely in containment zones that have seen a lot of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases . India ordered 500,000 kits from Chinese suppliers on March 30. Several states are waiting for these kits to arrive, and be distributed to them, so that they can start testing. The states have also been allowed to procure kits on their own -- it wasn’t immediately clear which have, and how many at that. Separately, the state-owned HLL Lifecare is set to start production of 20,000 rapid testing kits a day at its Manesar factory on Monday, Hindustan Times reported on Saturday. In anticipation of the arrival of the kits, India issued an advisory on starting rapid antibody testing on April 4, and revised the testing guidelines on April 9 to include rapid testing of all symptomatic individuals in hotspot areas with symptoms at least a week old. After the April 5 date passed without delivery, the Indian Council Of Medical Research (ICMR) announced in a press briefing that the manufacturers had assured it that the kits would be delivered either by April 8 or 9. That deadline too passed. “The kits haven’t reached yet but could reach anytime now,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry, in a briefing on Friday, April 10.Unlike the RT-PCR test that detects the virus’s genetic material (RNA) in throat swabs to diagnose a current Covid-19 infection, rapid antibody tests indicate both current and older infections by highlighting the presence of antibodies in blood. The result takes 15-20 minutes.ICMR first issued a notice seeking applications for delivery of one million rapid testing kits on March 27, but a day later revised it down by half because of the lack of availability. On Saturday, Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head, epidemiology, and communicable diseases, ICMR, said, “The manufacturers assured us that we will get them in a day or two. As and when we get these kits, we will deploy these on field and start rapid testing.”While the health ministry did not attribute any reason for the delay, people familiar with the matter said there is an acute shortage of rapid testing kits globally. The market is dominated by Chinese manufacturers that are producing these kits and they have been getting orders from all over the world.“There are several problems -- only 5-6 manufacturers have the requisite export license, and the local government has put a cap on the quantity that can be exported. And these handful of manufacturers are trying to fulfil the entire world’s demand,”added one of these people, who works in the testing business and spoke on condition of anonymity. “What affects supplies is also too many agencies from within the country trying to place orders. It’s not just the Indian government, but also I guess state governments and other labs trying to place orders from a limited pool of suppliers which is delaying the delivery.”Experts say rapid testing has to be done as soon as possible to find out the prevalence of the disease in India.  Dr Lalit Kant, a senior infectious disease expert, said: “The currently used test – PCR-- tells us who are currently sick. We are seeing only the tip of the iceberg. The antibody detection blood test will identify people who already have been infected, even those with mild or no symptoms. It will also help us to know how many have been able to fight off the infection and have become what is called ‘corona-blocker’.”“These tests are expected to be very economical, simple and give results within 15-20 minutes. It is being used for contact tracing in some countries. Indian health system has lot of experience in doing such tests, like the ones for dengue, chikungunya, so it will be easy to ramp up the screening. Great tool for surveillance, and building up epidemiological data,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/several-targets-missed-still-no-sign-of-rapid-testing-kits/story-Mu8HX2wB2Z9ZsFV3lGqzyJ.html
12-04-2020||India||Pandemic unites warring factions in Kerala||It is often said a tragedy brings out the best and the worst in people. The southern state of Kerala has two classic examples to offer in this regard-- sworn enemies are rubbing shoulders in community kitchens in north Kerala.The pandemic outbreak has brought friends and foes together in north Kerala’s Thalassery in Kannur district, the hotspot of CPI(M)-RSS clashes, which have claimed more than 200 lives in last three decades. Leaving behind their bitter rivalry, workers of both parties have joined hands to run community kitchens in the coastal town, also home to CM Pinarayi Vijayan, CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan and many other leaders.The new-found bonhomie has evinced much interest in political circles. While cutting vegetables for sambhar or cooking rice, workers of Sewa Bharati, the social wing of the RSS, and Democratic Youth Federation of India, CPI(M), the youth wing of the CPI(M) as well as workers of the Youth League and the Youth Congress rub shoulders. Before this, in certain pockets of Thalassery, both RSS and CPI(M) have fiercely guarded their party villages and their political opponents have been unwelcome here.“It is no time for politics. Our CM has given an open call to engage everyone in the community kitchens. Our only concern is to feed empty stomachs. We don’t go by the colour of flags here,” said Thalassery MLA AN Shamseer. And the young sub-collector Asif K Yousef is co-ordinating everything by roping in all hues and colours of politics. “Feeding the poor is a national movement. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said helping others is the best thing to do in trying times,” said BJP leader MP Sumesh.Meanwhile, the Kerala police on Saturday arrested three more workers of the ruling CPI(M) party for allegedly vandalising the house of a girl student who was in quarantine in Thannithod in Pathanamthitta district. Earlier police had arrested three persons and three others were on the run.They attacked the house, alleging that her father violated quarantine norms and came out frequently. The incident that took place on Tuesday had embarrassed the government and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had promised strict action against offenders.The police said the girl who studies in Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu had returned home recently and quarantined herself as instructed by health officials. Her father, a cable TV operator, had isolated her in a room and would go out to collect food items, which angered many people of the area. Initially, they sent a message on Whatsapp threatening them, but when the family filed a complaint their house was attacked, the police said.After the attack, the girl had filed a complaint with the Chief Minister and sought police protection for her family. “It should not have happened in a state like Kerala. Offenders never deserve any sympathy,” the CM had said. Later the CPI(M) Pathanamthitta district committee had suspended the accused men from the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-unites-warring-factions-in-kerala/story-GyNpqZktKmhZrmmga8W6mK.html
12-04-2020||India||Six new coronaviruses in bats discovered in Myanmar||Scientists have discovered six new coronaviruses among bats in Myanmar. These coronaviruses are very different from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov-1), Middle East Respiratory (MERS) or SARS-CoV-2 which are known to have jumped over from bats and infected humans.A team of scientists from Smithsonian’s Global Health Program and Conservation Biology Institute said that most of these viruses were found in guano (accumulated faeces) samples harvested by local people in Myanmar for nutrient-rich manure. Whether these new coronaviruses are dangerous for humans is yet to be assessed.The team focused on sites in Myanmar where humans live in close contact with wildlife like Hlawga National Park in Yangon. From May 2016 to August 2018, the team collected 750 saliva, guano and faecal samples from 11 bat species in these areas. Coronaviruses were detected in 48 samples.“Guano samples accounted for the majority of positives, suggestive of an important transmission route for CoV shedding from bats and a possible risk to people during the act of guano harvesting,” the study published in PLOS ONE journal on Thursday said, adding that in future viral detection in guano samples can be made through non-invasive methods and doesn’t require people handling bats directly.“Viral pandemics remind us how closely human health is connected to the health of wildlife and the environment. Worldwide, humans are interacting with wildlife with increasing frequency, so the more we understand about these viruses in animals -- what allows them to mutate and how they spread to other species -- the better we can reduce their pandemic potential,” said Marc Valitutto, a former wildlife veterinarian with the Smithsonian’s Global Health Program and lead author of the study in a statement. Authors also said the ongoing land-use change in Myanmar could be a prominent driver of zoonotic diseases in future.Despite small sample sizes, the study managed to detect six coronaviruses in insectivorous bats. “Given the potential consequences for public health in light of expanding human activity, continued surveillance for coronaviruses is warranted, especially in other species and human-wildlife interfaces,” the study concluded, adding that over 3,200 CoVs occur in bats, most of which are still undiscovered.The study said that bats are increasingly being recognised as natural reservoirs of viruses and they have a unique capacity to carry and transmit viruses due to some of their biological traits like the ability of sustained flight, the potential for long-distance dispersal and adaptation to semi-urban habitation. Bats are known to be carriers of the hemorrhagic Ebola, Marburg filovirus and the Nipah virus, apart from viruses that caused SARS, MERS and Covid-19 diseases. But bats are also extremely essential to ecosystems for seed dispersal, pollination, control of insect populations, among others.Scientists suggest a “One Health” approach to keep zoonotic spillover at bay. One Health, according to the World Health Organization, involves the control of zoonoses, antibiotic resistance, etc., by focusing on the interactions between humans, animals and plants.“In a country like India, people live cheek by jowl, not just with each other, but also with livestock (including both four-legged and two-legged), as well as in areas of high biodiversity. Such close proximity means that the diversity of pathogens that humans are potentially exposed to is very high. To understand the risks from these pathogens, it is thus necessary for us to adopt a One Health approach, where we have to work in large interdisciplinary teams that can investigate not only human and animal health, but also the links with changes in the natural environment,” said Abi Tamim Vanak, fellow, Wellcome Trust and senior fellow at Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment.Around 60–75% of emerging infectious diseases consist of zoonotic diseases; more than 70% of those originate in wildlife species.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/myanmar-six-new-coronaviruses-in-bats-discovered/story-cbcVqQgkBgQZx3n8YDrjdN.html
12-04-2020||India||Respiratory, organ failure and heart attacks killing Covid patients: Study||People with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) may die of a heart attack, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure or septic shock, but the cause of death is irrefutably Covid-19, scientists and clinicians have said, debunking attempts by some states to attribute fatalities to other reasons.“Covid-19 kills by respiratory failure and cardiac arrest, just like any other severe pneumonia. The difference is lack of immunity (against the new virus) and greater severity (of infection),” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.Follow latest updated on coronavirus here Earlier this week, a 78-year-old Italian woman in Gurugram’s Medanta hospital was classified as a Covid-19 fatality after she died due to a heart attack, days after test results showed that she had managed to clear the Sars-Cov-2 infection for which she had been hospitalised. “She died of multi-organ failure following a cardiac arrest, her kidney function was deranged when she was admitted to the hospital, and she was close to 80 years old; the mortality rate in such people with Sars-Cov-2 infection is close to 15%. The cause of death was Covid-19 because persistent infection is what led to the multi-organ failure,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, anaestheology and critical care, Medata-The Medicity. The woman died on Thursday while 13 other Italians who were in her group recovered and were discharged form hospital two weeks ago.Data from several countries that have been hit hard by the pandemic shows one in five people who contract Covid-19 become very ill. Chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes are the top three risk factors associated with potentially life-threatening complications.Also read: India’s Covid-19 cases cross 8000-mark, death toll at 273In China, nearly all of the fatalities among 44,672 who were specifically studied ,were people who had such underlying conditions, according to what is the largest study yet of Covid-19 patients, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).In the US, 78% of Covid-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and 71% of those hospitalised had one or more reported underlying health conditions, compared to 27% among those who did not need hospitalisation, according to an analysis of records of hospitalised patients between February 12 and March 28 by the US Centers for Disease Control, which called the findings consistent with what has been seen in China and Italy, one of the other major hot spots of the disease. Vulnerable heartAccording to one of the studies from Wuhan, the ground zero of the pandemic, one in five patients showed signs of heart damage. Cardiovascular conditions are often what kill patients, with “thromboembolic disease, hypercytokinaemia, secondary sepsis, hypovolaemia, and renal complications” being a toxic combination that doctors treating Covid-19 patients have to manage, according to a comment by Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, on April 11. Horton mentions cardiac troponin I as a reliable indicator of heart damage in some of the fatalities. A thromboembolic disease refers to clots in blood vessels, hypercytokinaemia is a strong, potentially fatal immune reaction; while hypovolaemia refers to low levels of plasma, which is a critical component in the blood that contains antibodies and clotting factors.Also read| Covid-19: Govt may divide country in red, orange and green zonesIndian experts said heart damage could be explained by several reasons. “This could be because of causes ranging from acute cor pulmonale (heart working harder to pump blood as oxygen levels fall because of lung tissue freezing); heart muscles suffering hypoxic damage, leading to depressed function, and arrthythmias (irregular heartbeat), viral myocarditis (inflammation after virus directly invades heart cells); and possible rise in thrombosis (blood clots),” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India, and former head of cardiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi.Several other viral infections are known to disrupt blood flow to the heart, leading to irregular heartbeat and heart failure. During influenza outbreaks, more people die from heart complications than from pneumonia, according to a study in the journal JAMA Cardiology. A 2018 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found the risk of heart attacks rising almost six-fold when a person has flu infection.Lung onslaughtSmokers and people with COPD have also been identified as being at higher risk of infection and severe disease because their lungs and lower respiratory tract have cells showing a higher “expression” of ACE2, the portion of a cell through which the Sars-Cov-2 invades it, according to a study by the European Respiratory Journal. In mice, ACE2 has been shown to protect animals from severe lung injury related to breathing and sepsis.Also read: One in every 25 Covid-19 patients in Delhi is a health care worker“There is an increased ACE2 expression in airways of current (but not former) smokers and those with COPD... while the upregulation of ACE2 may be useful in protecting the host against acute lung injury, it predisposes them to increased risk of coronavirus infections, which uses this receptor to gain entrance into epithelial cells. This may in part explain the increased risk of viral respiratory tract infection in active smokers and virus-related exacerbations in those with COPD,” said the study. Upregulation refers to a cell increasing the quantity of a cellular component, such as RNA or protein, in response to an external stimulus, such as a virus.Protein connectionACE2, or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is increasingly posing a challenge. ACE2 is a surface protein that is present at several key locations in the body: it covers cells in upper and lower respiratory tract, heart and the gastrointestinal tract, and plays a role in blood pressure, cardiac function and immune regulation. Targeting this protein is what makes the Sars-Cov-2 insidious in how it infects a body. In response to this, the body mounts an immune attack by releasing small proteins called cytokines into the blood. But with the virus knocking ACE2 out, the immune response can go haywire, causing a cytokine storm that can lead to tissue and organ damage.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage People with high blood pressure or heart disease are also prescribed ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which can inhibit ACE-2 action. “The current consensus is that if people are already taking these medications, they should stay on them but they must consult their physicians. Depending on the severity of the infection and the clinical status of the patient, the medication may need to be modified,” said Dr Reddy||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/respiratory-organ-failure-and-heart-attacks-killing-covid-patients-study/story-qSg5rbMzY7BfQCTn91h1RI.html

They told the ten foreigners to write “I didn’t follow lockdown. I am sorry” at least 500 times on a piece of paper and hand it over to themThese foreigners hail from Israel, Australia, Mexico and some other European countries, the police said.The incident happened in Tapovan area, one of the most popular tourist spots in Rishikesh, which falls under Muni ki Reti police station in Tehri Garhwal district, on Saturday afternoon.Follow latest updates on coronavirus hereVinod Kumar, in-charge of the Tapovan police check post said, “The police had been getting reports that some foreigners were defying the lockdown and coming to the Ganga stretch from Neem Beach till Sai Ghat in Tapovan to chill.”“Based on the inputs, on Saturday, I along with some other personnel of my check post decided to patrol that stretch during which we found 10 foreigners strolling there,” Kumar said. The police officer said when they were asked to explain why they were strolling without any reason during the lockdown; the foreigners said they thought “they can do so from 7 am till 1 pm when the lockdown is relaxed”.Also read: Govt may divide country in red, orange and green zones“I told them that the relaxation is meant for people to buy essential items and not for venturing out without any reason to which they said they weren’t aware of that. I then asked one of my men to bring 50-60 blank pages from our check-post and gave five pages each to the 10 foreigners asking them to write ‘I did not follow the lockdown. I am sorry’ 500 times as punishment,” Kumar said.“After punishing them, I told them that it is a light one and if they refuse to do so then they will be blacklisted which will bar them from entering India again. They then agreed to the punishment and wrote the apology out 500 times at the spot.

12-04-2020||India||Migrant workers go on rampage in Surat demanding nod to return home, 81 arrested||The police arrested 81 people, mostly migrant workers from Odisha, in Surat late on Friday night on charges of rioting and violating the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. The workers resorted to violence after many of them were not paid their salaries for March and also denied permission by the authorities to go back to their native places because of the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown that started on March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), officials said.This is the second such incident in Surat since the lockdown started. On March 30, over 90 migrant workers were arrested in Surat for attacking the police after they were denied permission to return to their native places.Around 100 people migrant workers took to the streets at Surat’s Laskana area on Friday night violating the lockdown order, the police said. The angry workers went on a rampage, torching vegetable carts and damaging four vehicles. “At least five hand carts were torched and stones were pelted at locals by the migrant workers, who took to the streets fearing that the ongoing nationwide lockdown would be extended beyond April 14. An additional police force was deployed and the situation was brought under control around 8.15pm on Friday. Initially, 35 workers were detained,” said RB Brahmabhatt, commissioner of police, Surat.The police chief said no one sustained any injury and 400 police personnel were deployed at Laskana and its adjacent localities such as Diamond Nagar and Vipul Nagar, where a large number of migrant workers live.“Late Friday night, 81 people were arrested and booked under Section 148 (rioting) and 270 (likely to spread infection of any disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code and for the violation of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897,” Brahmabhatt said.Bansidhar Lenka, general secretary of an organisation that takes care of the migrant workers from Odisha in Surat, said that Friday evening’s incident was unfortunate and the violent behaviour showed their growing anxiety because of the lockdown.“Around 25,000 people from Odisha are working in embroidery units and textile factories in Surat. Each migrant worker earns between Rs8,000 and Rs12,000 a month. Half of the workers haven’t been paid their monthly salaries since the lockdown started, and the others have got paid 50% or less,” Lenka said. Most of these workers have run out of cash and are struggling to meet their basic expenses. Many of them are on the verge of being thrown out of their accommodation, as they have not paid their last month’s rent. Besides, they need to send money back home to their families, he added.The members of the factory association in Surat held a meeting with the district administration on Saturday and apprised the authorities about the situation on the ground.Surat district collector Dhaval Patel said food is being provided at seven shelter homes for free and five non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are also distributing meals to over 5,000 people twice a day. “Fear psychosis led to the migrant workers’ unprovoked violence. Most of the workers, who took part in the violence, belong to Odisha’s Ganjam district. They had booked buses to go back to their native places. They’re afraid that if the lockdown is extended beyond April 14, they won’t be able to go back home,” said Patel.In a separate incident, the police have lodged a case against Surat’s deputy mayor Nirav Shah for attending a religious function last week in violation of social distancing norms. Shah was booked after the video of him attending the religious function went viral on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-go-on-rampage-in-surat-demanding-nod-to-return-home-81-detained/story-W06XbIEV2s56sDTm9nd6OL.html
12-04-2020||India||DMK chief Stalin urges Tamil Nadu govt to extend lockdown in state||The opposition DMK in Tamil Nadu on Saturday urged the state government to take a cue from Punjab and Odisha and extend the ongoing lockdown enforced in the state to stem the spread of coronavirus till April-end.DMK President M K Stalin’s demand came on a day when the state cabinet under Chief Minister K Palaniswami is likely to take a call on extending the lockdown.On Friday, a 19-member expert committee constituted by the state government to advise it of steps to tackle the COVID-19 crisis had recommended that the lockdown be extended by two weeks beyond April 14 considering the rise in number of cases. Tamil Nadu has so far reported 911 positive cases.On Saturday, Stalin wrote a letter to Palaniswami, where he wanted the lockdown to be extended beyond April 14.Though isolation was a key precautionary measure, many states had urged the Centre to extend the lockdown, Stalin pointed out.“The Chief Ministers of Odisha (Naveen Patnaik) and Punjab (Amarinder Singh) have extended the lockdown till April 30 and May 1, respectively. Therefore, a due decision on this in Tamil Nadu should be taken without further delay,” Stalin, Leader of the Opposition in the state, said in the letter.He said the lockdown will affect the livelihood of the poor, farmers, labourers and small time traders and urged the government to ensure they did not suffer during this period.He demanded for a cash assistance of Rs 5,000, besides provision of essentials like rice and pulses to people.He also wondered why the state government was not convening an all-party meet like Prime Minister Narendra Modi had done to discuss the matter, adding, the outbreak of the virus was not a mere health or medical issue but also a future social, economic, environment and political one. Stalin also took exception to the state government’s decision to utilise Rs one crore from legislators’ local funds towards fighting COVID-19, saying the monies were being used by them only for “public welfare.” “It is the MLAs’ moral right. It is not fair on the part of the state government to snatch away that right,” he told the chief minister.Palaniswami had on Tuesday ordered utilisation of Rs one crore from the MLA Local Area Development Fund of all the 234 legislators towards procuring medical equipment, drugs and for prevention initiatives against the coronavirus across Tamil Nadu.Among others, Stalin sought for giving incentives to health professionals and field staff such as police since they were actively involved in the fight against coronavirus.While there were apprehensions of Tamil Nadu slipping into the third stage of the pandemic, the government should ensure it doesn’t happen, he said.In the event of the state entering the third stage, the government must be prepared to face it, the DMK chief added.PTI SA SS PTI PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dmk-chief-stalin-urges-tn-govt-to-extend-lockdown-in-state/story-kSKA7y8gcq3m38IGmPlXfN.html
12-04-2020||India||During Covid-19 lockdown, Delhi hospitals see double the usual alcohol withdrawal cases||The number of people with severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms in emergency department of Delhi hospitals has doubled during the lockdown, according to doctors -- and, they are coming in with severe symptoms.“There has been at least a 50% increase in the number of patients coming in with severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms to the hospital emergency. Earlier we would see only about one or maybe two patients a day; now we are getting at least three or four patients every day in the emergency,” said Dr Nimesh Desai, director, Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, the only stand-alone mental health hospital in Delhi.The hospital would usually see patients with substance-use disorders in its out-patient clinics, however, to maintain social distance the OPDs were closed. Around 1,000 to 1,500 patients visited these clinics every day. The hospital has started teleconsultation on the number – 9868396824 – where patients can get their prescriptions.A similar increase was also noted at the main emergency department of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).“We are getting double the cases in the emergency department of our main AIIMS campus and these are patients with severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms like delirium tremens or shaking, hallucinations, and confusion caused due to such withdrawal. Severe withdrawal can be fatal too as it can cause seizures,” said Dr Ravindra Rao, additional professor of psychiatry at the National Drug Dependence and Treatment Centre (NDDTC) of AIIMS.The main centre of NDDTC in Ghaziabad was also shut down.“No new cases are being taken in. And that is a problem. People are landing up in the hospital emergency with acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms because of two reasons: One, the lockdown has impacted the availability of alcohol and two, it has also restricted the movement of people and health care services. So, people wait longer and then end up in the emergency department with severe symptoms,” said Dr Rao. The psychiatrists on duty respond to such cases, who are then admitted for follow-ups.Safdarjung hospital has a limited psychiatry OPD running and has also seen an increase in the number of cases of alcohol withdrawal. “Yes, there has been a surge in cases of people with alcohol and drug withdrawal coming to the emergency department. However, I will not be able to quantify it without going through the admission data,” said Dr Rajesh Rastogi, senior consultant at the hospital’s psychiatry department.To tide over the problem during the lockdown, AIIMS has designed a nearly three-hour-long training session for all doctors, available free of cost on the website of NDDTC.“Unfortunately, the thing is that most of the doctors are not trained in management of withdrawal symptoms. Not just for the lockdown, but otherwise too. Many patients might have gone to their neighbourhood doctors before landing up at the hospital emergency. As a stop-gap measure once we started receiving these reports, we developed an online training module which is freely accessible to all,” said Dr Rao.The doctors say not all who drink daily are likely to experience withdrawal.“Not everyone who drinks daily will experience withdrawal, only those who are dependent on the substance will. We decide whether a person is dependent based on whether they have developed a tolerance, they experience cravings, they take a lot of time out to satisfy these cravings, and they continue to consume the substance even after they have developed physical problems such as liver disease,” said Dr Rastogi.These people have to keep a watch on their symptoms. Sleeping difficulties, anxiety, palpitations, and shaking of the hands are all symptoms that you need to go to a doctor.“If the patients come in within 24 to 48 hours of stopping alcohol, then the symptoms are mild to moderate. The severe symptoms start after two to three days of stopping the alcohol. If the patient has severe withdrawal, they require medication -- diazepam – taken every day. But in severe cases we have to inject the medicine in high doses,” said Dr Rao.Mild cravings can be managed at home, the doctor says.“If people have mild symptoms– it comes in waves – and people can control it by focussing on other activities such as listening to music, watching movies. It is extremely important to remain engaged; people might be irritable because of the lockdown and the cravings will add to it,” said Dr Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-number-of-alcoholics-with-withdrawal-symptoms-doubled-in-hospitals-emergencies/story-OD8QuiDVZwQm8uesxbf8NK.html
12-04-2020||Today's||Covid-19 lockdown could be a good time for MSMEs to log-in | Opinion||As a sector, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which form a large and critical part of India’s economic landscape, have been severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic not just in India, but across the world including China, USA, and the UK. There exist more than 63 million MSMEs in India that provide employment to over 114 million people and contribute close to 30% of the GDP. The sector is reported to have contributed 33% to industrial production in the country. These are big numbers and there is a lot riding on MSMEs. If this lockdown continues beyond the stipulated four weeks, close to a quarter of the firms could face closure and 43% would have to, most likely, shut shops if the Covid-19 panic extends beyond eight weeks.The lockdown that followed the travel bans has witnessed the closure of many establishments and has led to disruption in most business activities. But this is not to say that when the lockdown is lifted, the situation will start easing out immediately. This disruption is going to impact the economy for several reasons.Given the liquidity crunch and salaries taking a hit across sectors, the dwindling financial capacity of buyers and consumers will most likely result in low demand. It is a real possibility that larger production firms may likely bring down production and buying of raw materials, till demand starts rising. In addition, people are likely to refrain from frequenting crowded places to avoid any exposure to the virus, thus making markets and shopping destinations unpopular, albeit briefly, and this may not be a bad idea.While MSMEs are hopeful the government will bring into force emergency measures such as extension of bank loans, special funds, simplification of taxes, availability of working capital, and improving welfare of workers, one cannot but consider the expansion of e-commerce channels, to enable online shopping of goods from these MSMEs.Even as people are coping with being confined to their homes, certain e-commerce companies are undertaking the delivery of essential items, maintaining proper hygiene and sanitation of the last-mile delivery personnel, kitchen, parking areas, and delivery vehicles. If these portals are enabled to deliver non-essential products supplied by MSMEs, it would immediately address two issues facing manufacturers. First, many manufacturers already have stockpiles that are ready to be shipped, and e-commerce can help move these products to consumers. Stock-clearing is essential in the face of accumulated stocks at the onset of a disruptive period, as it could result in liquidity crunch or revenue loss for manufacturers. Second, and directly linked to stock clearing, is the fact that this model of business can keep the economy afloat with continued transactions. It can keep the consumption engine running. This arrangement can thus build resiliency for the vulnerable business communities who are likely to be hit hardest during a crisis.Almost half of India’s MSMEs are based in rural areas and they often need exposure to large markets and expertise to scale up and enhance capabilities. They can do so by integrating into global value chains. Already MSMEs contribute close to 50% of India’s total exports valuing $ 331 billion (2018-19). As a platform, e-commerce could enable this shift. The significant growth of e-commerce in India has provided MSMEs opportunities to access global markets, reap benefits by getting better value for their products and go up the value chain. In 2019, India’s e-commerce sector recorded the second highest year-on-year growth at 31.9% across countries. Over the last few months, MSMEs, entrepreneurs and the rural handicraft artisans have learnt how to use e-commerce and have onboarded with several portals. This move will give a chance to these small players to keep selling their goods in times of distress.Just as e-commerce provides a platform for MSMEs to connect with a much larger potential customer base, it also enables them to source raw materials from a large supplier base active online. Thus, not only will the local and regional supply bottlenecks be mitigated, the MSMEs will also fetch raw materials at more competitive pricing.In this emerging trend, logistic players also have a huge role as they are pivotal in moving goods from one place to the other post the online transaction. The government too was quick to make amends to the lockdown guidelines with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) allowing movement of all goods without distinction of essential or non-essential during the lockdown period. Some MSMEs which supply to large manufacturing firms have benefitted with these measures.When boundaries open up in a post-Covid world, e-commerce will play an integral role in re-establishing global value chains. MSMEs adopting e-commerce will gain access to a larger customer base and be able to tap a wider supplier base.In the face of the pandemic, e-commerce deliveries are providing continued livelihood and economic support to several gig economy workers. In the longer term, e-commerce can pave the way for the array of items that people will need once the lock down is over and aid us in jumping back to normalcy.(Raman Sobti is Partner and National Leader, KPMG Enterprise, KPMG in India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/covid-19-lockdown-could-be-a-good-time-for-msmes-to-log-in-opinion/story-QDmpw4vV1LLxL4BsbzOn6L.html
12-04-2020||Editorials||Covid-19: A test of federalism| HT Editorial||The most heartening element of India’s response to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been the close collaboration between the Centre and states. To be sure, there have been differences too. But rarely, if ever, has the federal structure been put to test as it is being done now. And this is because of the constitutional design. The Centre can frame broad policies; it can make national-level assessments; it can provide support, be it in terms of health care facilities or economic packages. But states are in the frontlines of the battle. Health is a state subject; so is law and order; and the entire ambit of daily administration at the local level — be it through local district magistrates or developments officers or district hospitals — happens through the state government.And that is why the voices of the chief ministers (CMs) must be heard. There have now been three video conferences between the prime minister and the CMs. In the latest one, on Saturday, while expressing their support for an extended lockdown, states asked for help — from requesting that donations to the CM Relief Fund be considered as corporate social expenditure to more availability of testing kits and personal protective equipment for health workers; from relaxations in fiscal deficit norms to the payment of compensation under the Goods and Services Tax regime; from a greater economic package for diverse sectors to fiscal support for states. The Centre must consider all these requests favourably, for it is both a question of the rights of states and the need of the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid-19-a-test-of-federalism-ht-editorial/story-QXcrKWT01bVh11zqFhLIbN.html
12-04-2020||Editorials||A smart lockdown| HT Editorial||In his interaction with chief ministers on Saturday, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi reformulated a popular phrase which he used while declaring the national lockdown to outline a change in the nature of the national objectives. On March 24, while emphasising the need for social distancing and urging people to stay home, he said, “Jaan hai toh jahan hai” — if one is alive, there is a world. This was meant to place the premium on health, unarguably the single-most-important priority at a time when the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has shaken the world. On Saturday, he said, “Jaan bhi, Jahaan bhi” — lives also, the world also. This does not, in any way, undermine the emphasis on health, but along with saving lives, the PM seemed to hint that India also has to restore a degree of economic normalcy and allow everyday life to resume, where possible.This is a sound approach. It will, however, need the government’s continued focus and calibrated policy vis-à-vis both elements. First, health. There is more known about Covid-19 than a month ago. Here is what India needs to do, beyond this phase of the lockdown to the next set of restrictions. Continue to ramp up testing to be able to identify positive cases to have the basis to intervene. Enhance quarantine facilities to ensure that those who are positive can be isolated. Expand the contact tracing apparatus, including through the use of technology, to be able to find people who may have come in contact with those tested positive. Add and remove containment zones, where a more strict form of a lockdown is in place, on an everyday basis depending on the evidence available. Source, from whatever mechanisms possible, more personal protective equipment for health workers who are risking their lives every day. Ensure there are enough hospital beds and ventilators in place to prepare for a surge in cases. And take special case of states where the health infrastructure is particularly weak but which have a high density of population such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.On the economy, this newspaper has argued for a comprehensive stimulus of Rs 10 lakh crore. But in the immediate context, it is important to smoothen the supply of essentials, allow some sectors and factories to open up on the condition of them meeting safety and social distancing norms, and providing relief to agriculture. Implementing partial restrictions will be a key challenge here, and security personnel will have to be carefully sensitised to what is allowed and what is not. It is time to move to the next phase of a, as a government official put it, “smart lockdown”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-smart-lockdown-ht-editorial/story-kMfI1iFH8D3Adp9lZovKqJ.html
