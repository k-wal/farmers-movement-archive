We will be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy,” wrote former president of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi, in a letter to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi. Having been the first to warn the nation about the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), Gandhi pledged full support to the PM in the fight against it and called for a more “nuanced” strategy to counter the virus, while acknowledging India’s distinct realities. How unique is India, and why is a total lockdown not an optimum strategy?First, comparing data of Covid-19 infections, hospitalisations, deaths and fatalities across different countries is absurd and misleading. Every nation has different testing strategies, demographics, and data integrity. To claim that the United States (US) has more Covid-19 cases than India, or that Italy has a higher fatality rate than Germany is like comparing guns, germs and steel. Such cross-country analyses have only added noise to this grave crisis.Many developed nations such as the US, the United Kingdom (UK ), France, Italy have adopted a strategy of social distancing through lockdown to prevent the rapid spread of the virus. India too jumped on the bandwagon, but with an extreme and absolute national three-week lockdown and is likely to extend it further.A lockdown impacts daily wage workers who must step out to work every day to feed themselves and their families. Less than a fifth of the workforce in the US, Italy and the UK are such daily wage workers. But in India, 90% of all workers are. So, the scale of the impact of a total lockdown in India is exponentially larger than in other nations. The very idea of social distancing rests on the premise that the virus can be contained within small households of two to four people. More than 90% of all households in developed countries have less than four members. But, more than three-quarters of all households in India have more than five members. In nearly all poor households, there are more than six members, again unique to India. Social distancing through lockdown has been portrayed as a Sophie’s choice, where there is a trade-off between a massive adverse impact on the economy and stopping the spread of the virus. It is a “dollars versus lives” conundrum in western nations and in that, the case for “lives” should always win.However, in India, it is not “rupees versus lives” but a “lives versus lives” dichotomy. There are already reports of many deaths due to hunger and hardships to migrant populations caused by the sudden and absolute lockdown. Millions of migrant workers have been left stranded amid heart-wrenching images of them being made to frog jump, squat and sprayed with chemicals. Deaths due to hunger, homelessness and isolation are imminent. Intangible social costs of ostracisation and humiliation by local communities may claim many more lives. None of these deaths will be measured and documented in charts, as ardently as the ones caused by Covid-19. Media reports indicate that the deaths by the lockdown are already similar in the count to the deaths by the coronavirus. Shamefully, this is also unique to India. Given India’s social structure, the efficacy of an extreme lockdown will also be much lower here than in developed nations. So India may not experience the full benefits of an extreme lockdown, but will be saddled with the enormous human and economic costs of it.It is often remarked that the government must provide a wide safety net of food, shelter and income, and, thereby, ensure that the lockdown is smooth. Yes, the government has woefully fallen short and must do more in protecting the poor and vulnerable during these tumultuous times. But it is also acknowledged that India has a weak State capacity for welfare delivery. It is then naïve to believe that a weak State can dramatically transform itself from an inefficient monster to an efficient angel overnight, and ensure that cash, food and shelter are delivered down to the last affected Indian.India’s inordinately large share of daily wage workers, high population density in homes, a notoriously inefficient government welfare architecture and a massive humanitarian crisis from the current extreme lockdown is a given.It is also a given that the Covid-19 epidemic is extremely infectious, fatal for the elderly, can overwhelm hospital capacity and can be highly asymptomatic. It is then imperative that we adopt a nuanced strategy to counter this complex threat.Ninety-five per cent of India’s population is below the age of 60. Covid-19 is fatal largely for people above 60. It is then possible to look at age-specific isolations, hospitalisation and treatment, which narrows the problem down to 5% of the population. Localised lockdown measures in specific states, districts and blocks based on migration patterns can be an alternative to a national lockdown. Ubiquitous testing through the private sector and isolating positive cases can be another targeted strategy. Spreading out work timings over multiple shifts can be yet another approach. I am sure many people will have several other ideas for a more balanced approach to social distancing than the current extreme and absolute lockdown strategy.It is important to shift from the current “extreme lockdown versus death by Covid-19” binary to a more nuanced debate. Moving from a total lockdown to a more targeted lockdown is perhaps the more viable and better option for India. John Maynard Keynes’ “in the long run we are all dead” is often quoted in such times but for millions of Indians, the long run is about surviving today for tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/full-lockdown-or-deaths-the-false-dichotomy/story-63vXKBU0JlWsOttFiMbwzL.html

05-04-2020||City||Team of scientists bust Covid-19 myths||Have you been receiving messages such as, “Indians have better immunity to fight coronavirus”, or “Home remedies can offer protection against the infection?” A group of scientists have taken the onus to falsify such myths which have been doing the rounds on social media.Less than 10 days after their first meeting, the hoax-buster team of the Indian Scientists’ Response to Covid19 (ISRC) has released “hoax-busting messages” in English and 14 Indian languages on https://indscicov.in/busting-hoaxes/ that can be downloaded and shared.A volunteer team comprising scientists, graphic designers and translators from across the country have countered hoaxes, myths and superstitions using short and simple social media messages accompanied by detailed responses with additional references to scientific evidence and technical manuscripts. You can report a hoax or any unverified claim at hoaxbusters.isrc@gmail.com“Some misinformation takes off and some do not. When some misinformation finds resonance and reinforces previously held beliefs, a critical number of people share or retweet it,” said Dibyendu Nandi, astrophysicist, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata, who helped assimilate many of the hoaxes and superstitions in to specific scientific questions for effective science communication.With several astrologers and spiritual masters claiming that the calendar followed by the spread of coronavirus follows a certain pattern that can be predicted by astrology, the hoax-busters have clarified that the motion of planets do not impact human bodies and tiny microorganisms and there is no connection between astrological beliefs and the spread of epidemics.“A nanometre sized virus has brought the world to its heels. For the person on the street, this is hard to fathom,” said R Ramanujam, theoretical computer scientist at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, and coordinator of the ISRC. “Our group not only tries to debunk the hoaxes that are going viral but is also spreading general scientific awareness by various other means. This is critical since the success of measures coming from the government depends on citizens playing their role rationally.” Aniket Sule, astrophysicist and science educator at the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, who played an important role in coordinating translations, said scientists, including astronomers from IUCAA-Pune and IIT-Bombay worked to automate the process of generation of images in all languages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/team-of-scientists-bust-covid-19-myths/story-0zv2O1TadvunjREdQT3q6J.html

According to the police, an FIR was registered on Sunday against unidentified men on the basis of the complaint by the Imam of the mosque, who was sleeping on the terrace of the building when the incident took place. However, he did not hear the sound of the gunshots, the Imam said in the complaint. The police said that they found at least one ejected shell casing near the gate of the mosque. Although the motive behind the firing is yet to be established, the police have denied any communal angle to it.In the police complaint, the Imam, who is a resident of Nuh, said, “I have been working as Imam in Kherki Majra. On Friday, the Imam of Jama Masjid, Dhankot, asked me to take care of the premises as he was going out of station. On Sunday around 6.44am, I received a phone call from him. He informed me that the residents of the village have told him that gunshots were fired in front of the mosque. I was sleeping on the first floor during the night and did not hear the gunshots.”The Imam further said that when he went downstairs, he saw a crowd in front of the mosque. The residents allegedly told him that they heard sounds of gunshots being fired around 12 am. After inspecting the area near the mosque, the Imam allegedly found an ejected shell casing and saw a bullet hole on the gate of the mosque, the police said.“Residents told me that they heard at least three gunshots. I do not know the people who fired them.

An ejected shell casing was found near the spot. There is no communal angle to the incident,” he said.A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said preliminary probe suggested that there were at least three men who came at the spot in a car and fried the gunshots.A case was registered against the suspects under Section 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Arms Act at Rajendra Park police station on Sunday, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/unidentified-men-open-fire-at-gurugram-mosque-fir-filed/story-IHGDCq6R4R0mzGHieBlr9N.html
05-04-2020||Gurugram||Homeless migrants for whom Gurugram footpaths are home say situation worse than demonetisation||Migrants from Rajasthan, who have been living on city’s footpaths for years and earning their livelihood by selling earthenware and hand carved agricultural tools such as sickles, chisels and the like, have been hit particularly hard by the nationwide lockdown, imposed to curb the outbreak of Sars-Cov-2. Living on the margins, many of these men and women, some of whom have spent about three-four decades in the city, agree that they have never seen such bad times in the past. Even during demonetisation, they recall, they had managed to earn something every day, but the impact of the nationwide lockdown is such that they have not been able to earn a single rupee in the last 15 days, they say.There are around 40 tents at Hanuman Chowk in Dundahera in which more than 150 migrant families live. These migrants hail from Chittor in Rajasthan and belong to the ‘Lohar’ community, but being nomadic in nature till a few decades back, they own no property.“We don’t have permanent homes and these tenements are our only abode. Due to the lockdown, our shops are closed and there are no buyers but we have mouths to feed. There are around 600-700 people who need help in terms of groceries and essential items,” says Maina, a 60-year old woman.The families staying at Hanuman Chowk say the local councillor had brought help to them a week back and given them rice, flour, oil and other essentials. “We have no money right now and the children need milk and food. We used to earn ₹500-₹600 every day but now there is no income,” said Kamlesh, another resident of the area. While these migrants are facing shortages of food, those staying at the Palam Vihar road near Rezangla chowk say they are troubled as the community washrooms and toilets located nearby have been closed due to the lockdown. “There are 40 people living here. The women are facing trouble as they are forced to go in the open to relieve themselves. We have to fetch water from around 1km afar,” says Machhar Singh, who has been living in the area for over four decades. The migrants insist that they should be given dry ration instead of cooked meals as they are worried about the quality of the food. “We don’t accept cooked meals. What we want is some rations that can sustain us during the lockdown,” says Anguri Devi, adding that the sources of income have dried up and her savings are also gone.When asked about the matter, Rakesh Daultabad, MLA Badshahpur assured that help will reach these people at the earliest. “Our teams are working hard to reach out to the distressed persons. Whatever is needed will be given by Monday morning,” he said.Sudhir Singla, BJP MLA from Gurugram, also assured that he will ask officials to reach out to all such people and help will be given on priority. “I have just come to know about their problems and I assure that no one in the city will remain hungry. Help will reach them soon,” he asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/homeless-migrants-for-whom-gurugram-footpaths-are-home-say-situation-worse-than-demonetisation/story-vUzvlQTRoStJTbmVZLtDtJ.html
05-04-2020||Mumbai||Urban designer marks Mumbai’s containment zones on Google Maps||With a growing number of containment zones in the city to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, a city-based urban designer and professor has spatialised the zones and areas on Google maps. The easy-to-access map shows users the zones near their locality. You can access the map on your mobile via shorturl.at/tWX29.According to the plan, a containment zone means at least one person from the area has tested positive for Covid-19. The patient’s family and the building are identified as a cluster zone, and at least four to five adjoining buildings on all sides are mapped in the containment zone, depending on the area’s population density. The greater the population density, the wider the radius of containment zone.In addition, the disaster management team of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) gets an alert in case of any movement in the containment zone through video analytics. BMC has identified 241 containment zones in the city as of Friday. Mumbai is the worst-affected in the state with an increasing number of cases.“The idea was to make an easy-to-access map which citizens can also access on their phones to know which are the no-go zones. This is also user-friendly and can be accessed on mobile phones,” said Abhijit Ekbote, a city-based urban designer and secretary of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region – Environment Improvement Society (MMR-EIS). Ekbote has been updating the map based on data released by BMC.Apart from Mumbai, Ekbote has also updated some containment zones in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The map has had more than 3,000 views till Sunday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/urban-designer-marks-mumbai-s-containment-zones-on-google-maps/story-XaA5TTuSgZGXWIBEhrnPcP.html
05-04-2020||Noida||Builders provide free food, medicines to halt exodus of migrants||A number of Noida-based real estate developers have been successful in convincing migrant construction workers not to leave their construction sites and head back to their home towns during the ongoing nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19. As the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, these developers reached out to the labourers and convinced them that they and their families will remain safe, healthy and have access to adequate food and medicine at their respective construction sites. Several prominent builders such as ATS Infrastructure, ACE Group, Jaypee Group, Wave Group, Supertech Limited and others decided to provide all essential services right at the construction sites.“Our construction workers are like an extended family to us because they are the ones who build housing projects. It was not safe for them to go back to home towns in groups. Therefore, we have started giving them free food and medicine to around 1,700 labourers at our all sites in Noida and Greater Noida since lockdown was put into effect,” said Ajay Kumar, chairman and managing director, ACE Group.Jaypee Group, for instance, has provided food to the families of nearly 1,000 migrant construction workers. Similarly, ATS Group has done the same for almost 2,000 migrant workers. Supertech Limited has also provided food to around 2,500 workers, while Wave Group has supplied food to around 2,200 construction workers and their families. Jaypee Group, who is also into health care, has given up its properties to be converted into quarantine facilities, where migrant workers are being kept in isolation. Apart from providing food to construction labourers, the Jaypee Group has also made quarantine facilities at its multiple properties including a hospital in Noida and two hospitals in Bulandshahr.“Our group is committed to extending full support to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath to fight Covid-19. We have reserved a 20-bed ward for quarantining in a Noida hospital and have given up a full hospital in Chitta and another one in Anupshahr in the neighbouring district of Bulandshahr. Our effort is to fight this pandemic together and provide relief to the needy during this time of crisis,” said Sunny Gaur managing director of Jaypee Healthcare.“Our volunteers have also shown our labourers how to stay safe by washing hands, maintaining social distance and staying inside their living quarters at sites. And since we have provided food and counselling regularly, they have stayed back,” said Getambar Anand, CMD, ATS Infrastructure.These builders have also started sanitisation work at the sites, where construction workers are staying.“As we adopted 2,200 labourers and have taken care of all of their family members. We have assured them of medical help and free food for the 21 days of lockdown,” said Manpreet Singh Chadha, chairman, Wave Group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/builders-provide-free-food-medicines-to-halt-exodus-of-migrants/story-OWQBezeK18FGtPrx5jSgBL.html
05-04-2020||Noida||Noida industrialists, entrepreneurs seek relief package amid lockdown||Noida-based entrepreneurs and industrialists have demanded a relief package from the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government and the Centre, amid the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.They said although their operations are shut, they are required to pay the salaries of their staff members as per the government order. Noida Entrepreneurs Association (NEA), which has at least 10,000 industrial unit owners as its members, has written to the UP government and the Centre about their plight. These 10,000 industrial units collectively employ at least 5 lakh workers directly. Further, at least 2 lakh more people get indirect employment from these industrial units, said NEA. Small, micro, medium and large-scale industrial units manufacture a variety of products, such as electronic goods, electrical equipment, automobile parts, garments, etc. They said that they were already suffering due to the economic slowdown and now the shutdown of units amid the nationwide lockdown has virtually brought their businesses to a standstill.“The biggest worry is that the government has directed us to pay the salaries of all employees during the phase when units are shut and workers are not reporting for work. We have happily paid the salaries to our employees but the problem is that the government has not provided us with a relief package yet. They should not charge any interest on loan installments for at least three months, as the Reserve Bank of India has put a moratorium on all loan payments. If there is no work happening, then why we should pay interest on our businesses or other loans?” asked Vipin Malhan, president of NEA.The association has written letters to the UP chief minister and the ministry of finance for a relief package amid the existing scenario when the industry owners have completely shut down their business operations and are staying at home. They said that the Noida Authority has refused to waive off water or sewer charges and there has been no relief from rental charges for their industrial units and other taxes during this period.“The government must take into consideration our plight because the government should stop taking electricity bills during the period when operations have been shut down. Other taxes from all departments should also be put on hold during this crisis period,” said Sudhir Shrivastava, spokesperson of NEA.The association also demanded that commercial and transport taxes for their vehicles should also be exempted.“The government should provide business loans at 6% interest rate in order to give a boost to industrial units on the lines of reliefs given to other sections. We employ at least 5-7 lakh people in Noida. If the government will encourage our business instead of imposing unwanted taxes then it will benefit all our employees and the local economy,” said Shrivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-industrialists-entrepreneurs-seek-relief-package-amid-lockdown/story-mknUoyOab6fPgRXIi8obfK.html
05-04-2020||Noida||Man arrested for rape, murder of cousin||A 19-year-old man was arrested Sunday on charges of raping and murdering his eight-year-old cousin on Saturday night, the police said.The incident was reported around 10pm on Saturday when the girl’s body was found in a hut near her house in an area that comes under the Sector 49 police jurisdiction. The body has been sent for an autopsy, the police said. According to the victim’s parents, she had gone missing around 6pm.“We had seen her going with her cousin in the evening and we suspected his role in her death,” said the girl’s father in his police complaint.Police said that a call was made to the police helpline around 10pm when the family found the body after which a team was rushed to the spot.“The body was sent for an autopsy, and based on the family’s complaint, the suspect was nabbed. Upon questioning, he confessed to the crime,” said Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, station house officer, Sector 49 police station.Sharma said that the suspect lived in a separate hut. The girl’s parents work as daily wage earners, he said.According to the police, preliminary investigation suggests that the suspect first raped her and when she started to raise the alarm, he suffocated her to death with a blanket. However, the autopsy report is awaited, they said. The girl’s body was handed over to the family on Sunday, the police said.The suspect was booked under sections 302 (punishment for murder), and 376 (1) (punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.“The suspect was arrested for the rape of his cousin. Necessary legal proceedings are being done,” said Akhilesh Kumar, additional commissioner of police.The suspect was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/man-arrested-for-rape-murder-of-cousin/story-iyzCgBHGZjJ7kVO3PXEqpK.html
05-04-2020||Noida||Call on extending prohibitory orders in Noida will be taken on April 14||The Gautam Budh Nagar police commissionerate on Sunday said that it would decide whether on not to extend the imposition of Section 144 in the district on April 14, the last day of the lockdown.Confusion prevailed over the extension of Section 144 when the police department on Sunday issued a press note stating that the prohibitory orders will be extended from the previous date of April 5 to April 30, during which time all guidelines of the lockdown will be followed.However, senior officials denied the information.“Section 144 is in place till April 14. We will then take a call on extending it further depending on the situation,” Akhilesh Kumar, additional commissioner of police, law and order, saidThe commissionerate had, for the first time this year, imposed Section 144 on February 15, which was to last till March 15 (during the festival and examination season). However, as the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic spread across the country, the imposition was extended till April 5.The press note released by the Gautam Budh Nagar police had stated: “The nationwide lockdown will continue till April 14. For protection from the virus and safety of the public, Section 144 of the CrPC had been imposed till April 5, which is now being extended till April 30, 2020.” The police notice was signed by Ashutosh Dwivedi, additional deputy commissioner of police, law and order.In case the date is extended, all the regulations of the lockdown will continue for the extended time as well.“Even when the lockdown ends, any political, cultural, religious, or sports-related demonstration or rally or any other programme will not be allowed. Necessary legal action will be taken against any person found in violation of these guidelines,” the police notice stated. However, the Noida police sent out another press note in the evening, stating that the extension is only till April 15.Before the commissionerate system came into place in January, the power to impose Section 144 resided with the district administration.

Priya Patil, an activist, said, “When the government spoke about marginalised communities and those in need of help, there was no mention of transgenders. Even after the NALSA judgement, are we not considered citizens of the country?” She said most community members earn money on a daily basis by means such as begging which is not possible due to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/transgender-community-writes-to-authorities-for-help/story-rCvfMK0OlvGZiBmVhcc5vJ.html
05-04-2020||Mumbai||Volunteers unite to map Mumbai’s hunger amid lockdown||Even as various groups reach out to needy across the city providing them with basic essentials, a group of young volunteers have launched an initiative — Khaana Chahiye — to bring all efforts under one roof and reach out to the less privileged and marginalised sections by mapping them across the city.Shishir Joshi, the founder of Project Mumbai and one of the founders of Khaana Chahiye, said every day around 20,000 people comprising migrants and homeless across Mumbai are provided with khichdi or pulao in their lunch and dinner food packets. Around a week back, the group launched a website — www.khaanachahiye.com where volunteers and those who know of a needy family can supply details such as address, number of people, category of needy and kind of help required. Elsa D’Silva, who co-ordinates distribution of food packets on the Eastern Express Highway, said some families along were in need of dry ration which was provided to them following which they now distribute 550 packets at Kurla, Wadala and Chembur.The group, however, said they were in need of more volunteers. “We are helping out with food. But will also need a group of volunteers who can provide them with water,” said D’Silva. Currently, around 60 volunteers have joined hands for this project who provide monetary help and services, while some restaurants and kitchens have opened their space and manpower to cook meals.“The site was basically launched to provide a hunger map of the city because we do not want any duplication of efforts. It’s to understand the demand and accordingly supply food,” said Ruben Mascarenhas, co-founder of Khaana Chahiye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/volunteers-unite-to-map-city-s-hunger-amid-lockdown/story-ouNklF42wgAwqaRdWIAmsL.html

The incident came to light after a 68-year-old man from the group started developing symptoms of coronavirus. “The 68-year-old man was sent to Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai. After he was tested positive, the other nine from the group were also tested and two of them were also tested positive. Meanwhile, the 68-year-old man developed complications and was shifted to a Powai hospital, where he died on March 23. On inquiring with the men, we learnt that they had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi,” said an officer from Vashi police station.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), however, has claimed that the 68-year-old died of another infection and did not attribute his death to coronavirus, as he was first tested positive but later his report came negative.Meanwhile, two men who have been tested positive have recovered and are in quarantine at Nagpada. Despite being asked to self-isolate, the seven others who were tested negative have fled to Delhi, the police have said. As per the suo motu first information report (FIR) registered at Vashi police station, the men violated the conditions pertaining to their immigration and came in contact with Indians, causing the spread of the disease. Officers at Vashi police station said the 68-year-old man had come to India on a 40-day tourist visa and had exceeded his stay in the country.All the 10 have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for violating orders and spreading infectious disease; for remaining in India beyond their visa permit under the Foreigner’s Act; and sections of Epidemic Diseases Act as well as the Maharashtra Covid-19 Regulations, 2020.“The men did not inform authorities in the city that they had arrived from Delhi.

We had information about them and they were intercepted soon as they headed for immigration clearance. We had lookout notices against several foreigners who are believed to have attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at its Nizamuddin headquarters in March in violation of their visa conditions. They were handed over to the Delhi police for further action,” said an officer from the airport, who did not wish to be named. Their travel history showed that all of them had arrived in India in the first week of March, on different dates, to attend the congregation, the officer added.The ministry of health and family welfare was also alerted about the development. Deputy commissioner of police (IGI airport) said that the men were handed over to the crime branch.A police officer who did not wish to be named, said these men underwent basic medical screening at the airport by the APHO (Airport Health Organization) staff. “Their detailed medical reports are awaited. They were taken away and will be kept under quarantine. They are yet to be questioned about where had they been hiding since the Nizamuddin Markaz gathering came to light. Their background is also under verification,” the officer said. The government has already blacklisted over 900 such foreigners and invoked provisions of the Disaster Management Act and the Foreign Management Act against them.Over 2,000 Tablighi Jamaat activists were evacuated from the Nizamuddin building last week and several hundreds of them spread out to at least 17 states. The health ministry has linked close to one-third of all Covid-19 infections in the country to Jaamat members and their contacts. A home ministry release that announced the blacklisting of 960 foreigners for attending the congregation in violation of the visa rules said most were from Indonesia (379), Bangladesh (110), Kyrgyzstan (77), Myanmar (63) and Thailand (65). Many foreign nationals who attended the religious gathering, among other Indians, have tested positive for Covid-19 and nearly 22,000 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts have been quarantined across the country so far, a home ministry official said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/eight-malaysians-linked-to-tablighi-jamaat-caught-boarding-flight-at-delhi-airport/story-v0vzAWzeaSxoyMUWMvyVwO.html
05-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 cases in Mumbai tripled in five days||A review of the progression of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai has revealed that the number of positive patients has been increasing much faster over the last five days after the city breached its 100-patient mark.On April 5, the city touched a toll of 458, with 81 positive patients identified in a single day. It took Mumbai 15 days to breach the 100-patient mark after the first two patients – an Andheri-based couple – were identified on March 11. On March 31, the city crossed the 100-patient mark, taking the toll to 151. Since then, the virus has been multiplying faster as cases have tripled in just five days.The city crossed its 200-patient mark (235 cases) on April 2. By April 4, another 100 positive cases were reported, taking the tally to 377. On Sunday (April 5), 81 more cases were confirmed within 24 hours.Similarly, the death count due to the virus has also been increasing. To date the city has registered 30 deaths; Mumbai’s first death linked to the virus was reported on March 17, after a 64-year-old man died at Kasturba Hospital. It then took 13 days to register 10 new deaths, however, the death ratio later tripled, taking the death tally of the city to 30 on April 5.State disease surveillance officer Dr Pradip Awate said, “It is true that the number of positive cases is increasing day by day as we have improved our testing from merely 1,000 samples to 5,500 samples in a day.”The Maharashtra government is currently testing 5,500 samples for the Sars-Cov-2 virus daily at 13 government and eight private labs. Awate said that considering overcrowding and large population density in Mumbai, the civic body has already identified containment zones to avoid further spread of the virus.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to start 10 Covid-19 screening clinics in all containment zones and densely-populated areas where the focal outbreak is observed.The spike in cases, including that on Sunday, includes confirmation of cases tested earlier by private labs, pointed out another civic health official. He said that such a trend was likely to continue till April 15 due to increased testing. However, some experts said that even now, enough testing is not being done to gauge the actual spread of the virus.Dr Shashikant Ahankari, a community health specialist, and president of the Halo Medical Foundation, said, “To deal with the situation, the state government should opt for random testing at least in infected areas like Worli Koliwada, from where a many cases are being identified.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-cases-in-city-tripled-in-five-days/story-UjxjWEQrM2XxTK9DtWRrUM.html
05-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: One isolation bed for 5,246 Mumbai residents||The city has one isolation bed per 5,246 residents – that is 3,500 beds for a population of 1.84 crore as per the 2011 census. While the civic body plans to double this figure, health experts expressed scepticism over its adequacy, given the rising number of Covid cases and density of the city.Documents accessed by HT show that Mumbai currently has 2,107 isolation beds across different hospitals. By the end of next week, this number is set to increase to 3,507 after Seven Hills Hospital, Marol converts the entire hospital into the biggest isolation facility in India with a capacity of 1,500 beds. At present, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started 100 isolation beds and will add 20 intensive care units (ICU) at the hospital. “The current capacity, although less for a city like Mumbai, seems adequate for now. But it will not be enough to isolate patients if community transmission starts,” said Dr Abhijit More, activist, Jan Swasth Abhiyan. “In addition to beds, the BMC should also request retired doctors and medical staffers to join the force to attend to patients. A backup plan should be prepared.”As per the data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Japan and Korea have more than 10 isolation beds per 1,000 citizens. Countries such as Russia, Germany, Poland and France have over five isolation beds per 1,000 people.Dr Manohar Kamath, general secretary of Consumer Guidance Society of India (CGSI), said while the number of isolation beds is less, it won’t be reasonable to expect a sudden rise. “The number of Covid cases will rise as we are in the borderline of contact and community transmission. The government will, however, require time to set up isolation beds, as we didn’t have the inbuilt infrastructure, which didn’t exist even in the US,” said Kamath. “It is a gradual process, which the government is working on.”A back-up plan is ready if the novel coronavirus spreads further, said civic officials, with an additional 3,000 isolation beds on stand-by mode across various civic-run hospitals. “Hundreds of isolation beds are lying unused, as non-emergency services at all civic-run hospitals have stopped, which has led to a decrease in the number of patients. If we add those in emergency, the figure will be double,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, health, BMC.Kakani said the BMC has divided beds under the category of ‘peripheral and speciality hospitals’ into two phases. Phase one includes Kasturba Hospital with 125 beds, Rajawadi Hospital (100), KB Bhabha Hospital in Kurla (100), HBT Trauma Hospital (100) and KB Bhabha Hospital in Bandra (50). According to data provided by the BMC, 176 of 475 beds were occupied till Tuesday. In the second phase, the BMC has enlisted another 13 hospitals, including Eye Hospital, Surya Maternity Hospital, Bhagwati Hospital, Maa Hospital, etc. with a total of 555 isolation bed facilities.“We have kept the second phase as an extension of the first phase. If we run out of beds in the first five civic-hospitals, we will focus on isolating patients in the latter,” added Kakani.In addition to civic-run hospitals, there are 685 isolation beds with 50 Intensive Care Units (ICU) at the government-run Sir JJ Group of hospitals. Two railway hospitals – central railway hospital have kept 30 beds for isolation and Jagjeevan Ram Hospital under western railway has 10 beds. The Mumbai Port Trust has created a facility for 50 isolation beds. In March, the BMC released a list of 10 private hospitals (89 beds), which agreed to treat patients in their isolation wards. That number has risen to 22, including trust-run and private hospitals, taking the total number of isolation beds to 197. This new list includes Saboo Siddiqui (6), Saifee Hospital (1), Bhatia (10), Wockhardt Hospital (9), Global (10), BJ Wadia (20), Shushrusha (10), Holy Family (1), SRV (15), Hindu Sabha (9), LH Hiranandani (4) and Nanavati (4). Health officials said at present almost 80% beds are lying vacant which highlights that the outbreak of coronavirus hasn’t yet flared up in Mumbai. From January 1, 2020, 2,523 suspected patients with risk factors have been admitted in hospitals and 330 have been identified with COVID-19 in the city till April 4. “We are also hunting for abandoned hospitals and places to start isolation facilities,” said Kakani.Anant Bhant, global health researcher, said China, with more population than India, has reserved 4.3 beds per 1,000 humans; India has only 0.5 beds for 1,000 people and the US is struggling to find isolation beds.“Isolation is a process to keep the patients separated, and therefore any place can been converted into an isolation ward. More than isolation beds, we need to be prepared with essential medicinal material like oxygen cylinders, protective kits to treat patients in isolation,” said Bhant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-one-isolation-bed-for-5-246-city-residents/story-qQY0Zi2QyuNgYBAzHDfyaP.html

However, he added that State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) and local arms may be used at 200 odd containment zones in the city.Divakar Shelke, senior police inspector, Dadar police station said, “Our team is deployed at Worli Koliwada and Adarsh Nagar’s entry and exit points. Daily one or two suspected patients for Covid-19 are being found. We are following the lockdown order and are making regular announcements using recorded messages.”Dayanand Bangar, a senior inspector of Oshiwara police station, said, “There are two containment zones in my jurisdiction where we have deployed a total of four police constables round the clock.”FIRs registered for hate speech On the other hand, a lot of hate messages, rumours and misinformation is being spread regarding coronavirus on social media platforms.Home minister Anil Deshmukh and chief minister Udhav Thackeray have warned to take strict action against those involved. “We have registered a total of 20 odd FIRs in Maharashtra and arrested 11 people in past few days for making hate speeches and communal posts on social media platforms. Our operation is on and more are likely to be arrested. We are monitoring all social media platforms and warn people to refrain from indulging in such activities.

The competition was part of ‘Go Corona Fest’, a series of online events held during the Covid-19 shutdown, to keep residents of Orchid Suburbia CHS entertained and connected.Since the lockdown was imposed, the entire society has been participating in daily online competitions and events using a common social media platform to upload their entries.From essay writing, poetry, painting, mask making, science projects, spelling bee to cooking with family, almost 2,500 residents across 685 flats of the housing society have participated in the fest. Awards in the form of coupons and prizes are given to daily winners. “The lockdown is a stressful period for everyone, especially children. The idea is to not only reduce panic but also develop a strong sense of community involvement,” said P Patwardhan, chairman of the society. Additionally, residents gather at their balconies every day between 6.30pm and 6.45pm to ring bells, chant mantras and clap their hands, wishing good health for each other. A section of residents is also using the social media platform to organise community yoga and Zumba classes.Alongside community entertainment, the society has taken numerous measures to keep residents safe and curb the spread of Covid-19.

05-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Women from rural Maharashtra make 6L masks worth Rs 75 lakh||At a time when job-cuts are happening as a result of economic slowdown due to the coronavirus lockdown, around 6,000 women from rural Maharashtra have got an opportunity to earn money by producing masks. As the demand for masks has increased by 400%, the State Women Development Corporation (SWDC), along with the Maharashtra State Rural Livelihood Mission (MSRLM) have trained the women in making masks following the guidelines of the Union health ministry.In the last 15 days, the women have produced over 6 lakh masks worth Rs 75 lakh. Depending on the type of mask, a woman earns Rs 3-4 per unit. One woman makes about 150 masks per day. Three types of masks are produced-- one, two and three-layer-- which are sold at Rs 10, 15 and 20, respectively. Forty-six-year-old Martha Ratwani earned Rs 7,000 last week for making masks. Her husband recently lost his job as a daily labourer in a wielding factory due to the lockdown. “After my husband lost his job, I was apprehensive as I have two children to feed. But thanks to the government for providing us with an alternative mode of income,” said Ratwani from rural Mumbai. The SWDC has procured around 3,20,000 masks worth Rs 35 lakh from the women. “Officials from the state health department have trained them in manufacturing the masks following hygiene and safety guidelines. Major part of this training was given through digital platforms,” said Shraddha Joshi Sharma, director,SWDC.“As most of these women know how to stitch, they have learned quickly. We also do quality checks of the mask,” said she added.The women were also given gloves and hand sanitizers for manufacturing the masks. As they cannot go out to buy raw materials, the state is supplying them at their doorsteps. “We procure the raw materials from the government accredited vendors. They give us the list of requirements and according on a weekly basis, we give them the materials,” said R Vimala, CEO of MSRLM. Under their scheme, over 3,20,000 masks have been manufactured incurring a sale worth Rs 40 lakh. But procuring raw material has become a challenge during the lockdown which is also increasing the price of the masks. Though Bhiwandi is considered a textile hub, officers there are also struggling to procure raw materials. “Due to the rise in the demand of raw materials at some places, the masks are being sold at a higher price,” added Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-women-from-rural-maharashtra-make-6l-masks/story-f2E53swv85F90rFBfcqO5H.html

The district administration has taken over around 785 rooms in 10 hotels in Noida and Greater Noida for the purpose.Hotels which have been taken over by the administration are Jaypee Resort in Greater Noida, Grand Heritage Resort in Greater Noida, Hotel Ginger in Noida, Radisson Blue in Greater Noida and Noida, Gold View in Noida, Mozaic in Noida, The Stellar Gymkhana in Greater Noida, SAA Hospitality PVT Limited in Greater Noida and Savoy Suites in Greater Noida. The district administration has also started a call centre from Saturday to address various issues of the public related to the Covid-19 outbreak. It received over 500 calls by Sunday evening. The integrated control centre has been set up by HCL Technologies at one of its facilities in Noida, with the support of the district administration, the police, the health department and the Noida and Greater Noida authorities. By calling on the helpline number -- 1800 419 2211-- people can get in touch with a team of doctors and if they have any symptoms, then they can opt to remain quarantined at any of the 10 hotels. A person can choose a five-star room for ₹2,500, a four-star one for ₹2,000, three-star facility for ₹1,500 and a budget stay for ₹800.According to officials, there are many who are not comfortable with staying at the government quarantine facilities and refer to remain in home quarantine. Such persons might come in contact with others, which can lead to a further spread of the virus. So officials are expecting that people will now opt to pay for a comfortable stay, without risking the health of others around them.The district administration has free quarantine centres at the Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar hostel in Greater Noida and the new district hospital building in Sector 39.“We have taken over certain parts of a few hotels in Noida and Greater Noida. Tariff for the hotel quarantine facilities has been fixed. There will be a fixed menu for three meals daily, plus evening tea and snack. The cost will include all expanses such as GST, services and food. We are hoping that people will be encouraged to stay in hotel quarantine,” Suhas LY, district magistrate, said.The toll-free call centre, apart from having doctors to address queries, also has the option to help those in need of food or rations. There is also an option to provide information about people suspected of having the disease and needing medical attention. The call centre is also linked with the police in case anyone requires police assistance.Of the 500 calls received till Sunday evening, over 50% were related to food issues. “A majority of callers want food or rations. We are getting these delivered with the help of government network, private organisations and local volunteers. A lot of people have been calling to inform us about persons whom they think have symptoms of the infection. People have been confusing a regular cold or cough with Covid-19. Our team of doctors is helping all such persons,” Rajiv Rai, subdivisional magistrate, Dadri, said.The health department is also going to make people in quarantine install a mobile app through which officials can keep a tab on their movement. Officials have also given an order to start stamping those in quarantine..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/suspected-patients-can-opt-for-comfy-hotels-to-get-quarantined/story-SZ0e9sbcXAAZ9tBkN3lX4H.html

While in one of the cases, the deceased has been a close contact of a Covid-19 positive case, the cause of infection in the other two cases is not known.The death of the 52-year-old-man with co-morbid conditions was reported in the afternoon on Saturday and the 60-year-old woman, who had earlier tested negative, was brought dead to the Sassoon General Hospital the same day. She later tested positive for the coronavirus infection. In the third case, a 77-year-old woman who had recently undergone a gall bladder operation was declared dead on Sunday noon at the Aundh district hospital.“The 52-year-old man who lived at Kashiwadi had diabetes and hypertension and was declared dead at Sassoon on Saturday noon. However, his test reports came in late on Saturday night in which his swab samples were found to be positive,” Dr Ajay Chandanwale, the dean of BJ Medical College, said. The deceased did not have any foreign travel history.“The 60-year-old woman was earlier admitted to the Naidu Hospital and had tested negative for the infection. She was brought dead to Sassoon, we took her swab samples to find out the cause of death and she tested positive for Covid-19 infection,” Dr Chandanwale added. The deceased was the first contact of a Covid-19 positive patient. She was a resident of Laxminagar, Yerawada.A senior official from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said, “The detection of virus depends on the viral load at the time of collecting the swab. It is possible that the viral load at the time of testing the woman on April 1 was nominal that it went undetected or it could also be possible that she was exposed to the virus later after she got discharged from here.”The third case is that of a 77-year-old woman residing at Gultekdi who had a post-operative infection and also tested positive for Covid-19 infection. Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, civil surgeon at Aundh district hospital, said, “The woman underwent an operation at a private hospital for gall bladder on March 31 after which she reported of stomach ache and fever. After the operation, it was found out that she developed post-operative infection and so she was referred to the Naidu Hospital from where she was brought to Aundh hospital on April 2 at around midnight. She was supplied oxygen through oxygen mask, but as her condition deteriorated we shifted her on ventilator on Sunday morning and within 2-3 hours she was declared dead. Her death is associated to Covid-19 along with other causes.”The first Covid-19 related death in the city was reported after a 52-year-old businessman died at the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital on March 30 and a 50-year-old woman passed away on April 2 at Sassoon General Hospital. With these fresh deaths, the final toll in the city due to Covid-19 rises to five as of Sunday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/within-24-hours-pune-city-records-three-deaths-toll-rises-to-five/story-8EZbrzCvGzMLWxf6NMEZkM.html

The directives were issues by civic commissioner Vijay Singhal who also asked private hospitals to categorise the patients according to risk factor.With the increasing number of cases of coronavirus in the city, the civic body has asked private hospitals to screen patients with fever and flu-like symptoms to ease the pressure on government hospitals. As a number of patients visit private clinics that do not have separate arrangements for Covid-19 patients, a dedicated OPD will ensure the hospital and existing patients are not exposed to the outbreak.Deputy municipal commissioner Sandeep Malvi said, “The patients are supposed to be categorised in three categories. The first category will include patients who have returned from foreign countries in the last 28 days. In the second category, hospitals will categorise close contacts of the travellers who had returned from a foreign trip, which will mainly include their family members and people who visited them.”The third category will include people who are experiencing symptoms like fever, sore throat, cough, cold or breathlessness.Malvi added, “We are checking all low-risk and high-risk contacts of the people who have tested positive for Covid-19. The hospitals who examine patients belonging any of the three categories or those showing symptoms should ensure that patients maintain a distance of one or two metre between each other. The hospitals will also guide suspected patients to government-approved testing centres for confirmation. They are also supposed to send the names of suspected or confirmed patients to the civic body.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tmc-asks-private-hospitals-to-set-up-special-opd/story-vopXqsWTQonH68KieWcE7J.html
05-04-2020||Delhi||CISF to provide enhanced protective gear to troops when airports, Delhi Metro resume ops: Report||The CISF is “augmenting” COVID-19 protective gear and healthcare paraphernalia for its over 40,000 personnel who will begin having close physical interaction with lakhs of passengers once airports and the Delhi Metro re-start operations, a top official said. The force has “spruced up” measures on anti-coronavirus protection for its troops after 11 of them in Mumbai tested positive for the viral infection that has claimed thousands of lives and infected about 10 lakh people globally. These personnel are understood to have picked the pandemic infection from a trooper who was on duty of physical frisking and baggage screening at the Mumbai international airport.“We are augmenting our resources in terms of better masks, gloves and sanitisation facilities. Security desks are being re-done to ensure proper distance between passengers and personnel without security protocols being compromised. “We will have more robust logistics in place during the next round of operations at airports and Delhi Metro, whenever they begin,” CISF Director General (DG) Rajesh Ranjan told PTI. The CISF has 63 civil airports of the country under its security cover at present along with the Delhi Metro and they witness lakhs of passenger footfalls every day. “We are confident that we will have much better equipment to handle the situation (in the coming days) at these two large public transport facilities where our personnel have a close physical interaction with passengers as well as other units,” the force chief said. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) deploys about 32,000 personnel as part of its aviation security group (ASG) to guard airports and about 12,000 troops to protect the Delhi Metro which is the lifeline of national capital region including Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Faridabad. The government has not announced as to when operations at these vital public transport facilities, shut till April 14 due to the ongoing nation-wide lockdown due to coronavirus, will resume.A force spokesperson added that the ICICI Bank “has donated 16,000 masks and 10,000 gloves for CISF personnel deployed at the Delhi Metro.” “We are incredibly thankful to the bank for this humane gesture and noble deed. It will certainly help front-line warriors of CISF in the war against COVID-19,” he said.DG Ranjan said his troops remained steadfast in the line of duty during the first phase of the COVID-19 when the “numbers of passengers were quite overwhelming” due to the incoming and outgoing evacuation and regular flights. “We created an ideal scenario in terms of social distancing at the airports but the resources were not in surplus and the task was demanding,” the DG said. The airport units helped in the entry and exit of numerous flights that brought in Indians evacuated from virus affected countries and ensured proper security-cleared departure of special and regular flights as the global airspace started closing, he said.“At the Delhi airport a special triage area was created at the tarmac to assist incoming passengers,” he said. “These personnel are still at the airports ensuring that special flights with citizens of other countries fly out safely,” the DG said.  The force, he said, has also created isolation facilities in all its 349 units of deployment across the country.“We are enhancing beds in these isolation wards so that more personnel can be accommodated in case of requirement,” the DG said. The about 1.62 lakh personnel strong force has its maximum duties in one-to-one public interaction domain whether it is securing public or private sector enterprises, government ministries and departments and vital nuclear and aerospace installations. The first positive case in the force was reported on March 28 after a head constable was found infected in Mumbai. Officials said he has been found negative in three more tests conducted for COVID-19 till now.“Even the 10 other personnel who were found positive and are in isolation now were asymptomatic when their samples were taken. It was the foresight of our commanders who thought of testing all the personnel who resided in the same campus where the first positive person was living,” the DG said. This CISF camp in Navi Mumbai has now been vacated and sanitised and all 145 personnel living there have been quarantined by the force at various other facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cisf-to-provide-enhanced-protective-gear-to-troops-when-airports-delhi-metro-resume-ops-dg/story-yitheJdzjiZu85smj5wAsI.html

Experts have said the increasing number of cases in Dharavi among people with no travel history is alarming considering its dense population spread across 600 acres.The spike in cases, which has been largely attributed to the Tablighi Jamaat’s international congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi between March 13 and 15, has forced the state government to ramp up its preventive measures.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had said during his Facebook address on Saturday that the state has been taking appropriate measures to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.“Yes, coronavirus cases are increasing because we are testing more people. We are further increasing testing capacity in Mumbai as the city recorded maximum cases,” Thackeray said.Also read: New plan holds clues to unlocking countryHe had also said that the state government has traced all those who attended the Tablighi Jamaat’s international congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin and put them in isolation facilities. “As per protocol, every day the central government sends a list of people who attended the congregation to the state. Till today, from the names received, we have traced 100% of them, and all have been kept in the isolation wards,” he said. He appealed to others who had attended the Tabligh-e-Jamaat congregation to come forward and contact civic authorities so that appropriate treatment could be provided to them if they have any coronavirus symptoms.Amid coronavirus outbreak in the state, Thackeray had warned about fake news and viral messages being spread on social media platforms. He said strong action would be taken against spreading communal messages.“Like coronavirus, there is another virus that is trying to divide our society. I am warning people to refrain from it. Coronavirus has no religion. I am warning all of you. No one can save you from the action,” he had said.State health minister Rajesh Tope has assured the state government has adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and has initiated discussion with the central government on their supply. “There is no need to worry over PPE equipment. As of now, we have 25,000 PPE kits, more than 25,00,000 N95 masks, and more than 25,00,000 triple-layer masks and 3000 ventilators in government hospitals. The central government has assured that they will acquire equipment for the state and provide us,” the minister said.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in its efforts to crack down on the spread of coronavirus, has identified 241 containment zones in Mumbai city.These containment zones have a large number of people who have to be quarantined because of their possible contact with Covid-19 patients. They are also being monitored by civic authorities by using the close circuit television (CCTV) cameras.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-update-26-new-covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra-tally-so-far-661/story-EPP5GL8ZQAMbAqmY0trAbO.html

When you enter, on your left are three rows of work stations and 30 screens on the walls. Each row has eight work stations - with three computer screens each - tracking every movement on the streets of Jaipur, and routinely watching the feed from 15 drones hovering over the walled city areas.Every suspicious or illegal activity is reported to the police station concerned. On the right, on 16 screens, calls to police are being tracked.Welcome to the ‘corona war room’ of Jaipur Police.“We monitor live feed from 800 cameras all across the city. 150 of them are PTZ cameras that can rotate 360 degrees, the remaining are fixed,” says Adarsh Choudhary, Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) and one of the three officers in charge of the war room.More on Covid-19:• Covid-19: Your guide to staying safe• Covid-19: What you need to know today• Can Covid-19 spread after symptoms end?• How coronavirus is different from seasonal flu and common coldWith the help of these cameras, Jaipur Police are ensuring compliance of the lockdown in the city. Out of the 800 cameras, 176 are in the walled city and 22 of them are PTZ cameras.For narrow and congested lanes and by-lanes, there are drones that fly over rooftops to detect illegal activities such as gatherings of more than five people.“The drone footage is monitored by respective police station areas,” said Jitendra Singh Rathore, station house officer of Manak Chowk police station, which is on one gateway to the Ramganj area - the first to be put under curfew after 45-year-old man tested positive for coronavirus disease Covid-19 on March 26.The man transmitted the virus to at least 20 members of his family, sparking fears of community transmission.The area under seven police stations in the walled city - Ramganj, Kotwali, Manak Chowk, Brahmpuri, Nahargarh and Galta Gate - is under curfew since March 28.“Our cameras are in the marketplace and at other prominent locations. We can track activities on main roads with them. For lanes and by-lanes, we needed more eyes in the sky to keep track, especially because of the curfew,” said Ajay Pal Lamba, Additional Commissioner of Police (Law and Order).The police officer, who shot to fame in 2013 when he led the police action against Asaram Bapu as deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Jodhpur West, also gets drone footage on his mobile phone, which he kept checking even as he spoke to Hindustan Times.There were some reports of people rushing to their rooftops to see the whizzing drones flying over them but the police had no problem with that. “As long as they stay indoors and maintain social distancing, we have no problem,” Lamba said.Meanwhile, in the war room, three additional SPs are in charge in three shifts - 6 am to 2 pm, 2 pm to 10 pm and 10 pm to 6 am. The call-in facility has two PRI (Primary Rate Interface) lines that can handle 60 calls at a time. A PRI line enables traditional phone lines to carry voice, data and video traffic.Four screens in the middle of the left wall display calls in progress. Constables in plainclothes monitor the work stations and routine rotate the PTZ cameras for better views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/covid-19-lockdown-800-cameras-15-drones-are-jaipur-police-s-eyes-in-the-sky/story-r2BDUy1V4MCyyNKywuVsLO.html

The district, adjoining Delhi, has recorded the maximum number of 227 COVID-19 cases in the state, according to official figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/8-new-covid-19-cases-in-noida-total-count-in-gautam-buddh-nagar-58/story-CeRUhzgoSc9sc7hl3vKtNN.html
05-04-2020||Ranchi||Covid-19 sample collection mobile booth becomes operational in Chaibasa||Chaibasa now has country’s first-of-its-kind coronavirus swab sample collection booth, which is expected to reduce the need of PPE kits substantially and save crores of money, at the district headquarters of West Singhbhum district, an official said on Saturday.One such mobile collection booth will also be launched on Monday.District deputy commissioner Arava Rajkamal and civil surgeon Dr Manju Dubey launched the static booth in Chaibasa on Saturday. The booth — look alike a phone booth — has been designed and developed by DDC Aditya Ranjan and two engineers from district rural development agency.“This is a booth fully protected by PPE kit and will house a single health staffer dressed in PPE kit. Fitted with microphone and a U-shaped table, the health staffer will direct the suspected patient to open his/her month and bring the nose closure and he will (gloved hands) collect the swabs from mouth and nose. Then the patient will be asked to seal it and the staff will collect the sample and drop it in the virus transport media (VTM) kit for transporting to the Covid-19 testing centres. This is the first such collection centre in the country,” said Ranjan. As per Ranjan, this will help reduce the use of PPE kits and also save much money. “At present, three people — all dressed in PPE kits — go for collecting samples from a single suspected corona patient and destroy the PPE kit after collecting the sample. However, this single health staffer in the booth will now collect all the samples patient-wise. A PPE kit costs about ₹600 to ₹3,000 and every district has an average requirement of 1,000-2,000 PPE kits now. Whereas this one-time booth has cost us ₹15,000 to ₹20,000,” said Ranjan, underlining the huge savings of both PPE kits and money.Rajkamal said the district has sent 47 samples till Saturday for testing of which 40 have come negative and result of seven was still awaited. “We have already used over 150 PPE kits and spent ₹1.5 lakh. But with this collection booth in place, much money will be saved and shortage of PPE kits too could be addressed effectively. We are going to launch a mobile booth on Monday which will go to different places and collect at least 100 samples a day,” said Rajkamal.TMH ready with 500 beds, 37 CCU beds to treat Corona+ casesMeanwhile, Tata Steel general manager (GM, medical services) Dr Ranjan Chowdhary Tata Main Hospital (TMH) was now ready with over 500 isolation beds and 37 critical care unit (CCU) beds to treat Corona positive patients. “We had sent 60 samples so far of which 47 have come negative while reports of 13 more patients are still awaited. We will start Coronavirus testing ourselves as soon as we get ICMR approval,” Dr Chowdhary told a con-call press conference this evening.

Both the hospitals have two machines each.“In order to effectively contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state, four new machines, two each at Ranchi’s Itki hospital and Dhanbad’s PMCH, have been installed to get more tests done. ICMR’s mandatory permission to conduct the tests with these four machines have been obtained. There are still some formalities that are required to be completed to make the machines functional. The machines will start working in a couple of days,” said Banna Gupta, health minister.PMCH principal Dr Shailendra Kumar, however, explained that the machines with testing kits have arrived. “A doctor and a clinical staffer would soon visit Jamshedpur’s MGMMCH for a three-day training. Once they would return here, sample testing would begin,” he said.On Friday, state chief secretary Sukhdeo Singh had held a meeting with top officials and all deputy commissioners and issued a slew of directions to them. He said after detection of two coronavirus-positive cases, the state has entered in the second stage of this pandemic.“This is a time of crisis. Casual approach will not be tolerated. Our cumulative efforts should be aimed at to track all suspects of Covid-19 and get them isolated and tested so that we can prevent the pandemic from entering into the third stage. But we have to also keep our preparations ready for dealing with third stage,” he said.He asked all deputy commissioners to prepare a blueprint for this and constitute 10-20 survey teams in their respective areas. He also asked the authorities to provide recreation facility to people quarantined at government centres and take regular feedback of people in home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/four-new-covid-19-testing-machines-in-ranchi-dhanbad-to-start-functioning-next-week/story-YPY0M1S3QDlFAbovZ9qGqM.html
05-04-2020||Ranchi||Decision on financial aid to people after lockdown gets over: Oraon||The state government is currently focusing on providing relief and health care to those in need and it would ponder over extending financial aid to vulnerable sections only after the national lockdown is lifted, finance minister and Jharkhand Congress president Rameshwar Oraon said on Saturday.“As there is national lockdown, the priority of the government at this stage to provide food and health care to those who have been hit due to this crisis. The government has taken several initiatives for it. Once the lockdown is over, the government would brainstorm over providing financial package to vulnerable groups,” said Oraon.The statement comes in the mid of the 21-day national lockdown to mitigate spread of the contagious Covid-19. With the entire country coming to a standstill, several social groups especially the daily wagers, migrant workers and those employed in the unorganised sectors have been hit the maximum.The Centre has announced a package of 1.7 lakh crore to be spent under several measures targeted at these vulnerable sections. However, people in the state, including elected representatives, have also been raising such demands from the state government to extend financial help for the vulnerable sections.CPI (ML) legislator Vinod Singh demanded the state government to provide help in line with schemes announced by other governments.“I urge chief minister Hemant Soren to follow the experiment of Arvind Kejriwal government. They are providing ₹5,000 to auto rickshaw drivers. Lakhs of migrant labourers from Jharkhand are stuck in different states. They do not have money even to eat, return home. If we do not help them, who else would?” said Singh.Congress coordination committee to look into relief workOraon, who is also the state unit president of ruling Congress, said while the government is taking several measures to execute the plans of the government to provide all possible help, committees have been formed to provide feedback about the work on ground.“Monitoring committees have been formed up to the block level. We are getting feedback and suggestions from several parts of the states. We are taking all measures to provide adequate relief,” said Oraon.The party has formed a state-level coordination committee which includes Roshan Lal Bhatia, Pradeep Tulasyan, Alok Dubey, Kishore Nath Shahdeo and Rajesh Gupta. State president Rameshwar Oraon chaired a meeting with the committee at the party state headquarters on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/decision-on-financial-aid-to-people-after-lockdown-gets-over-oraon/story-YtBHfX1hNWrTgv5CC5wOVN.html
05-04-2020||Chandigarh||Cycling home to meet sick dad, Rajouri man may shake admn’s quarantine plans||The UT administration is in a quandary over the arrival of a Rajouri resident from Mumbai, who is currently pedalling his way home to meet his ailing father.Senior officials believe that coming from Maharashtra makes him a potential case of coronavirus and 14-day quarantine would be essential upon entry.Mohammad Arif, who works as a security guard at Libra Tower in Mumbai’s Bandra West, left the city on Thursday with all but ₹600 for the gruelling journey on a decrepit bicycle he bought from a friend to meet his bedridden father. He said he decided to embark on the 2,100-km travel after he received a call about his dad’s ill health on Tuesday.When asked about the probable course of action upon Arif’s arrival, deputy magistrates of Kathua – the gateway to J&K – and Rajouri, O P Bhagat and Mohammad Nazir Sheikh, cited the strict guidelines in place to check the community transmission of Covid-19.Bhagat said, “When he reaches here, Arif will be quarantined for 14 days at Lakhanpur. Administratively speaking, there is no space for emotions. We pray for his father’s speedy recovery. God forbid he doesn’t make it, one life would be lost, but if Arif is infected, letting him go to Rajouri would prove fatal for several others. We are already in the community transmission stage and can’t take risk.”Stressing the importance of quarantine, Bagat said, “Arif is coming from Maharashtra and that makes him a potential case. Even if we presume he was fine in Mumbai, he will be crossing Gujarat, Rajasthan and Punjab. If he contracts the infection in Punjab and reaches Lakhanpur, how would we know about his health status? Thus, he has to be quarantined for 14 days.”Bhagat’s counterpart Sheikh said, “We are trying to locate him, but his phone is switched off. A police officer was sent to his home in Manjakote area on Friday. The medical reports of his father, who suffered brain stroke, are awaited.”Seconding that Arif should not be allowed to enter the UT without quarantine, Sheikh added, “We will take up the matter with the Kathua administration and the higher authorities. But even if he is allowed to head to Rajouri, he will first be quarantined here for 14 days,” said Sheikh.Meanwhile, a senior bureaucrat in the administration opined that the case should be handled with sensitivity. “We will try to send him till Rajouri (from Lakhanpur) if things are in control. He can be quarantined in Rajouri. This is a sensitive issue and should be dealt with care. We will take a call on his arrival,” he said.Citing the intricacy of the situation, the senior official said, “We don’t want anyone to be stopped, but the current situation demands so. Thousands of persons have been stopped for isolation at Lakhanpur. Any deviation in the policy will force us to allow everyone and that would be a breach of the lockdown,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cycling-home-to-meet-sick-dad-rajouri-man-may-shake-admn-s-quarantine-plans/story-Kl4mSmuNqua70sWYMysldI.html
05-04-2020||Patna||70-yr-old woman dies waiting for Covid-19 test at Patna’s IGIMS||A 70-year-old woman died, waiting for coronavirus (Covid-19) screening, on the third day of being admitted to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), family members said on Saturday.Alleging medical negligence, family members said the doctors were reluctant to attend to the woman, taking her to be a Covid-19 patient.“My aunt was a patient of asthma for the last 10 years. The doctors at IGIMS, however, took her as a Covid-19 suspect. They prescribed RT PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) screening for Covid-19, and were reluctant to attend to her unless her laboratory report came,” said Raj Kishore Prasad ‘Sadhu’, a close relative of the deceased.The doctor, who initially examined the woman when she turned up at the emergency, wrote “urgent” while prescribing RT PCR of nasopharyngeal swab for Covid-19 on the institute’s letter pad. However, none bothered to collect her sample for three days before her death at the institute Saturday morning, he claimed.“We met the higher-ups in the hospital to instruct the paramedics or doctors concerned to take her nasopharyngeal swab, but no one turned up. Finally, her medical condition worsened last evening and she was taken to the intensive care unit. She was declared dead this morning,” he added.The IGIMS death certificate mentioned “cardio-pulmonary arrest” as the immediate cause of death. It also mentioned “chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with cor pulmonale” (abnormal enlargement of the right side of the heart as a result of disease of the lungs or the pulmonary blood vessels) and “acute renal failure” as antecedent cause of the patient’s death.The Hindustan Times has copies of the patient’s death certificate and doctor’s advice for RT PCR of nasopharyngeal swab for Covid-19.Dr Arshad Ahmad, additional professor of medicine, under whose unit the patient was admitted, did not respond to this reporter’s phone calls or text message.Hospital administrators, too, were evasive.“I am not looking after Covid-19 cases or their suspects. You may please speak to the competent authority,” said IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal.“One of our junior doctors had advised the Covid-19 test, which was not required and later deleted from the patient’s medical file after our institute was designated a non-Covid-19 hospital. Our doctors, however, did not neglect the patient, who was suffering from hypertension, diabetes, metabolic acidosis (when the body produces too much acid) and COPD. She was admitted to the high dependency unit before being shifted to ICU, where she died,” said medical superintendent-II Dr Gopal Krishan, who is also the coordinator for corona related management at the institute.The IGIMS began RT PCR screening for Covid-19 from March 24. Its director Dr NR Biswas had then admitted that his paramedics were reluctant to take nasopharyngeal samples for Covid-19.“I have told them I will terminate their services if they do not collect samples after our dean and head of microbiology, Dr SK Shahi, showed them the way to do it,” Dr Biswas had then told this reporter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/70-yr-old-woman-dies-waiting-for-covid-19-test-at-patna-s-igims/story-aM6shQK7QvYnq4kmzU2FVI.html
05-04-2020||Patna||Two booked for sheltering 10 Myanmar natives||Two people were booked for providing shelter to 10 foreign nationals in Darbhanga, said police on Saturday.Darbhanga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Babu Ram said the accused were identified as Mohammad Salim and Mohammad Jaifee. The duo was booked under the Foreigners Act following the statement of the station house officer (SHO) H N Singh.The SSP said the matter came to light when police headquarters informed them that a foreign national was hiding in a mosque after attending the Nizamuddin Markaz function. Following the information, a special police team was dispatched to investigate the matter and found that about 10 Myanmar nationals had been illegally staying in the mosque till March 21, said the SSP. All of them left for Delhi via Patna on March 24, he said.“They came here on tourist visa and got involved in religious activities in violation of the visa rules,” the SSP added.“They didn’t inform the local intelligence office or the SSP’s office about their arrival in the Darbhanga town and their guides hid their movement from authorities, which was also violation of the Foreigners Act,” Babu Ram said.He told that the police also informed immigration department about the same and requested them to cancel their visas. The SSP also directed to all the participants of the Nizamuddin event or those who came in contact with the Myanmar nationals to get checked and declare their travel and contact history at the earliest.Bihar police have identified more than 100 foreign nationals, who had come to the state at different stages on tourist visas but some of these foreigners joined the Jamaat.The police said that the local imams (priests) of the mosques did not inform the authorities about the presence of the foreign nationals had attended the recent religious event at Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi. Meanwhile, the ministry of home affairs directed the Bihar police to sternly deal with anyone not cooperating with the authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/two-booked-for-sheltering-10-myanmar-natives/story-YXu9shSwhL766nLDzyAXUO.html

He was also involved in two cases of vehicle theft in Chandigarh and was out on bail. He has used a stolen Honda Activa and two motorcycles for snatchings in Panchkula,” said the inspector.On April 1, the accused fled with a 32-year-old woman’s handbag near Sector 10 on a Honda Activa, he said.

05-04-2020||Chandigarh||Implementation of cow cess in Chandigarh deferred due to coronavirus curfew||The implementation of cow cess that the UT had notified last month and that was to come into force from April 1 has once again been deferred, this time due to the lockdown.On the sale of four-wheelers and two-wheelers, the cess was decided at ₹500 and ₹200, respectively. A cess of 2 paisa per unit was finalised on electricity consumption. The cess was fixed at ₹5 per bottle for the sale of country-made liquor and beer, and ₹10 per bottle on the sale of Indian-made foreign liquor.A senior official of the municipal corporation said since the sale of liquor and sale of vehicle registration are banned in the city for now, “At most, we can get some revenue by levying the tax on electricity consumption.”PENDING SINCE JULY 2018The MC had hoped to earn ₹15 crore revenue per year from implementing the cow cess to help with running of three gaushalas and two cattle pounds, sheltering over 1,000 stray cattle in the city, and in making the city roads free of stray cattle.The agenda was approved last year but the implementation got delayed due to confusion over applicability of the Punjab Slaughter Act in Chandigarh. Later, it was decided that since the Act was passed before the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966, there was no need for a separate process to adopt and apply the Act in Chandigarh. On January 17, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had given his nod, paving way for the MC to levy the cess that was approved in July 2018.WATER MISUSE FINE DEFERREDMC has also deferred the levying of water misuse fine from April 7. The ₹2000 penalty that was earlier imposed on watering of lawns, washing of cars and leakages in water tanks has been put on hold since all MC staff is deployed on emergency duties to deal with corona outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/implementation-of-cow-cess-in-chandigarh-deferred-due-to-coronavirus-curfew/story-g19y2bNyUagTFLp1DiQopK.html
05-04-2020||City||Infected Ludhiana woman’s two relatives, Dera Bassi village panch test positive in Mohali||Two women of Mohali’s Sector 91, both close contacts of a coronavirus-infected Ludhiana woman, tested positive for the disease on Saturday. A 42-year-old panch of Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi also tested positive for Covid-19, taking the count to 15 in the district. The Sector-91 women, aged 55 and 80, are relatives of the 69-year-old woman from Ludhiana’s Shimlapuri area, who tested positive on April 2, and was staying with them. The Ludhiana woman was rushed to Fortis Hospital in Mohali on March 23 after she experienced a sudden drop in her sugar levels, diarrhoea and difficulty breathing, but was later shifted to Ludhiana, where her report on April 2 confirmed she was Covid-19 positive. Civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said they sampled six relatives of the woman on Friday and got three reports on Saturday that confirmed two women were positive. “We will be shifting them to Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur,” he said. While the Ludhiana woman had no history of foreign travel, she had travelled to Mohali via Punbus on March 17 to visit her niece here. “Out of the total 54 samples taken from Jagatpura village, where a 55-year-old man had tested positive on April 1, 51 have tested negative and three reports are awaited,” Dr Singh said. He added that all 11 patients admitted in various hospitals in the district were stable and responding well to treatment. DC, SDM VISIT KUMBRA, MAULI BAIDWAN A day after two out of the three men from Mohali who attended Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz event at Nizamuddin in Delhi last month tested positive for Covid-19, deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan and sub-divisional magistrate Jagdeep Sehgal visited Kumbra village in Sector 68 and Mauli Baidwan in Sector 80. DC said since both areas were densely populated and both positive patients had been socialising since their return from Delhi on March 17, they had urged people to stay indoors. Even though the district administration has already sealed both the villages, residents have also set up barricades on all entry points, banning further entry or exit.Health department teams also carried out door-to-door survey in both villages, screening 3,615 people.District nodal officer Dr Harmandeep Kaur and senior medical officer Dr Kuljeet Kaur monitored the survey and sampling work. They said 25 samples were collected from Mauli Baidwan and six from Sector 68. These have been sent to PGIMER, Chandigarh, for results. Dr Harman said most samples were collected as a precautionary measure, and residents were asked to inform health officials at helpline number 104 if any person was symptomatic. Meanwhile, people from Jagatpura, Mauli Baidwan and Kumbra villages, who had tested negative, have been quarantined at the hostel of the Government School for Meritorious Students in Sector 70 for 14 days. Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Jagdeep Sehgal said, “As many as 70 rooms in the hostel have been set aside for people in quarantine, and 20 are occupied.” PANCH OFTEN SERVED LANGAR IN HIS VILLAGEThe panch had been socialising with villagers at Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi since the coronavirus outbreak, and had even served langar several times. Brother of the village sarpanch, the 42-year-old first visited Jeevan Jyoti Hospital in Dera Bassi, where a doctor attended to him and referred him to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Sector 32, Chandigarh, when he complained of breathlessness on April 2. He was admitted in GMCH and tested positive on Saturday.There were about 200 patients in the private hospital at the time, and he had interacted with many of them. Consequently, Dera Bassi SDM Kuldeep Bawa said, they had quarantined the private hospital’s doctor, who attended to the panch, along with the doctor’s wife and their six-month-old child. “Process is also on to seal Jeevan Jyoti Hospital and trace the panch’s contacts,” the SDM said. RAN FACTORY OPERATIONS AMID CURFEWSources said the panch runs a tent house and a tile factory in Dera Bassi, and had been running the factory operations despite the curfew in Punjab. When police visited the factory for checking on Saturday, the workers ran out and hid in the nearby fields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/infected-ludhiana-woman-s-two-relatives-dera-bassi-village-panch-test-positive-in-mohali/story-2Lg6q569hXAdslc1ZlSqnO.html
05-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus outbreak in Chandigarh: Administration asks private doctors to voluntarily join mobile squads||The UT administration has decided to rope in private doctors for providing health care to senior citizens on a voluntary basis.With private hospitals shutting down their outdoor patient departments (OPD) and private clinics closing doors to patients in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, the administration is working out a plan to utilise the services of private doctors now.The plan is to have mobile teams that will be available on call to reach patients in their homes in case of emergency.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said, “Many doctors must be free now. We are planning to have mobile squads of such doctors who can go to attend to senior citizens who can’t come to the hospital due to the curfew.” Parida also tweeted on the issue seeking volunteers for joining these mobile squads.As highlighted by the Hindustan Times earlier, patients suffering from diseases other than Covid-19 are finding it hard to connect with doctors because of the curfew. Severe restrictions on movement, particularly vehicles, has been imposed during the curfew, which will last at least ten more days. The administration wants to address the problem by using the services of the private doctors.‘WELCOME MOVE, BUT ASSURE PROTECTION’Doctors in the city have welcomed the administration’s decision, but have also sought assurances that protective equipment and security will be provided to them.“In principle, it was much needed. More than 80% of the doctors in the country work in the private sector. Their services must be used in times like these. But the important question is how the administration plans to implement this decision,” asked Dr Neeraj Nagpal, convener, Medicos Legal Action Group, Chandigarh.Doctors say because of coronavirus, extra precautions have to be taken. “Personal protective equipment (PPE) has to be provided to all doctors, especially those visiting people’s houses. Similarly, doctors should only be asked for general check up of patients and examine them for acute problems. They can’t give medical care to all the patients in their houses, because for that they have to go in depth into their case histories,” said Dr Neeraj Kumar, former president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Chandigarh.Administration officials say protection will be given to all doctors coming forward to be part of the mobile doctor squads. Dr Rajesh Dhir, president, IMA, and head of department, ENT, at Government Multi-Speciality Hospital, Sector 16, said, “Whatsoever protection, equipment required will be provided.”“Doctors from the private sector are already coming forward to help. A list of all doctors is being compiled,” said Dr Dhir.LIST OF DOCS FOR BACKUP BEING PREPARED: PARIDAAdministration is working on compiling a list of private doctors who can act as a reserve or back-up for government doctors for managing coronavirus patients, said UT adviser Manoj Parida. In case government doctors can’t continue with their work, services of these private doctors could be banked upon, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-outbreak-in-chandigarh-administration-asks-private-doctors-to-voluntarily-join-mobile-squads/story-Kw6XiRZRhdpEtZzCLgY5mL.html
05-04-2020||Chandigarh||1,536 vehicles challaned in Chandigarh since curfew imposed||Despite a curfew imposed in the city since March 23, people have been pushing their luck and venturing out onto the roads. From that day on, working in coordination with local police, the traffic police have challaned a total of 1,536 vehicles for violating curfew. Most violations were due to not possessing the right set of documents and traffic police have impounded 1,363 vehicles since.As per data, 1,536 vehicles have been challaned for a total of 3,819 violations, most of which have to do with lack of relevant documents including driving license, registration certificates or expired third party insurance. On an average, traffic police are issuing between 100 to 200 challans these days, whereas before the curfew, they were issuing between 500 and 600 challans a day. Policemen attribute lower numbers to lesser traffic and a shift in their working.Explaining this, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic administration) Kewal Krishan said, “Currently we are setting up nakas only to check those breaking the curfew. At the naka, documents of the driver are checked whereas during traffic nakas documents are only checked when a driver is committing a visible violation. This is why so many people have been challaned. Traffic Violation Information Slips (TVIS) challans are also being issued through the social media profiles and Whatsapp number of the traffic police.”Krishan added that since cops are not needed to be deployed to manage traffic jams in the city, they have been assigned to check markets and residential areas to spread awareness and urge people to stay indoors. They are also helping distribute food and rations to needy people in colonies across the city.The use of breathalysers has also been suspended to contain the epidemic and no challans for drunken driving have been issued after March 10, when on the day two people were booked for drunken driving. Police said that with curfew restrictions and ban on opening liquor stores, the likelihood of people driving in a drunk state was considerably less.On Saturday morning too, the traffic police had set up a naka in Dhanas between 9 am and 1pm and impounded 32 two wheelers and one auto for not having a movement pass. Anyone found driving without a movement pass was to be considered violating curfew. The violator would be challaned and their vehicle impounded. A total of 1,363 vehicles have been impounded this way.BOXHED: Challans issued during curfewINTRO: Despite curfew, people have been venturing out on the roads, that too without mandatory documentsTotal traffic violations____________3819Driving without license/expired license/failing to produce license__________1712Driving without insurance/with expired third party insurance____ 839Driving without RC_______________ 802Riding without helmet____________ _280Driving without seat belt___________ 23Triple riding_____________________14||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/1-536-vehicles-challaned-in-chandigarh-since-curfew-imposed/story-MgHd12EhoLHFmNQ6a2YLDJ.html

05-04-2020||City||Lockdown is beyond doubt, but execution is not||Many of us were hoping that after the botched demonetisation exercise and the shoddy implementation of the GST regime, the Union government would have learnt that major executive calls require better planning. Sadly, the present lockdown proves the Centre has failed to understand the issues and implications of this pandemic.The US may enjoy some degree of protection from the oceans. But when you share a land border with China, the onus is on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to act early, and act decisively.With 70 days to prepare, the public expected better from the Union government. Whether history will be kind to the NDA government on this issue remains to be seen, but announcing a 21-day lockdown with no notice and nominal planning does not lay the groundwork for a robust strategy. What data did the government base this decision on? With marginal disease testing capacity and negligible testing overall, it would have had no accurate measure of the spread within India.The Prime Minister needs to explain why he could only provide a four-hour notice of the shutdown. Did he foresee a raging pandemic that, uncontrolled, would flatten our cities and villages in a matter of days? This is no doubt a serious pandemic, but one that develops momentum in weeks and months, not in days. There was still time to plan that the government did not avail. The principle of a lockdown is beyond doubt, as events worldwide have proven that social distancing is necessary to contain the spread of this disease. But the execution measures have left much to be desired.TRANSITION PERIOD WAS NEEDEDThe government could have announced a transition period of seven to 10 days that would have allowed families to reunite and to plan for their homes for the duration of the lockdown. Businesses could have planned an orderly shutdown and not be counting the huge costs of sudden process failure for want of manpower.Migrant labour could have returned to their families in an orderly manner. Essential services could have obtained permits to continue operations. Local authorities could have better catered for feeding the poor. Traders could have adjusted logistics so that perishables did not rot and goods were not left stuck on our roads and railways, awaiting looters. Ordinary citizens would have been better prepared.DETAIL THE OBJECTIVESThe state administrations should have been given clearer operating procedures and thus avoid the daily fiasco of revised local guidelines. Apart from slowing down the spread of the disease, the Centre has failed to detail the objectives of the lockdown. What are the numerical targets for antigen testing? What is the testing strategy for the hotspots? After all, capacity deficiencies do not limit a focused approach. Where is the governmental support for developing indigenous antibody testing?Where is the urgent enhancement of intensive care hospital beds, and the purchase of critical equipment? The countries that have managed better are those that have tested extensively as only this can reveal the true scale of the problem. Yet even now, several days into the lockdown, we have failed to test most hospital patients and key medical professionals. Without the confidence that comes from testing, the absenteeism of our frontline medical professionals will continue to increase.The coronavirus morbidity and mortality data published by the government is that for proven cases alone. A majority of the cases are excluded. In a country where 1.12 lakh people perish each day a few hundred coronavirus deaths may not be that obvious in the absence of testing. While some of India can socially distance, most can’t. Their housing does not allow them to and it is the escape to school or work that achieves for them effective social distancing. Confining the same family indoors in tight spaces means potential rapid spread within the family and to the neighbours.TEST AND ISOLATEThe minimal objective for the lockdown should have been to test and isolate all persons displaying symptoms, to home quarantine their families, to test all hospital patients and health workers, but there is no evidence that these are the government’s objectives.Consequently, at the end of the lockdown the disease will still be prevalent in the community, possibly spreading at a slower rate, but still sufficiently embedded to ensure that we rapidly return to square one, necessitating another lockdown.The Prime Minister owes the public a fuller explanation.The writer is a Congress leader and a former Punjab MLA.

The glitzy marriage places were replaced by limiting the wedding celebrations to the gurdwara in Phase 4, Mohali, while the langar prepared at the gurdwara took the place of the sprawling buffet, which was to serve cuisines from across the globe. Instead of a huge wedding party from all four families, the brides and grooms were accompanied by just their parents, while all other relatives had to give the weddings a miss due to ban on gathering of more than 10 people. The weddings, which would have otherwise cost Dharamvir several lakhs, thus, came down to ₹20,000 for both ceremonies. “The district administration allowed us hold the weddings with permission to allow only four members from a family,” said Dharamvir. His son Vikramjit Singh married Navneet Kaur of Chandigarh, while his daughter Bhupinder Kaur exchanged vows with Ramandeep Singh of Gurdaspur. Dharamvir said “We were unsure as to when the curfew will be lifted, so went ahead with simple weddings. We had booked marriage palaces for the two weddings and even distributed cards, but the venues were cancelled.” “We all wore masks and sat at safe distance in line with social distancing. My brother regularly gave us sanitiser to keep our hands clean,” said the newly wedded Vikramjit. Before taking off for Mohali from Gurdaspur at 4am, groom Ramandeep ensured his car was sanitised. “I always wanted a simple wedding, but this level of simplicity was a different experience altogether,” he said. “The gurdwara is being regularly sanitised. The weddings were solemnised after taking all precautions,” said JP Singh, president of the Phase 4 gurdwara committee. MORE APPLYING FOR PERMISSIONSEven when everything has virtually come to a standstill, the Mohali administration is regularly getting applications seeking permission for weddings. “We are not allowing more than four persons from a family, and permission is given only in exceptional cases. We are discouraging any kind of gathering,” said Girish Dayalan, deputy commissioner, Mohali. “So far only five families have been given permission in the district, of which four weddings are done. The fifth one is scheduled in Dera Bassi on April 16,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-curfew-in-mohali-when-masks-replaced-grooms-sehra-langar-a-lavish-buffet/story-O1Rxv61pyzjMQpXGqFaENO.html

Also, staff at a private hospital refused to offer help. However, two cops — assistant sub-inspector Bikker Singh and constable Sukhjinder Singh — on PCR duty came to the couple’s rescue and arranged help from nearby residential area for safe delivery. Harmesh Kumar said he first took his wife Jyoti to the PHC on a two-wheeler but no staff was present there. “I tried to admit her to a private hospital but they didn’t let us in. We also contacted 108 for ambulance but they said all vehicles were occupied. When no private doctor attended to my wife, I panicked when her pain became severe. Finally two cops who were patrolling in the area came for our help and called two women to help my wife deliver safely,” he said. The cops dropped the couple and their newborn home. “The woman was in so much pain, so instead of taking her to hospital, we sought help from the neighborhood,” said ASI Bikkar Singh.The local officials claimed the Dharamkot PHC staff was on coronavirus duty at nearby Janer village on Thursday evening. Moga civil surgeon Andesh Kang said she was not aware of the incident. “No such incident has been reported to me so far. I will inquire why the staff was not present at the PHC. The family should contact me. Strict action will be taken against anyone found guilty of negligence,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-lockdown-woman-gives-birth-on-road-in-moga/story-r4mpSiKvNALdaF5jiiqkYI.html

He did not want to be quoted, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. The lower the AQI the better it is. The AQI reading on Friday was 65. Since March 20, the AQI reading for the district has stayed below 80.Before the lockdown, the district’s average daily AQI reading was between 120 and 140. An AQI of under 50 is considered to be in the “good category”, which means the air pollution poses little or no risk. While, AQI between 51-100 is satisfactory, 101-200 is moderate, 201-300 is poor, and 301-400 is very poor, while 401 and above is severe. Environmental engineer Arun Kakkar said, “The improved quality is under moderate category due to the closure of vehicles and non-plying of vehicles.” The PPCB officials said the lockdown has also led to a reduction in the quantity of pollutants in the air. They added that the Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) had dropped to 50 micrograms per cubic metre in March; this was 188 micrograms per cubic metre, on average for 2019; it was 162.5 in 2018; 172 in 2017 and 197 in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jalandhar-air-quality-best-in-a-decade-aqi-recorded-at-52/story-AYsicrnXwqqwSaTj6wfSPI.html

05-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab cuts security of police top brass||Days after pruning the security of VIPs, the Punjab Police on Saturday cut down gunmen and other staff attached with top cops, government functionaries and Punjab and Haryana high court judges. The security personnel will now be give law and order duties during curfew imposed in Punjab following coronavirus outbreak.Punjab was the first state to clamp curfew on March 23, a day before Prime Minister announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown to fight coronavirus. On March 31, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh ordered to extend the curfew till April 14. Around 400 cops deployed on different duties with top officials and functionaries have been withdrawn immediately and have been deployed at their original postings.Those who face security cut include chief principal secretary to the CM Suresh Kumar (3 gunmen withdrawn), advocate general Atul Nanda (7), DGP human rights Mohammad Mustafa (9), special DGP (crime) Prabodh Kumar (3), chief director, vigilance and anti-corruption bureau and ADGP BK Uppal (11).Almost the entire top brass of the police, including those in the rank of DGP, IG, DIG, whose postings do not require field visits during present conditions, have faced a cut in staff from one cop to five.Retired DGP-rank officials, including Suresh Arora (4), Paramdeep Singh Gill (17), SK Sharma (5) and Rajinder Singh (4), are also in the list.The orders from the headquarters say “the staff attached with the cops has been withdrawn temporarily till further orders”.The list also included four senior judges of the Punjab and Haryana high court and some advocates working with the state government.“After chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh himself offered the DGP to have cut in his security to put cops on duties related to curfew and food distribution for the poorest of the poor across the state, pruning of senior police officials’ staff was also necessary. If need be, more staff deployed at police headquarters will be cut,” a senior police official said. A government spokesperson has recently said a significant number of personnel from the CM’s were withdrawn to fight the Covid-19 outbreak. Many senior police officials are not taking their staff along with them due to the virus threat, and putting them on field duties was a good idea as they all were sitting idle, said a top official. In the first phase on March 31, DGP Dinkar Gupta had ordered to have cut in security of district and sessions court judges, IAS officers, senior police officers, and some politicians.The personnel deployed with the MLAs, MPs and ministers have not been touched as per the list of 162 protectees whose security was pruned. Nearly 7,000 cops are still deployed to guard VIPs and officers in Punjab out of which 3,000 have already been withdrawn in past around two weeks, an official said.Punjab has put nearly 44,000 cops on curfew-related duties across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cuts-security-of-police-top-brass/story-RxbQhgOryUflwxoAZhtanI.html

It was also found that the total five positive patients in India’s largest slum have no travel history. The state health department confirmed the two new cases in Dharavi.The two new cases include a 30-year-old woman in Dr Baliga Nagar colony and a 48-year-old man from Mukund Nagar in Dharavi. No direct contact has been established between the two new cases and the first patient. Only one death due to coronavirus has been reported in Dharavi so far.A 56-year-old municipal sweeper and a 35-year-old surgeon from Dharavi tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. It was found on Saturday that the sweeper worked in Dharavi but is a Worli resident.The BMC had already sealed Dr Baliga Nagar where the first Covid-19 patient, a 56-year-old garment shop owner, was reported. The colony he lived in had eight buildings with 308 flats and 91 shops which were sealed.

05-04-2020||Gurugram||Waive rent for workers, students, owners told in Gurugram||In an attempt to stop the exodus of migrant workers and students back to rural areas or their home states and to reassure those who have stayed back of the state’s continued support, the Haryana government has directed all property owners across the state to waive off a month’s rent in rural areas of the state. The order was issued Thursday by the principal secretary, development and panchayat department, after directions from Union home ministry on March 29. The order states that wherever landlords who have let out properties to workers, including migrant labourers, shall not demand rent for a period of one month.The order has been passed in exercise of powers available under Section 10(2) (i) of the Disaster Management Act of 2005, said the letter issued by the government.The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has also issued directions in this regard. Deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh issued a public notice on behalf of the MCG on Saturday which stted that landlords in the city shall not demand house rent for one month from migrant workers, students and paramedics. His order added that if any landlord is found forcing such tenants to vacate, they will be liable for strict criminal action.“In case of violation of any of the above measures, action under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code shall be taken. A complaint can be lodged on the helpline number 1950,” the order states. This was also stated in the state government’s order. According to an official estimate, there are more than two lakh migrant workers staying in rented accommodations in industrial hubs located in rural areas of south Haryana such as Manesar, Bawal, Dharuhera, Mewat and Jhajjar, among others. Besides, a large number of workers are employed in warehouses and logistics firms located in Tauru, Pataudi and other areas of Gururam district, officials said.In Gurugram’s urban villages, however, it is estimated that five to six lakh migrant workers are staying as tenants in villages such as Chakkarpur, Nathupur, Dundahera, Mollahera, Sukhrali, Sirhaul, among others.When asked about the matter, Bijender Malik, tehsildar, Manesar, said the directions have already been conveyed to most property owners and landlords in Gurugram district. “When we approached them, a majority of the locals voluntarily decided to waive off rent for a month, which is a positive thing. They also agreed to remain flexible with rent collection if the situation so demands in the future,” he said.Malik added that in case workers are harassed or face trouble from landlords, action would be taken against them.In Khoh village which falls under his jurisdiction, where around 4,000 workers stay in rented accommodations, land owners have joined hands to provide food, groceries and other items to the renters. “We have set up a dedicated kitchen on our own in Manesar tehsil and food is being supplied locally. The work on scaling up operations is going on,” he said.Another official from the department, asking not to be named, said most of the workers engaged in agricultural work in rural Haryana want to go to their home states as they wanted to harvest the standing wheat crop, which shall be ready by the middle of April. “Hopefully, the lockdown will end by the middle of this month and these workers can go home with ease. Till then, we are helping them,” he said, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, landlords in urban areas and villages in Gurugram said they have already decided to waive off rent and also help workers as they form the backbone of the city’s economy. “I have been constantly interacting with property owners and they have agreed to voluntarily waive off rent due to the lockdown,” said Rakesh Daultabad, MLA, Gurugram.(With inputs from Kartik Kumar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-to-stop-exodus-govt-asks-landlords-to-waive-month-s-rent-for-workers-students-paramedics-2-lakh-to-benefit-across-haryana/story-UYtX9t0Sw3pLceljkbuMYO.html
05-04-2020||Noida||Easy flows the Yamuna as effluent discharge stops; assessment likely soon||With all legal (and illegal) industrial clusters shut across Delhi-NCR owing to the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown, river Yamuna has got a much-needed breather, albeit temporary, and is now showing a visible improvement.However, with labs and most government offices also shut, the pollution control boards and the Yamuna monitoring committee are yet to quantify the quality of improvement, with experts pointing out that the boards are losing ”a lifetime opportunity” to study the changes to the river. Pollution control board officials said they will start the river quality assessment Monday.Experts said while domestic sewage discharge across the river length in Delhi-NCR accounts for the maximum volume of effluents, it’s the industrial waste that’s more hazardous to the water quality as it adversely impacts the dissolved oxygen (DO) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) content of the river.“There is a visible change in the river and it seems that the Yamuna is much cleaner now. The water is quite clear and the opacity has improved. There are about 20 legal industrial clusters along the river such as the ones in Wazirabad, Narela, Okhla, Patparganj, etc., and they all used to discharge effluents into the river. But that has stopped due to the lockdown. So the water quality has improved, but just how much of an improvement it is, can only be ascertained after the water quality is assessed in labs,” Manoj Mishra, environment activist who leads the campaign, Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, said.He expressed surprise that the agencies were not gabbing the opportunity to collect and study samples.About 48km of the Yamuna, the largest tributary of the Ganges, flows through Delhi-NCR, of which 22km is in the national capital and the remaining passes through several NCR towns.“This is once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study the river, sans its load of industrial effluents. This is the right time to collect samples, so that we get to know the exact toll that industrial waste takes on the river,” Mishra said.According to Noida-based environmentalist Vikrant Tongad, the water quality at three major spots – Kalindi Kunj, ITO and Sector 150, Noida — has improved visibly.“The domestic waste is still flowing into the river and the major pollutant in that is faecal coliform. But the major hazardous one are effluents from industries that carry grease and oil and heavy metals. We are working on getting the samples tested ourselves, but the agencies should be doing this. The water quality at present, whatever it may be, reflects the improvement that can easily be achieved by stopping the discharge of industrial effluents,” Tongad said.According to data from Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), according to the last assessment in December 2019, the DO at Okhla Barrage (entry point to Noida) was 1.3 mg/l and the BOD was 42 mg/l while at Tilwada (exit from Noida), the DO was nil and the BOD was 54 mg/l .In Delhi, the last assessment held in February found the DO at Palla (entry point to Delhi) was 8.7 mg/l, and BOD was 2.6 mg/l. At the exit point in Jaitpur, the DO was nil and BOD was 32 mg/l.The standard for DO levels is 5 mg/l or more, and that of BOD is 3mg/l or less. The DO and BOD is minimum oxygen needed for a river to decompose organic waste.Meanwhile, officials said they will start testing water samples from Yamuna soon.“We will start collecting samples from Yamuna from Monday. The samples will be collected twice a week,” Arun Mishra, member secretary, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), said.Officials at UPPCB had no such plan. “Currently, all our labs are closed. We have no plan to get the water tested,” Anil Kumar Sigh, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/easy-flows-the-yamuna-as-effluent-discharge-stops-assessment-likely-soon/story-BRJ1vhI9SJPCYkFBLZgjBM.html
05-04-2020||City||10 more positive cases reported in Ghaziabad, 10 Indonesian nationals held in Sahibabad||The officials of the Ghaziabad health department Saturday said they have 10 new cases of Covid-19 since Friday evening. The officials said the sudden spurt is attributed to people who attended various religious congregations, including the one in Delhi’s Nizamuddin.Officials said they had a list of 13 positive cases till Friday evening and the number rose to 23 by Saturday evening. The 10 new additions include a 25-year-old woman from Vasundhara whose sister is an employee of Noida-based company – Ceasefire.“The nine other Covid-19 patients are those who attended various religious congregations. The positive patients are from across Ghaziabad, from areas such as Masuri, Loni, Muradnagar etc. Of the 23, we now have 13 Covid-19 patients who have surfaced in past few days after health officials and police launched a search. All these people were picked up after the spurt in cases reported from Nizamuddin in Delhi,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, said.The 29-year-old sister of the 25-year-old woman has also tested positive. The patient’s sister used to share her car with another 30-year-old employee of Ceasefire and he is also positive for Covid-19, health officials said.“Of the 23 patients so far, the father-son duo from Raj Nagar Extension has already been discharged from the hospital after treatment, as well as another patient, a doctor from Kaushambi who returned from France,” the CMO said.On Friday night, the health department officials also sealed a three-kilometre area in Masuri after several patients were found positive there after returning from attending various religious congregations. The officials also sent their family members to different isolation and quarantine facilities.Overall, in Uttar Pradesh, there has been a sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases and UP officials said that this is largely due to members of Tablighi Jamaat who have returned from Nizamuddin after attending a congregation there in March.On Saturday evening, the Sahibabad police also picked up 10 Indonesian nationals who had arrived in Ghaziabad for attending religious congregations and were living in a mosque, a madarsa and the house of a resident in Shaheed Nagar locality.“Five of the 10 are women. They also have their passports with them while some have deposited their passports at the Jamaat’s office in Delhi. All 10 have been sent to a quarantine facility. A case will soon be registered against them and also the caretakers of the mosque, madarsa and the private individual who provided them shelter and did not disclose their information,” Rakesh Mishra, circle officer (Sahibabad), said.The Uttar Pradesh government officials have already said the passports of such persons will be seized as they are in India on tourist visas and not allowed to attend religious events or take part in missionary work.Till Saturday evening, 306 such foreigners were identified across Uttar Pradesh and passports of 228 were seized besides 36 FIRs being lodged against them under the Foreigners’ Act, Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act, the officials of the Uttar Pradesh government said.Dr Gupta also said that there was information about a Covid-19 positive patient from Shipra Sun City, Indirapuram.“When our teams went there, he was found to be admitted to a private hospital in Delhi and his family could not produce any confirmatory report. So we have not included him in the list of positive cases, which came to light on Saturday. However, containment exercise has been taken up at Shipra Sun City,” he said.“People who are yet to make self-disclosures about their travel to foreign countries, other states and to religious congregations, should do so by 5pm on April 5. If they fail to do so and are traced by the health department or police, FIRs will be lodged against them,” Dr Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-more-positive-cases-reported-in-ghaziabad-10-indonesian-nationals-held-in-sahibabad/story-xxJt6AoXkqkZRkaW8isMxI.html

In 11% of cases, the state has been unable to determine the source of the virus. The data of 423 persons who tested positive in Maharashtra, which was analysed and compiled by the medical education and drugs department (MEDD), was made available by the state public health department on Saturday. Of these 423 patients, information on 233 (55%) is still being traced, while data about the source of the virus for 46 persons (11%) has been inconclusive. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAn official from the state health department said, “Inconclusive means the respective local bodies were not able to trace the source of the virus in the patients. This is the case for 11%. Whereas, for the 55% of patients, whose source information is awaited, it means the respective local authorities are still tracing the source and are yet to inform the state government.”Of the 154 cases in which the source of the virus has been traced, 84 (20%) have a travel history, while 60 persons (11%) tested positive after coming in contact with those with travel history. Figures from a week ago, from the MEDD report (March 27) revealed that 50% (67 persons) of Covid-19 positive patients had travel history; 31% (42 persons) had contact history, and source in 8% (11 persons) was inconclusive. In the report's focus period, the source in 11% (14 persons) was ongoing.Maharashtra recorded its first case of Covid-19 on March 9, and the patient had a travel history. Eighteen days since, the number of cases among contact persons has superseded those among travellers.“It is premature to say if this implies that we are at the community transmission stage of the Covid-19 outbreak. More information is needed on the 55% of positive patients. Awaited data means we have not exhausted routes of investigation to find out the source,”said a health department official. “I am certain in some cases, local authorities have found the source, and are yet to convey the information to the state health department. Hence it is not reflecting in the analysis,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-did-55-maha-patients-get-virus/story-3MdP3HbFpm6ogpWGJTky0H.html

An FIR was also lodged against these persons suspected to have contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) at religious gatherings attended in large numbers by members from countries where the pandemic had spread at the community level. One of these suspected cases later tested positive for Covid-19.“Since majority of these people are not cooperating with the recommended line of treatment, we have decided to rope in religious leaders from their communities to counsel them. After the incident at MMG Hospital, we have also been directed to rope in male staff to attend to the suspected cases from religious congregations. We are also trying to put up CCTV cameras in quarantine facilities,” chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said.“The chief minister has directed us to rope in religious leaders of all the districts and will be holding a video conference with them on Sunday. In all, in UP, we have tracked 1,302 persons linked to the Delhi Tablighi Jamaat gathering and 1,000 are being sent to quarantine facilities. The search is on to find others and we are also getting calls from people reporting those who are trying to hide,” Awanish Awasthi, UP additional chief secretary (home), said in a press briefing at Lucknow.On Saturday, officials of the district administration held meetings with religious leaders of different communities and asked them to persuade people to disclose if they were part of any large religious gatherings or were direct contacts of any person who was. The leaders were also asked to urge people to follow health protocols to contain the Coronavirus outbreak.“The religious leaders will be given the mobile numbers of people in isolation/quarantine and have been asked to speak to them. They will pursue them to take up treatment and behave well with the health department staff. We expect that this measure will help in containing Coronavirus,” Dr Gupta said.Chief medical superintendent at MMG Hospital Dr Ravinder Rana said another set of Covid-19 patients were brought to the hospital on Friday evening and they, too, were misbehaving. “They were also misbehaving and spitting around in the isolation ward. Some police officers present in the hospital, when this happened, intervened. It is vital that patients cooperate and not endanger the lives of the medical staff and that of others,” he added.After the April 1 incident, the Ghaziabad police have also beefed up security at quarantine facilities by deputing teams of personnel.Meanwhile, state government officials on Saturday said they have asked district officials to strengthen tracking of people who attended the March 18 Tablighi Jamaat gathering and to contain the spread of Coronavirus infection in affected areas.According to the state health department officials, there has been a sudden spurt in Covid-19 patients in the past two days. On Thursday, the number of positive patients in the state was 121 which shot up to 227 by Saturday afternoon.“Ninety-four positive patients are linked to the Delhi gathering. Positive cases have now been reported from 27 districts against 16 districts two days ago. We are stepping up our efforts to contain Coronavirus infection in an aggressive manner to prevent community outbreak,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP principal secretary (health).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/state-ropes-in-religious-leaders-to-counsel-patients-to-accept-treatment-not-misbehave/story-h74GbnOlOll47g3xbJy8QO.html
05-04-2020||Delhi||Lokpal member tests positive for Covid-19||Judicial member of the Lokpal and former chief justice of the Chhattisgarh high court, Ajay Kumar Tripathi, 62, tested positive for Covid-19 late on Friday night. He was in the isolation facility at the main AIIMS campus and was later moved to Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, which has been converted into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital.He has been admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital and is currently on a ventilator.“His condition is critical, and he is on a ventilator,” said an official from the hospital, on condition of anonymity.So far, 445 people have contracted the infection and six have died of it in the city.He is the second patient admitted to the 240-bed facility, which opened on Saturday. Around 120 of these beds have ventilator support. All trauma cases have now been diverted to the main AIIMS campus, where they are handled in the emergency ward.Apart from the five hospitals designated by the Delhi government for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, this is the only other stand-alone facility doing so. The hospital also plans to have one of the OTs dedicated for surgeries on Covid-19 patients.On Friday, doctors from gynaecology department of AIIMS used a minor OT for the delivery of a pregnant woman with Covid-19.

05-04-2020||Delhi||Pregnant women find ambulances busy, police vans step up to the task||At 2 am on Friday, Ruby Kataria,25, a Sangam Vihar resident, nine months into her pregnancy, started having labour pain. With most public transport off the road because of the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19, her elder sister, Komal, began calling hospitals for an ambulance. But each call was met only with radio silence.“For some reason, no hospital took my call. It was an emergency. My sister was in pain. We do not own a car. At that moment, something struck me and I called the police control room. I told them my sister was about the deliver a baby, and no conveyance was available. Within six minutes, a police van was at our door and took us to the hospital. They saved her life,” Komal said.On Saturday afternoon, Ruby, a homemaker, gave birth to a boy. They haven’t named him yet Komal said Ruby will she would take her child along with her to meet the head police constable who saved her life, once she leaves the hospital.Since the 21-day nationwide lockdown came into effect on March 25, the city’s police control room (PCR) vans are doubling up as ambulances.PCR vans are the first responders whenever a crime is reported to the control room.Between Friday evening and Saturday evening alone, PCR vans shifted at least 43 women who experienced labour pains to hospitals across the city. Since March 25, the police have rushed 139 women to hospitals, after getting calls on the police control room helpline. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Sharat Sinha, said, “As private and public vehicles have been banned due to the, and ambulances are mostly being used for transporting suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients, we are getting the police vans to be used as alternate emergency vehicles to shift pregnant women or people injured in various accidents to hospitals.”A senior official in the health department however said the government has enough ambulances to transport non-Covid patients. “We have ample ambulances dedicated for Covid-19 patients. We also have ‘102 ambulances’, which are dedicated only to transport pregnant women and sick infants.”In some cases, police officers, unused to the task now presented to them, are going the extra mile to make sure women in their vans feel safe and comforted.A police constable, who had rushed a pregnant woman to Safdarjung hospital on April 3, said, “I have asked my wife to guide me on the things that one must say when a woman is in labour pain so that I can to comfort her psychologically. We are learning on the job. We have to learn so many things as a police officer.”Sinha said that for many residents who do not own vehicles, getting hold of transport in emergency situations is proving to be a severe challenge.“Keeping these problems in mind, we instructed all personnel in the PCR vans to prioritise calls from women in labour. Fortunately, there has been no mishap in any of the cases, and our officers were able to rush women to hospital,” Sinha said.The police have narrowed their focus on such medical emergencies, he said, as crime-related calls are few and far between now.According to Delhi Police data, the number of heinous crimes, like robbery, snatching, dacoity, has come down in the last 15 days. Road Accidents on the city’s streets have reduced as well. Between March 15 and 31 last year, there were 48 fatal road accidents in the city. In the same period this year, that number dropped to 19.“The low volume of vehicular traffic has led to improvements in our response time. Our vehicles are reaching spots within two or three minutes, and are shifting women to hospitals in as much time,” he added.Each PCR van has a stretcher to carry people who are unable to walk. First-aid kits are also available in the vehicle but they are mostly used to give preliminary medical attention to people injured in accidents. To avoid police personnel getting infected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, they are provided sanitary masks, hand gloves, sanitisers, water and soap, which are kept in the vehicles.“We keep reminding our staff about their personal hygiene and safety. Being the first responders to any emergencies, we regularly encourage them to continue the services they provide to society during these times,” the DCP said.In many of the cases, the police vans had to transport women in labour as far as 14km from their homes to a multi-speciality hospital.On Friday evening, when HT spoke to the constable, he said he was going to a spot in his PCR van.

05-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi may soon run short of essentials, say traders||Wholesale traders in Delhi have warned of a shortage of essential items in the coming days, saying they are still to get the required number curfew passes for the movement of goods during the nationwide lockdown announced to stave off the spread of Sars-Cov-2 infection.Essential items include milk, vegetables, foodgrains, cooking oil, consumer durables and medicines, among others.The capital’s apex traders’ body on Saturday said they had written to the Union and Delhi governments to streamline the issuance of passes so that supplies are not affected.The Central government had issued a list of essential items, including groceries, which have been kept out of the purview of businesses ordered to remain shut during the lockdown. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAccording to traders, the shortage of curfew passes meant that goods were not able to reach retail markets and small-time grocers on time. According to the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), with only around 20% of the labour force and limited vehicles available, the delay in issuing passes may lead to a scarcity of essential items as retail stores may run out of stock.“We are already in the day 12 [Saturday] of the lockdown. The system of issuing e-passes for transporting essential goods must be streamlined. In many cases, passes have not been issued even after four or five days of applying. Additionally, some are being rejected without any reasons being given. This may disrupt the supply chain,” said Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary, (CAIT).Curfew passes are necessary to cross Delhi’s interstate borders, as well as movement across the city. From March 26, the Delhi government and Delhi Police began an online system where people can apply for an electronic pass (e-pass), intended primarily for workers engaged in essential services who did not have formal identity cards.Wholesale dealers supply stock from their godowns to different groups of retailers across the city. But modern supply chains are intricate, and rely on several interconnected elements to function in tandem. If a single element is disrupted, the entire chain is thrown into disarray.“We have suggested that authorities may allow the recognised traders associations to issue passes to drivers and merchants with, along with government officials, after following due process, in a phased manner. This could help facilitate movement of goods and services, while also maintaining the sanctity of the lockdown,” Khandelwal said.A senior Delhi government official, however, said there is no pendency as such. “Initially there were some technical glitches, but passes are being given within a day or two. We haven’t received any complaints so far. We will ensure that all essential goods reach stores in time,” a senior officer, who did not wish to be named, said.Delhi Police spokesperson MS Randhawa said, “We will definitely address if there are specific issues being faced in delivering essentials. Passes can only be issued to a select number of service providers in order to maintain the provisions of the lockdown.”Grocery store owners in several markets in Delhi said they were already running short on stocks of essentials such as flour, cooking oil and frozen foods.“It’s been five days since fresh stocks last arrived. The supply at the back-end is slow. We have almost run out of flour and items such as besan and suji, as well as some spices,” said Yogesh Gupta, 34, who owns a store in central Delhi’s Gole Market.Traders said they were also facing problems in arranging labour and transport. A large number of migrant workers engaged labourers in wholesale markets across the city have returned to their home towns in the aftermath of the lockdown.Naresh Gupta, president, Delhi Grain Merchants Association, said while there is at least two weeks’ worth of essential items in stock old Delhi’s Naya Bazar wholesale market, there aren’t enough vehicles or labour to transport them across the city.“There is limited staff for loading and unloading. Besides, we don’t get trucks in time, because transporters say they don’t have passes to ply or even drivers available for duty,” he said.Currently, Gupta said most wholesale dealers have only one truck available every two or three days.Transporters in the city too said they have been facing challenges in getting vehicles around due to a lack of staff, as well as a shortage of curfew passes. “Many times, despite having e-passes, our staff faces harassment. My drivers have been working two or three shifts a day,” said Kultaran Singh Atwal, president, All India Motor Transport Congress.He said only 15% of the supply trucks are plying currently. Even during the lockdown, this number should at least be 25%-30%, to ensure essentials reach the markets, Atwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/transport-labour-crunch-may-hit-supply-chain-warn-traders/story-i58Y1fSSFIVRGlACyZ4hJJ.html
05-04-2020||Delhi||Will win fight against virus, say residents of Patparganj||On March 25 around 9pm, the empty streets outside the gated apartment complexes in east Delhi’s IP Extension — which houses a cluster of high-rise societies — were overwhelmed by scores of migrant workers, many carrying suitcases, backpacks and their children, walking out of the nearby IP Extension industrial area.Those whose apartments faced the National Highway witnessed this exodus on a much greater scale. They say they saw myriad workers spread across the eight-lane highway, metres away from where they live, walking away from the national Capital.It wasn’t until that moment that the residents realised the seriousness of the pandemic.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicMany claimed it was difficult to fathom that the narrow lanes of the industrial area, which is barely a few kilometres away, could house so many workers and their families.“I did not even know why so many people were out on the streets that night. It was only the next morning that I came to know they were leaving to go to their home towns. It really hit us hard. While we can afford to stay in with our families, these people were aiming to walk hundreds of kilometres just to get home,” said Brij Mohan, a social worker living in the area.Ever since the lockdown was announced, many residents of this middle-class neighbourhood, also known as Patparganj, have come out to help their less privileged neighbours. Developed in the 1990s, IP Extension has over two dozen housing societies and multi-storey apartments. Many of these complexes were marked by the government for retired civil servants, university teachers and journalists. Some residents are distributing food packets, others are sending across groceries, soaps and hand sanitisers.“Every morning, one of us cooks some extra food and delivers it to Patparganj Village. As social distancing is important, and we do not want to risk mixing in a crowd while distributing the meals, we drop them at a local grocery store and someone from there goes door-to-door to distribute the food packets,” said Swati Sood, a resident of Sahyadri Apartments.A group of residents are in touch with local municipalities to ensure cleanliness along the cramped lanes of Patparganj Village and in the industrial area.“These lanes are very dirty. Even if one does not have any disease, they will fall ill if they live here for long. We tried to get municipal officials to help us but that did not happen for days. A few days ago, we got help from a residents’ group and got the area sanitised,” said Tarikh Ali, the pradhan of street number eight, Patparganj Village.Ali said people here, irrespective of financial background, are now working together to ensure that the area is safe from the spread of the coronavirus.“Disease does not discriminate in financial strata. Over the last week, though everyone is maintaining the lockdown guidelines, we have come closer as a community. We have got tremendous support, financially as well as in resources, from resident groups of neighbouring colonies. This fight will have to be won together,” Ali said. Many resident welfare associations (RWA) of these gated neighbourhoods have also sent out circulars to residents urging them to buy their vegetables and groceries from local vendors to ensure their business is not hit in these tough times. Rohit Maan, president, RWA of Shri Sai Apartments, said they have roped in two local vegetable and fruit vendors who set up shop at the colony gate every day. He said residents of each block in the complex have been given a specific window to come out for purchases, to ensure there is no crowding.“We have provided masks and sanitisers to vendors to ensure the health of residents here is not affected. However, at the same time, instead of calling for home deliveries from online services, you will do good if you buy groceries from the people who actually need the money,” Maan said.He said they are also working to ensure residents do not have to step out repeatedly.“For groceries, residents can call us with their shopping list and we make a collective order every alternative day with a local grocer,” he said. “There are many retired people living in these colonies and even a single person’s mistake can put lives at risk,” said Sarita Iyer, a member of the East Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-win-fight-against-virus-together-ip-extn-residents/story-MtqeDcT50OT9CZRJAzCSLO.html
05-04-2020||Delhi||Cancer institute will move patients to private hospitals, test them||After another nurse of the Delhi State Cancer Institute tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday, the institute has decided to shift all the patients admitted to its wards to private hospitals for treatment. The hospital had earlier closed the out-patient clinic for sanitisation.The sample of the 30-year-old male nursing officer was collected after he came in contact with one of the doctors from the hospital, who tested positive earlier this week. The samples of around 19 staff members had been collected, of which three tested positive. Two others, a male and a female nurse, both in their 40s, tested positive on Friday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicBefore shifting the 48 people admitted to the hospital for cancer treatment, their samples would be collected to see whether they might have contracted the infection. “We are in the process of shifting the patients. However, it will be done only after all of their samples have been collected,” an official from the hospital said, on condition of anonymity.A 35-year-old doctor from the department of Preventive Oncology had tested positive on Tuesday and was admitted to Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini, close to where he lives. His wife and child were admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital, on suspicion of having contracted the infection from him.“Most of the patients in the hospital have a weak immune system and we cannot take a chance here. So, they are being moved to private hospitals for their treatment,” the official said. This will be done under the Delhi government’s existing Delhi Arogya Kosh scheme, which covers over 1,000 procedures in private hospitals.It is, however, unclear where he got the infection from. “He has no history of foreign travel or treating any Covid-19 patient. So, the source of the infection is still a question mark. His brother and sister-in-law did travel to the UK in February, but they haven’t tested positive for the infection,” an official with the Delhi government’s health department said.Another nurse from the emergency department of Apollo Hospital, who had come in contact with a 62-year-old man from Yemen, who had died of Covid-19, also tested positive earlier this week. Eight to 10 people who had come in contact with him have been asked to remain in quarantine.At Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, 108 staff members have been asked to remain in quarantine after they came in contact with two Covid-19 positive patients a couple of days ago.So far, at least eight doctors and five nurses in the city have tested positive for the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/state-cancer-institute-to-shift-all-patients-to-pvt-hospitals-over-covid-19-fear/story-QqjX4iFzN3mdq6vo3ufySP.html
05-04-2020||Delhi||14-day isolation must for people out of quarantine, says new government rules||People who complete their mandatory 14-day quarantine periods at government facilities will be allowed to return home only through routes approved by the district administration and within a specified time frame, a fresh set of guidelines issued by the Delhi government stated.According to senior health officials, the standard operating procedure (SoP) for patients who have recovered and those who have finished their quarantine period is almost the same, and mandates that they stay in self-isolation for 14 more days. The standard operating procedure (SoP), issued on Friday by the state executive committee — headed by chief secretary Vijay Dev — also talks about the transit arrangements of foreign nationals who arrived in the city after February 15 and were put under mandatory quarantine.Till Saturday, Delhi had recorded 445 Covid-19 positive cases, with six deaths. Fifteen people have recovered and one is out of the country. “In case of stranded foreign nationals, the concerned foreign government, in consultation with the ministry of civil aviation, Government of India, will arrange for chartered flights. Screening for Covid-19 symptoms as per protocol will be done prior to departure and local transportation will be provided by the embassy concerned. Transit passes will be issued by district magistrate for transit routes,” read the SoP, which was drafted on Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal’s directive.The L-G’s directive came on March 31 after he received complaints that several foreign nationals were stranded in Delhi even after completing their quarantine period. Similar complaints also came from Indian nationals who returned from abroad after February 15, completed their 14-day quarantine in government centres and have not been able to return home despite testing negative for Covid-19 due to the 21-day nationwide lockdown.The total number of people quarantined as of Saturday was 3,531, of which 374 had completed the quarantine period. Out of 374, 219 have tested negative for Covid-19. Of the 219, at least 102 have been discharged from institutional quarantine. “We declare a Covid-19 patient as recovered if two consecutive test results, within a minimum span of 24 hours, comes negative. The person is then discharged from the hospital. But, the story doesn’t end there,” said Dr Nutan Mundeja, Delhi’s director general of health services.“They are then asked to self-quarantine at their homes for another 14 days. The drill is the same for even those who have completed their 14-day quarantine in a government facility or at their homes. So, the entire follow-up exercise actually goes on for 28 days in every case,” she said.The latest SoP also stated that no person of any group will be released where even one person tests positive for Covid-19. “Transport arrangement has to be made by the person themselves and transit for fixed route with specified validity for such person will be issued by district magistrate of concerned district. Such person will further remain under home quarantine for a period of 14 days as per standard protocol on the matter; the details of such person will be shared with state/UT government for necessary follow up,” read the document.As on Saturday, a total of 101 transit passes had been issued, a senior official said. A senior official in the revenue department said that more than 700 district surveillance teams are currently active across Delhi for contact tracing, and monitoring recovered patients and those under home quarantine.The New Delhi district, for example, has 98 district surveillance teams comprising doctors and paramedical staff, who also work in resolving all complaints received from the district. Similarly, the south-west district has 76 such teams.District magistrate (south-west) Rahul Singh said there are eight Covid-19 positive cases in the district. There are another 3,587 people under home quarantine, and 300 placed in institutional quarantine facilities.“If a suspected case is found, then a poster is pasted outside their home for mandatory home quarantine. In case higher level of scrutiny, the person is kept at an institutional quarantine centre being operational in the district at 2 places — sector 9 PTS Dwarka and DUSIB flats in Sector 16 Dwarka. Together, both the facilities are housing 300 individuals in quarantine. When a person is found to be positive, the individual is sent to the designated Covid hospital,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/14-day-isolation-must-for-people-out-of-quarantine-says-new-government-rules/story-sSCU01gdkrVc1y4opM2H4L.html
05-04-2020||Delhi||PPE shortage forces govt’s hand, allows purchase from private sellers||To address a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors treating Covid-19 patients, the Delhi government has allowed hospitals to purchase necessary equipment from private manufacturers, provided each kit costs less than Rs 1,087, the price set by HLL, a government company.A PPE kit contains a full-body suit, masks, goggles, gloves, and shoe covers. “The cabinet has approved the procurement of PPE kits by individual hospitals from local manufacturers or suppliers at market rate, provided the rates are less than or comparable to rates of HLL of Rs 1,087 per kit,” the order read.Until now, the hospitals were dependent on supply from the central procurement agency and their contracted manufacturers. “Now, we do not have to depend on only the manufacturers we have contracts with, but can purchase PPE kits from anyone in a position to sell. It should cost less than the ones provided by HLL, but also be of good quality. This order increases the range of options for us. Several small manufacturers have come forward due to the shortage in the market. Their products are not always of good quality, but one or two out of five manufacturers can give us decent PPE kits,” an official of Lok Nayak Hospital, one of the five hospitals designated as a Covid-19 centre by the Delhi government, said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe central procurement agency, which is responsible for buying medicines, consumables and equipment for Delhi government-run hospitals, already has a tender in place for 120,000 PPE kits, with three companies. “Due to the shortage in the market, they are not able to give bulk orders and are supplying up to 2,000 PPE kits a day right now, which is just about enough for our needs. But, we need more kits to prepare for a surge in numbers,” a senior Delhi government official said.These kits are shared among the five designated hospitals and quarantine facilities across the city. At the hospital level, managements have also been purchasing the protective gear. “We get about 200 or 300 PPE kits from our local manufacturers that are shared with two other quarantine facilities in the area. This is enough for us at present, but more would be needed if the cases rise,” an official of Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, which is among the five designated by the government, said.The Delhi government has written to the centre, asking for more PPE kits, but is yet to receive a reply, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday. “The government has asked for about 200,000 PPE kits from the centre to ensure adequate stock,” a senior official of the Delhi government said.A senior official of the health ministry, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Orders for more PPEs have been placed and will be distributed among states on a priority basis.”So far, at least eight doctors and five nurses — three of whom had worked with Covid-19 positive cases while the history of the index patient for the others remains unclear — in the city have contracted the infection. At Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, around 108 staff members, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and ward boys, have been placed in quarantine after coming in contact with two Covid-19 patients without PPE.“The hospital received authorisation to treat Covid-19 patients on Friday, but we are still working on procuring PPEs. There is a shortage in the market and those who have it have driven up the prices. We cannot start treating patients without ensuring adequate protection for our staff,” an official of the hospital said.The five-doctor committee advising the CM on Covid-19 preparedness has estimated that in Scenario 1, when hospitals start receiving 100 patients a day, the stock of PPE should be around 5,000 in each of the designated hospitals. However, as on April 2, the five hospitals, combined, had 3,261 kits, according to the Delhi government’s health bulletin.“If 100 patients are admitted to a hospital, let’s say 20 of them would require ICU care. The hospital would need around 500 to 600 PPE kits in a day for that. If Delhi gets 100 cases a day for seven days, each hospital must have a stock of 5,000 PPE kits for that scenario. Right now, we are not getting 100 cases every day, so the hospitals can manage with the kits they have,” said Dr SK Sarin, head of the committee and director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/shortage-forces-delhi-govt-to-allow-purchase-of-ppe-kits-from-pvt-sellers/story-CrLbvTN1z1hgqD5Yd2ls1N.html
05-04-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal hits out at Centre for PPE shortage, says haven’t received a “single rupee” from Rs 17,000 crore fund||As Covid-19 cases in Delhi touched 445 on Saturday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy CM Manish Sisodia accused the Centre of not responding to the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in Delhi. They also accused the Centre of not giving “a single penny” from the ₹17,000 crore emergency assistance given to other state governments. Sisodia urged the Centre not to “play politics” during a pandemic.In his digital media address, Kejriwal said that due to the Nizamuddin Markaz incident, Delhi has seen a sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases. The tests of around 500 persons evacuated from the Markaz, which has emerged as a hot spot, is underway.The number of persons linked to the Tablighi Jamaat, who have tested positive for Covid-19, increased from 259 on Friday to 301 on Saturday. “We urgently need PPE kits and have written to the Central government about it. I do not want the doctors and nurses to work without the protective gear. The centre has not yet provided us with a single kit till now,” he said.Responding to this, a senior health ministry official, on condition of anonymity said, “Orders for more PPEs have been placed and will be distributed among states on a priority basis.”Sisodia said he had also written a letter to Union finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, expressing disappointment over lack of relief assistance to the Delhi government. “The Central government provided relief assistance worth ₹17,287 crore to all the states but Delhi was not given a single rupee,” his letter stated.Sisodia said that Delhi has become the third worst-affected state in India.Kejriwal on Saturday reiterated that with 40 cases of local transmission, Delhi has still not reached the community transmission stage. “Of all the patients who have Covid-19, 11 are in ICU. Five are on ventilator support. Of over 2,300 people evacuated from the Markaz, around 500 are admitted to various hospitals and around 1,800 are in quarantine. We are testing all 500 people because they have various symptoms and all of them may be suffering from Covid-19, which means the number of positive cases in Delhi will increase. But I want to reiterate that this is not community transmission. So, there is nothing to worry yet,” he said.The chief minister said that until now, Delhi has recorded six deaths, of which five were above 60 years of age and one was 36 years old. “Among these six people, three were traced to the Markaz, while five had other serious illnesses. One person had liver disease, one person had diabetes, two persons had respiratory disease and one person had heart disease.APPLICATION FOR RATIONKejriwal, on Saturday, said that over six lakh who do not have ration cards will start getting free ration, up to five kilograms, from Wednesday or Thursday. He asked them to register on the government’s portal soon.“We have already announced that the Delhi government will give 7.5kg free ration to 71 lakh people who have ration cards. There are around 6.5 lakh people whose applications for ration cards have been in the waiting list for years. We have decided to give these people the benefit of free ration first,” the chief minister said.On Friday, the Delhi government launched a website where one can fill a form to get registered. After the registration, the person will get free ration. Since its launch, nearly 40 to 50,000 people have already registered.He also said it is important to register to ensure that one person does not take multiple stocks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-hits-out-at-centre-for-ppe-shortage-says-haven-t-received-a-single-rupee-from-17-cr-fund/story-yRGLgK79iIu3LRZ3QMq0WI.html

Isolation facility has been created on the jail premises for this purpose, according to a video of the process shared by Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of prison, Maharashtra.The footfall in the police stations in Pune police jurisdiction has reduced drastically since the state went into lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. However, police action during lockdown has ensured the inflow of inmates at the jail premises.The Yerawada Central Jail is the biggest jail in the district that comprises Pune rural police, Pune city police and Pimpri-Chinchwad police. The Pune police alone have also registered 22 cases and arrested 23 people for running multiple illegal businesses in the city since the lockdown was announced.Among the 22 cases, two are of illegal drug possession. In one case, ganja worth Rs 7,160 was seized while in another case, hash worth Rs3,60,590 was seized by the police, according to a statement issued by Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, crime, Pune.While the arrests are made by the crime branch, cases are registered at various police stations in the city, including Hadapsar, Samarth, Koregaon Park, Kondhwa, Swargate, Sahakarnagar, Lashkar, Bibvewadi, Mundhwa, Sinhgad road, Faraskhana, Warhe, Wanowrie, Vimannagar, and Bharati Vidyapeeth.The arrested people are either entrusted to the respective police stations’ custody or to judicial custody at the Yerawada Central Jail.The biggest lock-up facility in the city is located at Faraskhana police station in Zone-1 of Pune city police.

05-04-2020||Pune||Covid-19 on the frontline – 1: Right now, things are in control in Pune, says Dr Prasad Rajhans||Dr Prasad Rajhans , chief intensivist, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, Pune, speaks to HT about city’s preparedness for dealing with the Sars-cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection. It has been declared a pandemic by the World health Organisation (WHO).What exactly is your role in this crisis?I am in charge of the Emergency Department and ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and have been very busy. We are doing all kinds of preparedness for the Covid-19 pandemic. We have to train the staff, get everything in order, see the disaster preparedness of the hospital.How does your day begin and roll out?I stay next to the hospital, so, before I head to work, it is imperative to look after one’s health. I do pranayama (breathing exercise in yoga) in the morning. Once I come to the hospital, I take a round in the ICU to see my patients, followed by an academic discussion with my colleagues to get ourselves updated on Covid-19. I have taken 30 lectures for my staff on facts about Covid-19 and motivation, which is absolutely important during this pandemic. What precautions are you taking?Basically, we have to make sure that hand washing is important. Then, while looking after highly suspected Covid-19 patients, we need to take care that we are covered in proper, scientific personal protective equipment (PPE). Finally, we need to follow all the precautions at home that we teach to our staff.What is your assessment of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune? How is it unfolding?Right now, we are very much in control of the situation and there is good networking between the public and private sector. Also, many industries have come forward with donations and support. So, basically, we will have to keep a close watch until the end of April and May to see how things evolve.What gaps do you see in healthcare and relief work?I think the main problem that hospitals and healthcare workers will face is the shortage of protective consumables such as N95 masks and PPEs (personal protective equipment). The problem is, people have hoarded these things in their houses and these items are being sold at a very high cost. There needs to be some kind of monitoring as to what price they should be sold at. I would request people who have stocked N95 masks in their homes to come and donate them to the nearest hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-on-the-frontline-1-right-now-things-are-in-control-in-pune-says-dr-prasad-rajhans/story-c3vETTruA5LDjVyDOCKp1J.html

There are two hospitals to which these patients are being admitted,” he said.On Friday, three others, of Kerala who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamuddin last month, had tested positive in Nuh, said officials.The superintendent of police, Nuh, Narender Bijarniya, on Saturday, said they have deployed 900 personnel across the district along with medical teams to keep a watch on those who had come in contact with the patients. “We have identified 270 people, so far, who had attended the Jamaat and 430 others who came in close contact with those who had returned from there. We have admitted more than 270 people to Government Polytechnic college in Malab and Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati Government Medical College, Nalhar, Nuh,” he said.The police sealed the district border as well, to check the spread of disease from outside. Bijarniya said the police have asked all village heads and ward officers to ensure that people experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 are taken to the hospital and that the police are informed. The three who were tested positive on Friday had come to Palwal on March 19, and stayed in Nizamuddin for 10 days, before visiting Nuh on March 30, the police said.Bijrania said they had traced them through their travel history, mobile location, human surveillance and informers. “We have collected samples of more than 70 people, so far, who were close to the people infected. We are tracking all the possible movements and contacts so that the situation can be monitored and controlled,” said Bijrania.Special police teams have been formed for visiting villages in Nuh to check the ground situation and ensure no person with these symptoms go unreported. “We are sending the police personnel with the medical staff and district administration teams door-to-door, to check the details of each occupant, ascertain their travel history and track their current location. We are undertaking intense patrolling in the area and if anyone found is found hiding intentionally, strict action will be taken against them and those sheltering them,” said Bijrania.Police teams deployed near the hospitals and dealing with the quarantine patients are given full-body protective suits. All the staff members have been asked to ensure sanitisation four times a day, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/truck-driver-from-nuh-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-OBFUvHnnlzC69eeJlG0cMI.html

This was after two persons who had returned from the Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin, New Delhi, had tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus. This locality is highly congested and most people have been living here in self-constructed, one, two or three storey houses, from the last two-and-a-half decades. People living here are workers, petty businessmen, fruits and vegetables vendors. Here’s are first-person accounts from people in the area on how life has changed for them after the area was sealed.‘I don’t want Italy, US-like situation in our city’A 58-year-old resident shared his experience: I can’t imagine that the two Covid-19 positive cases were reported from just 100 ft distance of my home. We on our own rigorously followed the lockdown and after this area was sealed, the police were deployed outside our houses. We stopped going outside our house to purchase essentials such as grocery, milk and vegetables. We are adjusting with whatever is available at home without making any fuss. After all, life is precious. I have been living here since the last 20 years. I have three sons, wife and a five-year-old granddaughter. We all spend time engaging ourselves in household work, watching television and taking as much rest as possible.I am worried about my granddaughter. I can go out and buy milk from just about 50 ft distance; but I’m avoiding even that. We are allowed to step out to take milk and vegetables between 6 am and 10 am only. I, however, decided that no one will step outside the house in the present conditions. I don’t want a Italy or a US-like situation in our city. I told my family members, ‘Be like a soldier’ in this situation. A soldier can live under any circumstances and survive. My earnest request to all is, don’t go outside.A 45-year-old homemaker’s view The situation became serious in the last two days. The Covid-19 positive cases were reported just 200 ft from my house. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s health staff keeps knocking on our doors daily to check whether anyone in our family has symptoms of fever, cough and cold. I showed my medical prescription to police to purchase medicines. The medical store is just 100 metres away. Barring the medical store, everything is shut down here. I make various types of sprouts, soaked chickpeas and prepared idli-dosa batter in the refrigerator. As we have children at home, the demand for food is high. For the last two days, no vegetable vendor was allowed in the area. I am very scared to go outside. I keep watching television news and read newspapers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/life-in-a-sealed-area-under-pimpri-chinchwad-i-don-t-want-italy-us-like-situation-in-our-city/story-mfCAIDtasbnZ8QjKptqLsN.html

As of Saturday, seven positive cases of Covid-19 was reported from various slum pockets of the city. While four have occurred in Parvati slums, two are from Gultekdi and one each from Laxminagar (Yerawada) and Ghorpadi peth. The civic administration has maintained that these are sporadic cases and there are no concentrated numbers in the slums as yet. Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “We have only found a few sporadic cases in these areas like 2-3 and they too are only the close contacts of the positive patients. There is no immediate plan to seal off these areas. We may decide on containment when the cases touch 10-15 in one area.”Besides slums, such cases occurred in congested ‘peth’ areas of the city, including Raviwar peth, Bhawani peth and Kasba peth. Dr Vaishali Jadhav, officer incharge of the containment plan in Pune said, “We conduct survey in the nearby areas where a positive patient has been found to find out if anyone is suffering from any respiratory illnesses like cold cough and difficulty in breathing. We also ask them about their foreign travel history and any other movement. But during the process, our officers often face physical and verbal assault and opposition from residents. Especially in Muslim majority pockets, as they fear that this survey might be linked with NRC (National Register of Citizens) or CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act). These incidents have risen since the Delhi Tablighi incident. We have to take the help of the local police for surveys in these areas which makes our job even more difficult.” The civic body and the district administration have been tracking people who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi. Currently, under the PMC’s action plan, a solution of 1% sodium chlorite is sprayed in areas where a positive patient is found for 14 days of the incubation period. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer, PMC said, “We implement the containment plan when a positive patient is found in the half to one kilometre radius. If any of the first contacts who have tested negative do not have the space for home isolation, then we provide them with institutional isolation. We also conduct a survey in the area to find if anyone has symptoms. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, we recommend for sample testing.” Covid-19 advisory for Jhuggi-Jhopri clusters/slumsThe advisory issued by the National Centre for Disease Control defines slums as small, roughly-built house or shelter usually made of mud, wood or metal having thatch or tin sheet roof covering. It says, “slum” means an area consisting of badly built, overcrowded houses, buildings or Jhuggi-Jhopri cluster. The action plan includes, common areas like toilets, water supply areas, surfaces, likely to be touched by residents to be cleaned frequently using any available disinfectant. It advises that the local administration must ensure cleaning of toilets frequently, prevent crowding around public amenities such as toilets, drinking water sources and ration shops. People waiting should maintain a distance of 1m and face away from each other and refrain from touching their eyes, nose and mouth. The local body must also ensure that all residents have access to soap and water for frequent hand-washing for at least 20 seconds and any family member working as domestic help in the neighborhood should request exemption from service for a short period of two weeks so as to ensure that neither the employer nor employee acquires and spreads Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/civic-staff-facing-resistance-during-covid-19-surveys-in-pune-s-slums/story-mfKa9i2ydtozhnDiAa5SyH.html

However, with a lot of spare time on her hands, Habbu also paints, is learning how to cook, stitch and sew.For the 15-year-old, 2019 was a great year as she clinched the top spot in the under-17 group and also delivered memorable performances. Habbu was also a part of the Indian squad for the junior Asian badminton championship and finished third in the under-19 junior nationals held at Rajahmundry in December. A resident of Kalyaninagar, she describes a day in her life during the lockdown. Morning sessionI wake up at 8am and have a light breakfast and start my day with my morning workout. It usually consists of long runs in the society to keep up the energy reserves and maintain my stamina. The session continues for an hour, later in the day I devote my time to household chores like cleaning and sweeping.Afternoon sessionI usually take a nap for an hour, have lunch and then proceed to either paint and get creative or simply read a book. Evening sessionI work on strengthening and conditioning my muscles followed by 20 minutes of core workout – the session lasts for an hour. After the workout, I enjoy watching Netflix and catching up with my friends through online games or video calls. I also utilise my free time by painting or helping my younger brother with his studies. To cheer up at night, my family religiously plays the carrom or a game of cards followed by watching news on TV.No gym, no worries As I am not allowed to hit the gym, I follow a workout routine given by my trainer. I do endurance training twice a week, work on agility and footwork three times a week and spend the remaining days working on flexibility and yoga. It is very important to take care of your body in times like these, we need to be able to train to the best of our abilities and use all the resources which are available. In my opinion, quarantine should not be an excuse to miss or skip training. You do not need fancy equipment or too much time, one justs need to schedule the workout properly. To keep in touch with the game I do wall-practice with a shuttle for 20 minutes a day and make it a point to watch badminton related videos and online matches.HobbyCooking and painting. My grandmother also encourages me to learn how to cook and teaches me something new every day which I enjoy a lot. I am also currently learning how to stitch and sew. Painting is one thing which I like since my childhood. As a player, this routine is quite different from the normal one, I hope we can all overcome this pandemic and resume our normal lives soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/riya-habbu-badminton-u17-no-1-shuttles-between-training-badminton-practice-and-painting-at-her-pune-home-during-the-lockdown/story-o0qJfkOKGZdeDk8TF4B13N.html

This decision has been taken to begin the new academic session on time.BEPC director Sanjay Singh said, “The council has collaborated with UNICEF for developing content. Class-wise and subject-wise study materials are being prepared. With the help of All India Radio (AIR), the content will be broadcast.”“Radio has deep penetration into villages which would benefit the rural and urban students as well. The equipment required for radio access is much simpler. A basic phone or smartphone would serve the purpose.”Kiran Singh, state programme officer, said, “Paper work with AIR is in progress, which I hope will be completed soon. We have asked for evening slots for Class 9 and 10. Weekly schedule would be finalised shortly. We might start broadcast from next week if we get duly approval.”Besides, BEPC has also encouraged use of online education portals like Diksha.“Now almost every family has a smartphone and internet connection. The students can utilise their free time by engaging themselves with new syllabus using these mobile applications. NCERT books are available free of cost on Dikha app for class 1 to 12. It also has integrated audio-visual media along with digital textbooks for better understanding and online assessment”, said a BEPC official.Earlier in March, BEPC had announced for promotion of all students from Class 1 to 8 to next grade on the basis of their performance in half-yearly examination. The education department suspended examination owing to the Coronavirus outbreak.Meanwhile, all the teaching and non-teaching staff members of the Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) donated their day’s salary to PM Cares fund to fight with Covid-19 outbreak.“On the call of vice-chancellor Harish Chandra Singh Rathore, each employee of CUSB voluntarily donated their one day’s salary of March in a bid to extend their help to the government in procuring medical equipment and facilitate better medical services to fight with coronavirus outbreak. The donated amount summed Rs.5,60,918 which was electronically transferred to PM CARES fund on April 2 ”, said Mudassir Alam, public relation officer of the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/bihar-education-project-council-to-teach-students-of-class-8-12-via-all-india-radio/story-oJhClUWjkCQK6Uv5mXJ40J.html
05-04-2020||Delhi||Newspaper vendors fight myths with facts amid Covid-19 crisis||Gopal Chauhan has been distributing newspapers in Lajpat Nagar for the last 30 years. Every day, with clockwork precision, Chauhan ensures that his customers get their daily dose of latest news, views and information. For four days between March 23 and March 26, however, Chauhan could not do his job, which he proudly says, is an important one.“I have always taken pride in my job. I know that my customers wait for me eagerly each morning. I know their day is incomplete if I don’t deliver the newspaper,” said Chauhan, in the context of the nationwide lockdown in which several housing societies and RWAs had stopped accepting newspapers fearing the coronavirus infection. No one has been infected by Sars-Cov-2 through newspapers or packages, with scientific research showing the virus does not survive on porous surfaces. The particular sterility of newsprint makes newspapers safe, world’s top scientists and researchers have said.“Initially, I had stopped because some of my customers suspended the service, so I assumed that others will also not accept. But from fifth day onwards, I started getting so many calls from my customers, asking for the newspaper,” Chauhan said.In its guidelines related to the national lockdown to stave off the spread of Sars-Cov-2 infection released on March 23, the Union home ministry had included media in the list of essential services along with others such as banking, hospitals and ration shops. This means there is no bar on the distribution of newspapers or the movement of journalists. Chauhan, like hundreds of other vendors, who are helping in the fight against Covid-19 by ensuring dissemination of credible and scientific information through newspapers, said: “At a time like this, the newspaper is even more important. Besides information, during any crisis, it is the newspaper that gives voice to the common man,” said Chauhan. He said he was making all-out efforts to connect with his customers and convincing them to resume the delivery of newspapers.Dinesh Kumar, a newspaper vendor who has 32 distributors working under him, said despite several condominiums and gated societies in Gurugram refusing to accept their daily supply of newspapers, his men were still going out every day and leaving the bundles at the gates. Kumar said he has been in the business of newspaper distribution for the past 17 years. Every morning, Kumar reaches IFFCO Chowk centre in Gurgaon from where his distribution team sorts and picks newspapers before going out to deliver them across the city. Asked why he was continuing despite customers not accepting newspapers, Kumar said: “This is a social service. There is so much fake news on the internet and social media. It is only the newspaper that tells the truth,” he said. Like Chauhan, Kumar said he was trying to convince his customers to read the newspaper “even more” during this “critical time”.He said sales have reduced by half. “We are going through a tough time. But my distributors are coming without fail every day, and I am trying my best to ensure that their salaries are paid on time,” said Kumar.National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) director Dr Sujeet K Singh had earlier said it is untrue that newspapers can be a source of the Sars-Cov-2 infection. “There is no evidence to suggest that. If it was happening, we would have said so to stop the infection. What we know about the virus, for sure, right now is that it spreads largely through droplets and fomites [infected surfaces], not newspapers,” Singh said.Several newspaper vendors and distributors in Delhi-NCR said they were struggling to figure out how to collect payments from their customers during lockdown. The biggest issue they say they are facing is that of discrimination from people who feel that the newspaper and those distributing it are carriers of the virus.BP Singh Pradhan who has been distributing newspapers in central Delhi since 1984, said, “The fear of the virus is so strong that people have started to shun us. The idea that the newspaper spreads coronavirus is misplaced. Even we are touching the newspaper to deliver it to people. But has anyone thought about our health?” asked Pradhan.The vendors and distributors said they were taking all precautions to ensure that they operate with safety gear such as gloves and masks and sanitise their hands. “I am also trying to spread awareness through various means that the newspaper does not spread coronavirus,” said Kumar. Emphasising the need for newspapers to reach people, additional commissioner of police MS Randhawa, who is also the city police’s spokesperson, said that police personnel are ensuring that no vendor or distributor is stopped from delivering newspapers.The officer said, “It was reported that some newspaper agents, distributors were blocked from distributing the paper. An order has already been issued to all the district deputy commissioners of police to instruct all beat level officers to allow newspaper delivery. The distribution of papers takes place between 4am and 9am. Delhi police will ensure that citizens are not deprived of their daily newspapers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/newspaper-vendors-fight-myths-with-facts/story-QLsk9EqRw6Up9Z7x90sw2K.html
05-04-2020||City||Coronavirus effect: Licence renewal date for pubs and bars extended till April 22||Gurugram: The Haryana excise and taxation department has extended the date for renewal of licence for pubs, bars and company godowns till April 22 due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus. Excise licences for liquor vends, pubs, bars and restaurants are renewed annually by March-end, said officials. All the liquor vends in the state are not allowed to operate at least till April 14. The prices of liquor of all brands will also not change till the new excise policy, announced in February, is implemented. The prices, which had to be revised starting April 1, may now change after April 22 or later. The new policy is likely to be implemented in May depending on the situation, said the officials.Aruna Singh, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (east), said, “The permit fee, assessment fee, import and export fee will also be charged at the rates applicable for the policy year 2019-20 until April 22 and other provisions of the excise policy will also remain unchanged for the time being. The renewal fees for pubs, bars, and godowns can be paid by April 22,” she said.The officials said that the licensees shall pay a full annual fee, whatsoever is due at the time of renewal.On February 20, the Haryana cabinet had approved the new excise policy, in which they gave relief to wholesalers and hoteliers who will have the choice to buy liquor from any licensed wholesaler for 2020-2021.HC Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west), said that the extension was given so that people do not visit the excise office for their documentation work. “We are keeping social distancing and have informed all the licence holders to visit the office after the lockdown period is over. The restaurants are anyways shut and not operating, so they will get the benefit for this period,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-effect-licence-renewal-date-for-pubs-and-bars-extended-till-april-22/story-EtqDC2tdvaiN1IoDCpG7sN.html
05-04-2020||World||US President Trump warns of ‘toughest week’ with a ‘lot of death’||US President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Americans of a “lot of death” as he sought to urge them to brace themselves for the “toughest week” yet in the fight against the coronavirus that killed an average of more than a 1,000 people in the last few days and infected thousands.“This will be probably the toughest week, between this week and the next week,” the American president told reporters at the daily briefing by the White House coronavirus task force. “And there will be a lot of death, unfortunately.”More than 8,500 Americans have died in the outbreak till Sunday morning, over 1,000 from the previous day; and the number of confirmed cases climbed to 3,12,000. New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana states remain the hardest hit, with New York City bearing the brunt of it. Washington DC, Colorado and Pennsylvania are emerging worries, health officials have said. Washington state, which reported the first death in February, and California, which was the first state to issue stay-at-home orders, have kept their numbers low and are being touted as the model for social-distancing for others.The next week will be tough, as US officials has been warning for a while. They have warned of 100,000 to 240,000 fatalities in all despite the social-distancing measures in place, without which deaths could be as high as 2.2 million. And in anticipation of the peak, they stepped up preventive measures to include — as a recommendation, not mandatory — masks or face covering in public, and stepped up procurement of protective gear for health workers such as gowns, masks and gloves.“The next two weeks are extraordinarily important,” said Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. “This is the moment to not be going to the grocery store, not going to the pharmacy, but doing everything you can to keep your family and your friends safe, and that means everybody doing the six-feet distancing, washing their hands.”The grim warning came amidst projections that New York, Louisiana and Detroit in Michigan, the three hotspot regions with the highest incidence of cases, will be hitting their peaks together in six to seven days.New York state had reported 3,565 fatalities till Sunday morning, with 2,624 in New York City along; the total number of cases in the state that continues to be the epicenter of the American coronavirus epidemic, followed by New Jersey with 846, Michigan with 504 and Louisiana with 409 deaths.While the situation remains dire in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo said at his daily briefing on Sunday that over the last few days “the number of deaths has been dropping for the first time”. But he hastened to add it was too early to know what to make of it, though new hospitalizations are also down.The struggle for resources continued, despite Trump administration’s claims to the contrary. New York is still short of ventilators that are needed for several ill Covid-19 patients. “The number of beds doesn’t really matter anymore. We have the beds. It’s the ventilators, and then it’s the staff,” the governor said. He has appealed to other states to send over their supplies and health professionals to help the state at this time, promising to reciprocate when they needed it, in a rolling pattern.Over 66,000 people have died in the pandemic globally and there have been more than1.25 million confirmed cases. It has wreaked havoc on economies around the world, including the richest nations — an estimated 10 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the last two weeks. Developing countries are expected to be hit the hardest. “In three to six weeks, Europe and America will continue in the throes of this — but there is no doubt the center will move to places like Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro and Monrovia,” said Ashish Jha, Director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, to the Washington Post. “We need to be very worried.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-trump-warns-of-toughest-week-with-a-lot-of-death/story-RhhxYbxt4vE69m7PtEiFzH.html

05-04-2020||World||UK Covid-19 death toll likely to be between 7,000 and 20,000: Epidemiologist||A key epidemiologist advising the Boris Johnson government on Sunday reiterated expert modeling that the coronavirus death toll in the United Kingdom is likely to be between 7,000 and 20,000, as latest figures put the figure at 4,313.Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, whose modeling prompted the government to shift strategy from the controversial ‘herd immunity’ to lockdown and other measures, said it is not yet clear when restrictions could be eased. UK hospitals are dealing with 41,093 cases.A special message from Queen Elizabeth was due to be telecast to the UK and the Commonwealth at 8 pm UK time on Sunday (0030 of Monday India time).Ferguson told BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “There is no point, having gone through this effort, in releasing a lockdown at a point where case numbers are still high and will resurge even faster than we have seen before”.“We want case numbers to get to a low point where we can start substituting other measures for the most intrusive and economically costly aspects of the current lockdown,” he said, adding that the death toll could be “anywhere between about 7,000 or so up to a little over 20,000”, he added.According to quotes released before the queen’s message, she is expected to say: “I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time. A time of disruption in the life of our country: a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.”“I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country.”Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader, told Sunday television that “serious mistakes” had been made by the Boris Johnson government while dealing with the pandemic, but had reached an arrangement to receive ministerial briefings and wanted to be constructive.“But asking those difficult questions matters.

Over 700 Indian nationals, including over 70 tourists and students, are stranded in the island nation due to non-availability of flights. They are being helped by the high commission with their visa extension and where requested with food and accommodation, the envoy told PTI. “We are working with Singapore’s Manpower and Foreign Affairs Ministries to help Indian nationals in every way,” said Ashraf, who joined Singapore’s Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran, Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad and Member of Parliament Murali Pillai during a visit to an Indian workers dormitory on Saturday. Of the 72 Indian nationals infected by COVID-19, 21 are permanent residents, 28 are on employment passes (and their dependents), 18 are on work passes (of whom 16 are workers living in dormitories) and five are on short term visits to Singapore. Many of these infected Indians had travelled to America and Europe. A few of the workers had visited India before being confirmed as COVID-19 patients, though it is not definite where they were infected, according to Ashraf. The high commissioner has assured the Indian workers that the Singapore Government will look after them, provide medical treatment if they fall sick, and will work with employers to address salary-related issues. Management of dormitories will also try to ensure smooth functioning of remittance services from dormitories. The high commissioner has asked the Indian workers to stay calm and positive and follow all hygiene and social distancing protocol in the dormitories. Those workers affected by the four-week shut down of construction sites and other workplaces, as part of the disinfection and cleaning up of sites and premises hit by COVID-19, are assured of their salaries and welfare by the Singapore authorities. “There is no need to worry and be concerned as the Singapore authorities have assured of all helps and the Indian High Commission is available 24/7 with emergency phone numbers and online services to help,” said Jawed Ashraf. Tens of thousands Indian nationals are working in Singapore’s labour intensive sectors -- construction and shipyards -- some of which are coronavirus clusters after large number of COVID-19 cases were identified there. The livelihood of foreign workers will be taken care of, as Singapore ramps up measures to fight the spread of the coronavirus, said Minister for Communications and Information Iswaran on Saturday. Speaking to reporters after a 30-minute dialogue with foreign workers at a dormitory in Jurong industrial estate, Iswaran said the government’s top concern is their health and well-being, along with that of Singapore residents. “The second thing is that they have concerns around their livelihood, as well as their welfare, and these are things that the Ministry of Manpower is working with other government agencies, as well as the dormitory authorities to address,” The Straits Times quoted Iswaran as saying after visiting foreign workers on Saturday. “We want to assure the workers that we are doing our best to address these concerns and ensure that they are able to navigate this period of closure with some level of peace of mind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ten-of-72-indian-coronavirus-patients-recover-in-singapore/story-kVev68PP6B6DmUdLoITrOP.html

Pope Francis called the pandemic a tragedy on Sunday that must be faced with courage and hope.“Today, in the tragedy of a pandemic, in the face of the many false securities that have now crumbled, in the face of so many hopes betrayed, in the sense of abandonment that weighs upon our hearts, Jesus says to each one of us: ‘Courage, open your heart to my love’,” the pope said.Palm Sunday marks the arrival of Jesus in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. Easter Sunday on April 12 celebrates his resurrection from the dead.But many of the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics are observing the sacred days under home confinement -- just like the 83-year-old pontiff.Pope Francis has been communicating with the outside world by video so that crowds do not gather to see and hear him in one of the world’s most famous squares.Vatican City itself has been closed to tourists for nearly a month as part of global efforts to stop the spread of a disease that has officially killed more than 65,000 people worldwide.The Argentine-born pontiff went on to call on the faithful to overcome their fears and remember that they are not alone.“When we have our back to the wall, when we find ourselves at a dead end, with no light and no way of escape, when it seems that God himself is not responding, we should remember that we are not alone,” the pope said in his prayer.Pope Francis himself went down with a cold in late February and was reportedly tested for COVID-19 twice as a precaution because seven people in the Vatican have caught the virus.The Vatican says the pope is now in good health.Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter a week later on April 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-calls-for-courage-as-he-livestreams-palm-sunday-mass-due-to-coronavirus-tragedy/story-KkC2wu3fDp2shvDwHlzQCM.html

That is down from an increase of 7,026 infections in the previous 24-hour period, confirming the downward tendency of the past week.Confirmed new deaths also dropped to 674 fatalities, taking the national tally to 12,418. That is the first time new deaths have fallen below 800 new fatalities in the past week.As its outbreak loses steam, Spain’s government has started to cautiously consider when it can start to reactivate an economy that has been shut down and put hundreds of thousands out of work.“We are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez told the nation Saturday.But to get there, Sánchez announced that he would ask the Parliament to extend the state of emergency by two more weeks, taking the lockdown on mobility until April 26. He added that a team of experts is also studying how to plan for a gradual loosening of restrictions to reactive the country’s dormant economy and social life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-witnesses-drop-in-coronavirus-deaths-for-third-day/story-ofGxY103GtvNk6XsmtkPsM.html
05-04-2020||World||Donald Trump warns ‘toughest week’ ahead as global coronavirus deaths top 60,000||US President Donald Trump warned Americans to brace for a “very horrendous” number of coronavirus deaths in the coming days, ahead of a rare speech by Queen Elizabeth II on Sunday aimed at rallying hard-hit Britain.Global deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic have soared past 60,000, with Europe continuing to bear the brunt of the virus which has left roughly half the planet confined at home.There are now more than 1.2 million confirmed cases across the globe, and around 65,000 people have died since the virus first emerged in China late last year, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.Trump said the United States was entering “a time that’s going to be very horrendous” with “some really bad numbers.”“This will probably be the toughest week,” he said at the White House. “There will be a lot of death.”At the same time, the president stressed the US -- where infections have surpassed 300,000 -- cannot remain shut down forever.“Mitigation does work but again, we’re not going to destroy our country,” he said. “I’ve said it from the beginning -- the cure cannot be worse than the problem.”Over 45,000 global deaths have been in Europe, with Britain reporting a new daily high in fatalities, taking the overall toll to 4,300 out of nearly 42,000 cases.Queen Elizabeth II is to make a rare, “deeply personal” speech on Sunday to urge people to rise to the challenge posed by the coronavirus, and personally thank frontline healthcare workers.“I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,” she will say, according to extracts released Saturday.The pandemic has hammered the global economy, with businesses hit hard as people are forced to stay indoors to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.Governments have rolled out massive, unprecedented stimulus programs to ease the pain, but economists have warned that the crisis could worsen poverty levels with millions of jobs lost.Poor economies, such as Iraq, are struggling, with charities and volunteers rallying to provide food to the needy.“This is more dangerous than Daesh,” said Iraqi volunteer Mustafa Issa, referring to the Islamic State jihadist group that swept through a third of the country in 2014. Tide turning in Italy? At the Vatican, Pope Francis is expected to livestream his Palm Sunday Mass. St. Peter’s Square is usually packed by Catholic faithful for the occasion, but this year, it will be empty because of coronavirus containment measures.There was, however, some encouraging news from Europe over the weekend.Worst-hit Italy cheered after seeing its number of intensive care virus cases drop for the first time -- from 4,068 on Friday to 3,994 on Saturday.Even some of the most cautious Italian health officials seized on the figures as evidence that the tide may be turning in the deadliest disaster the country has faced since World War II.“This is a very important data point,” said civil protection service chief Angelo Borrelli, adding that it “allows our hospitals to breathe.”The daily rise in new infections across Italy has also slowed. It reported 681 new deaths on Saturday, down from a peak of almost 1,000 just over a week ago.Spain, which is under a near-total lockdown, saw a second successive daily fall in coronavirus-related deaths with 809 fatalities.The total number of deaths in Spain now stands at 11,947, second only to Italy.Although the number of new cases also slowed, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced an extension of the country’s lockdown until April 25.At a field hospital in Madrid set up at a conference centre, staff applauded whenever a patient was healthy enough to be discharged.One of them was 59-year-old builder Eduardo Lopez who gave a “10/10” rating to the staff who cared for him “with tenderness and a great dose of humanity.” ‘We need you’ New York state, the US epicenter, saw a record 630 deaths in a single day and Governor Andrew Cuomo warned the worst was yet to come. The state has recorded a total of 3,565 deaths.Cuomo also cautioned that already strained hospitals were not prepared.New York City appealed for licensed medical personnel to volunteer their services. “Anyone who’s not already in this fight, we need you,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said.Trump said 1,000 military personnel, mostly doctors and nurses, would be deployed to help in the city, which he described as “the hottest of all the hot spots.” U-turn on masks Several Western countries including the US, Germany and France have in recent days encouraged the use of masks in public despite earlier saying that only carers needed to cover their faces.The U-turn has angered and confused some citizens, and spurred a flurry of online tutorials for DIY masks.The advice came after some studies suggested the new coronavirus can be spread through speaking and breathing, not just coughing and sneezing.US authorities said wearing a simple homemade mask or scarf could help stem rocketing infection rates.The World Health Organization is reviewing its guidance but has said it worries that masks could give “a false sense of security,” leading people to be more casual about hand washing and social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-warns-toughest-week-ahead-as-global-coronavirus-deaths-top-60-000/story-ucTROG1PhnXgaAOvV7QZEM.html

The US has so far repatriated around 37,000 Americans stranded overseas due to the pandemic and is planning to bring another 22,000 of its citizens, many of whom are in South Asia, especially India, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Ian Brownlee told reporters during a conference call on Friday.  “We have repatriated roughly 37,000 US citizens from over 60 countries on more than 400 flights. It includes over 20,000 Americans repatriated in the past week alone,” Brownlee said. He said the US State Department has approximately 70 flights scheduled in the coming days which should bring back several thousand more US citizens. “South Asia now has the most US citizens wishing to return. So far the US has brought home almost 1,000 Americans from South Asia and are working aggressively to assist thousands more who have expressed an interest in returning,” Brownlee said. “The total number we’re looking at overseas at this point is about 22,000. The greatest number of those – certainly the plurality of those – are in South and Central Asia, many of them in India,” he added. Brownlee urged Americans to return to their home country as soon as possible. “For the US citizens contemplating whether or not to come home, the time to act is now. Flights will not continue indefinitely, but we want to do all we can to assist you while we are still able to do so,” he said. More than 60,000 people have died from coronavirus since it was first detected late last year in China.With more than three lakh confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and over 8,000 fatalities, the US has emerged as the global epicentre of the deadly coronavirus disease to which there has been no cure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-airlift-22-000-americans-stranded-overseas-many-in-india/story-meOHdTRdIauchDCu2oldHM.html
05-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: Taiwan’s Covid-19 strategy sets an example as total number of cases remain under 400||Coronavirus originated from China’s Wuhan last year. As it began to step away from mainland China, the deadly contagion left behind over 80,000 patients and killed more than 3,000 people in the country. As of today, nearly 1.2 million people are affected by the virus and a whopping 60,000 have been killed. The virus is estimated to account for a record number of patients and deaths in the United States. European nations like Italy, Spain, France and Germany are already reeling. Global bodies like the World Health Organization hailed South Korea for its strategy to contain the virus spread. Another administration which has done laudable work in mitigating the crisis within its territory is Taiwan.Taiwan, although so close to mainland China (just 81 miles off coast), has managed to keep the ugly head of Covid-19 from rising within its territory.  We activated the @Taiwan_CDC’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) back in January, and I visited them today to thank our unsung heroes for their non-stop, #AllHandsOnDeck efforts to contain the #COVID19 outbreak & keep the people of #Taiwan safe. pic.twitter.com/3uGUTxt7LFAccording to a report, as the news of coronavirus’ emergence surfaced in Wuhan last year, officials at Taiwan’s National Health Command Center (NHCC) acted quickly.Stanford expert Jason Wang, who is an associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine, says the outcome is a result of Taiwan using “new technology and a robust pandemic prevention plan put into place at the 2003 SARS outbreak”.Taiwan’s National Health Command Center (NHCC) was set up after the SARS pandemic and became part of its mechanism to tackle large outbreaks. Today I announced three major areas where #Taiwan will contribute to the global fight against #COVID19: 1️⃣: Donating 10 million face masks to countries in need. 2️⃣: Increasing production of quinine. 3️⃣: Sharing our use of technology to trace & investigate outbreaks. pic.twitter.com/F5yxyuF0FcWhile world economies were mulling over what actions to take and when, Taiwan was already responding with a Covid-19 strategy in place. Owing to its proximity to mainland China, it was supposed to be one of the worst-hit regions by coronavirus. Taiwan quickly moved to put travel curbs in place, checking its ports and introducing stringent punishments for violators of quarantine orders. Aggressive testing also helped Taiwan deal with the pandemic efficiently. Taiwanese authorities came into action as soon as the WHO was notified of a pneumonia of unknown cause in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December.In the first week of January itself,  Taiwanese authorities issued a notification for individuals who had travelled to or from Wuhan in the past 14 days and reported fever or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection.Those displaying symptoms were quarantined, tested for over 20 viruses.“Taiwan leveraged its national health insurance database and integrated it with its immigration and customs database to begin the creation of big data for analytics; it generated real-time alerts during a clinical visit based on travel history and clinical symptoms to aid case identification. It also used new technology, including QR code scanning and online reporting of travel history and health symptoms to classify travelers’ infectious risks based on flight origin and travel history in the past 14 days,” Wang says in a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).The administration prepared a list of 124 action items to devise a strategy against coronavirus. After nearly three months into the Covid-19 crisis, Taiwan has reported less than 400 coronavirus cases and witnessed 5 deaths as per the data by Johns Hopkins University. The lessons that world economies can learn from Taiwan’s Covid-19 plan are enormous. Taiwan’s strategy finds its foundation in early recognition of the crisis.With “daily briefings to the public, and simple health messaging, the government was able to reassure the public by delivering timely, accurate, and transparent information regarding the evolving epidemic,” Wang writes in her paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-taiwan-s-covid-19-strategy-sets-an-example-as-total-cases-remain-under-400/story-Ij2IMMhG4aqzXdERg3RAaO.html

The flights cost each adult £681 from Goa, £600 from Mumbai and £581 from Delhi; infants under the age of 2 will travel free.Jan Thompson, acting high commissioner to India, said: “We know how worrying the past few weeks have been for British nationals in India. I hope this announcement will bring relief, especially to those in greatest need”.“Due to the large numbers of British travellers involved, the scale of this operation is huge. The UK Government continues to work hard with our Indian counterparts in New Delhi and London to arrange a safe journey back for as many people as possible”.Officials said the charter flights are for UK travellers who normally reside in the UK and their direct dependants. A number of seats will be reserved for those deemed vulnerable. On Saturday, 113 of the most vulnerable British nationals left Goa on an Irish flight.Foreign Office minister Tariq Ahmad said: “In the absence of commercial flights, these first charter flights from India should provide relief to some of our British travellers who are desperate to return home, especially for the most vulnerable and those in greatest need”.In view of the restrictions on movement in India, Britons travelling to airports from where the charter flights will depart are asked to carry a letter called the ‘British movement letter’ in English (also translated in 9 languages) to show to Indian authorities.It says: “All Indian authorities are hereby requested to provide holders of British passport or resident permits with safe passage, without delay or detention, to their port of departure in India”.“For this purpose all Indian authorities are further requested to exempt holders of British passports or resident permits from any restrictions on public movement or crossing of State or District boundaries currently imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic”.Officials said there are an estimated 35,000 Britons currently in India, of whom over 20,000 are keen to return home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flights-for-over-20-000-britons-stranded-in-india-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-from-april-8/story-YlbM84XemGvvfte4tf3rFP.html
05-04-2020||World||US concerns natural, will challenge acquittal of Daniel Pearl murder convicts: Qureshi||Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said on Saturday that the apprehensions expressed by the US goverment over acquittal of four people convicted in killing of Amerian journalist Daniel Pearl were “natural”.He added that the decision will be challenged in the country’s Supreme Court.“Pakistan has made many sacrifices in the fight against terrorism,” the FM stressed, adding, “The entire nation fought a long war against terrorism and defeated this menace with collective efforts.”Qureshi further said that the accused had right to appeal and the Sindh High Court, while acknowledging this right, suspended the life sentence given to three accused - Fahad Naseem, Salman Saqib and Sheikh Adil - and commuted prime accused Sheikh Omar’s capital punishment to seven-year imprisonment.However, hours after the verdict, the Sindh Home department issued orders to detain the four before they were released from prison, citing sufficient reason to believe that these men may act “against the interest of the country”.“Yesterday, the Sindh government had ordered the detention of the four suspects for 90 days under the Public Safety Act,” Qureshi said.The US State Department had earlier condemned the overturning of the convictions and terming the decision “an affront to victims of terrorism everywhere”.“Those responsible for Daniel’s heinous kidnapping and murder must face the full measure of justice,” senior US diplomat Alice Wells wrote on Twitter on Thursday.On Friday, Pakistan’s Ministry of Interior had said that the government of Sindh will file an appeal next week against the judgment in the Supreme Court.“The government of Pakistan has asked the Sindh government to dedicate its best resources in the pursuance of appeal before the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan,” it said, adding that the provincial government was advised to consult Attorney General for Pakistan in the matter.Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief of Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story on the alleged links between the country’s powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.Sheikh, who was the mastermind behind abduction and killing of Pearl, was arrested from Lahore in February 2002 and sentenced to death five months later by an anti-terrorism court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-concerns-natural-will-challenge-acquittal-of-daniel-pearl-murder-convicts-qureshi/story-xjkAz2jHqtT4yzuhCksXxN.html
05-04-2020||World||Anti-parasitic drug kills coronavirus within 48 hours in lab grown cells: Study||Researchers have found that an anti-parasitic drug already available around the world can kill the novel coronavirus grown in cell cultures within 48 hours, an advance that may lead to the development and trial of a new clinical therapy for COVID-19.According to the study, published in the journal Antiviral Research, the drug, Ivermectin, stopped the virus, SARS-CoV-2, from growing in cell culture within 48 hours. “We found that even a single dose could essentially remove all viral RNA by 48 hours and that even at 24 hours there was a really significant reduction in it,” said study co-author Kylie Wagstaff from Monash University in Australia. The scientists said Ivermectin is an approved anti-parasitic drug that has also been shown to be effective in vitro against a broad range of viruses including HIV, Dengue, Influenza and Zika virus. However, Wagstaff cautioned that the tests conducted in the study were in vitro and that trials needed to be carried out in people. “Ivermectin is very widely used and seen as a safe drug. We need to figure out now whether the dosage you can use it at in humans will be effective - that’s the next step,” Wagstaff said. “In times when we’re having a global pandemic and there isn’t an approved treatment, if we had a compound that was already available around the world then that might help people sooner,” she said. Although the mechanism by which Ivermectin works on the virus is not known, the scientists said it is likely, based on its action in other viruses, that it works to stop the virus ‘dampening down’ the host cells’ ability to clear it. “As the virologist who was part of the team who were first to isolate and share SARS-COV2 outside of China in January 2020, I am excited about the prospect of Ivermectin being used as a potential drug against COVID-19,” said Leon Caly, study co-author from the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia. The scientists further cautioned that the use of Ivermectin to combat COVID-19 would depend on the results of future pre-clinical testing and ultimately clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anti-parasitic-drug-kills-coronavirus-within-48-hours-in-lab-grown-cells-study/story-GWEikskherACYNEKpGsfCJ.html

He, however, exuded confidence that Pakistan would emerge stronger from the challenge.“Nobody should have the false notion that they will be safe from this (coronavirus)...Look at New York where most of the rich people live,” he said on Saturday.Khan’s remarks came as he visited Lahore to oversee the measures taken by the Punjab government as the number of coronavirus patients in the largest province of the country crossed 1,000.Khan visited a 1,000-bed makeshift hospital set up by the provincial government at a short notice to accommodate the coronavirus patients.As of Saturday, Pakistan has recorded 2,818 cases of Covid-19. There have been 41 deaths due to the disease in the country, though with only limited testing available, observers worry the number is far higher.Punjab - the hotspot of the viral infection in Pakistan - reported a total of 1,072 cases, followed by Sindh at 839, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 383, Balochistan 175, Gilgit-Baltistan 193, Islamabad 75 and 11 cases in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Khan earlier in the day again rejected the possibility of a total lockdown.The Pakistan government on Saturday informed the Supreme Court that the number of coronavirus patients in the country could reach up to 50,000 by the last week of this month.According to the breakdown provided in the report and widely reported in the media, around 7,000 cases of the total are expected to be critical in nature while around 2,500 could be a cause of concern. The government estimates that a further 41,000 cases could be of a mild nature.The report noted that confirmed cases are expected to be lower than that of countries in Europe, and assured that the government is trying to maximise its testing capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/look-at-new-york-where-rich-people-live-imran-khan-warns-pakistan-on-covid-19/story-VR0bGRuMIJTrRDLvnTE76L.html

More than 306,000 people have tested positive in the United States and over 8,300 have died.But that isn’t stopping a church in a suburb of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from celebrating the Palm Sunday this weekend.Despite warnings from local and state officials, Solid Rock had been holding its 1,000-strong gatherings in person, and plans keep the church open on Palm Sunday, the beginning of Holy Week in Christian churches.“We’re defying the rules because the commandment of God is to spread the Gospel,” Louisiana pastor Tony Spell said on Saturday.Louisiana has become a US hot spot for the virus, and reported a jump in deaths to 409 on Saturday.Millions of American Christians will observe Palm Sunday at home this weekend, as the vast majority of US churches have moved services online to comply with stay-at-home rules.But, like Solid Rock, pockets of churches from Florida to Texas and across to California are keeping their doors open and inviting worshippers to attend services this weekend.“Satan’s trying to keep us apart, he’s trying to keep us from worshipping together. But we’re not going to let him win,” Kelly Burton, pastor at Lone Star Baptist Church in Lone Star, Texas, wrote in a post on Facebook.President Donald Trump told Americans to brace for a big spike in coronavirus fatalities in the coming days, as the country faces what he called the toughest two weeks of the pandemic.“There’s going to be a lot of death,” Trump said at a briefing with reporters on Saturday.White House medical experts have forecast that between 1,00,000 to 2,40,000 Americans could be killed in the pandemic, even if sweeping orders to stay home are followed.In the grimmest day yet for the US state hit hardest by the pandemic, coronavirus-related illnesses killed 630 people in the last 24 hours in New York state, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satan-s-trying-to-keep-us-apart-say-us-pastors-set-to-defy-palm-sunday-quarantine-over-covid-19/story-Z7eemngDlKM9hvs2gwqehK.html

So we are walking a tightrope,” he said in another tweet.Khan on Friday mentioned the problems faced by India due to what he called unplanned lockdown.“India is facing dire consequences due to unplanned lockdown. As a sensible strategy is required, we are monitoring the situation daily,” Khan said. The Punjab government announced that it will reopen more industries including textile, sports good, surgical goods, auto parts, leather and leather garments, meat and meat products, fruit and vegetables and pharmaceuticals.Meanwhile, the Pakistan government on Saturday informed the Supreme Court that the number of coronavirus patients in the country could reach up to 50,000 by the last week of this month.It was stated in a report submitted by the government on its national action plan for combating the coronavirus epidemic in the country.Geo News reported that in its report, the government detailed the situation in the wake of the pandemic and the severity of suspected cases.“By April 25, the number of the coronavirus cases are feared to reach 50,000,” the report stated.According to the breakdown provided in the report, around 7,000 cases of the total are expected to be critical in nature while around 2,500 could be a cause of concern. The government estimates that a further 41,000 cases could be of a mild nature.The report noted that confirmed cases are expected to be lower than that of countries in Europe, and assured that the government is trying to maximize its testing capacity.The federal government said that it has put in place an emergency plan worth $366 million and guidelines have been prepared in consultation from the medical experts.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage“All the airports have special counters to monitor coronavirus,” it mentioned in the report, adding that around 222 suspected patients have been traced due to th entry and exit point checking at airports.The areas adjacent to Iran and along the Balochistan border have declared an emergency to cope with the incoming infected individuals, it said.“Preparations were made to place patients in 154 districts under quarantine,” the government added in the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-covid-19-cases-in-pakistan-rise-to-2-818-imran-khan-says-nobody-is-safe/story-KlwOKdhnpGr9j08329RLGJ.html

05-04-2020||World||Child aged five among new UK coronavirus victims||Britain on Saturday reported a record 708 daily deaths from COVID-19, including a five-year-old child, who is thought to be the country’s youngest victim.The health ministry said 4,313 people who tested positive for the virus in hospital had died as of 1600 GMT Friday while there were 41,903 confirmed cases as of 0800 GMT Saturday, up 3,735.The toll has been steadily increasing by more than 500 deaths a day this week and the country is bracing for an expected peak in the next week to 10 days.A total of 637 of the latest deaths were in England, the National Health Service (NHS) said.“Patients were aged between five years and 104 years old. 40 of the 637 patients (aged between 48 and 93 years old) had no known underlying health condition,” it said in a statement. The NHS said it would not be giving further information about the five-year-old patient at the request of the family.A 13-year-old boy from London, Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, died last week, days after testing positive for COVID-19. His family said he had no underlying illnesses.Senior minister Michael Gove told a daily briefing that the teenager’s mother and siblings were now showing symptoms.The overall death toll now included seven healthcare professionals, he added.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in self-isolation after developing mild symptoms of the disease, ordered a three-week lockdown of the country on March 23 to try to cut infections.But there has been concern that warmer weather forecast for this weekend could tempt people from their homes to green spaces and public parks.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned against any relaxation in social distancing, saying: “If we do, people will die.”- ‘Things will plateau’ -Imperial College London epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, who is advising the government, told BBC radio on Saturday a peak was expected around the Easter weekend.“We still think things will plateau but we’ll be at quite high levels of infection for weeks and weeks rather than seeing quite a rapid decline as the type seen in China,” he said.But he said that was dependent on people staying at home. If that happened, it could lead to less stringent measures in place “at least by the end of May”, he added.The announcement of another record rise in deaths came after 13 residents at a care home in Glasgow died in one week in a suspected outbreak of coronavirus.The Burlington Court Care Home said those who died had underlying medical conditions and two staff members were being treated for COVID-19.Tests for coronavirus are currently carried out on the most serious cases that require hospital treatment, suggesting the true extent of confirmed cases and deaths is an under-estimate.The government meanwhile announced that up to 4,000 low-risk prisoners near the end of their sentence could be release from jails in England and Wales to try to stop the spread of COVID-19.A total of 88 prisoners and 15 prison staff have tested positive for the virus, and there is concern it could spread rapidly because of shared cells and overcrowding.The justice ministry said those released would be electronically tagged and temporarily released on licence in stages. High-risk offenders will not be considered for early release.The national medical director for NHS England, Stephen Powis, condemned vandals who attacked new 5G mobile phone network masts, after discredited claims it helped spread the virus.Powis called the theory “absolute and utter rubbish” and said he was “absolutely outraged (and) disgusted” that vital infrastructure had been targeted during a national emergency.“The reality is that the mobile phone networks are absolutely critical to all of us, particularly in a time when we’re asking people to stay at home and not to see relatives and friends.“But in particular they are also the phone networks that are used by our emergency services and our health workers,” he added.Later Saturday, news emerged that the British singer and 1960s pop icon Marianne Faithfull had been admitted to hospital suffering from the virus.“She is stable and responding to treatment,” music industry publicists Republic Media tweeted.“We wish her well and a full and speedy recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/child-aged-five-among-new-uk-coronavirus-victims/story-4L2YaadY5kjImpmxrgcvbM.html

These antibodies could help patients in an acute stage of the disease to fight the virus.”The trials will involve 60 patients in Paris hospitals, half of whom will receive the plasma from the persons who have recovered.It said the first results could be known two to three weeks after the trials,The US Food and Drug Administration has alrady authorised physicians to experiment with the strategy to fight the coronavirus. Tests are also being done in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-test-plasma-of-coronavirus-survivors-to-treat-sick/story-I9VhGjcXMo4JCZFM7LdN5I.html
05-04-2020||World||Queen Elizabeth II to praise coronavirus response in address to Britain||Queen Elizabeth II will urge people to rise to the challenge posed by the coronavirus outbreak, in a rare special address to Britain and Commonwealth nations on Sunday.In extracts released Saturday of what royal officials said was a “deeply personal” speech, the 93-year-old monarch will say she has faith that people will respond, despite the difficulties.The broadcast, scheduled to air at 1900 GMT on Sunday, is only the fourth time in her 68-year reign that she has made a special televised address outside her annual Christmas Day message.It comes as daily deaths in Britain hit a record high of 708, including a five-year-old child on Saturday, taking the overall toll to 4,313 -- and as the country prepared for a third week of lockdown.According to Buckingham Palace, the queen will personally thank frontline healthcare staff and other key workers for their efforts during the crisis.“I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time,” she will say in the speech, which was recorded at Windsor Castle, west of London.“A time of disruption in the life of our country: a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has tested positive for COVID-19, has put his government on a war footing, calling for a collective response to the outbreak.Some 750,000 people responded to his call for volunteers to support the state-run National Health Service (NHS), the elderly and vulnerable currently in self-isolation.The initial appeal was for 250,000, while business and industry have been mobilised in a way unseen since World War II.The queen will say: “I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge.“And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.“That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country.” The queen and her 98-year-old husband Prince Philip moved to Windsor Castle on March 19 as a precaution because of their age, which puts them in a high-risk category.Royal officials have said the couple were in good health and following government guidelines.Her eldest son and heir Prince Charles, 71, has been in self-isolation on her sprawling Balmoral estate in northeast Scotland after developing mild symptoms of COVID-19.As a precaution, he officially opened by videolink a new 4,000-bed field hospital in east London which will treat the most seriously ill patients on Thursday.The royal family has cut its engagements, and Sunday’s speech was recorded by a single camera operator wearing personal protective equipment, royal officials said.Specific advice from royal doctors was sought to mitigate any risk to the queen and others, they added.The queen’s intervention is her first at troubled times since the death of her mother in 2002. Before that, she addressed the nation on the eve of Diana, princess of Wales’ funeral in 1997.She also broadcast a message in 1991 during the first Gulf War.A fourth message in 2012 was to thank the public after celebrations for her Diamond Jubilee, marking the 60th anniversary of her accession to the throne.(AFP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-ii-to-praise-coronavirus-response-in-address-to-britain/story-YXWfvldEM62XvMBKFWR8OI.html
05-04-2020||World||‘There’ll be a lot of death’: Trump tells US as Covid-19 cases surge||President Donald Trump said Saturday that the United States was heading into what could be its “toughest” weeks as coronavirus cases swell nationwide. He warned states not to inflate their needs for critical medical equipment.“There will be a lot of death, unfortunately. There will be death,” Trump said in a somber start to his daily briefing on the pandemic.Trump was joined by Vice President Mike Pence, virus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US government’s foremost infection disease expert. Each stood far apart from one another on the small stage.Trump said the goal was to stay several days ahead of critical medical needs in each state. But he also suggested that states were asking for more medical supplies than they really needed.“The fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests,” Trump said.Louisiana officials have said New Orleans is on track to run out of ventilators by next week. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., whose state is at the epicenter of the national pandemic with over 113,700 confirmed cases as of Saturday morning, has pleaded for ventilators for days and lambasted what he has said is insufficient help from the federal government. New York is poised to get more than 1,100 ventilators from China and Oregon.Trump also revisited a familiar message, saying he wants to get the economy up and running as soon as possible. At one point during the unfolding outbreak, Trump said he had hoped to open up businesses by Easter, April 12. He later acknowledged that was not possible, ceding the month of April after seeing rising death toll projections.“We have to vanquish the virus as quickly as we can. ... We have to get back to work,” he said.The number of people infected in the US has exceeded a quarter-million, with the death toll climbing past 7,000; more than 3,500 of those deaths are in New York.Much of the country is under orders to stay home, including professional sports leagues that were among the first to clamp down in the pandemic.Trump on Saturday spoke with commissioners of the country’s sports leagues. He said he told them that he recognizes “the good work being done by many teams and players” to care for their communities and fan bases dealing with the outbreak.The virus has decimated the sports world with the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League suspending their seasons indefinitely and Major League Baseball postponing the start of its season.The NCAA basketball tournament was also canceled, as were college spring sports such as baseball and softball, lacrosse and track and field.A wide range of sports leaders participated in the call, including Roger Goodell of the National Football League and the NBA’s Adam Silver. Trump called on them to continue efforts to support their fellow Americans.Before the briefing, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized the decision by Trump to nominate “one of his own lawyers,” as an inspector general overseeing federal aid during the coronavirus recovery.She said the watchdog monitoring “this historic relief package for workers and families must be independent from politics.”Trump appointed Brian Miller to the Treasury Department watchdog post. He currently serves as a special assistant to the president and as senior associate counsel in the White House.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is overseeing the government package that aims to shovel $2.2 trillion into theUS economy over the next few weeks to try to cushion the free fall. The assistance includes $349 billion in loans for small businesses and a $500 billion corporate rescue fund.The legislation signed by Trump last week created the special inspector general position as well as a panel appointed by Congress to monitor how the aid is deployed.Pelosi said Trump is disregarding provisions in the act that would hold the administration accountable. She said a new House committee on the virus response would work to ensure “taxpayer dollars are being used wisely and efficiently to help workers and not to be exploited by profiteers and price-gougers.”For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/there-ll-be-a-lot-of-death-trump-tells-us-as-covid-19-cases-surge/story-ZDKuW8OmJkonz8EvtmSHkI.html
05-04-2020||World||Some US companies wait for clarity on COVID-19 aid package||As the Trump administration on Friday began processing financial aid for small businesses under the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief legislation that the president signed into law last week, some large businesses and corporation are waiting for more clarity on the conditions attached to these payments.They are specially anxious about the possibility of the government picking up equity in borrowing firms in exchange. Boeing, which is looking at a substantial assistance package, has already opposed it saying it will explore other options. if forced to part with equity.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe administration is actively weighing, acquiring stake in borrowing companies, the big ones, as compensation. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Thursday it was under discussion now in the context of relief for the airlines industry and “I’ll be working very closely with the President, and we’ll make sure that we strike the right balance. This “not a bailout” and taxpayers should “get compensated”, he added.The Trump administration is eager to ensure the terms of the relief package — called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and. Economic Security Act (CARES Act) — were not as lenient as assistance put together by the Obama administration after the 2008 financial crisis, which has been used by some of the borrowing companies to buy back their own stock to boost them on the exchange and to make hefty payments to top executives.“We don’t let them buy back the stock; we don’t let that happen,” President Trump had said, when signing the legislation into law. “(with) tough limits on executive compensation.”The 42.2 trillion package included $300 billion in direct payment to American families; $350 in job retention loans to small business; $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits; $500 billion in loans for industries hit hard by the virus; and $100 billion for healthcare workers.The coronavirus outbreak shut down large parts of the country, forcing many businesses to close to lay off workers to survive. Airlines and related sectors are the worst hit, along with small businesses (those employing 500 workers or less). Unemployment has shot up with a record 6.6 million filing for benefits last week, in addition to the 3.3 million the week before.The amount set aside for industries is a mix of grants and loans and it has been earmarked for airlines, cargo carriers and those deemed essential for national security. Boeing falls in the third category and is looking at $17 billion along with others.The treasury department announced a set of conditions last week for disbursing loans to these industries. Borrowers are prohibited from buying back their stocks, or of their parent companies, until 12 months from the date when the loan is no longer outstanding.Borrowers are also banned from paying “dividends or make other capital distributions with respect to the common stock of the borrower” for after the same waiting period of 12 months.The borrowing company must also “maintain its employment levels as of March 24, 2020, to the extent practicable, and in any case will not reduce its employment levels by more than 10 percent from the levels on such date”.And, of course, the borrower must be an American company with “significant operations in and a majority of its employees based in the United States”.There is no indication in the treasury department announcement of “Procedures and Minimum Requirements” of the government acquiring a stake in the borrowing company. As Mnuchin said at a White House briefing earlier this week, the matter is still being considered, and he did not rule it out.Boeing has opposed it publicly and repeatedly. “I don’t have a need for an equity stake,” Boeing co-CEO Dave Calhoun told Fox Business just days before Trump signed the relief legislation into law. “If they force it, we just look at all the other options and we’ve got plenty of them.” He had then added the company was looking at borrowing from the government and had every intention of repaying the whole amount, with interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-us-companies-wait-for-clarity-on-covid-19-aid-package/story-jkg893kNwqKEdgg0BN9FkI.html

America ended the day, as a result, with 278,000 confirmed cases and 7,141 fatalities, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker Saturday.Washington DC, the national capital, has emerged as an area of “developing concern” along with the states of Colorado and Pennsylvania and the cities of Chicago in Illinois and Detroit in Michigan based on new cases and deaths, according to the White House coronavirus task force. New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, Connecticut continue to report high incidence.New York state remains the worst hit with 103,000 cases, a tenth of the world total of 1 million cases, and 2,935 deaths. New York City, which alone accounted for 1,867 deaths, is faced with an additional crisis of the shortage of medical supplies, and officials have warned of empty racks by this weekend.Washington state, where the first reported coronavirus death in America was announced on February 29, and California have been able to slow the spread belying early fears, and are beginning to be cited on how to beat the deadly pathogen with rigorous and disciplined social distancing.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), whose social-distancing guidelines have served as the template for the shutdown of all but a handful of US states, recommended Friday Americans should wear masks in public, as announced by President Donald Trump at the daily brief of the White House coronavirus task force, citing studies that show the “transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood”.“In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure,” the president said, and added, infusing the new recommendation with his characteristic scepticism about the virus., “So it’s voluntary; you don’t have to do it. They suggested for a period of time. But this is voluntary.” And, he added, severely undermining the credibility of the move, “I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.”President Trump’s reservations about the new recommendation are representative of his overall response to the outbreak from the start when he first sought to dismiss it as a hoax and then, as cases and bodybags piled up, portray it as a transient crisis. It proved to be neither and cost the country precious response time, according to his critics.Pressed for his reasons for his personal aversion to the mask, the president said, “I just don’t want to be doing -- I don’t know, somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk -- the great Resolute Desk -- I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don’t know. Somehow, I don’t see it for myself. I just -- I just don’t.”The president also addressed questions impact of the epidemic on the general election on November 3, when he will up up re-election. Asked if they be held as scheduled, he said, “The general election will happen on November 3.” But he dismissed suggestions of switching to mail-in voting in case social-distancing guidelines were still in place — “lot of people cheat with mail-in voting”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-us-beats-its-own-grim-record-covid-19-death-toll-touches-1-480-in-24-hours/story-KocA3U8Hp6FNjuo6Rwa10L.html

The talks focused on issues including the estimation of PPE, ventilators and medical equipment requirement, retrofitting domestic production lines to meet demand, supply chain management issues, innovative technology-led solutions, issues of certification, GST, import duties on components, issues of procurement, training, and post-lockdown operating procedures.“The start-ups, namely, AgVa, Biodesign Innovation Lab, Kaeaenaat, Qure AIDrona Maps, mFine, MicroGo, Staqu, working on innovative ventilator design, testing tools, and tracking solutions have been contacted separately to understand their scale and possible contributions,” said the release.While industries appraised the group about their philanthropic and CSR (corporate social responsibility) activities related to Covid-19, they also took up several challenges on critical issues of health care intervention, pertaining to ramping up production and procurement of ventilators, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/empowered-group-hits-ground-running-to-contain-pandemic/story-TwK2Cr4wSPQ2GMr5b2vapN.html
05-04-2020||India||Individuals, NGOs, companies pour in to volunteer for govt initiative||New Delhi: Over a lakh individuals and around 4,500 corporates/non-government organisations (NGOs) have so far offered their services as part of the government’s Self4Society initiative to fight the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, according to officials aware of the matter. They are being assigned works like supply chain management, providing food to migrant labourers, economic weaker sections, and producing IT-based solutions etc with the help of various government agencies like the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs).Hundreds of individuals have also donated over 5.51 lakh items like digital infrared thermometers, thermal scanners, surgical gloves, personal protective coveralls, masks, hand sanitizers, face shields etc as part of the initiative.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a Self4Society portal and app in October 2018 with a focus to invite electronics and IT companies to organise initiatives for social welfare. It has been now been expanded to include all kinds of corporates and NGOs. Abhishek Singh, the CEO of MyGov.in that manages Self4Society, said the NDMA wanted volunteers throughout the country for fighting the coronavirus. “We have volunteers in several categories now like community services, medical field, production of PPE [personal protection equipment] etc. Their demand aggregation is happening on the portal and this data is accessible to the states, which... assign the volunteers to work in required areas based on their expertise.”The corporates are also diverting their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to help deal with the pandemic. Abhishek Humbad, the CEO of CSR management firm Goodera, said, “We are helping corporates spend their CSR funds for projects like PPE and masks for hospitals, food kits for daily wage earners etc. Employees are volunteering virtually from their homes in activities like bringing grocery for elders, teaching kids, getting requirements from hospitals on needs etc.” He added Goodera is working with different hospitals across India to understand needs and also connecting with different suppliers to fulfil them in a time-bound manner. “All of this is being enabled through Goodera’s state of the art CSR and employee volunteering technology platform.”Humbad added that some of the big companies working with them on Covid-19 relief include Amazon, Hexaware, Lenovo, Toyota and Kirloskar Motor.Mohit Sharma, a Delhi-resident working as a volunteer, said after working from home, he assists authorities in spreading awareness at the community level on hygiene practices, benefits of social distancing and how to control the Covid-19 spread. “I am trying to do my bit.” Kamal Kishore, a member of the NDMA who is also a part of an empowered group coordinating with the private sector, NGOs and international organisations for Covid-19-related response activities, said they are coordinating closely with civil society organisations, corporates and understanding their capabilities. “Accordingly, it is decided in which area they can contribute to. We are working on other fronts as well including disseminating guidance for the general public as well as specific guidance for other target groups including public service delivery persons such as bank employees, shopkeepers... The NDMA is also in regular touch with all the SDMAs and providing them guidance on the management of Covid-19 emergency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/individuals-ngos-companies-pour-in-to-volunteer-for-govt-initiative/story-gsIpl72k3yirnenE52iswI.html
05-04-2020||India||In Kerala, nurses inspired by Nipah warrior Lini||Thiruvananthapuram: Reeja Vishnu, a nurse, was given an option of opting out of serving at high-pressure coronavirus (Covid-19) ward of Kalamassery Medical College Hospital in Kerala’s Ernakulam since she has a two-year-old daughter to take care of. But she declined the offer saying she would not do so when her services are needed the most. Many frontline health workers like her are volunteering to combat the pandemic that apart from carrying the risk for them of contracting the disease also involves following detailed protocols, wearing heavy personal protection equipment (PPE) and living restricted lives.“I have stopped breast-feeding my 2-year-old daughter. Initially, I had some problems but once I wear my PPE, I forget all my worries,” said Vishnu, 28. “We have many diligent workers like her and they all rise to the occasion. At Ernakulam Medical College Hospital, we have 24 patients in isolation wards,” said district medical officer Dr N K Kuttappan. Reshma Mohandas, a nurse at the Kottayam Medical College Hospital, who contracted the disease while looking after Thomas Abraham, 93, and his wife, Mariyamma, 84, has sought permission to return to work after the end of her 14-day mandatory quarantine at home. She was discharged after recovering along with the elderly couple on Friday.Dr T K Jayakumar, the hospital superintendent, called Mohandas, a committed worker. “People like her nursed back the aged couple. It is a big achievement for the country. We will take a call on her request at an appropriate time.”Mohandas recalled that the aged couple, which contracted the disease after some of their family members returned from Italy last month, were like small kids and were treated like that. “At times, they were stubborn and cranky. We had to pat and prod them quite often. Since one of them had some hearing problems, I had to go very close. It was my duty,” she said. Mohandas, (30), was isolated when she developed fever four days after the couple was admitted to the hospital. “I took it [infection] in my stride,” she said. Taking care of Covid-19 patients is a challenging job for frontline health workers like Vishnu and Mohandas. They say a person in PPE cannot work more than four hours, which often feels like 40. Wearing and removing PPE alone takes more than one hour. Another hour is usually spent on following the post-duty protocols.“We need another person’s help. First, we wear shoes and put on the PPE overalls. Then we cover our heads and wear masks and goggles. At times, we have to wear two or three layers of masks and then put on gloves; one large and another small over it. Since we cannot go to washrooms after putting on PPE, we usually avoid water,” a nurse said on condition of anonymity.She said after putting on PPE, there is a 10-minute check to find out whether a person is comfortable and can move around quickly. “Post-duty protocols are more cumbersome. We have to spray disinfectants on our clothes before removing them. Each apparel has different bins. During baths, we have to wash all our personal clothes and disinfect them again. We are not allowed to wear those clothes at least for a month. Then we move to our hostels and dormitories. We are not allowed to interact with others. We have to inform our superiors about our health twice a day,” she said. Many hospitals in Kerala, which is among the worst-hit states with 306 cases and reported the first Covid-19 case in the country in January, have arranged accommodations for their staffers treating Covid-19 patients.Nurses in Kerala say Lini Puthussery, a 28-year-old nurse who died fighting the Nipah virus outbreak in north Kerala in 2018, is their inspiration. A movie based on her life, ‘Virus’, was a big hit. “After fighting the Nipah virus, which was more dangerous, our health workers are stronger now. It is time to stand with them,” said Lini’s widower, Sajeesh. Lini left behind two children, then aged six and two. Sajeesh, who worked in West Asia, was later offered a job in the health department in Kerala.Nurses from Kerala are most sought around the country and the world. Around 20,000 nurses of them work abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-kerala-nurses-inspired-by-nipah-warrior-lini/story-mlJYblMpN735JHqdvKwI0I.html
05-04-2020||India||Cases doubling in 4.1 days, up since Jamaat event: Govt||The government on Sunday said that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) doubling rate in India is currently at 4.1 days and attributed the rapid increase to Tablighi Jamaat congregation that took place in Delhi between March 10 and 15.Addressing a media briefing on Sunday, Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said, “If it were not for the congregation, India’s rate of doubling would have been at 7.4 days.India has reported a total of 3,374 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases till Sunday, and 77 deaths across 274 districts.All states have been asked to put in place a district-specific containment strategy based on the detailed large outbreak containment plan issued by the health ministry on Saturday.“Surveillance and contact tracing has been our main focus, and we will continue to put emphasis on that,” said Agarwal. The health secretaries and chief secretaries of all states and Union territories have been directed by the centre to make frontline healthcare workers aware of the government-sponsored health insurance scheme that has been announced for them.The centre has also relaxed lockdown norms for people in the agriculture sector, tea industry etc. so that crop harvesting and sowing is smooth.“As per the guidelines states will be asked to start these rapid tests. The objective behind introducing the rapid testing mechanism was more effective monitoring, keeping in mind areas from where a large number of cases are being reported, areas where mass gatherings have been held and also at the evacuee centres that require mass samples to be tested in a short span of time. Also, to monitor influenza like illness cases,” said Agarwal.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Saturday had issued detailed guidelines on rapid testing (blood test), and where all it can be deployed.The rapid testing kits are expected by Wednesday, and that’s when these will be deployed in the field.For migrant workers quarantined across India, a total of about 28,000 relief camps have been set up.“Of all the camps providing relief and shelter, 23,924 camps have been set by the government and 3,737 are being run by the NGOs. Food camps are 19,460, of which 9,951 are government-run, and 9,509 are run by NGOs. About 12.5 lakh people are housed in these shelter camps across the country, and at least 75 lakh people have been provided with food. As per our information, 13.6 lakh people are being given shelter and food by their employers and industry,” said Punya Salila Srivastava, joint secretary, home ministry. “Smooth inter-state movement is being ensured for people involved dealing with the supply of all essential services and goods including drugs, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, their raw material and packaging material. In some pockets, there was an issue but states have been directed to look into it. The Railways have run close to 2.5 lakh coal wagons for transportation of supplies,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-doubling-in-4-1-days-up-since-jamaat-event-govt/story-uobYz3j8kViaPNh2i6D8TK.html

05-04-2020||India||School closures may raise obesity among kids: Experts||New Delhi: School closures due to the Covid-19 outbreak could exacerbate childhood obesity, according to epidemiologists from the New York Academy of Medicine and others published in Obesity journal. Increase in obesity among schoolchildren during the summer recess has already been documented by US public health experts. Surplus weight usually accrues every summer and obesity experienced at as young as five years of age has been shown to be associated with a higher BMI (body mass index) at an older age, even up to 50 years.More than 30 million children receive subsidised school lunches and food insecurity rates are higher for such families during summer months when there is a break in schooling. Only three days of school closures could result in 405,000 missed meals among schoolchildren in the US, according to the authors of the study cited above. Along with the impact of calorie-dense foods that can be stocked up during lockdowns, children in urban areas don’t have much physical activity due to a social distancing intervention. The authors cite data to show that online video game usage is already soaring.In India, 115.9 million children are enrolled in the midday meal scheme. But due to the lockdown and disruptions associated with the Covid-19 outbreak, many states are not able to give children these meals. The human resource development ministry on March 20 asked state governments to provide either hot cooked midday meals or a food security allowance for the children’s families to buy food.“As the country is passing through the difficult times of the Novel Covid-19 (Corona) outbreak The State Governments and Union Territories are advised to provide hot cooked Mid Day Meal or Food Security Allowance, whichever is feasible, to all eligible children till such time their schools are closed due to Novel COVID-l9 (Corona) Virus. The modalities for this purpose may be decided by the respective States…the regular Mid Day Meal shall resume as soon as the schools reopen,” the letter to the states reads. Kerala was among the first to start delivering meals to schoolchildren at home. The state serves 2,584,156 children in 12,327 schools. The menu includes a banana, an egg and milk along with vegetables, pulses and rice.“It’s very difficult to say what health impact the children here are going to face because the school closure may not be long-term. More worrying is the long-term impact on the socioeconomic condition of the parents. The government should deliver midday meals to children wherever they are,” said Dr Anand Krishnan, professor, Centre for Community Medicine at All India Institute Of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/school-closures-may-raise-obesity-among-kids-experts/story-0WojeXk0uo9NONSNIyLlWI.html
05-04-2020||India||Spike in Covid cases in J&K due to intensified contact tracing, testing: GC Murmu||Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has seen a spike in coronavirus cases recently with 106 positive cases. Lieutenant Governor Girish Chandra Murmu, however, says this is because of an aggressive testing and tracing strategy. In an interview to Aurangzeb Naqshbandi, he outlined the steps taken by the government to contain the pandemic: Coronavirus cases in Jammu and Kashmir have risen in the past few days. Is contract tracing emerging as a big challenge for you, especially as many people have come from outside the country?Screening of all individuals coming from outside was initiated on March 4. Till now, nearly 33,503 travellers and persons in contact with the suspected and positive cases with travel history abroad have been put under surveillance. Out of these, 10,981 are in home quarantine, 100 in hospital isolation, 619 in hospital quarantine, 16,237 in home surveillance and 5566 with travel history abroad have completed their 28 days surveillance period. Till date, 1551 samples have been sent for testing of which 1429 tested negative, 106 positive with the number of deaths at 2.  The government has undertaken an aggressive contact tracing and testing campaign — that is why there is surge in the number of confirmed positive casesHave you sought the assistance of army and paramilitary forces in controlling the situation?No direct assistance of army and paramilitary forces has been currently sought to control the situation, though the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is deployed with the local police to assist in maintaining the restrictions during the lockdown. We have isolation and quarantine facilities in army hospitals across the UT. We have requested the army to provide additional isolation facilities of 500 beds each in J&K.You have also started declaring Red zones in some parts of the UT? How alarming is the situation in those areas?To take precautions and contain the spread of Covid-19, 38 villages across J&K have been declared as Red Zones, where complete restrictions have been enforced for movement of people. All essential commodities are being provided to the residents of these zones. The situation in these areas is not alarming but extra precaution is being taken. Around 900 people of the UT are suspected to have participated in the Tablighi Jamaat conference in New Delhi from March 14 to March 21. Of these, 550 have been identified and quarantined and the survey and verifications for the remaining is on. We have intensified contact tracing campaign of the people who had this congregation at Delhi and are conducting 100% testing of such people and their contacts.Videos are in circulation in social media showing police using force on residents, doctors, and even government officials to enforce a strict lockdown. Have you advised the police to refrain from such acts?J&K police is directly assisting the administration. People are exhibiting restraint and discipline during the current situation. Police is strictly controlling the situation as well as providing all necessary help and co-ordination, including distribution of ration to the needy.Given the pandemic, is there any plan to restore 4G internet services for better connectivity and information dissemination?Currently, 3G facility by certain identified telecom providers with adequate precautions is available. The administration ensured that people did not suffer due to the internet blockade by making available internet facilities in the office of district magistrates.There have also been demands to release prisoners on humanitarian grounds. Have you arrived at any decision in this regard?A committee has been constituted headed by chairman, state legal authority, to consider the release of prisoners on parole or interim bail depending upon the nature of the offence. Jammu and Kashmir Temporary Suspension of Sentence, Rules, 2020, have been notified, and the Director General of Police, Prisons, has been empowered to grant parole or furlough to specific category of prisoners on the recommendations of jail superintendents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spike-in-covid-cases-in-j-k-due-to-intensified-contact-tracing-testing-gc-murmu/story-eNND7K9i0PFYu0sIjzhogN.html
05-04-2020||India||Gearing up for upcoming financial challenges: Dushyant Chautala||Chandigarh: Haryana’s deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who holds several key portfolios including excise and taxation, food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, revenue, and labour, spoke to Hitender Rao about the Covid-19 impact on farmers and the state economy, the health care preparedness, and migration, among other issues. Edited excerpts:What impact will the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak have on Haryana?The biggest concern at the moment is to save lives. Our effort is on containing the spread of virus and the only way is lockdown and social distancing. Haryana has done well so far.What will the impact of the lockdown be on Haryana’s economy? As the excise and taxation minister, how do you plan to make up for the revenue loss?The impact on the economy is nationwide. In fact, it is global. We are gearing up for the upcoming financial challenges. Our economic parameters have been decent. I am quite confident that the hard working people of the state will overpower this adverse phase and we will be a vibrant economy.Which sector of the economy will be affected the most ?Whichever sector gets hit, it will be the duty of the state government to revive it.What is your estimate about the quantum of revenue loss, if the lockdown is eased or lifted on April 15?The new financial year started from April 1 and the lockdown will end on April 14. Hopefully normalcy will be restored within 15 days after the lockdown ends. Revenue collections for April should be viewed along with the savings the state has done during the lockdown period.How well is the state geared in terms of medical infrastructure and manpower if there is a sudden spurt?We’ve already asked for more ventilators and made provisions for dedicated Covid-19 hospitals across the state. We’re geared up in terms of safety equipment for health staff and medics. The state government is also providing support to Delhi, Chandigarh and other states in terms of medical safety equipment.How do you plan to tackle the food grain procurement, which is already deferred due to the lockdown? Are non-availability of labour and the rush of farmers carrying grains in grain markets a concern?The state government has deferred the procurement dates for mustard (April 15) and wheat (April 20). We are now working towards staggering the purchase process because wheat comes in large quantity in less number of days.While we are requesting migrant labourers to stay back, we have also asked the central government to include manual farm work like harvesting as a permissible activity under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS). The scheme provides at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every rural household. If we get the Centre’s approval in the next 5-10 days, it will be a boost to economy including the agriculture sector.The migration of farm labourers involved in harvesting crops in Haryana is a worry. How will the state address this challenge?We have faced worse times. We faced the plague; we’ve been through the Kargil war. I think each one of us become a farmer during such crisis. We have been getting reports through deputy commissioners that farmers are going to fields and started harvesting on their own sensing non-availability of labour.The state is seeking financial support from the Centre for incentivising farmers who opt for staggered procurement. What is the status?We have sent a proposal to the central government to provide bonus to farmers as we are encouraging them to bring their harvest to mandis in phases. The state government has proposed a bonus of up to Rs 125 per quintal to encourage staggered procurement. We are waiting for a go-ahead from the Centre. However, if the Centre does not accede to our request, the state government will find a solution.What is you take on the large number of people identified and quarantined in Haryana after attending the Tablighi Jaamat gathering in Delhi?We’ve traced all those who attended it. More than 1,300 people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat from Haryana have been quarantined. Some who didn’t return to Haryana after attending the event are being tracked by the police. We are also coordinating with neighbouring states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gearing-up-for-upcoming-financial-challenges-dushyant-chautala/story-SdS6yHTvxiAceueoZr099H.html
05-04-2020||India||US and UK set to evacuate their nationals from India||London/New Delhi: The UK and the US are set to join a list of countries that have been evacuating their stranded nationals from India, with the Boris Johnson government on Sunday announcing the first wave of seven charter flights for some 20,000 Britons in different states.The UK government has said it will provide £75 million for special charter flights, where commercial routes do not exist, to bring home thousands of Britons stranded in various countries. The flights from India will depart from Goa on April 8, 10 and 12, from Mumbai on April 9 and 11, and from New Delhi on April 9 and 11.The flights cost each adult £681 from Goa, £600 from Mumbai and £581 from Delhi, and infants under the age of two will travel free.The UK’s acting high commissioner to India, Jan Thompson, said: “We know how worrying the past few weeks have been for British nationals in India. I hope this announcement will bring relief, especially to those in greatest need.“Due to the large numbers of British travellers involved, the scale of this operation is huge. The UK government continues to work hard with our Indian counterparts in New Delhi and London to arrange a safe journey back for as many people as possible.”Officials said the charter flights are for British travellers who normally reside in the UK and their direct dependants. A number of seats will be reserved for those deemed vulnerable. On Saturday, 113 of the most vulnerable British nationals left Goa on an Irish flight.An estimated 35,000 British nationals are currently in India but only some 20,000 have expressed a desire to return.The US, which flew out some 200 citizens from India on March 31, is set to operate a steady flow of flights from Delhi and Mumbai this week. People familiar with developments said several thousand Americans, most of them stranded tourists and travellers, will be evacuated by these flights.The US embassy announced on Sunday there will be flights from New Delhi to San Francisco (April 6, 7 and 8) and from Mumbai to Atlanta (April 7 and 10).“We do not know for how long US government-organised flights returning to the United States will continue after this week. We urge US citizens who want to return to the United States to take advantage of the current opportunities,” the embassy said in an alert posted on its website.The embassy said it will also facilitate transportation to Delhi from some cities in northern and eastern India, including flights from Dehradun, Amritsar and Chandigarh, and bus services from Ludhiana and Dharamsala. It will also arrange flights from Chennai and Hyderabad to Mumbai.A total of 22 countries evacuated almost 14,000 people from India till late last week, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Germany has flown out some 3,000 citizens in about 10 flights from different Indian cities, Japan about 2,300 in some 10 flights, Malaysia about 2,100 citizens in 13 flights, Israel about 1,600 citizens in eight flights, and Russia almost 1,100 citizens in four flights.France, which has so far evacuated 400 nationals in one flights, has plans to evacuate almost 1,600 more stranded tourists and travellers.Special arrangements have also been made by the countries to arrange “movement permits” in view of domestic travel restrictions currently in force across India. These permits call on Indian authorities to allow passage, without delay or detention, to the foreign nationals.The people cited above said there are currently no plans to arrange flights to bring back Indians stranded abroad. The government recently advised stranded Indians to “stay put” and Indian missions have been tasked to help them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-and-uk-set-to-evacuate-their-nationals-from-india/story-OeEtMnTuxWCvXb2XgtDhvL.html

The police facilitated the operation to ensure that lockdown norms are not violated by those in need of food.Kathua’s Senior Superintendent of Police, Shailendra Kumar Mishra said, “They are a team of 300 volunteers, who came under the banner ‘United Kathua JKP’. They operate through a helpline number 9540501414 for which a central control room has been set up at my office in Kathua.”Navdeep Kumar, one of the volunteers, said, “We get calls from the people in distress on our helpline number. Subsequently, we enter such calls in our database and then trace its location before sending one of our volunteers on a bike with the relief material”.People need medicines, ration and then there are migrant labourers, who need cooked meals, he said. “In case of medicines, we take the actual amount from those who can pay but we don’t take any money from those who can’t afford,” he said.United Kathua volunteers work from 10 am to 8 pm every day and they reach out to the people in distress delivering them medicines and essential supplies at their doorsteps.“The delivery is free of cost. They also feed around 7000 daily wage earners, mainly migrant labourers living in slums throughout the district with cooked meals twice a day for which nine community kitchens have been set up. Of course, hygiene and social distancing are indispensable,” Mishra said.The United Kathua is self-financed and works without any government funding.All volunteers are locals, who have bikes and wear white T-shirts, printed with “United Kathua JKP” logo to be easily identified by the people and security personnel for hassle free working.“The bikers pay for their own fuel. They received and resolved over 700 calls in the first four days of the initiative. They are being guided and controlled by Kathua Police and the district administration,” said Mishra.The SSP informed that amid total lockdown the volunteers have been successful in feeding hungry migrant labourers in Kathua district.They also ensure medicines at the doorsteps of the people, especially the ones, which are not available in the local market.“Medicines are provided free of cost to those who cannot afford. Medicines unavailable locally are procured from Punjab with the help of truckers entering Jammu and Kashmir with essential supplies,” said Mishra.Since this initiative was launched, United Kathua got around Rs 4.50 lakh in donations, out of which Rs 3 lakh has been spent so far in providing meals and medicines to the needy, he added.Drones were also being used by the police to make announcements and to locate migrant labourers.Kathua, an industrial district, roughly has more than 12,000 labourers. While 5,000 who are industry pay rolls are being taken care of by their employers, 7,0000 were left to fend for themselves amid the sudden lockdown.Another volunteer, Sardar Gaganpreet Singh, said, “We have roped in 15 load carriers that we use to take cooked meals to migrant labourers across the district. These meals that are being provided at 11 am and 6 pm every day are cooked at nine different community kitchens”.Anis-ul-Rehman, another volunteer said, “Serving these migrant labourers and their children with food and milk gives them a sense of satisfaction. After all humanity teaches us love and compassion.”Dev Mati, a migrant woman, in one of the slums, said, “We had nothing to eat and we would have died of starvation but God sent these men with food and milk”.Nandini, another migrant labourer, said that she neither had money nor ration in her shanty for two days and then these young men arrived with food at their cluster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-j-k-s-kathua-district-locals-turn-angels-for-7-000-hungry-labourers/story-xl16e3LSnhfG0sBBfZwOVI.html

The correct position is spelt out in my tweet of 2nd April 2020,” Puri tweeted.On April 2, Puri had tweeted that a decision to restart flights after this period (lockdown) remains to be taken. “If required, we will have to assess the situation on a case-by-case basis,” he had said.On Friday, India’s national carrier Air India stopped advance bookings for all flights till April 30.Currently only cargo flights carrying essential supplies are being operated on priority to the northeastern region and other remote places including Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.On March 22, India announced suspending international flights for a week. It was later extended until April 15 coinciding with the lockdown to break the chain of transmission of coronavirus that ha snow infected almost 4,000 people in the country. Earlier that month, India had suspended most visas for foreigners and stopped flights to a clutch of countries.Domestic flights stopped as the lockdown came into force but even before that many airlines had cancelled flights or stopped services due to low traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speculation-says-aviation-minister-on-report-of-resumption-of-flights-after-lockdown/story-XwjjkWb5IUIw6SkRto1MLO.html

Street lights too were turned off and small specks of light started appearing from every house in almost all localities. Much before the designated time of 9 pm, people switched off lights at their residences and began lighting lamps, earthen diyas and candles.Fireworks, a few claps, crackers and whistles were also heard.In South Delhi, at some places, devotional songs, mantras, shlokas and the national anthem were also played on mobile phones from terraces.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a video message on Friday, had asked the people of the country to use the light of lamps or candles to “challenge the darkness of coronavirus”. He had urged people to switch off the lights in their homes and light lamps, candles or mobile phone torches for nine minutes at 9 pm on April 5, to display the country’s “collective resolve” to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic.The exercise was a ‘voluntary’ one with no pressure on people to follow the call given by the PM, but it evoked overwhelming response from people in the national capital.In a video message of over 11 minutes on Friday, the PM had also asked people to maintain the “lakshman rekha” of social distancing by staying indoors and not gathering together in groups during the exercise of showing solidarity.Coronavirus cases in Delhi on Sunday climbed to 503 with 58 fresh cases, according to Delhi government officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-delhi-answered-pm-modi-s-call-to-fight-coronavirus-darkness/story-HuoM4gSb9sqrybQg4cADoM.html

It becomes somewhat difficult but I manage as the cause is to serve humanity at this crucial time,” said Kiran whose husband serves his lockdown duty for almost 10 hours daily.She says that the raw material for the masks including the cloth and elastic bands are provided by the district police department’s women welfare centre.“We bring the raw material home and then make the masks as per the specifications of the WHO” said Kiran, adding “I make around 15 masks every day in two hours.”“I feel very grateful to God that both my husband and I could contribute in this fight, though it’s a very small contribution,” she said.Sharing a similar story, 26-year-old Sunita Devi, wife of a constable in Champawat district said, “While my husband is serving the nation from morning 7 to evening 7, I am making sure that I do my part in this fight by making masks.”Mother of a 2-year-old boy, Sunita says it sometimes becomes difficult to manage with a small child at home all alone.Unlike Sunita and Kiran, 35-year-old Upasna Rana is both a policewoman and a housewife, and despite that she takes out time for making the face masks.“My husband and I are both police constables in Champawat. While I serve my duty in the morning from 6 to 1 pm, my husband serves his night shift duty in the local area. I also have to take care of my children and household chores but I spare time to make the masks,” said Upasna, mother to two children aged 8 and 1.Director general (law & order) Uttarakhand Police Ashok Kumar said the efforts put in by the housewives of the policemen was really commendable.”“We can only win this pandemic if we fight it together while sharing responsibilities” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cops-fight-coronavirus-on-streets-wives-at-home-making-masks/story-c92gK8r07VGlgJGUuXBrCO.html

Police in the national capital had registered the first case against the Tablighi workers (FIR number 63) and its leadership for multiple offences.Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla had this week ordered other states to start filing criminal cases against the foreign Tablighi workers as well. A Home Ministry official said they had started receiving confirmation from states that police stations across the country had started registering cases under the penal provisions against these workers..Faced with the legal proceedings against them, the foreign nationals attempted to escape India in special flights for evacuating Malyasian and Indonesian nationals.But they were stopped from boarding the evacuation flights at Delhi and Chennai airports under instructions from the home ministry. Among those stopped was a group of 8 Malaysians who had boarded the flight to Kuala Lumpur but were stopped by immigration officials minutes before take off.The religious congregation at Tablighi Jamaat’s Nizamuddin headquarters has been linked to a third of coronavirus infections in India. In the national capital, according to a Delhi government document seen by HT, 320 out of the city’s total of 503 cases are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat.The number of Covid-19 infection cases are expected to go up as foreigners later picked up from various mosques in Delhi and other parts of the country are being tested for the virus.Also Read: Markaz leadership resisted, then NSA Ajit Doval dropped by at 2 amOfficials recall how the Tablighi Jamaat leadership resisted efforts to get them to vacate the premises when health authorities sounded an alarm at scores of people showing symptoms of the disease. On March 28, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval had to test his relationship with Darul-Uloom, Jamiat-e-Ulema Hind and Al-Hadees leadership to convince Markaz emir to ask his supporters to vacate the Banglewali Masjid.It was only then that the Jamaat workers came out and boarded the buses lined up for them. By then, 24 of them had already tested positive and 200 showed symptoms of having contracted the infection.The discovery of the hot spot had triggered alarm in several circles of the government and triggered a nation-wide search for foreigners and Indians alike who had been to the Markaz, or come in contact with someone who did.The Home Ministry said 21,200 Tablighi Jamaat workers and their contacts had been placed under quarantine. At his daily briefing on Sunday, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal underlined how the Jamaat-linked cases across 17 states had fuelled the spike in Covid-19 cases in India.India’s Covid-19 cases have doubled in 4.1 days due to the Tablighi Jamaat cases, he said.“If it were not for the congregation, India’s rate of doubling— that is the number of days the cases double — would have been at 7.4 days,” Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-tablighi-workers-stopped-from-leaving-at-airports-cops-say-action-begins/story-FP3rAEDNs2ZrxG4NbFcyNO.html

05-04-2020||India||Covid-19: India unable to take full advantage of drop in oil prices||India, the world’s third-biggest oil consumer, is unable to take full advantage of a slump in global crude prices because of a steep drop in the sale of petrol and diesel in the aftermath of the nationwide lockdown for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) that has squeezed dealers’ margins and put at risk the jobs of some of the 500,000 people employed at fuel stations.Sales of automobile fuels have slumped by around 80% in the cities and 60% in rural areas since March 25, when the lockdown went underway, taking public transport and private vehicles off the roads, according to dealers HT spoke to. “The spread of the coronavirus and the lockdown have affected everyone. If demand does not pick up this month, we would face difficulties in paying salaries to staff,” a Noida-based dealer said, requesting anonymity. A Mumbai-based dealer said he had been forced to shut his petrol pump in the heart of the city for the time being because of both lack of demand and absence of staff to serve any customers who turn up amid the lockdown.“My other retail outlet at Ulhasnagar [on the outskirts of Mumbai] is open, but sales are a minuscule 500 litres a day compared to from 450 KL [kilolitres] earlier,” the dealer said requesting anonymity. 1 KL is equal to 1,000 litres.“I have taken Rs 50 lakh credit from bank. I have fuels in tanks worth Rs 50 lakh. Unless I can sell fuels, I would not be able to service my debt,” he said.Crude oil prices have gone down because of deepening concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic and an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. After US President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that he had brokered a deal that would see the two countries cut output by 10 million barrels per day, or about 10% of global supplies, Brent crude, a benchmark in oil pricing, soared 47% on Thursday. In early trading on Friday, it was trading at $33. 6 per barrel, a 12.3% gain over the previous day, but still half its level at the start of 2020.The steep drop in oil prices meant a windfall for India given that it is dependent on imports to meet around 80% of demand, but the sharp drop in sales of auto fuels has offset the gains to some extent. An Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) spokesperson estimated the overall drop in fuel sales at 65-67% since the lockdown began.At stake in the battle to overcome the coronavirus disease and get India back to normalcy are the jobs of 500,000 people employed at fuel pumps as attendants, salespeople and so on. There are over 62,000 retail outlets with about 500,000 employees. Each outlet has eight staffers on an average. “In certain parts of the country sales have dropped by over 95%. Some dealers have stocks of 100,000 litres, but sales are less than 1,000 litres [per week]. We will assess the situation after the 21-day lockdown is over and take a decision. Currently, on humanitarian grounds, dealers are paying salaries to their employees,” said Ajay Bansal, president of the All India Petroleum Dealers Association (AIPDA).Cities away from metros are marginally better placed. A Meerut-based dealer said on condition of anonymity that sales at his pump had gone down by 60% since the lockdown began from 60 KL, but liquidity was a major issue because most sales are on credit and customers, mainly transporters, are not in a position to pay on time, “Most of the pump owners will not be able to service debts, hence banks should extend the duration of credit period to 90 days,” said Hemant Sirohi, a member of the Empowering Petroleum Dealers Foundation (EPDF). Petroleum dealers receive 15 days’ credit under an Electronic Dealer Finance System eDFS, an application that aims to automate the loan disbursal and interest recovery process and provides a repayment model through internet banking. The Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers Association has sought relief from state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) – Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation ltd (HPCL). In a letter to senior executives of oil companies, the association asked OMCs to advise banks to waive interest for the 21-day lockdown period.Email queries sent to IOC, BPCL, HPCL and the oil ministry on the subject did not elicit any responses.Consumption of fuel is an indicator of economic activity, and with the nationwide lockdown, demand for fuels has dropped, Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) secretary general Deepak Sood said. “The benefit of reduced fuel prices can’t be garnered in such a scenario by the industry or consumers,” he said“As part of its economic measures, the government should look at supporting retail pumps catering to cities and rural areas, ensuring employment and working capital requirements are met during these troubled times,” he said.Deepak Mahurkar, partner and leader of the oil and gas practice at PwC India, said global oil demand had become subdued about one-and-a-half months ago because of the impact of the coronavirus and the ripples have now reached India. “Demand will start picking up after the lockdown is removed, but it will be slow as consumers will be cautious,” he said.Mahurkar said global oil prices will have to eventually bounce back to the level of $60 a barrel because current levels are not sustainable. He described the volatility in international oil market on Thursday and Friday as an attempt by oil producers to boost oil prices. “Even the US would like prices to go up to help its oil and gas sector,” he said.

The flights from India will depart from Goa on April 8, 10 and 12, from Mumbai on April 9 and 11, and from New Delhi on April 9 and 11.The flights cost each adult £681 from Goa, £600 from Mumbai and £581 from Delhi, and infants under the age of two will travel free.The UK’s acting high commissioner to India, Jan Thompson, said: “We know how worrying the past few weeks have been for British nationals in India. I hope this announcement will bring relief, especially to those in greatest need.“Due to the large numbers of British travellers involved, the scale of this operation is huge. The UK government continues to work hard with our Indian counterparts in New Delhi and London to arrange a safe journey back for as many people as possible.”Officials said the charter flights are for British travellers who normally reside in the UK and their direct dependants. A number of seats will be reserved for those deemed vulnerable. On Saturday, 113 of the most vulnerable British nationals left Goa on an Irish flight.An estimated 35,000 British nationals are currently in India but only some 20,000 have expressed a desire to return.The US, which flew out some 200 citizens from India on March 31, is set to operate a steady flow of flights from Delhi and Mumbai this week. People familiar with developments said several thousand Americans, most of them stranded tourists and travellers, will be evacuated by these flights.The US embassy announced on Sunday there will be flights from New Delhi to San Francisco (April 6, 7 and 8) and from Mumbai to Atlanta (April 7 and 10).“We do not know for how long US government-organised flights returning to the United States will continue after this week. We urge US citizens who want to return to the United States to take advantage of the current opportunities,” the embassy said in an alert posted on its website.The embassy said it will also facilitate transportation to Delhi from some cities in northern and eastern India, including flights from Dehradun, Amritsar and Chandigarh, and bus services from Ludhiana and Dharamsala. It will also arrange flights from Chennai and Hyderabad to Mumbai.A total of 22 countries evacuated almost 14,000 people from India till late last week, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Germany has flown out some 3,000 citizens in about 10 flights from different Indian cities, Japan about 2,300 in some 10 flights, Malaysia about 2,100 citizens in 13 flights, Israel about 1,600 citizens in eight flights, and Russia almost 1,100 citizens in four flights.France, which has so far evacuated 400 nationals in one flights, has plans to evacuate almost 1,600 more stranded tourists and travellers.Special arrangements have also been made by the countries to arrange “movement permits” in view of domestic travel restrictions currently in force across India. These permits call on Indian authorities to allow passage, without delay or detention, to the foreign nationals.The people cited above said there are currently no plans to arrange flights to bring back Indians stranded abroad. The government recently advised stranded Indians to “stay put” and Indian missions have been tasked to help them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-outbreak-us-uk-set-to-evacuate-their-nationals-from-india/story-n4bFJfR6TJWgEoxZw25WkM.html

People familiar with developments said several thousand Americans, most of them stranded tourists and travellers, will be evacuated by these flights.The US embassy announced on Sunday there will be flights from New Delhi to San Francisco (April 6, 7 and 8) and from Mumbai to Atlanta (April 7 and 10).“We do not know for how long US government-organised flights returning to the United States will continue after this week. We urge US citizens who want to return to the United States to take advantage of the current opportunities,” the embassy said in an alert posted on its website.The embassy said it will also facilitate transportation to Delhi from some cities in northern and eastern India, including flights from Dehradun, Amritsar and Chandigarh, and bus services from Ludhiana and Dharamshala. It will also arrange flights from Chennai and Hyderabad to Mumbai.A total of 22 countries evacuated almost 14,000 people from India till late last week, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Germany has flown out some 3,000 citizens in about 10 flights from different Indian cities, Japan about 2,300 in some 10 flights, Malaysia about 2,100 citizens in 13 flights, Israel about 1,600 citizens in eight flights, and Russia almost 1,100 citizens in four flights.France, which has so far evacuated 400 nationals in one flights, has plans to evacuate almost 1,600 more stranded tourists and travellers.Special arrangements have also been made by the countries to arrange “movement permits” in view of domestic travel restrictions currently in force across India. These permits call on Indian authorities to allow passage, without delay or detention, to the foreign nationals.The people cited above said there are currently no plans to arrange flights to bring back Indians stranded abroad. The government recently advised stranded Indians to “stay put” and Indian missions have been tasked to help them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-uk-to-begin-evacuating-stranded-nationals-from-india/story-XmSDldfAKH7hZl7QjQHrDP.html

The initiative in this regard was taken by some youths led by village panchayat member Arun Kashyap who underlined the need for villagers to isolate themselves and ban the movement of people to and from the village.Follow coronavirus live updates here.“Only in case of emergency service, we allow movement otherwise neither local residents nor outsiders villagers are allowed exit and entry respectively during easing of lockdown restriction from 7 am to 1 pm. Nearby residents also keep tab on villagers movement beyond this time till night. We need to set an example and adhere to the lockdown as per government and administrative guidelines. With masks, soap and sanitizers put up at various points we are also generating awareness among villagers,” said Arun Kashyap, village panchayat member.Village head Maya Ram Kashyap and deputy head Avdesh Chauhan lauding the youth’s initiative pointed that about 1700 odd villagers are duly adhering this self-imposed restriction during non-restrictive hours too barring any emergency or very important work.Uttarakhand reported 26 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday.In Roorkee too, villagers of Matlabpur have conveyed to nearby villages that no person from their area will be allowed to enter till April 14. All the routes and entry points to Matlabpur village have been closed after the consent of the hundred-odd villagers.Nine other villages that fall in the Pathri area of Haridwar district have also sealed themselves.“Taking into consideration the rise in the number of positive cases which are primarily due to people coming from other states or countries, we decided to seal our villages to keep Covid-19 out of our areas. Even if vegetable vendors arrive we stop them outside the village and procure vegetables keeping social distance and washing hands of both the vendor and the buyers,” said Tikaula village chief Naveen Chauhan.In bordering villages with Uttar Pradesh, though state police and Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) personnel have been deployed as the state border has been sealed till April 14, some villages on Uttarakhand side are also keeping a tab on any human movement from Bijnore district side.The village head of Bishanpur Kund Savita Devi said that villagers are also keeping vigil at Ganga riverside area as outsiders can enter by crossing the river to escape from the border police post checking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-villagers-seal-their-villages-to-check-spread-of-covid-19/story-HMXmbpB8H4BiiVZzABsUyI.html

Increase in obesity among schoolchildren during the summer recess has already been documented by US public health experts. Surplus weight usually accrues every summer and obesity experienced at as young as five years of age has been shown to be associated with a higher BMI (body mass index) at an older age, even up to 50 years.More than 30 million children receive subsidised school lunches and food insecurity rates are higher for such families during summer months when there is a break in schooling. Only three days of school closures could result in 405,000 missed meals among schoolchildren in the US, according to the authors of the study cited above. Along with the impact of calorie-dense foods that can be stocked up during lockdowns, children in urban areas don’t have much physical activity due to a social distancing intervention. The authors cite data to show that online video game usage is already soaring.In India, 115.9 million children are enrolled in the midday meal scheme. But due to the lockdown and disruptions associated with the Covid-19 outbreak, many states are not able to give children these meals. The human resource development ministry on March 20 asked state governments to provide either hot cooked midday meals or a food security allowance for the children’s families to buy food.“As the country is passing through the difficult times of the Novel Covid-19 (Corona) outbreak The State Governments and Union Territories are advised to provide hot cooked Mid Day Meal or Food Security Allowance, whichever is feasible, to all eligible children till such time their schools are closed due to Novel COVID-l9 (Corona) Virus. The modalities for this purpose may be decided by the respective States…the regular Mid Day Meal shall resume as soon as the schools reopen,” the letter to the states reads. Kerala was among the first to start delivering meals to schoolchildren at home. The state serves 2,584,156 children in 12,327 schools. The menu includes a banana, an egg and milk along with vegetables, pulses and rice.“It’s very difficult to say what health impact the children here are going to face because the school closure may not be long-term. More worrying is the long-term impact on the socioeconomic condition of the parents. The government should deliver midday meals to children wherever they are,” said Dr Anand Krishnan, professor, Centre for Community Medicine at All India Institute Of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-could-exacerbate-childhood-obesity-epidemiologists/story-HymeYxxRMGqBZsvRIIuXFI.html

The first was a 29-year-old man from Bomikhal area of Bhubaneswar, where three brothers living in an apartment tested positive on Friday. The person who tested positive on Sunday is another brother. A 70-year-old man in the city who had returned to Bhubaneswar on March 22 from Australia also tested positive.Earlier in the day, Odisha chief secretary Asit Tripathy made it clear that community transmission of the disease is yet to happen in Odisha due to the lockdown and social distancing measures undertaken. “As the travel history of the fifth Covid-19 positive patient, a 60-year-old man with co-morbidity conditions was not found initially, we were scared of seeing more positive cases due to community spread. But, we contained it by sealing the area and enforcing a shutdown in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Jajpur. We have actively contained the Covid-19 hotspots during the 48-hour shutdown and hope to continue the same in the near future. The local administration has been empowered to implement the closure of possible infection hotspots for containment of the deadly virus,” he said.Though the 60-year-old man from Bhubaneswar had no travel history, yesterday it emerged that his daughter had travelled to Kolkata and stayed there for four days. On Friday, 4 members of the man’s family and 3 members of his tenant’s family tested positive.The chief secretary said the 48-hour shutdown in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Jajpur would come to an end on 8 pm Sunday, but advised people against going out en masse afterwards.“Even after shutdown, people are requested to abide by the lockdown rules and avoid gatherings. Social distancing is the only weapon for containment to fight the deadly virus. You might be out to buy vegetables or grocery but will be coming back with the disease,” said Tripathy.He further warned that the state would seal small areas if any positive cases were found anywhere in the state.Meanwhile, a team of police in Cuttack was pelted with stones while they were undertaking regular patrolling during the 48-hour shutdown in place this morning. The attack occurred in Kesharpur area. As many as 15 people were arrested over their involvement in the incident.Meanwhile, 400 women self-help groups in Odisha have manufactured over one million masks for distribution among people. The SHGs - under the Odisha government’s Mission Shakti programme - made around 50,000 masks every day, as part of its efforts to help the state government in its fight against the coronavirus.Some of the SHG groups have been visiting villages across the state to generate awareness about the disease and are distributing cooked food among the poor, amid the 21-day nationwide lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-odisha-denies-any-community-transmission-as-state-count-climbs-to-23/story-QL4G1XbKKVwebkAILNOC2J.html

05-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: Govt’s 11-point FAQs on PM Modi’s call to switch off lights for 9 mins at 9 pm||The Union power ministry on Sunday came out with a list of 11 questions around the lights off event later in the evening at the call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the FAQs, the government underlined that there are no plans to carry out load shedding for the 9 pm lights out event and stressed that people should only switch off their domestic lights. PM Modi had appealed to people to switch off their lights in their homes and instead, light oil lamps, candles, and flash their mobile phone torches on at 9pm, for nine minutes.This, PM Modi underlined, will symbolise the collective power of people and showcase their determination in taking the country from darkness to illumination in the fight against Covid-19, or coronavirus.Power Ministry’s FAQs about lights off event at 9 pm and grid stabilityQuestion 1: Are only domestic lights to be switched off or are street lights, common area lighting, essential services etc lights also to be switched off between 9 and 9:09 pm?Answer: Only domestic home lights in the houses have to be put off voluntarily as appealed by our Hon’ble PM. It is again reiterated that no street lights, common area places, hospitals and other essential services have to switch off their lights.Question 2: Are my domestic appliances going to be safe?Answer: All your domestic appliances will be safe. There is no need to switch off Fans, ACs, Fridges etc. Indian Electricity Grid is well designed to handle such kind of load variation and has several in- built levels of control and safety mechanisms to absorb any kind of frequency changes occurring due to such load variation. Thus, all the domestic appliances will be totally safe and hence should be kept in normal functioning mode as per the requirements.Question 3 : Whether adequate arrangements and protocols are in place to handle grid stability?Answer : Yes, all adequate arrangements and standard operating protocols are in place to maintain grid stability.Question 4: Is it compulsory or voluntary to switch off lights?Answer : Voluntary. As already said only domestic home lights have to be put off .Question 5: Some apprehensions have been expressed that this may cause instability in the grid and fluctuation in voltage which may harm the electrical appliances. Answer : These apprehensions are totally misplaced. These are normal phenomena and the Indian Electricity Grid is well designed to handle such load variation and frequency changes as per standard operating protocols.Question 6 : Whether our grid management and technology deployed will withstand the fluctuation that light out may cause?Answer : Indian electricity grid is robust and stable and employs state-of-the -art technology. It has in place necessary control and protective elements capable of handling such kinds of fluctuations in demand at any instant of time.Question 7 : Whether appliances like fans, refrigerators, AC, etc should be switched off or kept in the on mode?Answer : All your domestic appliances would be safe. These appliances should be operated normally as per requirements by the consumers. No need at all to especially switch off at 9 pm.Question 8 : Whether street lights will go off?Answer : No. In fact, all States/UTs/ Local bodies have been advised to keep the street lights on for public safety.Question 9: Whether hospitals or other emergency and important installations will face light out?Answer : No, the lights in Hospitals and all other essential services like Public Utilities, Municipal Services, Offices, Police Stations, Manufacturing Facilities, etc will remain on. The call given by Hon’ble PM is to just switch off lights in residences.Question 10: Would a sudden switching off of 20% load not destabilise the grid? What measures will the Mmnistry take?Answer : Domestic lighting load is much less than 20 per cent. Such kind of reduction in demand can be easily managed for which standard technical operating protocols are in place.Question 11: Will there be load shedding? If yes, what will be the impact ?Answer : No load shedding is planned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-govt-s-11-point-faqs-on-pm-modi-s-call-to-switch-off-lights-for-9-mins-at-9-pm/story-6OjCWdZJbrvHefEsJvUmZL.html

The arrests were made in the last 24 hours after Afghan forces caught Aslam Farooqui, the Pakistani national who led the terror group ISKP known to have strong links with Pakistan’s ISI that carries out off-the-shelf jihad at its instance.Among the 37 who have been arrested are 14 women and children. A majority of them are Pakistani nationals.Aslam Farooqui and the members of his module are being interrogated in the presence of US security agencies outside Kabul, people familiar with the developments in Delhi and Kabul told Hindustan Times.Afghanistan vice president Amrullah Saleh cheered the Afghan intelligence agency for the breakthrough.“I am sure he is already singing & will sing more to the dismay of his patrons in & out. A treasure of intelligence. Make him talk,” tweeted Saleh, who earlier headed the Afghan intel agency National Directorate of Security. The reference to Farooqui’s patrons is seen to be pointing to Pakistan’s intel agency ISI. Watch: Watch: Mastermind of Kabul Gurudwara attack, ISKP terrorist Farooqui, capturedThe Farooqui-led module had targeted Sikh worshippers at Gurdwara Har Rai in Shor Bazaar Kabul on March 25. The Taliban had rushed to deny its involvement in the gurdwara attack. The ISKP came forward to claim responsibility. But its assertion that the strike was revenge for Muslims in Kashmir was a dead giveaway for Pakistani deep state, people mentioned above said.ISKP chief Aslam Farooqui’s links with Pakistan’s ISI have been too well known. Farooqi, also known as Abdullah Orakzai, is a former commander of the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba with direct links to the ISI.Also Read: ISKP chief’s arrest for gurdwara attack brings out clear link to Pakistan’s ISI: OfficialHis 4,000-strong ISKP group operates with other groups like the Lashkar and Jaish-e-Mohammed. It largely comprises defectors from the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan and other Islamic terrorist outfits active in the Afghan-Pakistan area along the Durand Line including elements from the LeT, Jaish and Haqqani network.The LeT already has a presence in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces and is in expansion mode. It is trying to get a foothold in the adjoining Nuristan and Laghman provinces and is reported to have set up a training camp in Waygal area of Nuristan. Counter terror operatives in Delhi and Kabul suggest that the Lashkar was in the process of opening two new centres in Kunar province. Under directions from the ISI, the LeT has been involved in planning and conducting attacks on Indian interests, including Indian Embassy and consulates in Afghanistan in coordination with the Haqqani network, an Indian government official said.The Jaish-e-Mohammed, another anti-India proxy for the ISI, maintains close links with the Haqqani network and Al Qaeda.The Jaish has dedicated commanders for 12 provinces including Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktia, Arwan, Kundu, Ghazni, Nimroz, Helmand, Kandahar and Uruzgan provinces, an official said. JeM activities in Afghanistan are controlled by the outfit’s leaders based in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-backed-terror-module-in-afghanistan-that-targeted-india-busted-37-arrested/story-kjzMl28mqulIgeHa7gpmUP.html

ICMR has issued detailed guidelines for antibody testing, also referred to as rapid antibody-based tests, in the last two days while adopting a new strategy to deal with Covid-19 clusters (containment zone), in large migration gatherings and in centers were evacuees are kept in quarantine, where a large number of Covid-19 cases are arising.In another important announcement, ICMR said that the deadly Covid-19 virus doesn’t spread through the air as suggested recently by the experts in the United States.Dr R Gangakhedkar of ICMR said that while it was routine for different expert opinions to exist on matters such as this, there was not enough scientific evidence available to suggest Covid-19 was an airborne disease. “A balanced evidence-based approach must be taken. Had it been an air-borne infection then all the members of a family with a positive case amidst them should test positive as they all breathe the same air,” Gangakhedkar reasoned.He also cited the example of a hospital environment which could have lent itself to a more regular spread of the infection to all the patients present at the facility.Airborne diseases spread by viruses and bacteria are considered to be highly contagious and a high-level scientific panel in the United States had suggested that coronavirus could spread by just talking and breathing in contrast with earlier findings and analysis.The scientists said the virus could stay in the air in the form of an “ultrafine mist” that is produced when people exhale.“While the current specific research is limited, the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolisation of virus from normal breathing,” said a letter written by Dr Harvey Fineberg, chair of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s standing committee of experts.India has officially reported little under 4000 positive cases so far and the government says the dangerous phase of community transmissions has not been observed yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spitting-in-public-chewing-tobacco-could-spread-covid-19-govt-warns/story-MA3z2ztbol7tyyD1TDkAWM.html
05-04-2020||India||Covid-19 cases doubling in 4.1 days, Jamaat incident worsened coronavirus spread: Govt||India’s doubling rate of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) stands at 4.1 days, Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary of the Union health ministry, said on Sunday, explaining in how many days the number of infections gets doubled in the country. If the cases reported due to a religious gathering in New Delhi in March had not taken place, the doubling rate would have been at 7.4 days, he said, referring to the congregation of the members of the Islamic missionary group Tablighi Jamaat in the national capital.The headquarters of the Jamaat, or the Markaz, in Nizamuddin area, where the gathering took place last month, has emerged as a hot spot of Covid-19 infections in India. About one-third of the total cases in the country have been linked to the gathering. Authorities across states have launched a complex exercise to trace those who visited the Markaz and then fanned out across the country.Also read: 8 Malaysians linked to Tablighi Jamaat deboarded from rescue flight“If it were not for the congregation, India’s rate of doubling— that is in how many days the cases have doubled — would have been at 7.4 days,” Agarwal said.The total coronavirus cases in India stand at 3,374 and the death toll has reached 79, Agarwal said, adding that 472 new Covid-19 cases and 11 deaths have been reported since Saturday. He said 267 people have recovered.But a PTI tally of figures reported by states showed at least 106 deaths and 3,624 cases. Of this total, 284 have been cured and discharged, according to the news agency.He said all states have been asked to put in place a district-specific containment strategy in place based on the detailed large outbreak containment plan issued by the health ministry on Saturday.Also read: Delhi’s Tablighi Jamaat meet sparks Covid-19 fears in IAF“Surveillance and contact-tracing has been our main focus, and we will continue to put emphasis on that,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-doubling-rate-in-india-at-4-1-days-govt/story-CcMgi8sSrZ7LnBp1oZ70OL.html

05-04-2020||India||‘Once we don PPE we worry only about our patients’: Kerala nurses fighting Covid-19||They say they would like to be known as warriors, not nightingales any more. Days of gloom and challenges have made them stronger and bolder, say nurses, frontline health workers in the Covid-19 battle who spend most of their time in forlorn wards.“I have stopped breast feeding my 2-year-old daughter. Initially I had some problems but once I don the heavy personal protection equipment (PPE) I forget all my worries,” a 28-year-old nurse at Kalamassery medical college hospital in Ernakulam said. Since she has a small child, Reeja Vishnu was given an option to opt-out of the Covid-19 ward but she declined. “We can’t desert the ship when it needs us the most,” she said.Reshma Mohandas, a nurse at the Kottayam medical college hospital, turned coronavirus positive while treating 93-year-old Thomas and his 84-year-old wife Mariyamma. She was discharged the same day the old couple left the hospital, often dubbed as a miracle among the medical fraternity. While leaving the hospital, the nurse made an unusual plea to the medical superintendent-- she wants to works at the Covid-19 ward after her 14-day mandatory quarantine at home.“Both the aged people were like small kids and we treated them like that. At times they were stubborn and cranky. We had to pat them quite often. Since one of them had some hearing problem I had to go very close. It was my duty,” said Mohandas, a staff nurse. She developed fever on the fourth day of their admission and got isolated immediately. “If we start worrying about ourselves, who will be there to console and look after our patients? So I took it in my stride,” she said. Let us ask some of these nurses about their day in a Covid-19 ward. According to world health standards, a person in PPE can’t work more than four hours and they admit these four are like 40 hours. But they say for wearing and removing it takes more than one hour and another one hour for pre-quarantine and post-duty protocols.“We need another person’s help. First we wear shoes and put on the PPE overall. Then we cover the head and wear mask and goggles. At times we have to wear two or three layers of masks and then put on gloves, one large and another small over it. Since we can’t go to the washroom after putting PPE we usually avoid water,” a nurse explained. After putting the PPE on, there is a 10-minute check to find out whether the person is comfortable and can move around quickly.“Post-duty protocol is more cumbersome. We have to spray disinfectant on entire clothing before removing and each apparel has different bins. During bath we have to wash all our personal clothes and disinfect them again. Not allowed to wear those clothes for at least a month. Then we move to the hostel or dormitory and are not allowed to interact with others. We have to inform our superiors about our health twice a day,” she said. Many Covid-19 hospitals in Kerala have arranged accommodation for health staff near hospitals. There were some cases of taboo but the government intervened effectively.They all say Lini Puthussery, a nurse who died fighting the Nipah virus outbreak in north Kerala in 2018, is their inspiration. Later, a movie was made based on her life ‘Virus’ and it was a big hit. “After fighting Nipah virus, which was more dangerous, our health workers are stronger now. It is time to stand with them,” said Lini’s husband Sajeesh, who works at the health department now. When Lini died, both her children were six and two years of age, later the government gave Sajeesh, who was working in the Middle-east, a job near his house.Nurses from Kerala are most sought after the world over and you can find them in all major hospitals of the country and roughly 20,000 of them work in foreign countries also. Office-bearers of the Nurses’ association said they have information about at least six Kerala nurses who have been infected in foreign countries, including two in United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/once-we-don-ppe-we-worry-only-about-our-patients-kerala-nurses-fighting-covid-19/story-u8f3KkwmJnCVeet6XrhHdM.html
05-04-2020||India||No evidence of coronavirus being airborne, says ICMR’s top scientist||With the number of coronavirus cases in India now doubling in just over four days as the pandemic continues to spread the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said Sunday that there was no evidence of the virus being airborne.“There is no evidence of coronavirus being airborne,” Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, Head Scientist, (ICMR) said at the government’s daily briefing.Coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. Follow coronavirus live updates here.Last month, the World Health Organization had said that there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne, except in a handful of medical contexts, such as when intubating an infected patient.On Sunday, the number of coronavirus cases in India climbed to 3,374 and seventy nine people have lost their lives so far while 267 people have recovered, Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, health ministry said at the briefing.Aggarwal also said the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi last month contributed largely to the rapid rise in infections recently.“Covid-19 cases doubled in 4.1 days presently.... had Tablighi Jamaat incident not happened it would have taken 7.4 days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-evidence-of-coronavirus-being-airborne-says-icmr-s-top-scientist/story-lnLTiNx4JtgxeTZP9G64lN.html

05-04-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 cases climb to 3,374, 79 deaths reported so far, says Health Ministry||India’s approach in the fight against coronavirus outbreak has been proactive and is defined by the attitude to ‘chase the virus instead of letting it chase us’, a health ministry official said on Sunday while revealing that the total number of infections in the country had reached 3374 with 79 incidents of deaths including 11 since Saturday.The government officials also confirmed that 274 districts across the country had reported at least one positive case of coronavirus disease.“Total 3374 confirmed Covid-19 cases have been reported till now, including an additional 472 new cases that have been reported since yesterday. Total 79 deaths reported including 11 additional deaths since yesterday. 267 persons have also recovered from Covid-19,” said Lav Aggarwal, Joint Secy, Health Ministry.Agarwal added that the number of cases in the country was doubling every 4.1 days. “The doubling rate for the cases of Covid-19 cases in the country is presently 4.1 days and this would have been 7.4 days had the Tablighi jamaat cases not surfaced,” Agarwal added.Agarwal was referring to a group of religious congregants in Delhi’s Nizamuddin that have spread the infection in at least 17 states and are said to be the source of at least one-third of all positive infections in the country. The officials said that the Cabinet secretary held a review meeting with the district magistrates of all districts in the country which was also attended by the chief secretaries of all states where officials shared different successful containment strategies deployed in their respective territories. Agarwal said the successful strategies could be summed up in two points- proactive and ruthless containment and over-preparedness.“Proactive and ruthless containment implementation at field level and secondly preparedness to the extent of over preparedness to deal with all situations,” Agarwal said, highlighting the takeaways from the meeting. He said that delineating buffer and containment zones and the necessary ring-fencing of the disease was crucial to the containment strategy and added that the government’s approach has been proactive since the very beginning.“Instead of the virus chasing us, we chase the virus, our approach has been proactive since the very beginning,” Agarwal added.On the issue of a shortage of personal protective equipment, Agarwal said the shortage was being overcome by local manufacturing and import. He said available PPEs have been dispatched to the states on the basis of number of cases and the district authorities have been advised to use them judiciously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-india-s-covid-19-cases-climb-to-3-374-death-toll-goes-up-to-79-says-health-ministry/story-GA3dyS1tIwVlIfYPbwF92M.html

Ever since, the number of Covid-19 patients have gone up rapidly with the current figure crossing 3,300 patients across the nation.Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi are inching toward recording 500 coronavirus cases. Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are also affected by the virus, among other states. However, there are still some corners of the country that are untouched by the grip of the deadly contagion. These include four northeast states and two Union Territories.Northeast India’s Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura and Meghalaya have not recorded a single coronavirus case so far. Assam has seen 24 coronavirus patients while Manipur has just 2. Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh have one Covid-19 case each. The Union territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, as well as Lakshadweep, have not witnessed any coronavirus cases so far. According to the figures released by the Ministry of Health, the number of coronavirus cases in the country on Sunday rose to 3,374. The number of active cases in India stands at 3,030 while 266 people have recovered from the infection. As many as 77 people have died of Covid-19 in the country.Maharashtra leads the Covid-19 tally with a whopping 490 cases, followed by Tamil Nadu (485) and the national capital (445), as per the central government estimates. The government has drawn out a containment plan as clusters posing high risk of further spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19 have emerged in several states.“Clusters have appeared in multiple states, particularly Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana and UT of Ladakh. 211 districts are now reporting Covid-19 cases and the risk of further spread remains very high,” the Union health ministry has said in a 20-page strategy document.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-4-northeast-states-untouched-by-covid-19-no-cases-in-lakshadweep/story-cb7jo3clLkGFJeMYPFpvGL.html
05-04-2020||India||Amid lockdown, Chhattisgarh Police re-calibrate anti-Maoist ops in Bastar||The lockdown to fight coronavirus has forced Chhattisgrah Police to re-calibrate and scale down anti-Maoist operations for security reasons and apprehension of likely shortage of essential items for the troopers, top officials said Sunday. The officials said the approach is to have fewer “dedicated offensive” against the Left-wing extremists based on specific intelligence inputs.Chhattisgarh’s Director General of Police, DM Awasthi, said only four anti-Maoist operations have been conducted since the lockdown came into force on March 24. “Earlier, we used to have 15 to 20 such operations in 10 days,” the DGP said.Awasthi said anti-Maoist operations have been scaled down and the police have changed the ‘operational approach’.“There are many reasons behind planning fewer operations,” he said.He said for big operations, the police need huge back-up like helicopters and medical teams which may be difficult to arrange due to the lockdown. “I have given instructions to officials that operations will only be planned when there is pinpoint intelligence of Maoist movements and big movement of security forces should be avoided,” said Awasthi.More than 65,000 police personnel including 48 battalions of central forces are deployed in the Maoist stronghold of Bastar region which is spread over 39,117 sq km across seven districts and forms a crucial corridor linking Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Jharkhand.According to police estimates, about 5,500 Maoist cadres (from its political and military wings) live in the jungles of Bastar and more three lakh people including women and children in Bastar are Sangham Sadasya (foot-soldiers) of the banned CPI (Maoist).“The anti-Maoist operations have reduced by 50 % in my district. Only dedicated operations are still going on by the Special Forces and it is very difficult now to push other forces in the jungle for big operations,” said a Superintendent of Police posted in one of the districts of Bastar, requesting anonymity.The SP said in the absence of traffic during the lockdown, vehicles of security forces would become easier targets for Maoists. Even inside the jungles there is no movement of people, thereby making the entry of security forces more difficult, he added. “The silence of roads and jungle can be dangerous for security forces. All tribal villages have imposed lockdown and there is barely any movement in jungles. Venturing out could be dangerous,” the SP said.On the ground, the security forces are also facing other problems.Another senior police officer, who was also not willing to be named, said the security forces are facing shortages of essential items and getting supplies quickly is becoming difficult because of the Maoist threat. “It has created some resentment among the lower rung personnel,” a third police officer said. The officers also said that the killing of 17 jawans in Sukma in an ambush by Moaists, a day after the lockdown was enforced on March 24, has also taken a toll on the security personnel. Many are also worried about their families.“Many of the jawans are from rural areas in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha and are worried about their family members back home. Some of them have also applied for leave as they want to visit families. We have cancelled all leaves due to lockdown which has created some resentment,” the official said.All the three police officers quoted above said in such times, mobilising security personnel for operations could have an adverse physiological impact. “The jawans are being counselled by their seniors,” said one of the police officers. Experts, however, said intelligence based operations are important and should continue in Bastar in order to dominate the Maoists.“This is a valid argument that police forces are more exposed on roads during this lockdown because no other vehicles are allowed but SPs should continue intelligence based operations and area domination of the jungle. Police should also take care of the mental health of their personnel,” said Prakash Singh, former DGP of the Border Security Force (BSF).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-lockdown-chhattisgarh-police-re-calibrate-anti-maoist-ops-in-bastar/story-b42rESvuGlTLp0Ek8wZRNP.html

EPFO can validate the date of birth of a subscriber online with Aadhaar instantaneously after the member files an application.At present, subscribers can get their date of birth corrected by producing any of these documents —birth certificate issued by registrar of births and deaths, any education-related certificate, service records of central or state organisations, medical certificate by a civil surgeon, Aadhaar or any other document issued by a government department.A labour ministry spokesperson confirmed the development.Relief to EPFO subscribers is a part of the Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare package under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana (PMGKBY) announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month.Under the relief package, the government would contribute both the share of the employee and the employer in the PF accounts of establishments that have fewer than 100 employees, and where 90% of the employees earn less than Rs 15,000 per month for the next three months.The government has also amended the PF regulation scheme to allow employees to withdraw, on a non-refundable advance basis, 75% of the amount, or up to three months of wages, whichever is lower, from their accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-epfo-allows-subscribers-to-correct-age-proof-documents-online/story-QBJjMuXbFYlMDedGX3oTjK.html

Saturday’s meeting follows the industry bodies’ earlier talks with the tourism ministry as well as a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, asking for financial interventions. Presidents of 10 associations of the tourism and hospitality industry, under the banner of the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality (FAITH), held the virtual meeting with Yogendra Tripathi, the secretary of the tourism ministry, over the National e-Governance Division (NeGD) grid system.Tripathi said the Indian tourism industry will be one of the worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic across all the sectors, as per one of the attendees. The industry bodies reiterated their earlier demands in the face of a grinding halt of the domestic as well as the international tourism industry due to the coronavirus pandemic. This time, they presented a 20-point agenda. Among the demands and their respective statuses that were discussed were a complete Goods and Services Tax (GST) and income tax holiday for tourism, travel and hospitality industry for a year, a moratorium on repayment of EMIs of principal and interest for term loans for 12 months, the enhancement of working capital limits at interest-free rates, and a support fund for salaries and establishment costs. The associations also demanded that provident fund (PF) contributions and Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) be waived off for a year and that GST liability, advance tax, custom duties, excise duties, VAT, and TDS be deferred for a year. Another demand was that cancellations and advances of travel agents and tour operators from airlines be refunded and that the national tourism disaster management task force works on a standard tourism survival package across states. A rollback of the tax collected at source (TCS) introduced in the 2020-21 budget, reduction of interstate tax, reduction in credit card charges, no fixed costs on power tariffs, water or other utilities, deferment of property tax were some of their other demands. The industry has also suggested that Indians be given a tax benefit on the lines of Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) to boost the sector. Subhash Goyal of FAITH said among the relief measures that were given to the industry till now are the three-month moratorium on EMIs and the directive by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that working capital limits be reevaluated by banks.In addition to that, the finance and labour ministries have waived off PF contributions for three months for organisations with less than 100 employees where 90% of the workforce earns below Rs 15,000 per month and is contributed for by the government. Apart from that, the announcement by the finance ministry that filing of income tax returns will be deferred for three months for companies earning up to Rs 5 crore. In the case of VAT and other taxes, some states have given partial reliefs. “India needs to give a relief package like the United States and the United Kingdom. The tourism ministry is the first to be affected and the last to recover,” FAITH’s Goyal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-mn-jobs-at-stake-tourism-sector-needs-relief-package-to-deal-with-covid-19-industry-bodies-to-govt/story-HAbXzcERtYhL6jT68Wq30K.html

Police officers across the state have begun belting out Konkani ‘cantar’ (songs) that are entirely new compositions or with lyrics modified to the tunes of existing songs to get people to stay indoors during the lockdown and have been earning praise from the state’s top cop as well as the people. Four policemen -- Deputy Superintendent of Police Sammy Tavares, Police Inspector Sherif Jacques, Sub Inspector Diego Gracias and constable Daya Kerkar -- in separate instances chose to belt out songs encouraging people to stay in their houses within their respective jurisdictions. While Deputy SP Tavares is an acclaimed theatre singer and has several ‘singles’ and albums to his name spanning a long career wherein the cop would double up as an entertainer, it is a new experience for the others in the police force. “Creativity of #goapolice is an indicator of its commitment to #service of #Goa. Let’s add some music to our PA (Public Address). There is much to cheer as #Goa is doing so well in its #FightAgainstCOVID19,” Goa’s Director General of Police Jaspal Singh who has been actively tweeting the videos shot by his officials has said. “It is heartening to see the people of #Goa appreciating and acknowledging the efforts of their #goapolice. The #FightAgainstCOVID19 is a fight to be fought as one and in #unity. To a better tomorrow,” Singh tweeted. Besides live singing, the Goa Police under Tavares’ guidance also produced a studio recorded song urging people to stay at home, maintain social distance and other tips like encouraging the use of masks, frequent hand washing and avoiding handshakes.The Goa Police faced a lot of flak for its initial attempts to enforce the Centre’s move for a 100% lockdown after videos went viral of cops forcibly closing down grocery stores that had opened and chasing back those who ventured out. Later, images of people being punished and made to do squats and sit ups also emerged online after the CISF were deployed. The restrictions have since been relaxed to enable people to venture out and buy groceries. “Good to see some policemen doing something positive in the media, rather than the negative press they’ve been getting for heavy handed behaviour with some residents,” Fleur D’Costa, a resident said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-to-crooners-goa-police-now-take-to-singing-to-urge-people-to-stay-home/story-a0ym5sThZkFD8KRJpTBtvK.html

The health ministry has linked close to one-third of all Covid-19 infections in the country to Jaamat members and their contacts. A home ministry release that announced the blacklisting of 960 foreigners for attending the congregation in violation of the visa rules said most were from Indonesia (379), Bangladesh (110), Kyrgyzstan (77), Myanmar (63) and Thailand (65). Many foreign nationals who attended the religious gathering, among other Indians, have tested positive for Covid-19 and nearly 22,000 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts have been quarantined across the country so far, a home ministry official said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-malaysian-nationals-linked-to-nizamuddin-jamaat-deboarded-from-rescue-flight/story-Ho9KlEFxZyUoNI29MJzvsO.html
05-04-2020||India||Kumaraswamy claims hidden BJP agenda in PM Modi’s blackout call||Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to offer scientific evidence to back his call for switching off the lights for nine minutes at 9 pm on Sunday and suggested that the symbolic gesture may have been organized to mark BJP’s foundation day, which falls on Monday, April 6.The prime minister on Friday gave a call for a nine-minute show of solidarity and united resolve by the citizens and asked for switching off electric lights and lighting up earthen lamps, candles or flashlights at 9 pm on Sunday. It has received a mixed response with some calling it a move to reenergize the nation towards the national goal of containing the coronavirus disease and others dismissing it as a marketing gimmick.“Has the PM slyly asked the nation to observe a candlelight vigil on the eve of foundation day of (the) BJP? April 6 being its foundation day, what else can explain the choice of date & time for this event? I challenge the PM to offer a credible and scientific explanation,” Kumaraswamy tweeted.PM Modi during his appeal, made through a video clip released on Friday, had added that the gesture will serve as a reminder that the country was united in the battle against coronavirus.“At that time, if you have turned off all the lights of your homes, and each one of us in all directions has lit a diya; we will experience the superpower of light, clearly illuminating the common purpose we are all fighting for. In that light, in that lustre, in that radiance, let us resolve in our minds that we are not alone, that no one is alone! 130 crore Indians are committed, through a common resolve!” the PM had said.In a series of tweets, Kumaraswamy accused Centre of not providing enough personal protective equipment (PPE) to doctors and demanded that testing should be made affordable for the common man. He alleged that the prime minister was not telling the nation what concrete steps are being taken to combat the Covid-19 menace and was instead giving “meaningless” tasks to an already exhausted population.The JDS leader said that PM Modi was converting a national crisis into an event of self-aggrandisement and alleged BJP had a “hidden agenda” while the country faced an unprecedented global calamity.The government has denied claims that there was a scientific purpose behind prime minister’s appeal to switch off lights and light diyas and clarified that it is purely a symbolic move to rally the citizens behind a common cause.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kumaraswamy-claims-hidden-bjp-agenda-in-pm-modi-s-blackout-call/story-jA8hk5XYFt6amoVNuvUYdJ.html
05-04-2020||India||BJP tells leaders to use social media cautiously||Bharatiya Janata Party president JP Nadda has told party office bearers to be cautious of their social media activity during the 21-day lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease outbreak. In a first, many officials are working from home, along with a major chunk of the country’s workforce, as a preventive measure.The instruction was conveyed during an hour-long briefing, co-hosted by party leader BL Santosh, on Thursday.“Naddaji told us that while some of us may not be in a position to go out and help people because we were quarantined, we should be sensitive to the worker’s psyche,’’ said one of the leaders who attended the meeting on condition of anonymity.“Some of us have been posting photos of yoga sessions, of relaxing during the lockdown. Naddaji’s point is that this (such photos and videos) is discouraging, because the worker will resent the fact that he’s out on the streets volunteering to help while senior leaders seem to be having a good time,” the leader cited above said.A second leader who also attended the video conference, said, “He (Nadda) just took it up for 15 seconds because he wanted to convey that this isn’t a holiday. After the lockdown was imposed, many BJP MPs had shared their photos while doing yoga, playing with their pets or mingling with family. Union minister Prakash Javdekar was criticized for tweeting a photo of himself watching Ramayana in his living room.Reacting to the party president’s directive, BJP leader Kailash Vijaywargiya said, “I think that if you like reading and you like bhajans (devotional music), it’s not tough.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-tells-leaders-to-use-social-media-cautiously/story-87tmhUOrRdPnnlfViRMlAI.html

The report was received on Sunday morning and it came negative,” he told PTI.Jammu and Kashmir has so far recorded two coronavirus deaths, while 90 people -- 69 in Kashmir and 21 in Jammu -- have tested positive. Three patients have recovered and discharged from hospital.“The man was asymptomatic and was shifted to one of the best available quarantine facilities given his age and close contact with the positive case. He did not have any major health problem except old-age related issues,” Singla said.Three persons from Narsoo village in Udhampur tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday. Following this, the district magistrate declared Narsoo and Chunti villages as red zones and their surrounding villages as buffer zones.“There shall be no inward or outward movement of any person from these villages and people shall stay at their homes. There shall be complete lockdown. That there shall be no vehicular movement on internal lanes or roads connecting these villages,” Singla said in an order and warned of stern action against violators.He also directed the officers concerned to ensure supply of essential commodities to the villages in accordance to the protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-year-old-man-dies-in-quarantine-in-jammu-and-kashmir-s-udhampur-covid-19-test-report-negative/story-IWZKaw4KziZvpMgGckf1KN.html
05-04-2020||India||Local officials not getting lockdown instructions right: Centre to states||Local officials are not on the same page as the Union government on federal recommendations on the lockdown to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), risking agriculture, routine health care and critical supplies, a communication sent out to states by the Centre shows.There are different “interpretations” of the Centre’s orders on exemptions “on the ground” during the three-week, nationwide lockdown, the communication cautions, indicating that states are not getting federal instructions right at a crucial stage when India is fighting a pandemic that has infected over 3,000 people in the country.The communication comes amid reports that tight rules to enforce social distancing are being applied to exempted essential activities, which district officials are regulating with lockdown permits.Also read: Covid-19 lockdown: 800 cameras, 15 drones are Jaipur Police’s eyes in the skyOn at least three occasions, the Union cabinet secretariat and the home ministry have renewed guidelines on which services to allow and how to manage supply lines, but these have not “percolated down”, the communication to all states said on Friday.It also urged states to ensure district authorities are appropriately briefed to avoid “ambiguity”.Communication lapses could test the limits of efforts to supply essentials to a billion people during the lockdown. For instance, there are reports that diagnostics laboratories, necessary for patients of many non-communicable and communicable diseases, are not adequately functioning in many centres, although they enjoy federal exemptions. This risks the health of people with ailments such as diabetes, heart or neurological conditions The Centre’s communication on April 3 asked states to allow “opening of temporary collection centres, movement of lab technicians and transportation of samples from collection centres to laboratories”. The letter to chief secretaries of states said at the “ground level, different interpretations are being made on exemptions”, which have “hindered” smooth flow of the supply chains. Also read: How high-level group formed by govt has stepped up Covid-19 fightFarmer communities face one of the greatest risks of income losses in what is a key spring harvest season for a range of crops, such as wheat, potato and onion. The Centre has renewed its guidelines on three occasions, especially on allowing agriculture and linked activities that form the farm-to-fork supply chain, on March 25, March 26 and April 3. Farm production, warehousing and transport are critical to the agriculture sector that employs nearly half of the population, with a 16% share in the country’s gross domestic product. On Saturday, the Centre issued a fresh advisory to allow farm machinery and their servicing points.Federal instructions have allowed these sectors to operate in a regulated manner. To ensure social distancing, the mainstay of India’s strategy to fight Covid-19, isn’t compromised while keeping these sectors open, “district authorities have resorted to a pass system”, a senior official of the agriculture ministry said, requesting not to be quoted. The Centre’s advisory on the functioning of these sectors on April 3, seen by HT, said: “Difficulties in getting passes are, however, being faced by businesses with nationwide supply chains of essential goods.” To address this issue, the Centre has asked states to give priority in issuing passes to firms that cater to nationwide supply lines.A key challenge for local officials has been to regulate essential activities that comply with social distancing rules. “Local administration might have tilted more towards the latter. They have constrained capacities. In these situations, the district collector and district police chief have the biggest responsibilities,” said Ananda Kumar Pai, a retired Indian Administrative Service officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-officials-not-getting-lockdown-instructions-right-centre-to-states/story-c1OUrLv4CvA0LaRbYjJ4QN.html
05-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Environment ministry panel for automatic extension of forest clearance||The environment ministry’s forest advisory committee (FAC) has recommended that the validity of forest clearance be extended automatically for government-owned mines whose lease period got a 20-year extension (some of these are from the last year). FAC made this recommendation in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and economic impacts of the lockdown imposed to stop contain the infection.According to the minutes of FAC’s meeting held on March 30 through video-conferencing, these mines will not require a fresh forest clearance. Hence, the impact of forest diversion on the area will not be assessed. Every time its lease expires, a mine has to apply for a fresh forest clearance.The minutes, which HT has seen, state that ministry of steel sought a clarification from the environment ministry in September 2019 on whether forest clearance can be made co-terminous (valid for same period) with the mining lease period.The 50-year lease of five National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) mines in Chhattisgarh expired in 2015 (for four mines) and 2017 (for one mine). Last year, the Chhattisgarh government extended the lease period by another 20 years till 2035 and 2037. Odisha has also extended the lease period for some of its mines. The request for extension of forest clearance was made for these projects by the steel ministry.FAC observed that based on interpretation of various court orders and legal opinion from time to time, such extension of forest clearance can be granted. FAC, however, said the extension of forest clearance should be continued based on whether mines have complied with previous conditions stipulated in the forest clearance like compensatory afforestation and mitigation of environmental impacts. The status of compliance with previous conditions will be monitored after three months (beginning March 30) and additional mitigation measures recommended if needed.“Environment ministry in view of the recent emergency situation (lockdown due to outbreak of Covid-19 disease), may consider the approval granted under FCA-1980, to Government mines, making those co-terminus with the valid lease period,” FAC observed.“FAC’s emphasis on the compliance with previous conditions of forest diversion is significant. However, this should not become a mere bureaucratic exercise both by the central and state governments. For now, the state government can reach out to affected people living in and around these mines to ascertain the existing impacts before taking a final decision. In the context of the lockdown, people living around the mines are the only ones who can report ground realities, other than the mining companies,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research, a public policy think tank.Separately, the environment ministry has already issued directions for extending the validity of all prior environmental clearances expiring between March 15 and April 30 till June 30. The ministry of home affairs has categorised “mining operations” as essential services, which will not be interrupted during the three-week lockdown period that began on March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-env-min-panel-for-automatic-extension-of-forest-clearance/story-e6W7xbhu5b16xidB855rHK.html

Besides focusing on bilateral cooperation against the pandemic, President Donald Trump recalled his visit to India in late February.According to government sources, India is stockpiling the drug for its population in the event of a worst case scenario and will lift the export control order only after it has enough to take care of all Indians. Other countries are also doing the same. India is one of the largest manufacturers of hydroxychloroquine, which has been used for treatment of malaria and lupus. Also Watch | Why PM Modi’s call to light candles on April 5 is not mere symbolismWhile India is all for honouring its contracts for supply of this drug to American companies, it is also willing to be on the frontline of human clinical trials of a future Covid 19 vaccine with its body of highly professional doctors , laboratories and transparent feedback to the manufacturers. This may not be possible in African countries as well as in China.Also Read: ‘There’ll be a lot of death’, Trump tells US as Covid-19 cases surgeIn the past two weeks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been working the phones and video-conferences with all the major global leaders to fight the pandemic. Since the lockdown, he has spoken to G-20 leaders, majority of SAARC leaders and leaders from Israel, Spain and Brazil.Supplementing the global effort is external affairs minister S Jaishankar who is in constant touch with his counterparts in Gulf countries and has touched base with nearly 100 foreign ministers in the past two months.While the “extensive” telephone call between PM Modi and US President Trump was focused on the fight against coronavirus, the conversation between EAM Jaishankar and his US counterpart Mike Pompeo went beyond coronavirus and touched on bilateral relations.Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla has also been on the phone in this context. In the past two weeks, he has spoken to his counterparts in India-Pacific region including the US, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand.Worried at the spike in coronavirus cases due to the infection spread at Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Markaz Nizamuddin, India is seriously ramping up its pharmaceutical capacities too as there would be a price to pay to whoever develops the Covid-19 vaccine first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-do-all-we-can-how-pm-modi-responded-to-trump-s-request-on-covid-19-drug/story-mEH6BrglRAey1fIpT6UdmM.html

The Central government data, however, doesn’t take into account the latest cases reported by the states, which if taken into consideration will put the total over the four thousand mark at 4014, including all incidents of deaths and cured cases.Maharashtra is the only state to have reported in excess of 700 cases with a combined tally of 719, followed by 495 in Tamil Nadu, 461 in Delhi, 358 in Kerala, 257 in Uttar Pradesh and 272 in Telangana as per the state-wise data reported by PTI.

USA tops the chart with over 300,000 infections followed by Spain, Italy, Germany and France with over 126,000, 124,000, 96,000 and 85,000 cases respectively. Italy has registered 15,362 deaths, the most globally, followed by 11,947 in Spain and 8454 in the USA.India entered day 11 of the 21-day lockdown on Sunday which, the government has indicated, could be lifted in a phased manner after April 14. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a video conference with leaders of all political parties on Wednesday to hear their suggestions on the containment strategy for Covid-19.India has also revised its testing strategy to include rapid testing involving blood tests to detect the presence of antibodies against Covid-19 virus, however, it is only being used to test communities in hotspots so far.Several experts and political parties have suggested scaling up testing followed by isolation in order to prevent its spread. Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram has said that the lockdown for coronavirus will be effective only if “we test, detect, isolate and then treat”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-india-s-covid-19-cases-jump-to-3373-by-sunday-afternoon/story-jMoEm4SH9VVpIirq9OrgpL.html

05-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Suspected Covid-19 patient attempts suicide in Delhi||A 37-year-old suspected Covid-19 patient tried to kill himself by jumping off the third floor of the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital building in central Delhi late on Saturday, police said.The man suffered a fracture in his legs and is undergoing treatment in the hospital, they said. They added that the man, a shopkeeper, does not have any foreign travel history. “Prima facie, it appears that he was depressed and feared to be infected by the Covid-19,” said a police officer. Police said the man is not from the Nizamuddin Markaz area, from where more than 2300 people, including foreigners, were evacuated by authorities after many from across the country who had attended a religious congregation there were found Covid-19 positive. Sanjay Bhatia, the deputy commissioner of police (central), said the man, who lives with his family in a residential area not too far from the hospital, had walked into the hospital on March 31, complaining about a runny nose and cough. Also read: New plan holds clues to unlocking countryAfter initial medical tests, the doctors said he was suffering from normal flu and had no symptoms of Covid-19.“They discharged him but he returned the same day and insisted on being admitted so that his tests should be done again. The man was admitted,” said Bhatia, adding that the result of the man’s test for Covid-19 test was awaited.On Saturday at around 11.30pm, DCP Bhatia said, the man jumped down from the third floor of the hospital. He first fell on the metal roof below and then landed on the ground, because of which he survived but fractured his legs.“Doctors have told us that his condition is stable,” said Bhatia.An official from Lok Nayak Hospital, which has been converted into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, also confirmed that the suspected patient jumped from the building. “We do not know the reason yet. His is alive and his injuries are currently being evaluated and treatment is being done,” the official said.There are 466 Covid-19 patients, including 15 discharged and six fatalities, in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-suspected-covid-19-patient-attempts-suicide-in-delhi/story-EB2ipMwT8QZlPHWU5M3OpO.html
05-04-2020||India||Govt draws aggressive containment strategy to check spread of Covid-19||The government has drawn out a containment plan as clusters posing high risk of further spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19 have emerged in several states.The cluster containment strategy is meant to contain the disease within a defined geographical area by early detection of cases, breaking the chain of transmission and thus preventing its spread to new areas.“Clusters have appeared in multiple states, particularly Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana and UT of Ladakh. 211 districts are now reporting Covid-19 cases and the risk of further spread remains very high,” the Union health ministry has said in a 20-page strategy document.More on Covid-19:• Covid-19: Your guide to staying safe• Covid-19: What you need to know today• Can Covid-19 spread after symptoms end?• How coronavirus is different from seasonal flu and common coldThe aggressive containment strategy will be scaled down, said the government document, only if no new cases of Covid-19 are reported for at least four weeks after the last confirmed test.“Intensive risk communication campaign will be followed to encourage all persons to stay indoors for an initial period of 28 days, to be extended based on the risk assessment. Based on the risk assessment and indication of successful containment operations, an approach of staggered work and market hours may be put into practice,” the document said.The cluster containment strategy would “include geographic quarantine, social distancing measures, enhanced active surveillance, testing all suspected cases, isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts and risk communication to create awareness among public on preventive public health measures”, the document stated.“The objective of this plan is to stop the chain of transmission thus reducing the morbidity and mortality due to Covid-19,” it said.For large outbreaks amenable to containment, the documents stated that the strategy will remain the same but vary in extent depending upon spread and response to be mounted to contain it.Geographic quarantine and containment strategy will include defining the area of operation, active surveillance for cases and contacts in the identified geographic zone, expanding laboratory capacity for testing all suspect cases, high risk contacts and SARI cases and operationalising surge capacities created for isolation (Covid-19 hospitals/blocks) to hospitalise and manage all suspect or confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-draws-aggressive-containment-strategy-to-check-spread-of-covid-19/story-9xosl47rbiw9w9dtWndarK.html

Has the PM slyly asked the nation to observe a candle light vigil on the eve of foundation day of BJP? April 6 being its foundation day, what else can explain the choice of date & time for this event? I challenge the PM to offer a credible scientific and rational explanation, the Janata Dal (Secular) leader tweeted. It is shameful to convert the national crisis into an event of self aggrandisement & it is beyond shameful to push the hidden agenda of his party in the face of global calamity.May sense prevail upon the PM, Kumaraswamy said. The government, he alleged, is yet to provide personal protective equipment (PPEs) for doctors and make test kits affordable for the common man. Without telling the nation what concrete steps are being taken to combat COVID-19 menace, the Prime Minister is giving meaningless tasks to an already exhausted population, the son of former Prime Minister and JDS supremo H D Deve Gowda claimed. The Prime Minister on Friday urged people to switch off lights at their homes and light up lamps, candles and hold mobile phone torches for nine minutes from 9 pm on Sunday to display the country’s “collective resolve” to defeat the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/south/pm-s-appeal-on-lighting-lamps-is-bjp-s-hidden-agenda-hd-kumaraswamy/story-GW0gzsrerdsu9nEmfiw3BM.html
05-04-2020||India||Covid-19 challenge seeks innovative solutions to mitigate pandemic impact||The National Innovation Foundation, an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), has launched a Challenge Covid-19 Competition (C3), seeking technologies and innovative solutions to various problems related to the viral disease.NIF will help in incubating and scaling up shortlisted entries — innovations such as better PPE (personal protective equipment) kits and masks, rapid diagnostics, cheaper ventilators, sanitizers or anything else that can break the transmission of the virus.NIF is also looking for ideas keeping people gainfully engaged or that proposing a healthy diet during a lockdown. Ideas for supply chain management and door-step delivery for the elderly are also being looked at.Also read: Coronavirus update: PM Modi’s call for switching off lights for 9 minutes at 9pm todayIn the long term, the challenge will also look at supporting contact-less technologies. Surfaces such as elevator buttons that are frequently touched by many become a source of infection and hence solutions to minimise the contact have been invited.“The initiative being launched will not only create awareness, but will intimately engage a wide cross-section of society with diverse backgrounds in providing and implementing solutions,” said Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, DST.The Science Engineering and Research Board (SERB), another body under DST, is also supporting an Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur team in developing a virucidal coating that can be used on masks and personal protective gear to ensure no virus can pass through.The IIT-Kanpur team will use a combination of polymers that are known to have anti-microbial properties along with some anti-viral molecules to better protect health care workers, extend the life of the gear, and make it reusable. The team will also keep in mind the cost of the coating to ensure scalability, according to DST.“Immobilising anti-microbial and anti-viral ingredients on the fabric can be useful in critical environments, and for extending the life, re-usability and safer handling and disposal. This additional defence will be especially valuable if it can be added at a fraction of the cost of the mask,” said Sharma.Another DST-funded startup — Weinnovate Biosolutions — has come up with a non-alcoholic colloidal silver solution that can be used for disinfecting hands and surfaces. The liquid is non-flammable. Lab testing has already been done and the manufacturers have received a test license.“We are aiming to manufacture primarily a minimum of 200 litres of colloidal silver solution per day with our manufacturing set up to cater to the demand of hand sanitisation and disinfection. With our solution, we are positive to reduce the number in infection spread and helping India to be infection-free,” said Milind Choudhari, one of the founders of Weinnovate Biosolutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-challenge-seeks-innovative-solutions-to-mitigate-pandemic-impact/story-uQ1l62gwj1khNnXCMClwgJ.html

05-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Govt keeps tabs on pharma sector to ensure smooth supplies||The government is keeping tabs on the working of the pharmaceutical industry in order to ensure that there is no shortage of essential medical supplies during the three-week, nationwide lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) .The department of pharmaceuticals has reached out to all stakeholders, asking them to duly document details of the pharma industry’s operations on a daily basis. And acting on that directive, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has written to drugs controllers in all states and Union Territories to ensure that details are submitted to the government every day.“In view of the current situation of lockdown due to the outbreak of Covid-19 in the country, the government of India is desirous to know the status of working of pharma industry. Accordingly, department of pharmaceuticals has forwarded a performa for the required information to be provided on daily basis,” reads the letter from CDSCO to all drugs controllers.Initially, the exercise will be implemented at the state-level, and gradually will be extended at the district-level.“The government is keeping an eye on manufacturing, sale and distribution process, and action will be taken wherever necessary. So far, there is no shortage of any medicines, vitamins etc. in the market, and people need not hoard,” said a government official, requesting anonymity. The government has also restricted the export of diagnostic kits with immediate effect.“Experts are reviewing the situation on a day-to-day basis, and are intervening wherever there is a need. These export curbs are a part of several measures that the government is taking to ensure there’s no shortage of essential items, and are temporary in nature,” said a second senior government official.To ensure that there is no overpricing of medical devices, especially at a time the country is fighting the pandemic, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) earlier notified that all 24 classes of medical devices shall be regulated as drugs.The government, under this new regulation, will ensure that no manufacturer will increase the maximum retail price (MRP) of these items beyond 10% of the MRP in a year. The country’s apex drug pricing regulator issued the notification under the provisions of Drug (Price Control) Order, 2013, and it came into effect on April 1.“The companies cannot increase the price of medical devices beyond what is permitted under any circumstances. This is done to ensure there is no price inflation, especially when the country is combating a pandemic,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry, said in a briefing on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-govt-keeps-tabs-on-pharma-sector-to-ensure-smooth-supplies/story-YTQZ1FVnscocTbgvzmXjlJ.html

The research scholar at University of Milan in Italy got to know he had contracted the coronavirus disease when the Regional Medical Research Laboratory in Bhubaneswar messaged to doctors in Capital Hospital that his swab report had tested positive. He became Odisha’s first Covid-19 patient that night.Discharged on April 3 from Capital Hospital, two days after the second Covid-19 patient was released from AIIMS Bhubaneswar, the man sent a video message thanking the doctors for their support.“I urge people not to panic over the situation and stay positive,” the man wearing a surgical mask is heard saying in the video. Also read: Odisha asks thousands to self-quarantine as postman tests positiveHe has been advised to remain under home quarantine for another 14 days and avoid any cold food. He has also been asked to call doctors if there any health complications during this period.His father and their cook were kept in an isolation ward of the same hospital for coming in contact with him and released a few days ago as they tested negative.Confusion and clearanceOn March 14, when the man and his father came to the hospital along with their cook over suspected symptoms of Covid-19, he had an upset stomach. They were asked to stay in the isolation ward along with another man, who had arrived from Belgium and showed symptoms of the viral attack. On the night of March 15 when the man’s first test report arrived, there was some confusion as the result showed his was a suspected case while the report of the other who had travelled to Belgium was positive. However, soon the confusion was cleared as the second report confirmed that the 33-year-old man had Covid-19 while the other tested negative.“When I took the youth to his cabin, he was already having loose motions and seemed very nervous. He kept on asking if he will survive. I assured him that he would be alright,” the doctor who attended him said requesting anonymity.Cocktail of drugsBooks, phoneAs there are no prescribed medicines for the coronavirus disease, the doctor at the Capital Hospital consulted his retired teachers and read up international medical journals to get an idea about the drugs.“So, we administered hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin and Oseltamivir to the youth. Luckily after a few days, it started showing results,” said the doctor.“But more than that I took to chatting with him over the phone to lift his morale. That was very important as he was alone in that cabin. If a patient gets demotivated, then his situation may worsen,” he said.Also read: With 15 new Covid-19 cases, Odisha sees a 3-fold jump; 3 towns shut down completelyThe man’s father, who was kept isolated in the same hospital, said he just saw his son across the glass door a few times.“The hospital authorities would keep his food outside his cabin on a table. He would then take the tray inside and eat. Inside his cabin, he had just his mobile phone to keep him busy for about 20 days,” he said.He had also books and magazines to keep him busy.The man would have been discharged a little earlier but his second sample could not be tested due to a surge in cases at the laboratories. So, a third sample was sent a couple of days earlier which came out negative for Covid-19.The doctor who treated him lived in a servant quarter of his government accommodation and his family stayed several metres away.Doctors at Capital Hospital said the third Covid-19 patient, a 60-year-old banker who retired last month, was also improving.“He was suffering from pneumonia which is what Covid-19 does. But we tried the same cocktail of medicines that we tried with the first patient and luckily it worked. He would hopefully be discharged after his reports test negative twice in a span of 24 hours,” said the doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-recovery-odisha-s-first-covid-19-patient-urges-people-not-to-panic/story-CmNALoSglJp1YKGPGl5MqM.html
05-04-2020||India||Cancer patients from Assam stranded in Mumbai amid Covid-19 lockdown||Anup Bordoloi reached Mumbai on February 25 for his 64-year-old father’s cancer treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital.After being tested, Jogen Bordoloi was diagnosed with food pipe cancer and was referred to a private hospital in Mumbai on March 17.Belonging to Mangaldai, a town 75 kilometres north of Guwahati, this family with limited resources was relying on the Atal Amrit Abhiyan — a cashless healthcare scheme.But it was denied by the hospital, which is not among 30-odd private sector healthcare institutes outside the state empanelled with the Assam government.Left with no option, the father and son decided to move back to Guwahati, but fate had some other plans. The Bordolois are now among scores of other cancer patients from Assam who are stranded in Mumbai due to the Covid-19 lockdown.Also read: Assam’s lone non-Markaz patient baffles officials, shows symptoms month after travelThey have been staying at Assam Bhavan, which has been converted into a shelter for cancer patients and tourists from the state.“We are providing free lodging and food to 200 people, most of whom are cancer patients,” Devasish Sarma, joint resident commissioner of Mumbai’s Assam Bhavan, says.“We are also providing free food to around 7000 migrant labourers from Assam, who have been rendered jobless. A helpline number (022-27810888) has also been activated,” Sarma says.Dilip Kumar, 37, who had come for bone marrow transplantation in Mumbai is another stranded patient.“I was told to arrange Rs 15 lakh for treatment. For this, I have to travel back to my hometown Mangaldai to seek financial assistance, but I can no more travel amid the lockdown,” he says.Same is the case with Nasim Khan, 44, of Titabor, a town located 300 kilometres east of Guwahati. He is in Mumbai along with his wife for her urinary tract cancer treatment. Uttam Kumar Roy, 52, who went to Mumbai to get his brother treated for mouth cancer at Tata Memorial Hospital, says his brother’s case has been referred back to Guwahati, but now they are unable to make their way back.Meanwhile, Kabita Dey, 36, from Guwahati is facing a problem of a different kind. She was undergoing treatment for breast cancer at Christian Medical College, Vellore, but decided to shift to Tata Memorial Hospital because of the high costs involved.“Here in Mumbai, doctors wanted my biopsy slides prepared at Vellore, but due to the lockdown, they haven’t reached yet, and I am stranded here with no treatment,” she says.Why they move out“The number of cancer patients stranded in Mumbai is too high, but the Assam Bhavan is doing a great job in supporting them,” M Angamuthu, commissioner of Assam’s general administration department, says.“Even Assam has good cancer care facilities, but these came up a bit late. While some people are not aware of them, others don’t want to rely on local institutes and make a beeline for prominent hospitals in Mumbai and other metropolitans.”Echoing a similar sentiment, Bibhuti Borthaur, superintendent of B Barooah Cancer Institute in Guwahati, says most of the times, cancer patients’ well-wishers suggest them to go to metropolitan cities, such as Mumbai and Chennai, to get better medical attention.As public and private cancer care institutes in Assam have long waiting lists, they are unable to provide prompt treatment, he says.“Since Tata Memorial Hospital is the most preferred cancer hospital in India, many patients end up going to Mumbai,” he says.Also read: People between 21-40 worst hit by virus, shows ministry dataHowever, many of them, like Jogen Bordoloi, are later referred to other private hospitals, where the cost of treatment is much higher.“Cancer patients undergoing treatment are more susceptible to any kind of viral infection,” says Borthaur. “We encourage patients to opt for hospitals at or close to their hometowns, as cancer treatment takes time.”Generally, the cost of treatment is less than the cost of travel, stay and food. After a point, it gets difficult to bear the financial strain and people give up, he says.However, Anup Bordoloi is not giving up just yet and is waiting for the lockdown to end so that he can bring his father back to Assam to resume his cancer treatment in Guwahati.“I am hopeful,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cancer-patients-from-assam-stranded-in-mumbai-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-C0cGCFVUuwFyijkBOWYrQN.html

Investigation is going on,” said Shyam Singh, superintendent of the police of Birbhum district.The administration had decided to build a quarantine centre. A section of the people didn’t want the centre to come up as they apprehended that there could be an outbreak. The idea was supported by another section of villagers. “This triggered a political unrest. A clash followed, which left one person dead,” said a senior police officer.A large police contingent was rushed to the spot to bring situations under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-killed-after-clashes-break-out-over-setting-up-of-a-quarantine-centre-in-south-bengal-district/story-uIX8qbbAypnR1LxXEh80RK.html

He died on the spot,” Raju Adivasi said.The local legislator Panchilal Meda also blamed the police for the tribal man’s death.“The dead body of the deceased bore signs of canes which suggest that he was beaten up by police and it caused his death. Strict action should be taken against guilty police personnel,” Meda said.

He only said they had a “good discussion, and agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to fight Covid-19”. Also Watch | ‘There will be a lot of death’: Donald Trump warns as COVID-19 cases swell in USLate Saturday, the White House said in a readout of two leaders’ phone call that they discussed how the two countries can work together to combat the coronavirus pandemic and “agreed to remain in touch on the issue of global supply chains for critical pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and to ensure they continue to function as smoothly as possible during the global health crisis”.India is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of hydroxychloroquine, a drug that has been used for decades to treat malaria and lupus. It banned the export of the it as active pharmaceutical ingredient (API, the molecule) and it formulations on March 25, around the time President Trump began talking about the need for it to treat Covid-19.India is using the drug extensively as a prophylactic for healthcare professionals working on coronavirus patients.Also read| ‘There’ll be a lot of death’: Trump tells US as Covid-19 cases surgeThe restriction, issued by the director general of foreign trade, was not blanket. An exception could be made, the notice said, on “humanitarian” grounds and on a case-to-care basis determined by the ministry of external affairs. And India has indeed made exceptions for Israel from restrictions announced earlier on a list of 26 drugs, according to news reports. It was not clear if exemptions for Israel included hydroxychloroquine.Also read: How pool testing for Covid-19 can enhance speed, scaleThis notification was amended and superseded by another issued on Saturday, which removed the exemptions altogether. “The export of hydroxychloroquine and formulations made from hydroxychloroquine, therefore, shall remain prohibited, without any exception,” the director general of foreign trade said in the new notification.The implications of the new notification for President Trump’s “personal” plea to Prime Minister Modi could not be immediately ascertained but people familiar with the matter said it’s a government notification that can be overturned by the government if it so determined.If India has surplus doses of the drug, they argued, it might want to allow the US orders at this time of emergency for a country struggling with an epidemic that has killed close to 8,500 people and infected more than 300,000. The long- and short-term implications of the “gesture” cannot be overstated, they added.Also read: Untraced foreigners could spread coronavirus, experts fearFaced with a fast depleting stockpile of medical supplies and equipment needed to deal with the rush of cases and fatalities, Trump has reached out to other countries as well. He recently called his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in for medical equipment and the Russians sent a planeload of supplies last week. Earlier Saturday, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced getting a donation of 1,000 ventilators from China.The size of the US order on “hold”, as the president called the ban, could not be immediately ascertained, but their importance to his cannot be underestimated. “They make large amounts of hydroxychloroquine, very large amounts, frankly,” the resident said, adding, “and they had a hold, because, you know, they have 1.5 billion people. and they (need) a lot of it”.There is no proven evidence that hydroxychloroquine works against the coronavirus. There have been some studies and trials, but scientists and experts have said they were too small to determine its effectiveness. But physicians have been using it nevertheless, even in the United States.President Trump has spoken of hydroxychloroquine as a potential “game-changer” many times, with experts of his coronavirus task force adding the usual cautionary note every time that the drug has no proven benefits for COVID-19 patients. The US drug regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, granted “compassionate use” authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine), to be prescribed to severely ill patients in mid-March. Last week, the regulator gave it emergency-use authorization. And it is being tried on COVID-10 patients in New York City, the epicentre of the American outbreak.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-donald-trump-urges-pm-modi-to-lift-export-hold-on-anti-malaria-drug-for-covid-19-treatment/story-qL7QVaX2jD3OvXiJQ6Ce2K.html
05-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: New York gets 1,100 ventilators with help from China, Oregon||New York secured a planeload of ventilators from China on Saturday, and Oregon was sending a shipment of its own to battle the coronavirus pandemic at its US core, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said. But the governor’s startling plan to force hospitals elsewhere in the state to give spare ventilators to the fight in New York City apparently hadn’t yet materialised, a day after he ordered them to surrender 20 per cent of any unused supply to the National Guard for temporary redistribution. The state got 1,000 ventilators after the Chinese government facilitated a donation from billionaires Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai, the co-founders of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, Cuomo said. He added that the state of Oregon had volunteered to send 140 more breathing machines.The influx offered some hope after the governor repeatedly warned that the state’s supply of the vital machines would be exhausted in days if the number of critically ill coronavirus patients kept growing at the current rate.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here“It’s going to make a significant difference for us,” Cuomo said.New York is the pandemic’s US epicentre, with over 113,700 confirmed cases as of Saturday morning. More than 3,500 people statewide have died, and about 15,000 coronavirus patients are hospitalized. Over 4,100 are in intensive care — many, if not all, of them needing ventilators.The outbreak is heavily concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area.Cuomo’s announcement came a day after he said he would have the National Guard collect and “redeploy” ventilators that some hospitals weren’t using.He alluded again Saturday to the plan, but details remained unclear.“We find what equipment we have, we use it the best we can,” the Democrat said Saturday, saying he’d seek 20 per cent of “unused and available” ventilators, a number he pegged at 500 in all.Also read| ‘There’ll be a lot of death’: Trump tells US as Covid-19 cases surgeThe idea has alarmed Republican politicians and some hospital leaders upstate.They said it would leave people in their areas vulnerable and pit the state’s regions against one another.But two hospital umbrella groups didn’t protest. The Greater New York Hospital Association portrayed the idea as ongoing reciprocity among medical centers as the outbreak’s hotspots shift, while the Healthcare Association of New York State noted that some hospitals have already, voluntarily sent staff and equipment to harder-hit institutions or accepted patients from them.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageBoth groups, and several upstate hospitals, said Saturday they had gotten no further information on the governor’s plan. The state Health Department said no information was available beyond the governor’s remarks.Messages were sent to his office seeking details on how the redistribution would work.National Guard spokesman Eric Durr said Saturday that the collection had not yet begun.Governors around the US have been pleading, competing and scouring the global marketplace for needed supplies, especially ventilators, to treat the sick. Cuomo said Saturday that New York at one point made purchase orders for 17,000 of the devices, but only 2,500 came through.“You get a call that says, ‘We can’t fill that order,’” he said.Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, also a Democrat, said last week that the federal government agreed to send about 2,400 ventilators to the city and another 2,000 to the state. The mayor and governor have repeatedly implored the federal government for more help.The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.In upstate New York, state Sen. James Seward, a Republican from Milford, had been on a ventilator since Thursday and in a medically induced coma because of COVID-19, but his condition improved and he was taken off the ventilator Saturday, his spokesman, Jeff Bishop, said in a Twitter posting.Earlier Saturday, Seward’s wife, Cynthia, posted in an online community group that he was still in a coma and on a respirator at Albany Medical Center, and she asked for thoughts and prayers for his healing, PBS reported. Cynthia Seward, who also has COVID-19, said in the post that she was self-quarantining, had pneumonia and shingles, and had lost her sense of taste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-new-york-gets-1-100-ventilators-with-help-from-china-oregon/story-yPvmD4i6rULH46VmX4FQUK.html

Busting mythsAfter Prime Minister appealed for a show of solidarity in the country’s collective fight against the coronavirus pandemic, social media was full of videos and posts about its ‘scientific benefits’.This led the government to dismiss these as ‘rumours and unscientific’ through the Press Information Bureau (PIB).“Don’t fall for the rumours/unscientific reasoning on the appeal for lightning Diya/candles/flash/torch on 5th April at 9pm. This initiative is to show solidarity and confidence in our collective fight against #Covid19,” PIB tweeted“Please maintain #SocialDistancing to keep #Covid19 at bay,” it said.Power gridsModi’s appeal to citizens to switch off lights across India on Sunday to mark the coronavirus fight also raised concerns that a surge in voltage due to a steep dip in power demand could harm the grid and cause widespread outages.The power grid has seen a 30% drop in demand due to the absence of commercial activity amid the 21-day nationwide lockdown. There were fears that the Prime Minister’s call could encourage people to switch off everything, reducing demand even more.The Union ministry of power then clarified that Modi’s call would not cause instability to the power grid amid concerns over a possible grid-collapse.Also read: What you need to know today“Some apprehensions have been expressed that this may cause instability in the grid and fluctuation in voltage which may harm electrical appliances. These apprehensions are misplaced. The Indian electricity grid is robust and stable and adequate arrangements and protocols are in place to handle the variation in demand,” the power ministry said in a statement.“The appeal of the Hon Prime Minister is to simply switch off the lights in their homes from 9 pm to 9.09 pm on the 5th of April. There is no call to switch off either streetlights or appliances like Computers, TVs, Fans, Refrigerators and ACs in the homes. Only lights should be switched off,” it added.PM Modi’s earlier appealModi had called on people to go on a self-imposed Janta Curfew and stay inside their homes and avoid going outside between 7am to 9pm on March 22. He also asked people to come to their doorways, balconies and windows to clap or ring bells at 5pm to thank those working toward essential services. Hundreds of thousands across the country had responded to the Prime Minister’s appeal to cheer doctors, nurses, police officials and others who are working to fight the coronavirus pandemic.India has seen a rise in the cases of Covid-19 since then and 3072 people, including 212 recoveries and 75 deaths, have contracted the coronavirus disease till Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-pm-modi-s-call-for-switching-off-lights-for-9-minutes-at-9pm-today/story-olj4BNvDusJtIZeUAYAaCJ.html

Any surge in cases are to be monitored and brought to the notice of surveillance officer or chief medical officer for additional investigation.“We have identified several hotspot areas where large numbers of COVID-19 cases are cropping up and rapid anti-body test is most suitable to detect whether the disease is spreading in the area or not... Also, rapid antibody test give quick results. Once a person is positive for rapid anti-body test, he or she should be quarantined for 14 days and a RT-PCR test should be done as a confirmatory test,” Dr R Ganga Khedkar of ICMR told ANI.“We have issued fresh guidelines for healthcare workers which say that all healthcare workers who are doing the rapid antibody test should use gloves, mask and headcovers. Healthcare workers collecting throat or nasal swab should follow standard national infection control guidelines,” he said.The advisory also mentioned that as a matter of abundant precautions, all symptomatic ILI persons should be advised home quarantine for 14 days. At facility level, symptomatic ILI individuals are to be tested using rapid antibody test.The guidelines mentioned, “Antibody test negative: if warranted, confirm by real time RT PCR using throat or nasal swab. If RT PCR negative: likely non COVID19 ILI and if RT PCR positive: confirmed COVID 19 case and action as per protocol to be initiated for isolation, treatment and contact tracing.”“Anti-body test positive: After clinical assessment, treatment in hospital or isolation as per protocol. Action to be taken as per protocol to initiated for contact tracing,” it said.The ICMR stated that the rapid antibody test approved by US-FDA CE-IVD or non CE-IVD validated by ICMR-NIV with marketing approval by DCGI be used.To ensure that all such cases are monitored and necessary action is initiated with respect to infectious can disease management, ICMR has sought details of all test results to its portal and update real time data. Failure to do so they will be held liable to action under Disaster Management Act, 2005.As of now, India has reported over 3,000 cases of COVID-19 and 75 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-gives-nod-for-rapid-antibody-test-to-detect-covid-19-in-hotspot-areas/story-yW35kCeXHJk4PSiESHygCK.html

The group leaders spoke on issues and challenges that need to be addressed and the Prime Minister told them that the government is closely working with the states to combat the deadly virus.Later, in a series of tweets, the PM said that countrywide preparedness in terms of availability of hospitals, proper isolation and quarantine facilities, and disease surveillance, testing and critical care training were reviewed at the meeting. According to the official cited in the first instance, the meeting also identified areas needing attention. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Prime Minister also emphasized on ensuring sufficient production, procurement and availability of all essential medical equipment such as PPEs, masks, gloves and ventilators.Many states have sought more medical equipment such as protective gear, gloves and masks from the Centre apart from financial packages. The Prime Minister was also appraised of the steps being taken in the past seven days to ramp up the production of medical equipments. Earlier, in a meeting it was found that more than 20,000 ventilators in India are lying unused due to shortage or spares or servicing.The Narendra Modi government on Sunday established ten empowered groups and a key strategic task force to look into all aspects of the Corona outbreak. the measure turns at least 68 senior bureaucrats into a consorted planning and implementing machinery as India scrambles to minimize the impact of the deadly diseases that continues to kill thousands across the world.Last Sunday, the government announced working groups with specific task assigned to country’s top bureaucrats and experts to cover all aspects of the current situation arising out of the Corona outbreak.Groups have been formed with focus areas such as “the medical emergency management plan”, “availability of hospitals, isolation and quarantine facilities, disease surveillance and testing and critical care training” and “facilitating supply chain and logistics management for availability of necessary items such as food and medicine” and other issues.All the ten empowered groups have representatives from the cabinet secretariat and PMO for better coordination.A six-member Strategic Task Force has also been formed which will exclusively deal with issues related to the ongoing three-week lockdown that ends on April 14.

05-04-2020||India||Community spread worries swirl in MP’s Covid hotspot Indore||Around 50% of the Covid-19 patients in Indore, the commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh, have no recent travel history or exposure to another person infected by the coronavirus, indicating that they caught the disease possibly through community transmission, health officials said. Indore recorded its first Covid-19 case on March 25, five days after the first four cases in the state were reported from Jabalpur. The number of cases grew steadily -- five more on March 26, four each on March 27 and 28 and three on March 29. The spurt started on March 30, when 19 new cases were identified. As of Thursday night, Indore accounted for 82 of Madhya Pradesh’s 107 Covid-19 patients.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOnly 40 of the 82 people identified as Covid-19-positive had a travel history or exposure to a person known to be suffering from the disease, indicating the likelihood of community transmission, said a health department official of Indore district, who is maintaining records of all Covid-19 positive cases. Community transmission, known as stage 3 in a pandemic of the Covid-19 kind, is suspected when the source of infection cannot be identified and is seen as a sign of the virus spreading in local communities. Indian medical authorities have so far not acknowledged that the country has reached that stage. A health department official, requesting anonymity, said that when the initial cases were reported in Indore, little screening of people had taken place in the densely populated neighbourhoods where they surfaced. The complete lockdown starting on March 25 had also not been strictly enforced, the official said. “This may have caused some community spread,” the official added.The Madhya Pradesh government on March 30 replaced collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav and deputy inspector general of police Ruchivardhan Mishra with Manish Singh and Harinarayan Chari Mishra,respectively. Jatav declined speak on alleged lapses that took place in containing the spread of infections at the onset of the virus in Indore. The new collector should brief the media about the situation in Indore, Jatav said. Singh said they were alert about the situation and strict lockdown has been enforced in all these localities. What shocked health officials was that about 70 patients, or 80% of the Covid-19 patients identified as of Thursday night, had no recent history of travel. Chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Indore, Dr Praveen Jadia said, “Most of the cases don’t have a travel history. We suspect that the first four cases may have got the disease from one source and may have unknowingly spread it to others.” The first cases were reported from Ranipura, Chandan Nagar and Khajrana and they spread to new neighbourhoods like Daulatganj and Azad Nagar, indicating that the enforcement of the lockdown had been lax. Anwar Qadri, a local corporator , agreed with Jadia. “We are also baffled as to how the virus spread so fast in these localities,” he said, that unlike in other places, Indore’s Muslims had an insignificant association with the Tablighi Jamaat, the Islamic group whose Delhi headquarters hosted an international congregation last month and emerged as a hotspot of the coronavirus disease. Even three days after the spurt happened, the district administration is yet to complete contact tracking of all the Covid-10 patients. Commissioner, Indore division, Akash Tripathi said: “We are trying to know as to how many persons came in contact with Covid-19 positive cases to identify and screen such people. But we are yet to know as to whom it all started from.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-spread-worries-swirl-in-mp-s-covid-hotspot-indore/story-iqpFtGfmA4XqKscz4JwAYP.html
05-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||This is the 18th instalment of this column. Like the two other instalments that have come on Sundays, today’s was to have focused on how Covid-19, the coronavirus disease, would affect individuals (on the two previous Sundays, the column looked at how Covid-19 would change countries and companies). That will have to wait – although it’s an important topic. The pandemic, the lockdowns, the havoc that has been wrought on communities and economies – all of it has forced people to ask fundamental questions of themselves. And so, even as many will be forced to change how they live and how they work because their companies will ask them to go – unless India, like France, gives companies a good reason to not fire people – there will be others who decide it is time to change how they live and where they work (or vice versa, or both).It will have to wait because – Gattaca.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOver the past few days, there’s been a lot of talk of the antibody test for Covid-19, and how the widespread use of this test could help get people back to work quickly (and get the wheels of economies chugging). WFH is all fine, but there’s a lot of stuff that can’t be done from home. In Italy, a debate is raging on who can and should be allowed to work. Veneto, one of the provinces of the country (Venice is located in it), is mulling antibody tests for health care workers, and then, everyone else. Those who are found to possess antibodies (of the kind that indicate they have had the disease; another kind simply shows that they are still fighting the disease -- at least that’s the theory) will be allowed back to work. Those who do not, even if they have never been infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19 will not be – simply because the risk that they could get infected in a second wave of infections is too high.Italy isn’t the only country speaking this language. Last week, The Guardian reported, quoting the country’s health secretary Matt Hancock, that the UK is considering so-called immunity passports – certificates, based on antibody testing, that show that people have antibodies against Covid-19, which means they have had the disease – as a way to decide who gets to go back to work. The Guardian also reported that the idea seems to be derived from Germany, where researchers are readying a large-scale study to decide, again, based on immunity, who gets to be exempt from lockdown restrictions.Also Read: Biomedical waste from quarantine homes remain a potential hazardOther countries will also have to do this – even as researchers everywhere try and answer questions about antibody testing, which is less expensive, and also much less complicated than the PCR tests used to identify cases of Covid-19. Antibody testing is also based on bloodwork – something every neighbourhood path lab in India knows how to do.An announcement on antibody testing in India is imminent, HT’s health editor tells me. Its usage here is likely to be different – in clusters, to identify those with infections (although the antibodies show up after a lag, usually), rather than as a way to decide who is safe, and who isn’t.Which brings us to Gattaca, perhaps the best science-fiction movie ever made. It revolves around eugenics and the ethics of it and is set in a world where certain jobs are reserved for genetically superior people (called the valids). The others, the invalids, are not allowed to perform such jobs. One can argue that immunity passports are more about protection than reservation, but it is likely, if they are adopted, that they will be used not just to decide who gets to work, but also who gets to travel, and, perhaps, do other things as well. The world will now be divided between those who are immune to the coronavirus and those who are not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-n64LltiISkBSjBWOU4gmHJ.html
05-04-2020||India||Untraced foreigners could spread coronavirus, experts fear||Early this week when the security establishment and health workers were close to completing the evacuation of 2,300 people from the Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters in central Delhi, investigations led the police to conclude that there were more foreigners who attended the gathering organised by the missionary group who were staying in different mosques in the national capital. On 31 March, the Delhi Police sent an urgent message to the Delhi Government seeking help to locate the remaining Jamaat workers in the city’s mosques. The police communication listed 16 mosques.Investigators were prepared to find 187 foreigners and two dozen Indian nationals who had shifted to the mosques after attending congregation meetings at the headquarters of the religious sect in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area, an official familiar with the matter said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIt turns out they were horribly wrong.In four days, the combined teams of police, health workers and civil servants widened the net to cover a large number of mosques and have located over 800 foreigners linked to the Jamaat in the national capital. And they still have some distance to cover.“The big fear is that many of them would turn out to be positive cases, and could have already infected many others,” the official added. speaking on condition of anonymity.The Jamaat workers have been placed in multiple government-run quarantine facilities across the national capital. The ones who were found in mosques are yet to be tested. That process is expected to begin in a day or two.A senior official in the Delhi government’s home department confirmed the development but underlined that he couldn’t put a number on the foreigners found. “We are still in the process of getting final reports from the field,” he said on condition of anonymity.Security agencies who pored over the registers for foreigners maintained at the Markaz found 2,100 foreign nationals had touched base after landing in the country between March 1 and 18. Of them, 216 were still at the Jamaat headquarters when the crackdown took place and 824 had already left on missionary work. “We believe that the remaining 900-odd foreigners are mostly hiding in mosques around the city,” an offcial involved in the operation said.This person added that about 100 foreigners were found in mosques in the north-east district, 200 in the south-east district, 170 in the south district and seven in west district. Officials recall that by the time they evacuated the Jamaatis from the Markaz this week, 24 people had already tested positive and nearly 200 had symptoms. The Delhi government hasn’t received all the test reports, but the Markaz-linked cases already make up for two-thirds of all coronavirus patients in Delhi.By Friday evening, Delhi had 445 cases of Covid-19; of these, 301 can be attributed directly to the Jamaat gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/untraced-foreigners-could-spread-coronavirus-experts-fear/story-LcO0kuSNxyIsuMgmGhL4kK.html

Similarly, the district administration in Jajpur sealed off three villages including Brahmabarada village as well as 10 block headquarter towns and four municipal areas to prevent the spread of the deadly virus after a person from the village had tested positive. The man had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi.Meanwhile, the number of those infected by coronavirus in Odisha rose to 21 on Saturday after a 29-years-old man of Kalahandi district tested positive. The man had recently returned from Bahrain, but did not show any symptoms of the disease.Also on Saturday, the Odisha government started passive surveillance of both the government and private healthcare facilities and asked all the hospitals to inform the government about the details of patients suffering from severe acute respiratory infection and influenza. The hospitals have been urged to report all the cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection and Influenza-like Illness to the district Integrated Disease Surveillance Program cell or State IDSP, said Odisha government’s chief spokesperson on Covid-19, Subroto Bagchi.“As there has been a sharp increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases, it has become imperative to strengthen passive surveillance. Any violation shall be viewed seriously including sealing of the facilities and cancellation of licence under the Clinical Establishment Act.

05-04-2020||India||Scientists write musical notation on coronavirus protein||In times of social isolation, many are turning to the soothing notes of classical music, but for scientists, it might provide a new method to study the virus that has brought the world to its knees.Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have translated the spike protein of Sars-Cov-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, into music using a technique called sonification.The audio, posted on SoundCloud in March, is meant to help researchers better understand the structure of the virus, which first emerged in China late last year and has infected more than a million people across the world in just over three months.Over time, this audio format could help create drugs or find an antibody that can counter the virus’s effect, scientists say.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAt the heart of the experiment is the spike protein -- the component on the surface of the virus that gives it a crown-like appearance and the name coronavirus (‘corona’ meaning ‘crown’ in Latin). This protein is what binds the pathogen to host cells, often predominantly in the lungs. Its structure and relationship with the cell it infects is instrumental in understanding how the virus attacks the human body.But why choose music over conventional methods of mapping the virus?“Our brains are great at processing sound. We would need a high-powered microscope to see the equivalent detail in an image, and we could never see it all at once. Sound is such an elegant way to access the information stored in a protein,” Markus J Buehler, the MIT professor at the helm of the project, told the university’s on-campus publication, MIT News, on Thursday.“We might also use a compositional approach to design drugs to attack the virus. We could search for a new protein that matches the melody and rhythm of an antibody capable of binding to the spike protein, interfering with its ability to infect,” Buehler added.There is also a larger metaphor that shows why scientists are keen to translate the virus’s structure into sound. The “pleasing, relaxing sounds” convey the “deceitful nature of the virus, which hijacks the body” to exploit it, wrote Buehler in his description for the nearly two-hour long audio, ‘Viral counterpoint of the coronavirus spike protein’, that he posted on the music sharing platform, SoundCloud.The process of sonification involves assigning amino acids that make up a protein to corresponding sounds by transposing their natural frequencies on a note in a specific musical scale. Other aspects of the protein are represented by altering the volume and duration of the notes, giving it rhythm.Artificial intelligence algorithms are used to convert these musical scores into a composition that displays the “innate relationship” between amino acid and the protein structure, according to a methodology released on American Chemical Society (ACS) Publications by researchers Chi-Hua Yu, Zhao Qin, Francisco J Martin-Martinez and Markus J Buehler, who suggested the broad guidelines of the process of sonification. This isn’t the first time microbiological data has been perceived through sound. A 2017 study converted information stored in a DNA sequence into music, which, it argued, could help the scientific community analyse its complex structure and any mutation that might occur. Last month, a UK-based artist released a track titled ‘Sound of Covid-19’, albeit with no such scientific utility: the artist said the notes were a conversion of the genome sequence of Sars-Cov-2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-write-musical-notation-on-virus-protein/story-BBJ36dRM4RCx8S3mD19xEP.html
05-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: New plan holds clues to unlocking country||A Union health ministry plan has outlined how regions — cities, villages or neighbourhoods — with large outbreaks or multiple clusters of the coronavirus disease Covid-19 could be walled in, charting out what may be the first official road map to keep the disease in check by focussing curbs and surveillance on hot spots while other areas return to some degree of normalcy once the nationwide lockdown ends later this month.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe strategy is based on lessons from the 2009 outbreak of the H1N1 influenza pandemic which, according to the report, had a bigger impact on “well-connected big cities with substantive population movement” while rural areas and smaller towns with low population and poor connectivity reported only few cases. “The current geographic distribution of Covid-19 mimics the distribution of H1N1 pandemic influenza. This suggests that while the spread of Covid-19 in our population could be high, it’s unlikely that it will be uniformly affecting all parts of the country. This calls for differential approach to different regions of the country, while mounting a strong containment effort in hot spots,” said the health ministry’s containment plan for large outbreaks. Also Watch | Health Ministry’s plan to unlock lockdown, musical version of COVID-19: Top 5 stories from HTAlso Read: India Inc awaits fiscal push from Centre to keep afloatThe road map is meant to tackle the third most serious scenario of the outbreak in the country. The first, and the mildest scenario, is when cases are limited to those who have travelled. Second is when cases are spread locally. The third scenario is when there are large clusters, while the remaining two are, when there is widespread community transmission and, the most severe, when India becomes endemic for Covid-19. Actions for mitigation phase -- a scenario when focus must shift to management of cases instead of containing the outbreak -- will be dealt under a separate plan, the report added.“The large outbreak in India is still amenable to containment. All states have put in place aggressive containment measures, and we haven’t reached that stage where the outbreak is uncontrolled,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting anonymity. At present, there are 21 clusters in nine regions that are under a close watch for outbreaks. While there are no rigid thresholds set for what defines a “large outbreak” or how many clusters make the cut, an official aware of the plan cited Delhi’s Nizamuddin neighbourhood, Rajasthan’s Bhilwara and Kerala’s Kasargod as examples of what will be considered for the containment plan. Nizamuddin is home to the Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters, which has contributed about two-thirds of Delhi’s 445 infections. Bhilwara accounts for 27 of Rajasthan’s 200 cases and Kasargod 136 of Kerala’s 306 infections. “That’s what is being done at the ground level from where a large number of cases are being reported. Most of our cases still can be traced back to international travel and the percentage where contacts have not been traced yet is too small to cause panic,” the official quoted above added.According to the plan, a hot spot will be divided into zones: the quarantine zone and a buffer zone around it. The quarantine zone will be where most of the cases are focussed, while the buffer will include certain blocks or districts around it, as decided by authorities on a case-to-case basis.For both zones, access– particularly outbound travel – will be cut off and all movement of vehicles and public transport will be halted, with exceptions only for those with special passes meant to enable essential services. “Thermal screening, IEC (inform-educate-communicate: a strategy to raise awareness on risks and consequences) shall be carried out at all entry and exit points,” the plan says.Schools and colleges will be closed, mass gatherings will be banned and people will be encouraged to stay indoors for the first 28 days in both zones, the document states, adding: “based on the risk assessment and indication of successful containment operations, an approach of staggered work and market hours may be put into practice.”These measures will be paired with increased disease surveillance: more random tests on hospitalised cases, testing of all suspected cases, isolation of patients and quarantine of contacts.The testing criteria, however, remains the same. All symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the past 14 days, all symptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases, all symptomatic health care workers, all hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in contact. The testing will continue till 14 days from the date the last confirmed case is declared negative by laboratory test, says the document.According to experts, such strategies are crucial because it is not possible to keep a country as huge as India under perpetual lockdown and a blanket withdrawal is not advisable at this stage of transmission. “The aim behind implementing the lockdown in the first place was to buy more time to better prepare the country for likely surge in cases, therefore, areas from where unusually high number of cases is being reported, what are called as hot spots, those should still remain under lockdown as these are sensitive areas that can change the entire scenario if left unattended. These are vulnerable pockets and need special government focus, else it can defeat the whole purpose behind country’s efforts towards flattening the transmission curve,” said Pradip Chakraborty, senior advisor, Centre for Public Health and Food Safety. The containment strategy is similar to what has been used in China, the ground zero for the outbreak. Wuhan, a city of about 11 million people from where the virus is believed to have begun spreading in late December and affected the largest number of people within the country, was put under a strict curfew. The curbs were gradually relaxed, but movement restrictions have not been removed entirely.Among some new measures, the health ministry report suggests local administrations must ensure “supply of enough triple layer masks to households in the containment and buffer zones to be distributed through visiting surveillance teams”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-plan-holds-clues-to-unlocking-country/story-SuNkpmmyaDy2zEU4u0E77O.html
05-04-2020||India||‘Cannot do selective evacuation of stranded Indians from Covid-19 affected countries,’ says minister||Minister of state for external affairs (MEA) and parliamentary affairs, V Muraleedharan, spoke to Hindustan Times about brings Indians back from abroad, foreigners stranded in India, and relief being sent by India to other countries, among other issues.MEA had a daunting task of evacuating Indian citizens from overseas. How did you go about it?A lot of Indians who were abroad have been brought home; the last such flight came from Iran. We have been carrying out evacuations, but since international travel has stalled, and there is a lockdown in India, we have through our high commissions and embassies ensured that food and other necessities of people of Indian origin are taken care of. In fact there are between 700-800 Indians abroad who are infected by the virus, even their needs are being taken care of.We get a lot of emails and requests from people who want to come home, some are unwell, some have bereavements in their families, but since international travel is affected so we cannot do selective evacuation. Embassies and high commissions have been asked to step up; they have also been helping people whose visas have expired. It is not their job, but they are helping people renew their visas as well.How is India helping in the relocation of foreign nationals stranded across the country?For foreign nationals who are in India, we have already started a portal where they can register and we can plan for their evacuation. A lot of people from countries such as Germany, the UK and the US have already been evacuated. Governments of some countries sought our help in getting their nationals who were stuck in distant places to reach the airports in Mumbai, Delhi or Kochi; that assistance we could provide after coordinating with the home ministry and the local police - we helped them reach the airport from where they could then be evacuated to their respective countries.How exactly is India helping other countries? We’ve sent help to Maldives…Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been in discussion with heads of states; he had a meeting with the members of the Saarc nations and G20; he also spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday (expert teams of the two countries will actively share information on measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus as well as about ongoing research on treatment and vaccines.) Union Minister for external affairs S Jaishankar has also spoken to his US counterpart Mike Pompeo (on how to combat the international crisis, including strengthening global pharmaceutical and healthcare manufacturing and supply chains). The PM also addressed the heads of 130 missions. Wherever we can offer help and provide assistance, we’re going to do that.What is the status of relief efforts by India to the neighbouring countries?Being a member of Saarc, PM Modi has already announced the setting up of a Covid-19 emergency fund with India making an initial contribution of $10 million. Countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives have already made the contributions. These countries are again collaborating in whatever ways to fight the pandemic.What is the initial assessment of the lockdown?The overall impact has been good because people have appreciated the decisive action of the PM. Because of his address on TV, a lot of people understood the seriousness of the situation. His word carries weight and people have faith in him.The economic impact is an important issue, and the second is the migration of workers. The government will have to work on these. Some groups [of exporters] have had a discussion with the commerce minister pointing out how India could lose markets if restricted resumption of services export services is not started. But we will all have to bear the impact of the pandemic. However, some international financial agencies have said that except China, India and Indonesia, which will have growth in the whole financial year, other countries will be in recession. The challenges now are to ensure that the delivery of essential goods is carried without any hiccups. The railways,for instance, is transporting all essential goods, but the workers to carry the load may not be permitted by the police to leave their homes. We will have to find a way out; those in the government and in the police, particularly at the lower levels, will have to be a bit more discerning and understand the nuances of the lockdown.There was criticism from the Opposition that Parliament should have been adjourned earlier?Parliament was on because at that moment there was a sense that adjourning the House will create a situation of panic. The Prime Minister had said ‘no’ to panic and ‘yes’ to precautions. We had already taken steps such as banning visitors from Parliament. The message was that life has to go on but with precautions. After the “Janta curfew” on Marcch 22, and when an escalation of cases began, it was decided that there will be a locked down. After the Lok Sabha passed the finance Bill on March 23, a lockdown was announced on the 24th, in that way the timing was perfect; it was neither too late nor too early.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/get-a-lot-of-emails-and-requests-cannot-do-selective-evacuation-v-muraleedharan/story-DECv8ZhX7mYzXUafCS7ssO.html
05-04-2020||India||1,023 Covid-19 cases across 17 states linked to Jamaat: Centre||At least 1,023 cases of Covid-19 in India are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi, the Union health ministry announced on Saturday, adding that authorities had traced nearly 22,000 other people who were connected to the religious event that has emerged as the biggest hot spot of the infection in the country. At a briefing ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said infections linked to the event were found in 17 states and that primary contacts of the 22,000 people had been placed in quarantine. “Around 30% of the total cases so far are linked to one particular place where we could not sort of understand it and manage it,” he said.The congregation of the Islamic missionary group at its six-storey headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin saw people trickling in and out for weeks, and came to light late on Saturday when officials began evacuating hundreds from the building. By that time, many people had already gone back to their homes, forcing many state governments to call in the police and paramilitary forces to ferret people out of villages. Prominent religious and political leaders have also appealed any attendees to contact local health authorities. Among the worst hit is Tamil Nadu, which now has the second highest infection count in the country (485) after Maharashtra. All but one of the 74 new cases reported in the southern state on Saturday were linked to the event. In Uttar Pradesh, 47 of the 55 fresh Covid-19 cases were members of the Jamaat who attended the congregation, additional secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi and principal secretary, Health and Family Welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said at a joint press conference in Lucknow. The state police identified 1,302 Jamaat members and 1,000 have been quarantined. The statewide search drive of the Tabligi Jamaat members is continuing, said Kumar.In Andhra Pradesh, the government declared that 1,085 people had attended the conference, of which 946 people had been identified and tested. At least 108 had tested positive for Covid-19. Another 626 persons came in contact with the attendees and 32 of them contracted the virus. “In all, 140 out of 161 positive cases in the state were related to Tablighi Jamaat meeting directly and indirectly,” a release from the state government said. The details of the remaining persons related to Jamaat incident are yet to be revealed.In Assam, 24 of the 25 patients visited the Jamaat event last month. “It is unfortunate that daily we are getting fresh inputs about more and more people from the state who had visited the congregation. I would appeal to the district and state level functionaries of Tablighi Jamaat in Assam to give us the entire list of attendees voluntarily,” said Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. “We have not got the kind of response we expected from them. If we don’t get all the information within Sunday we might be forced to ask the police to get involved in tracing them,” he added.In Odisha, where the government has imposed a harsh lockdown in several cities, three of the 28 people from the state who attended the Jamaat have tested positive. A worried Odisha government has now asked anyone who attended the event to come forward voluntarily and get tested in the next 24 hours. A senior government official said 68 persons from Odisha, including several African nationals, attended the event last month.On Saturday, Uttarakhand police said it had identified 708 Jamaat followers and quarantined 673 of them. “In the case of 383 Jamaatis from our state, 26 didn’t return and are quarantined in Delhi only. Here, 285 of them have been put in institutional quarantine and 72 in home quarantine. Soon the ones in home quarantine would also be put in institutional quarantine,” said Ashok Kumar, director general (law & order), Uttarakhand police.Three Jamaat members were among 11 tested positive in Kerala on Saturday, said state health minister KK Shailaja. In Bengal, the government has not disclosed whether any state resident visited the Delhi event but the Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT) said on Saturday that a man working at Haldia port, who went to the Nizamuddin Markaz, tested positive for Covid-19. The man is an employee of one of KopT’s contractors at the port. KoPT said officers who might have had any kind of contact with the patient had been quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-023-cases-across-17-states-linked-to-jamaat-centre/story-pdlVxSMu5Yf2909kWycIoN.html
05-04-2020||India||Bengal undecided on allowing jute mills to operate||KOLKATA: A day after the ministry of food and public distribution wrote to the West Bengal government, requesting them to immediately direct the jute mills to start operations to meet the increased demand of jute bales, the state government remained undecided on Saturday.Bengal is the country’s biggest hub of jute industry and about 60 mills in the sector directly employ nearly 2 lakh people. Another 40 lakh jute growers are dependent on orders from the industry. “We have received no instruction from the state government yet. Earlier in March, we too had written to the state government, urging it to allow us to function. We hope a decision would be arrived at on Monday,” said Raghavendra Gupta, chairman of Indian Jute Mills Association.Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha did not respond to questions sent via text messages and WhatsApp asking if the government had taken any decision in this regard. Labour minister Malay Ghatak did not take repeated calls.Jute Commissioner of India (JCI) Moloy Chandan Chakraborty said he did not receive any communication from the state government asking the mills to start functioning. The food and public distribution ministry’s letter to the West Bengal chief secretary was also marked to the JCI. In his letter to the chief secretary, dated April 3, E K Majhi, additional secretary at the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution wrote that the government of Punjab and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had stated about shortage of jute bales due to the nonfunctioning of the jute mills since the beginning of the lockdown in March.“It is of utmost importance that jute mills immediately resume their operations for manufacturing/dispatch of jute bales to meet the requirements of the State Procurement Agencies/FCI,” Majhi wrote.“I shall, therefore, earnestly request your indulgence to direct jute mills to immediately start manufacturing/ supply of jute bales so that during the peak procurement period, procurement operations of government are not disrupted due to shortage of jute bags,” the letter said.It also stated that there could be additional requirements of jute bales this year.Jute is one of Bengal’s largest labour-intensive industries and the mills are located in the districts around Kolkata – Howrah, Hooghly, North 24-Parganas and South 24-Parganas.A senior government officer posted at the state secretariat said on Saturday, requesting anonymity, that the state government wanted to have an informal discussion with leaders of prominent trade unions before asking to start operations.“We do not want to pressurize the state government. It is a sensitive situation, where a fine balance needs to be struck between procurement of food and safety of mill workers. The state has been advised and we hope they would arrive at the best judgment,” said a senior official at the ministry of textile who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-undecided-on-allowing-jute-mills-to-operate/story-VN2JklGcvpGsbFIljhqRaM.html
05-04-2020||India||Welfare schemes, well-oiled PDS helping Tamil Nadu’s poor||It is either vattams (circle) or kattams (square). Hemalatha, 38, has stood in both shapes — chalk-drawn on the road to help people maintain distance — while waiting her turn to pick up rations from the fair-price shop in Usilampatti in Madurai district. “My father is over 60 so we got an SMS saying that we should stay home and we will be given a token which will specify the date and time on which we have to line up outside the ration shop,” she told Hindustan Times. “Before us the residents of the next street were asked to line up. It is done in an orderly way.”Hemalatha, who works as an assistant project officer at the Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihoods Missions, said that two volunteers of a local self help group are deputed to a ration shop each morning. They are provided gloves, masks and sanitisers and they must ensure that people in the queue maintain adequate distance. There are also notices by the government on how to wash hands thoroughly, and the sanitation workers sprinkle bleaching powder in neighbourhoods and roads regularly, she said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThough 31 out of Tamil Nadu’s 37 districts have been affected by Covid-19 cases — the updated total on Saturday was 485 — the state has largely been able to avoid a humanitarian crisis largely due to the containment strategy it put in place after over 1000 persons who attended a religious conference of the Tablighi Jamaat in New Delhi, returned. More importantly, a well-oiled public distribution system and well-supplied social welfare schemes of the state have been able to help residents, particularly those with livelihoods at stake, during the 21-day national lockdown.Hours before Tamil Nadu went into lockdown mode, on March 24, the government announced a Rs 3280 crore special relief package which included Rs 1000 cash assistance to each rice ration card holder, construction worker and autorickshaw driver. Those with “rice” ration cards were also promised free rice, lentils, palm oil and sugar for April. Based on socio-economic vulnerability, the state provides five types of smart ration cards. The relief measures apply to all those who have ration cards to avail rice in both priority and non-priority households. However, those who do not want to avail the service can give it up by indicating their choice online. More than 20.1 million ration card holders were covered in the Covid-19 relief announced by the government, a senior official at the TN Civil Supplies Department said on condition of anonymity.“All the beneficiaries will get cash support at their door and tokens will be issued to collect food grains from allotted fair price shops in a staggered manner. We are ensuring that up to 100 tokens are issued per day and people are given date and time in their tokens,” he said. “We are also providing doorstep delivery for those who are home quarantined since they cannot come to the shops. There is a separate team that is involved. All government employees have been reorganised to complete this task,” he added.All 35,244 ration shops in the state are operated by the government.“No private agents [are involved in the operation] like in states such as Uttar Pradesh or Maharashtra. From procurement from Food Corporation of India to sending it to different godowns at the district level, and then from there to fair price shops, [all of] it is done quite smoothly. It is easier to coordinate passing of information, and each transaction at the point of sales devices is captured in real time,” the senior official said.Besides the PDS system, Amma Canteens provide subsidised food said J. Jeyaranjan, director of the Institute of Development Alternatives. The canteens were launched by former chief minister J. Jayalalithaa in 2013, and offer cooked food is offered at heavily subsidized prices. For instance, an idli costs one rupee, Pongal (a mix of rice and lentil) costs Rs 5 and curd rice is available for Rs 3. “The point is the system is in place. While previously you would have seen 200 people visiting the Amma Canteen, now it is 600-700 people. The advantage is, you don’t have to invent something new to manage the crisis but you will need to pump in [more supplies],” he explained .There is “faith” in the system that it will work, Kripa Ananthpur, associate professor, Madras Institute of Development Studies, said. “For me the fact that migrant workers are not fleeing the state is an indicator that things are working,” she said. In the past week, the state also created containment zones to tackle the return of 1103 persons who attended the Tablighi Jamaat conference in New Delhi in mid-March. Many of them identified themselves promptly. For the past four days, the number of persons who have tested positive in the state has been driven by conference attendees.State health secretary Dr. Beela Rajesh announced that a detailed containment plan involves intense contact tracing: the attendees of the conference, their family members, their primary contacts are being investigated and tested. Health workers are also visiting homes in the area and checking for symptoms of Covid-19. The areas are also being cordoned off and movement is restricted. “Five kilometres is earmarked as a containment zone and two kilometres as a buffer zone. This is restricted and cordoned off by police and for each containment zone we have assigned staff including an anganwadi worker,” a senior official from the National Health Mission, Tamil Nadu, said. A doctor is put in charge of four zones, and can get a snapshot of prevalence of upper respiratory tract infections. “The moment a positive person is identified, he is isolated to a Covid-19 ward. Apart from that close contacts are brought to a facility’s quarantine.” Already 21 hospitals have been identified as Covid-19 treatment facilities in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/welfare-schemes-well-oiled-pds-helping-tn-poor/story-HgNMVaFI96sEHS71iU5YHO.html
05-04-2020||India||‘Aggressive testing, tracing those infected is key’: South Korean envoy||Aggressive testing among those at high risk, tracing people infected by the Coronavirus and quarantining them is key to preventing the mass spread of Covid-19, South Korean ambassador Shin Bong-kil said.South Korea’s 3T or “test, trace and treat” policy figured in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference with 130 Indian envoys on Monday as one of few successful approaches to tackling the spread of the virus. Shin said the situation is his country had stabilised, with the number of new confirmed cases showing a steady decline and fluctuating around 100 a day.“The Korean government’s Covid-19 control strategy consists of robust testing to identify confirmed cases, tracing their contacts to prevent further spread, and treating those infected at the earliest possible stage,” Shin said in an interview with HT.South Korea’s current diagnostic testing capacity is up to 15,000 tests per day. While it has performed more than 400,000 tests, it continues to test at near-full capacity, he said. Identifying and isolating the contagion and treatment in the early stages is the only viable method because no vaccine is available, he said.Asked if the “test, trace and treat” can be applied in India, which has a much larger population, Shin replied: “In India’s case, the lockdown of the entire nation was a necessary step considering India’s sheer size and demographic. However, in order to prevent mass spread of the virus, it is important to identify those at high risk, carry out aggressive testing, then trace those infected by the virus and quarantine them.”More than half of South Korea’s more than 9,600 cases were traced to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, and Shin said his country had faced a mass outbreak in the initial stage “due to a gathering of a religious congregation in” a province. “The Korean government acquired the list of all members of the religious organisation and aggressively proceeded to test and quarantine them. We were thus successful in controlling the spread of the virus at an early stage,” he said.Shin said the South Korean government was prepared to fully share all information and insights garnered from its fight against Covid-19 with India. “President Moon Jae-in and Prime Minister Modi exchanged ideas through the virtual G20 Summit,” he added.In the long run, South Korea and India, with their advanced information technology, bio and pharmaceutical industries, can cooperate in research and development in the fight against virus-related diseases, he said.Shin also expressed the hope that the Indian government will take speedy steps to address the concerns of South Korean firms once the 21-day lockdown ends.“As you are well aware, Korean companies such as Samsung, LG, Hyundai and Kia closed their plants due to the lockdown…Well aligned with the ‘Make in India’ policy, our companies have invested heavily in the country and a complete shutdown incurs massive losses for them,” he said.“Once the shutdown is lifted, new personnel will have to be dispatched for handling new equipment and installing new facilities. I hope the authorities expedite visas for engineers from Korea who wish to enter India.”Shin said a crisis often “leads to chance” and “India must not lose the opportunity to emerge as a world top manufacturing hub”.With hundreds of South Korean nationals stranded in India, Shin said a special Korean Air flight is expected to evacuate residents and tourists who desire to return in the first weekend of April. “Further evacuation will be dependent on the future pandemic situation and the status of the shutdown, which is currently imposed till April 15,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aggressive-testing-tracing-those-infected-is-key-korean-envoy/story-3Gsk91Cou7N0LrekzLtMwO.html
05-04-2020||India||Exposure to coronavirus needs to be digitally traced||The spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid) is too rapid to be contained by the traditional manual contact tracing of infected people, a new study has concluded, calling for digital and phone-based methods to control the contagion at scale. The study, conducted by professors at the University of Oxford and published in the journal Science, also flagged significant concerns around privacy and ethics and urged governments to be transparent and constitute an independent board to oversee the use of such invasive techniques. “Our analysis suggests that almost half of coronavirus transmissions occur in the very early phase of infection, before symptoms appear, so we need a fast and effective mobile app for alerting people who have been exposed. Our mathematical modelling suggests that traditional public health contact tracing methods are too slow to keep up with this virus,” said Christophe Fraser of Oxford University’s Big Data Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, and one of the authors of the study. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe paper has been published at a time when India is experiencing a surge in infections – the number has almost tripled in five days – and governments have pressed the local police, district administrations and even anti-terror squads to trace people who attended or have come into contact with those who attended an Islamic congregation in March in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin, which has emerged as the biggest hotspot of Covid-19 in the country. The government has linked at least 647 cases of the infection to the congregation, attended by delegates from overseas and all over India. In the study, scientists use a mathematical model of infectiousness through four routes of transmission: symptomatic (known contact with someone exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms), pre-symptomatic (contact with someone before symptoms showed up), asymptomatic (direct transmission from individuals who never experienced symptoms), and environmental (when direct close contact is not known).In the model, the scientists assume that the threshold for stopping the spread of the epidemic is to reduce the reproduction number (R) – the number of people one patient can infect – to below one. This would mean that each Covid-19 patient would infect less than one person, and the disease would eventually die out. The model of infection spread is assumed to be exponential – as has been witnessed in several countries.The scientists found that instantaneous contact tracing significantly improved the chances of containing the epidemic and reducing R to below 1, while a delay of three days – typically associated with manual contact tracing – led to the probability nearing zero. To be sure, this assumed that no other parameters – such as weather or medical intervention – were involved in the situation.“At the current stage of the epidemic, contact tracing can no longer be performed effectively by public health officials in the UK, and many countries across Europe, as coronavirus is spreading too rapidly. Our research of early data from other countries shows that patient histories are incomplete - we don’t know the details of the person we sat next to on the bus,” said David Bonsall from Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Medicine and one of the study’s authors. The scientists suggested the use of a mobile phone app that keeps a temporary record of proximity between individuals so that it can immediately alert close contacts of diagnosed cases and prompt them to self-isolate. The paper also proposed an algorithm by which instantaneous signals, carrying details of proximity and location, are transmitted to and from a central server, which also receives coronavirus diagnoses. This enables recommendation of risk-stratified quarantine and physical distancing measures in those known to be possible contacts – similar to the measures undertaken by South Korea after a 61-year-old woman attended a church congregation and ended up infecting close to 5,000 people. “To work, this approach needs to be integrated into a national programme, not taken on by independent app developers. If we can securely deploy this technology, the more people that opt-in, the faster the epidemic will stop, and the more lives can be saved,” Bonsall said. But the paper flags significant ethical and privacy concerns and stresses the need to avoid coercive surveillance. It calls for oversight by an independent advisory board, a transparent algorithm, data protection and sharing of knowledge. “People should be democratically entitled to decide whether to adopt this platform. The intention is not to impose the technology as a permanent change to society, but we believe under these pandemic circumstances it is necessary and justified to protect public health,” the study said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exposure-needs-to-be-digitally-traced/story-30JJuHxqN91v6ovAF97gfP.html
05-04-2020||India||EC defers legislative council polls in UP, Bihar in view of coronavirus lockdown||The Election Commission (EC) has deferred elections for the legislative councils of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in view of the lockdown due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The elections were to be held for eight legislative council seats in Bihar and 11 legislative council seats in UP. In Bihar, four of the seats are in graduates’ constituencies, in that graduates of the particular constituency will be allowed to vote. The remaining four are in teachers’ constituencies, in that only full-time teachers in a particular constituency will be eligible to vote. While the tenures of the incumbents only end on May 6, the EC, in a statement issued Friday, has stated that it requires at least four weeks, “subject to holidays, to complete the statutory activities, as prescribed in the Representation of the People Act.” The EC statement points out that the electoral process involves the “movement and gathering of polling officials, agents of political parties, support officials and electors on the poll day, which may put public safety at risk and create public health hazard”. Given the lockdown, the statement adds that “continuing with the electoral process in the current environment may not be feasible in view of the restrictions for the maintenance of public safety and avoiding health hazards”. “Now, therefore, the Commission invoking its powers under Article 324 of the Constitution of India read with Section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, hereby orders that the process of elections to the above-mentioned seats shall be initiated at a later date after reviewing the situation,” the statement concludes. The Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council has 100 seats. At present, it has a strength of 99, while one seat is vacant. Bihar, on the other hand, has 75 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-defers-legislative-council-polls-in-up-bihar/story-TUUySpDpR8uYMnh9SQGuNN.html
05-04-2020||India||Biomedical waste from quarantined homes remains a potential hazard||Thousands of people across India have been advised by doctors to stay in home quarantine for 14 days on suspicion that they could be potential carriers of the deadly coronavirus disease (Covid-19), . Some states have already set up a system to collect the biomedical waste generated by the quarantined households, but others seem to be lagging behind.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has tagged this waste – face masks and gloves - “domestic hazardous waste” and issued guidelines on how to handle it. But till date, much of the biomedical waste is getting the same treatment as solid domestic waste instead of being disposed of at Common Biomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facilities (CBWTFs).Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThis, experts say, is dangerous because it increase the risk of the disease spreading; many people who were home-quarantined were detected with the virus at a later stage. The CPCB’s guidelines say that such waste should be collected from doorsteps in yellow bags which are to be provided by the authorities. Civic bodies should engage a dedicated team of trained workers equipped with protective gear for the doorstep collection. The authorities need to maintain a list of such homes. In Himachal Pradesh, the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC) has set up a trained task force for door-to-door collection. They workers are provided with N95 masks and sanitizers.“The quarantined houses are informed before we go for collection. They are provided with yellow garbage bags, disinfectants and gloves. The garbage collector puts the yellow bag inside another bag which is sealed and sent for disposal,” said Surekha Cohpda, the district health officer.In Madhya Pradesh, too, a system has been set in place for home collection but sometime citizens raise objections when vehicles enter the neighbourhood to collect biomedical waste.“When we go for door-to-door collection with vehicles, some people raise objections. They fear that the vehicle may spread germs even though the entire process is done in a scientific manner,” said Deepak Shah, adviser to the MP Nursing Home Association, which manages the biomedical incinerators.In West Bengal, where more than 50,000 people are under home quarantine, the authorities seem to be lagging behind in putting such a system in place .“In West Bengal the mechanism to collect and dispose biomedical waste from hospitals is run by the health department. The civic bodies are no way associated with this,” said Subrata Gupta, secretary of the urban development department.Although top health officials including the secretary and the director of health services didn’t take calls, one of the CBWTFs said the health department had not issued any directions for collection of biomedical waste from till date.“We have been asked to collect biomedical waste only from hospitals. We have not received any orders to collect such waste from doorstep or provide yellow bags to houses,” said Krishnendu Dutta, deputy general manager (operations) at Medicare Environmental Management, which runs three CBWTFs in West Bengal.In Bihar, although officials claimed that biomedical waste was being properly collected and disposed according to the guidelines laid down by the government, an official of a waste disposal agency, requesting anonymity, said there were many loopholes in the disposal of waste generated by quarantine centres set up in villages.“Initially we faced some problem but now things have been streamlined,” said Krunesh Garg, member-secretary of the Punjab Pollution Control Board, adding that the board had distributed double-layered, yellow-colour bags for collection of waste. Separate sanitation staff has been deputed for collections of the waste.In Rajasthan, the authorities are still trying to put a system in place. “The state pollution board will be collecting the data related to biomedical waste. The health and the local-self-government department have to share a list of Covid-19 related facilities by Saturday along with how much of the biomedical waste is collected. We are bringing the system in place,” said Shailaja Deval, member-secretary of the Rajastha pollution control board.Experts like Satish Sinha, associate director at Toxics Link, an NGO working on waste management, doubt that the guidelines of the CPCB and state pollution control boards are being properly implemented on the ground.“The guidelines seem good on paper. But I have serious doubts of what is happening on the ground. Instead of creating a separate team by ULBs {urban local bodies} for collection, which needs to be trained, the task of collection from houses should be handled by the CBWTFs,” Sinha said. “They have the expertise and were doing the job of collection and disposal of waste generated by hospitals. The biomedical waste generated at homes is no different. They have the same virus and could be a threat. It is just that the generation points have increased.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biomedical-waste-from-quarantined-homes-remains-a-potential-hazard/story-h7O30krjzoDxBx60TPl9aL.html
05-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: How pool testing can enhance speed, scale||The ministry of health and family welfare evaluated this week a testing methodology that could significantly expand its testing capacity, although it is yet to take a final call in the matter. The methodology is pool or pooled testing, which involves simultaneously testing a combined sample from multiple people from a household or a local cluster to widen reach and speed up results.Used during large outbreaks and invisible community transmission, such as of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, this method is now being used to detect shards of the unique genetic material called RNA of Sars-COv2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicCovid-19 has infected at least 151,000 people and killed 61,000.The method uses the highly accurate real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in a combined sample from several people. If a combined sample comes back positive, each person in the group is isolated and tested separately.Researchers from Israel have demonstrated that testing combined samples from up 64 people for Covid-19 significantly speeded up results, brought down cost and fast-tracked contact tracing, while reducing the workload on labs.Germany, which has the lowest death rates in Europe, increased testing from 40,000 tests per day to 200,000 to 400,000 tests without compromising accuracy.“The pool testing has no influence on the detection limit. In the case of a positive mini-pool result, individual testing is carried out in previously reserved samples. The positive sample can then be identified within four hours,” according to researchers from German Red Cross Blood Donor Service in Frankfurt and the Institute for Medical Virology at the University Hospital Frankfurt at Goethe University. “The more people who can be reliably tested for SARS-CoV-2, the faster the pandemic can be curbed,” said Birgitta Wolff president of Goethe University.India evaluated pooled testing as a method to scale up testing capacity, but did not include the method in its new testing protocol issued on April 4.“Efforts to increase test capacity by the ‘pooling’ of samples are being evaluated. This is not simple and needs the development and testing of optimization algorithms so that one positive in a large pool is not missed, for example,” India’s principal scientific adviser K VijayRaghavan said on Twitter a week ago.India has tested just tested 75,000 people for Covid-19, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research, a fraction of its population size of 1.36 billion people.“India’s testing capacity is a key bottleneck. So far, only around 75,000 people have been tested, with confirmatory results from National Institute of Virology in Pune taking three to four days,” said a public health specialist, requesting anonymity.“It’s a pity because pooled testing detects viral RNA in samples very accurately and helps maximise existing resources. For Covid-19, swab samples from mucous membranes of the nose or throat are combined in a buffer solution, which are then tested using the highly accurate RT-PCR. It can really save costs,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-mulls-new-testing-approach/story-eD4ZiGlrdaynBRPSebpJoO.html

The family’s youngest child, a 9-year-old girl who suffers from a rare neurological ailment, is stuck in home quarantine with her maid. The man travelled to Accra, Ghana, on March 9 on a business trip. His 43-year-old wife started developing symptoms from March 19. Despite being informed twice, Kasturba Gandhi Hospital allegedly refused to run a test on her as she didn’t have any travel history or wasn’t in direct contact with a person who was carrying the pathogen of coronavirus. “She went to a local physician who prescribed her antibiotics which didn’t improve her health condition but did delay the diagnosis. Finally, on March 27, she approached a private laboratory that found her positive with Covid-19,” said the man. She was rushed to Fortis Hospital where she is undergoing treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and has been kept on minimal artificial breathing support. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe man had no way of returning to India as international airlines were shut. Meanwhile, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) health workers collected swab samples from other close contacts of his wife, including their teenage son, daughter, his mother-in-law and two maids. On March 29, his son also got diagnosed with Covid-19 along with his mother-in-law and a maid. “I was hundreds of kilometers away and couldn’t do anything about it. I am more worried for my daughter as she is a specially-abled girl,” he said. The girl suffers from a rare neurological disorder, RETT Syndrome, which affects the development of the brain in girls. It also affects the immunity of the patients. She is unable to talk, walk and eat on her own.“She will be taken to my mother’s place. But for now, she is home quarantined in a single room along with a maid. She is having seizures regularly as she can’t see her mother and brother. My wife, who is admitted in ICU, keeps worrying about her, which is also affecting her recovery,” he said. Now, his 22-year-old nephew is staying with the family but he also doesn’t know how to handle a specially-abled child. The girl’s test is done in a private laboratory and the report is awaited.The man has sent mails to the ministry of external affairs and the Prime Minister’s Office to rescue him. The family has also started a petition on Change.org and has already received nine thousand signatures. “I know everything is closed but still, the government is running emergency services across borders. I need to come back to my family. This is a plea to the government from a father,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-stuck-in-ghana-as-wife-son-infected-in-mumbai/story-F9cErjimsKZqEJYudTxjPK.html
05-04-2020||India||Muslim scholars in UP urge members to back PM’s 9pm call on April 5||In a video clip, which is doing the rounds in some closed WhatsApp groups, a Muslim doctor based in the US can be seen advising community members to light a candle or diya (earthen lamp)at 9pm on Sunday, April 5, to “remain in the mainstream of the country”. “Today, people, including our own neighbours, are looking at us with suspicion. They will be watching us. Do light diyas to remove all misgivings about the community,” he says.The doctor is not the only one.With the Nizamuddin Markaz emerging as a hotspot of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the country, influential members of the Muslim community have taken to mobilising the people to take steps that help bust myths, not just about coronavirus but also about the community.And getting Muslims to openly answer the call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to light diyas, candles or flash torchlights for nine minutes at 9pm on Sunday to show solidarity in the fight against Covid 19, is one of them.With mosques practically closed due to the lockdown, WhatsApp messages have come in as a handy tool for the clerics and scholars to disseminate the message. ‘NEED TO IMPROVE IMAGE’Mufti Obaid-ur- Rahman of Gorakhpur feels the Nizamuddin incident has dented Islam’s image and thus it is their (the community’s) duty to correct it. He says, “There are WhatsApp groups of madarsa teachers, clerics, intellectuals and commoners, wherein appeals are being made repeatedly to abide by social distancing rules and join countrymen in lighting candles outside doors and on balconies on April 5. Earlier too, many Muslims here had joined the nation in ringing bells and clanging thalis to show their solidarity with frontline corona warriors. This time, too, we will follow the PM’s appeal.”In Lucknow, Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, Imam of Eidgah (Aishbagh), says: “Muslims love their country and they must come out of this communal mindset to defeat coronavirus.”Prominent Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad says, “The coronavirus doesn’t differentiate between Hindus and Muslims, so we must fight it together.”Dr Javed Ahmed Siddiqui, who runs a clinic in Hussainganj locality of the state capital, says, “It’s time to prove that everyone is not like the Tablighis. Muslims are most liberal and scientific in approach. I have asked all my neighbours to join me in lighting diyas as this disease is a common enemy of both the communities.”Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic group that urges Muslims to follow the practices of the religion, has been grabbing headlines since March 30 after several people who participated in a religious congregation held in its headquarters — Markaz, situated in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area — in mid-March were tested positive for Covid-19. The gathering was attended by hundreds, including foreigners, leading to intensive contact tracing efforts and enforcement of mass quarantine and isolation. On Saturday, the Union health ministry said that a third of the 3,000-odd Covid-19 cases reported in the country are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat.In Agra, social activist and footwear exporter Nazeer Ahmad says, “The PM’s appeal is to Hindustanis and not Muslims and Hindus. Lighting lamps may not be a treatment of the coronavirus, but it is a token of the country’s unity to fight the disease.”Prominent lawyer Amir Ahmad says, “Appeals by noted personalities are being issued through various channels.”On Friday, religious heads of various communities met superintendent of police, City (Agra), Rohan Pramod Botre and expressed solidarity with the cause.The clerics are also quoting verses of the Quran to convince the community members that religious assemblies can be avoided during emergency situations.In Meerut, Shahar Mufti Qazi-e-Shariat Darul Qaza Saif-ur- Rehman, in a video released on social media, can be seen asking people not to move in groups as it will expose them to the virus and, in turn, cause problems for others.‘INDIVIDUAL DECISION’ On the PM’s appeal, Zainus Rasheedin, the Nayab Shahar Qazi and Aligarh president of Jamiat- Ulema- e- Hind, says, “It is a personal decision but one can use a cell phone torch instead of a candle or diya.”Mufti Zulfikar, state president of All India Imam Association, says, “As the PM’s appeal has nothing to do with treatment and cure of the coronavirus, following it will be a personal decision.” HELPLINE ON THE CARDSDarul Uloom Farangi Mahal, a seminary in Lucknow, is planning to launch a helpline to remove misconceptions about Covid-19 in the society. “We are going to launch a helpline for answering queries of Muslims about the coronavirus,” says Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali. “I saw a post by an educated Muslim on Facebook stating that the word corona is derived from Quran so it will not happen to Muslims. I couldn’t stop myself from writing that had this been true, the virus would not have affected the Muslim countries and Mecca and Medina would not have been shut down,” he adds.IN DAMAGE-CONTROL MODEIn western Uttar Pradesh in particular, Muslim scholars and spiritual leaders are trying to control what they call the damage done by the Nizamuddin incident.Qazi Zainus Sajeedin, former professor of Islamic mythology at Aligarh Muslim University, agrees that the Markaz committed mistakes, but adds that mistakes were also made on part of the district authorities who didn’t take adequate action for evacuating the jamatis in time.‘DON’T MISBEHAVE WITH HEALTH WORKERS’In Varanasi, Mufti-e-Banaras Maulana Abdul Batin Nomani has issued a video appeal. “When you return to your area from any other city, do go for testing as per government instructions. All of us should ensure the contagious disease doesn’t spread further,” he says. He also appealed to the people not to misbehave with the medical staff. “I appeal to the awam (people) to welcome the medical team when they come to your doorstep for testing. Don’t misbehave with them. Treat them well and get your test done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-scholars-urge-members-to-back-pm-s-9pm-call-on-apr-5/story-XcZf01ISxTX5fOeCKLiOlK.html
05-04-2020||India||Modi calls all-party meeting on April 8||New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called an all-party meeting on Wednesday, April 8, to discuss the situation arising out of the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, days after the Centre announced a three-week nationwide lockdown to prevent its spread.This will be the PM’s first meeting with political party leaders after the outbreak that has paralysed nations across the world after its onset in China towards the end of 2019. A letter from parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said only the floor leaders of parties that have more than five members of Parliament would be invited to participate in the meeting. Keeping in mind the need for social distancing and travel restrictions that may prevent the invitees from being present physically at the meeting, it will be in the form of a video conference.The government’s decision to restrict the meeting to floor leaders and not invite party leaders has disappointed some parties. A senior Trinamool Congress leader indicated that the party may skip the meeting, but the main opposition party, Congress, is expected to attend Joshi personally called up different floor leaders on Saturday evening to request them to attend the meeting. Trinamool’s Lok Sabha floor leader Sudip Bandopadhyay told him that he would be busy in his constituency. “The need of the hour is to stay in the constituency and help the state government. The Centre’s top priority should be to help the states with a financial package. West Bengal government is working hard but desperately needs funds from the Centre,” Bandopadhyay said.Given that the Congress has been consistently urging the Prime Minister to hold a video conference with all political parties, its floor leaders are likely to attend the meeting.Joshi called up both the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir ranjan Chowdhury and sought their participation.The government has also conveyed to the Congress that the video conference will not be limited to parties with five MPs but even smaller parties will be invited.“We expected this initiative from the government side much earlier, but still better late than never. We have right from the beginning extended our whole-hearted support to the Centre and state governments {in their efforts} to deal with the crisis,” a senior party functionary said on condition of anonymity.Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, one of the many leaders demanding an all-party meeting, said it should have been held earlier. Yechury said, “Let’s all be clear that it’s not the government alone that is fighting against Corona. It is a joint, united fight of India and Indian people against Covid. And all that the Centre needs to do now is to give more money to the states. Also, on issues such as migrant workers’ crisis, the Centre should have taken the states on board.”Many opposition leaders have been seeking an all-party meeting with the PM on the pandemic that has had far-reaching and devastating effect on lives and livelihoods.At the meeting, PM Modi will seek suggestions from political parties on the road map towards containing the deadly virus,government officials said. The meeting will start at 11am with Modi’s opening remarks in which he will appraise party leaders of the steps his government has taken so far to contain the coronavirus . According to the plan, only one leader from each party will be allowed to speak.According to one official, the meeting will also be an opportunity to build a broad political consensus on India’s fight against Covid-19.Apart from Modi, home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, parliamentary affairs minister Joshi and leader of the Rajya Sabha, Thawar Chand Gehlot, are also expected to be present at the meeting by video conference.Modi had on March 24 declared a three-week nationwide lockdown aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus. The lockdown, which took effect the following day, will be lifted on April 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-calls-all-party-meeting-on-april-8/story-3gLtbyxfgMuJfY4DmRtrSI.html
05-04-2020||India||‘No possibility of grid collapse, don’t switch off fridge, TV’: Power ministry||The union ministry of power on Saturday clarified that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for switching off lights on Sunday would not cause instability to the power grid amid concerns over a possible grid-collapse. “Some apprehensions have been expressed that this may cause instability in the grid and fluctuation in voltage which may harm electrical appliances. These apprehensions are misplaced. The Indian electricity grid is robust and stable and adequate arrangements and protocols are in place to handle the variation in demand,” the power ministry said in a statement. “The appeal of the Hon Prime Minister is to simply switch off the lights in their homes from 9 pm to 9.09 pm on the 5th of April. There is no call to switch off either streetlights or appliances like Computers, TVs, Fans, Refrigerators and ACs in the homes. Only lights should be switched off,” it added. The power grid has seen a 30% drop in demand due to the absence of commercial activity in the wake of the nationwide lockdown, and there were fears that the Prime Minister’s call could encourage people to switch off everything, reducing demand even more. The essence of grid management is load balancing over time (in this case, 15-minute intervals), and a drop in demand could have resulted in a sudden change in grid frequency, leading to a potential blackout. According to power ministry data available for April 2, peak demand stood at 125.8 GW, which is 25% lower than 168.3 GW for the same day last year.“As somebody who has been associated with the power sector for almost three decades including as minister, the call to go dark for 9 min at 9 pm on the 5th can have deep impact on the grid and its stability. I sincerely hope this is being properly managed,” Jairam Ramesh, senior Congress leader, said in a tweet.Following the Prime Minister’s call , the Union power ministry, on Friday, held a high-level review meeting to assess the impact of power fluctuation on the grid. The meeting was chaired by Union power minister RK Singh and senior officials from Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) and grid operator POSOCO National Load Despatch Centre, Hindustan Times reported on Friday.An advisory has been issued to all states by the centre to assure that adequate arrangements have been made to meet the variation in demand. “The national load dispatch centre has worked out the procedures for grid balancing during the period which they will be communicating to the regional and state load dispatch centre’s separately,” the advisory by the power ministry said. Load dispatchers in states such as Uttar Pradesh have written to the state power operators warning of sharp load reduction of approximately 3 GW, advising load shedding in a staggered manner for an hour during the event. “To avoid sharp crashing of load, load shedding in staggered manner may be done starting from approximately 8 pm to 9 pm” the letter written by UP state load dispatcher, seen by HT, said. According to POSOCO, total domestic lighting load reduction on an all India level has been pegged at 12-13 GW. In a detailed advisory on Saturday, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times said, “Unlike normal operation, this reduction in load of the order of 12-13 GW would happen in 2-4 minutes and recover nine minutes later within 2-4 minutes. This sharp reduction in load and recovery, which is unprecedented, will need to be handled through hydro and gas resources.” During the evening peak hours (from 6 PM to 10PM) hydro generation will be reduced and conserved for providing flexibility during the event at 9 PM, POSOCO has said. During this time directions have been issued for thermal and gas generation to be scheduled in a manner so as to manage the peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-possibility-of-grid-collapse-don-t-switch-off-fridge-tv-power-ministry/story-VximuWOa3dHO8MBNQW1QLM.html

So that there is no obstruction in the power supply during the crisis and in times of need,” she said.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to switch off lights, on April 5, at 9 pm, for nine minutes, the Union power ministry, on Friday, held a high-level review meeting to assess the impact of power fluctuation on the grid.

Experts too have said load dispatchers would have to rely on hydro and gas power plants to curtail risk. “I am not aware of any event before leading to such a sharp fluctuation before. It will need careful management and pre-planning. They will have to judicially use hydro and gas power plants to come back and curtail risk,” said Vinay Rustagi, managing director at renewable energy consultancy Bridge to India Energy Private Limited.

05-04-2020||India||Covid-19 kills more men than women across nations||Men are three times more likely to die from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) than women, according to a yet-to-be peer reviewed meta-analysis of 32 studies published in MedRxiv, a pre-print server for health sciences.The study found that deaths related to Covid-19 were higher than reported in studies in China, with the pooled death rate of hospitalised patients being 6.6%. The study was the first, systematic review of Covid-19 clinical characteristics, and sex-specific risk of death.Men hospitalised with Covid-19 had a significantly higher death rate (9.2%) compared to women (3.4%), showed the analysis of data from 4,789 hospitalised patients, who had a mean age of 49 years. “These findings could indicate the need for more aggressive treatment of Covid-19 in males,” said study authors, from Iran and the United States.Covid-19 has consistently shown a bias against men, with data from China first revealing that men accounted for close to two-thirds (64%) of deaths.A similar gender gap in mortality rates has emerged from Italy, Spain, South Korea, France and Germany, with men accounting for 71% of the Covid-19 deaths in Italy.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThere were also disproportionately high deaths in men in other coronavirus outbreaks caused by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), with data from Hong Kong showing deaths in men were 50% higher even though more women got infected.“We still don’t know for sure why it is happening but smoking and higher coronary artery disease rates in men play a role. The lungs of smokers are already damaged, which makes them more susceptible to collapse,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI).Virus behaviour also plays a role. The cellular receptor used by the Sars-CoV-2 to enter human cells is angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is a protein found on the cell surface that plays a role in heart and immune function. Sars-CoV-2 infection begins with the crown-like spike protein of the virus, which gives the virus its name (‘corona’ means ‘crown’ in Latin) binding to ACE-2. Sars-CoV-2 mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs, leading to respiratory distress. These symptoms are more severe in patients with cardiovascular disease, which may lead to increased secretion of ACE-2 in people with heart disease compared to healthy people.Since ACE-2 is a functional receptor for Sars-CoV-2, people having ACE-inhibitors to control high blood pressure need to be carefully treated.“Higher comorbidities such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases could be related to the pathogenesis of the virus through ACE-2 receptor, which open doors for future studies to evaluate the role of ACE inhibitor drugs in the high-risk group. There are still a lot of unknown features of Covid-19 for the broad scientific community to investigate in an effort to slow the progression and mortality of Covid-19 and finally defeat this pandemic,” said the study.The jury is still out on whether patients with Covid-19 and hypertension, who are taking an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker, should switch to another antihypertensive drug, but further evidence is required.The study also found that progressive fever, cough and fatigue were the most common symptoms, with than half of hospitalised patients showing leukopenia (low white blood cells count) or a high C-reactive protein, which are indicators of inflammation and infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-kills-more-men-than-women-across-nations/story-1XlmaPk2LE10aWKw0cyoBK.html
05-04-2020||Today's||The silver lining in the Indian economy||The fear of a big-three cartel emerging to resurrect oil prices are overblown. The only silver lining, amid the darkness over the Indian economy, is that crude prices have crashed, offering the country billions of dollars in savings. Recent attempts by major oil producers to negotiate a joint production cut and force prices up are floundering. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have had to push back a planned meeting on such cuts to next week. The two main participants, Riyadh and Moscow, have spent the past few days trading bitter rhetoric. The United States (US), the world’s largest oil producer, has abandoned an earlier attempt to broker an understanding between itself, Saudi Arabia and Russia. President Donald Trump has ordered his government to boost demand for US oil by topping off its strategic oil reserve. The main reason why an agreement is proving so difficult is the magnitude of the cuts required. All the three main players are trying to minimise their share of the burden. Most estimates say the pandemic has reduced global oil demand by about 20 million barrels per day. With Riyadh and Moscow showing little signs of reconciliation, New Delhi has every reason to presume a financial windfall over the coming months. A complete collapse, say down to $10 a barrel, is not necessarily a good thing. Smaller producers would close down and future investment would dry up — all of which cut production and drive up prices. But those are long-term considerations, out of place in a time of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-silver-lining-in-the-indian-economy/story-KoQSbwa6b6qr6dKg1dpnoL.html
05-04-2020||Editorials||The post-Covid economic order||It is now clear that the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) will not just have huge costs in terms of loss of lives and public health, but lead to enormous economic suffering. The nature of the disease is such that there is an inherent tension between preserving lives — which involves large scale lockdowns, restrictions on travel, and social distancing — and economic activity — which is based on mobility, migration, supply chains, trade, demand, and consumption. Governments across the world have intervened, in varying degrees, to minimise the distress. But what does the crisis, as well as the nature of the response, say about the new global economic paradigm? The welfare State is back. This is the most significant transformation in decades in global economic policymaking. To be sure, the welfare element of State policy — even in the most developed capitalist democracies — never faded entirely. But the dominant wisdom was that the State should stick to its core function of provision of basic public services and act as a regulator, and leave the rest to the market to determine. But it is clear that governments will now have to intervene in every element of economic life. For the poor, food and cash transfer will become a reality; for citizens across the board, free or subsidised health care will have to be contemplated; for the unemployed, allowances may have to instituted; for business and companies, fiscal support will have to be provided, tax concessions given, and demand created through public interventions; for the working class, public expenditure will have to be ramped up. The irony is that at a time when the world is dominated by Right-wing leaders, the economic argument of the global Left has prevailed. But this does not mean a return to the old ways of conducting economic transactions, for the other most significant change will be the enhanced role of technology. To be sure, technology advances were driving economic integration in unprecedented ways already. This is what made work-from-home possible. But expect an ever greater reliance now on technology, and a reduction of human interface, in the ways people live their lives, spend their money, work, operate businesses, interact with friends and family, and create communities. All of this accelerates the digital transformation, which, in turn, will be disruptive. Both the government and the private sector will be affected by this. It is this twin process, of welfarism and enhanced State role on one hand and of technological disruption on the other, which will dictate the post-pandemic order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-post-covid-economic-order/story-4Hs8wdY3rz05Ip3x38fw5N.html
