In the recent past, the world has witnessed more deadly epidemics: SARS, MERS, Ebola, and H5N1. Yet, the coronavirus has been overwhelming due to the speed with which it has spread, infected people, and claimed lives.The virus breached India’s borders on January 30 through the 1.5 million Indians returning to India since then till the ban on international travel. We do not know how many among them were active and passive carriers of the infection due to our abysmal state of testing. Two months down the line, we have over 2,000 infected, and over 50 dead. These figures are not worrisome when compared to other countries, except that the curve is moving upwards and flattening horizontally: Today, more than double the districts are affected than a week ago.Due to poor testing, we have no idea among whom the virus is lurking, and in which direction it is spreading. Fighting a war blindfolded has its risks. One hope is the onset of the searing summer and if, as is being said, this epidemic follows the same trajectory as the 2009-10 swine flu, we may end up with a more reasonable count of the infected.The response has been unprecedented with heartbreaking consequences for the poor, homeless and marginalised. I have not found any compelling evidence in the public domain to give the nation less than four hours to lock down. Surely it is not based on a model prepared by some individuals based in the United States that estimates that 300 million people will get the flu, and since questioned by other experts?Regardless, India has to take strong preventive measures. There were two models: The China model of social distancing by banning all movement, except for essentials; and the South Korean model of mass testing.Both strategies seek to isolate the virus and disrupt transmission. Of the two, South Korea’s was more sensible, but not possible as we had messed up our testing policy and do not have enough testing kits. On the other hand, social distancing through lockdowns gave the government time to marshal its scarce resources to fight the next phase of the battle (treatment) and getting related requirements — doctors, nurses, personal protective equipment, intensive care unit beds, equipment, drugs, and trained personnel — in place. Given our iniquitous health system, putting in place such infrastructure in the event of a surge is vital, if we want to minimise fatalities.The suddenness of the lockdown without preparation, however, has created another battlefront. In the best administrative system, at least three days are required for a balanced response system to implement such an order: Framing guidelines for clarity, understanding and operationalising them to reach the last mile. But the sudden lockdown led to misunderstanding and panic, forcing migrant workers to flee cities.The chaos that followed has, however, diverted attention from what caused it, besides creating the added worry of the potential spread of the infection to the hinterland. It reminds me of the spread of HIV in Surat. The sudden dismantling of a 400-year-old brothel, by an enthusiastic police chief, forced sex workers to flee, making containment of the infection difficult.But now, India has a window of opportunity, provided it acts quickly and decisively. The lockdown itself has limited value. Even if all 1.3 billion stayed home for 21 days, the virus will be down, but not out. For optimal results, the lockdown has to be accompanied by scaling up testing tenfold from the current levels, and rigorously implementing the mantra — test-isolate-treat-trace. And for such a scale-up, testing has to be free and accessible.With several manufacturers of test-kits now authorised, prices will fall with volume. This will be much cheaper than what India is paying in terms of economic and social costs. Removing the deterrence of price and distance is critical in these times.The second measure is relaxing movement restrictions for goods required for the manufacture and delivery of all health-related items — medical devices, consumables, drugs and instruments — and ensuring the running of the out-patient departments in hospitals. The Chhattisgarh government is reportedly organising five additional vehicles per block to ensure the steady supply of drugs for tuberculosis and chronic patients, besides transporting patients to and from hospitals.We cannot allow the tap to run dry for the essential care of millions of sick people who need their medicines and surgeries, without creating another health crisis. Closing down outdoor patient units could also mean missing out potential carriers of the virus.It must be remembered that money cannot buy all the essentials needed to cope with a surge of cases, but quick decision-making can. The Centre has now constituted working groups to deal with different aspects of the pandemic. This is a positive step, provided they are empowered and held accountable for delays. Indian companies have also come forward, making available all their resources — knowledge, expertise, infrastructure. This is inspiring. Working together may give rise to innovation with the long-term triggering of more self-reliant and less dependent policies. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: It’s a battle we have to win.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/one-mantra-for-india-test-isolate-treat-trace-opinion/story-TgqwX6JlKvwkfrbypa28cI.html
02-04-2020||News||Covid-19 should lead to more investment in health | Opinion||The coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) has exposed the new nature of health threats and emergencies, linked to food systems, human-wildlife and anthropogenic conflicts, and the dynamics of globalisation. To counter this emergency, an unrivalled response has been initiated by all governments, the scientific community and citizen groups.On March 25, despite fewer notified cases compared to other countries, India initiated a 21-day national lockdown, adopting social distancing and citizen isolation, state border closures and a call to action for low-cost innovations to support the government through this crisis.While the health care system attempts to ramp up for what seems like a long battle ahead, this is a wake-up call and a chance to invest in health care systems like never before. India’s investments in the health sector have historically been low, at no time over 1.3% of its GDP. Compare this to 5% in China, 8.1% in South Korea, 10.9% in Japan. Despite instituting one of the earliest architectures of rural primary care, the Indian public health system is struggling to comprehend the challenges that Covid-19 has brought with it.In 2005, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), now known as National Health Mission (NHM), attempted to strengthen the primary, secondary and tertiary health services. But this was not followed through with robust investments in health infrastructure, workforce, supply chains, and community models for delivering care. While the Prime Minister’s Ayushman Bharat Yojna (PMJAY) has led to risk-pooling and greater health access for poorer households, the issue of quality assurance needs more attention in the future. The response to Covid-19 provides an opportunity for meaningful health reform. India needs to make low-cost, client-centred medical and health innovations. A four-pronged approach may help.First, we need to invest in human resources for health, now and in the future. India must strive to meet the World Health Organization norms (2016) for health workforce density: 44 health workers per 10,000 people. Recent estimates indicate current total human resource density is at 29 per 10,000, with wide variations among states. While India increases this number, it needs to also look at enhancing quality through upskilling. Through emergency response training, competencies such as testing, referral, quarantining and using medical equipment can be developed. The fight against Covid-19 cannot be won without the active involvement of the private sector and other health care providers who can play an important role in identifying potential cases and ensuring early quarantines. We need to rethink the roles and responsibilities of frontline health workers such as Accredited Social Health Activists, Auxiliary Nurse Midwives and multi-purpose workers, taking into account the skills they have.Second, with citizens under lockdown and their mobility restricted, the role of community health centres and district hospitals will be key. State and district administration will need support from local community bodies, panchayats, urban local bodies, and citizen groups to ensure that cases are isolated early and supply chains for drugs and essential equipment are functioning optimally. A communication plan to spread the right messages will be important. District hospitals need appropriately trained staff and medical equipment to ensure that cases are managed effectively at the facility and mortality is minimised. Effective use of telemedicine can deal with complicated cases, especially in inaccessible areas. We should be careful to not concentrate services in some cities alone.Third, the government must make all efforts to encourage low-cost innovations in medical technology to meet the needs of essential equipment, both to respond to the pandemic now and to develop the capacity for the next flu season. Identifying and easing the regulatory frameworks for developing new medical products can help enable rapid responses. Regulating the prices of essential drugs, low-cost mass production of masks and protective gear, will ease the burden. In the medium-to-long-term, India needs to further strengthen its biomedical research capabilities, and invest in cutting-edge “made in India” health technologies and make it easier for health technology start-ups to function with tax cuts. Scientific innovations hold the key to solving social crises. Finally, a task force to understand the impact of Covid-19 on the health system and households is required. The pandemic presents an opportunity to expand the coverage of the PMJAY, including considering a universalised health insurance model. Social distancing may lead to new challenges of anxiety and mental health all round. The costs of this pandemic could also be borne by other health and nutrition programmes as services and attention are likely to get diverted. We require state-level task forces that represent not just administrators and doctors but that engage wider civil society to address some of these long-term effects.Covid-19 presents an opportunity to bolster India’s health system, sustain investment in technology and reorient budgeting priorities towards what is truly essential — our health. As our medical workforce fights this invisible enemy, India owes them a robust health system that can facilitate all their efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-should-lead-to-more-investment-in-health-opinion/story-Wja3xwRvonXKE3IDc2dUrJ.html
02-04-2020||News||Why secular liberals are wrong about Nizamuddin||As the full scale of the damage to public health caused by the Tablighi Jamaat meeting — and its aftermath — in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area emerges, there are some things we can be clear about.One of them is that attempts by Hindutva communalists to try and turn this into a Hindu-Muslim issue are despicable. It is shameful that TV channels allow terms like bio-jihad to be used or let guests suggest that those who visited the Markaz Nizamuddin were out to poison Hindus.In fact, the vast majority of those who were infected were Muslim. So, far from being a jihad against Hindus, this an act that, so far at least, has risked more Muslim lives.The second thing we can be certain of is that various authorities are not blameless. There appears to have been laxness in granting visas. The Delhi Police, who have a station located next to the Markaz, failed to clear the building. The police have released a video of an officer speaking the leaders of the Markaz and asking them to vacate the complex. So not only were the police aware of the situation but they did not act even after the Jamaat leaders ignored their warning.The police video also contains clear references to Delhi Administration officials which suggests that even the state government failed to act.This may not be the best time to fix the blame but there can be no doubt that there is lots of blame to go around.Equally, it is as clear that the Jamaat leaders behaved with extreme irresponsibility, using religion to encourage people to stay inside the building and to ignore health warnings. The videos and audiotapes that have now been discovered show Jamaat clerics saying things like “Yes there is a virus. But 70,000 angels are with me and if they can’t save me, who will? This is the time for more such gatherings.” A voice, believed to be that of Maulana Saad, is heard saying, “This is a plan to end amity between Muslims, to alienate them from each other.” These are not videos recorded in secret as part of some sting. The Jamaat actually put them up on its YouTube channel and advised people that social distancing was an elaborate conspiracy against Muslims.At a time when millions of Indians are making sacrifices to fight the coronavirus, this kind of behaviour is not just criminal, it amounts to attempted murder.All this seems clear cut enough. So, why is there a problem?Well, because of what seems like a knee-jerk reaction from sections of the secular establishment.I cannot believe that any sensible person — Hindu or Muslim, secular or communal — can approve of the primitive fundamentalism of the Jamaat, an orthodox group that would take Islam back several centuries to fulfil its objectives.And yet, such is the nature of our political dialogue that many secular liberals believe they must respond vigorously to everything that Hindu communalists say. So, if Hindutva extremists and trolls are using terms like jihad and using the incident to attack all Muslims, then the answer must be to find some way to defend the Jamaat.And so, we have had the sad and pathetic spectacle of various people who should know better trying every trick in the book to find excuses for the Jamaat.All of Wednesday, we heard the excuses. There was, first of all, the constant blaming of the authorities. “Why didn’t the police break up the gathering?” “The IB was keeping a watch on the Markaz: why did it allow the foreigners who had attended to travel around India?” And so on.There are valid questions but they, in no way, lessen the horror of what the Jammat did.A murderer is no less responsible for his actions because an inept police force failed to capture him in time.To point to the mistakes of others to suggest that the Jamaat is only one of many guilty parties is like saying that the Holocaust was only partly Adolf Hitler’s fault because the global community could have stopped him earlier but did not.When their explanations fail to hold, some secularists then switch to a tactic that is often associated with their ideological opponents on the right — whataboutery.Ok, they say, if this was wrong, then why was it okay for parliament to remain in session even when social distancing was the norm? What about Shivraj Singh Chauhan’s victory celebrations in Bhopal when legislators hugged each other despite the risk of coronavirus infection? Why was it okay for Yogi Adityanath to refuse to call off Ram Navmi celebrations till the very end? Or even, what about the migrant exodus after the lockdown where there was no physical distancing? There are two answers to the whataboutery.The first is that not only were all of these things wrong, they were widely criticized and condemned at the time — by many people, including those members of the secular establishment who are now using them to offer tactical cover to the Jamaat. The second answer is that it does not matter what else happened. You cannot explain away the 2020 Delhi riots by saying that the 1984 riots were worse. All riots are bad and should be condemned. So what if legislators hugged each other at Shivraj Chauhan’s victory celebrations? How does it make the behaviour of the Jamaat any less criminal?The problem with knee jerk secularism is that it can sometimes offer up excuses for the indefensible. We think we are defending the Muslim community from attacks by bigots.In fact, we are damaging Indian secularism.Each time secularists take a stand that runs totally counter to morality or even to common sense, we damage the liberal idea of India. Yes, communalists will play the Hindu-Muslim game. But we must never fall into the trap of doing the same thing.We must condemn disgraceful and criminal behaviour wherever we see it. Once we start defending people only because they belong to a particular religion, we are no better than the religious bigots on the other side.It makes no sense to say, as some are now claiming, that the incident had nothing to do with religion. This was a religious gathering. And the reasons for the behaviour of the congregation were explicitly religious — they were told that 70,000 angels would protect them.Secularism does not mean that you rush to the defence to every Muslim, no matter what he or she has done. It means that you fight against all religious bigots and their primitive mindset that ignores science and promotes religious mumbo-jumbo. The issue with the Jamaat gathering is not only that it endangered the lives of so many people. It is that it did so in the name of religion. In the process, it strengthened the communal Hindu propaganda that Muslims are fundamentalists who do not regard themselves as subject to Indian laws.Of course, this is complete nonsense. The average Muslim is as sensible and as patriotic as the average Hindu. Many influential Muslims have condemned the Jamaat.But when secularists feel obliged to find excuses for Muslim bigots, they obscure this reality. If India is to move forward, then all of us should unite to fight bigots, no matter whether they are Hindu or Muslim.Find excuses for one or the other and the battle is already lost.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-secular-liberals-are-wrong-about-nizamuddin/story-1FuTwxmmVRNnYJ0eChBbnI.html
02-04-2020||City||Coronavirus outbreak: In Mumbai, an uphill battle called Dharavi||Mumbai’s overworked public health officials face a new challenge this week: Dharavi. After a 56-year-old garment shop owner living in India’s largest, most-densely populated slum succumbed to Covid-19 on April 1, two teams of 50 officers and volunteers landed up in the area to spread awareness about Sars-Cov-2, the virus responsible for the global pandemic, and to quarantine 70 high-risk residents of an eight-building Slum Rehabilitation Authority complex in which the victim stayed. The locality also has 91 shops. All of them have been ordered shut, even those selling essential supplies. The next day, an additional 2,500 persons were home-quarantined, and will probably be tested for exposure to the virus.On Thursday morning, just as the two teams and an additional army of 800 community health volunteers were getting ready for another busy day at Dharavi, a second case emerged – a municipal conservancy worker from south Mumbai who was assigned the area, tested positive for Sars-Cov-2. Twenty of his friends and co-workers had to be quarantined.Neither the garment shop owner nor the conservancy worker has a travel history, according to information released by the city’s health department. “It is going to be an uphill task identifying asymptomatic patients in an area that has more than 8.5 lakh people,” says Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner, BMC, and the officer is in charge of the city’s G-North ward where Dharavi is situated.It is not just about Dharavi’s population. Its inhabitants live in some of the most cramped spaces in the country. In an area measuring 2.1 sq km, the slum has over 57,000 shanties, huts and small flats, almost all of them illegal. Its estimated population density – 66,000 people per square kilometre – is more than double that of Mumbai (32,303 people per square kilometre), the fifth most-densely populated city in the world, according to a United Nations Population Prospects study released in July 2019. Mumbai is also the worst Covid-19-affected city in India, with 235 positive cases and at least 17 deaths on April 2. With private laboratories also testing for Covid-19, state health officials say this number will only rise.Mumbai’s – and Dharavi’s – population numbers make social distancing – one of the key preventive measures recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) – almost impossible to sustain. “It is almost certain that the cases will spike in Dharavi due to overpopulation,” says Baburao Mane, a former state legislator from Dharavi. “There are, on average, 10-12 people living in thousands of 250 sq ft huts. As summer approaches and the temperature soars, it will be almost impossible to prevent home-quarantined people from coming out of their cramped spaces.”For Dharavi, therefore, BMC has a special plan in place. It has created two teams of 25 people each that work round the clock in two shifts. These teams include a sanitary inspector, medical officers, police personnel and community volunteers. In addition, the ward officer has got on board 800 community health volunteers whose primary responsibility will be to trace vulnerable residents such as senior citizens, patients with respiratory ailments and pregnant women.“I have sought permission to convert the Rajiv Gandhi District Sports club in a quarantine facility with 300 beds,” says Dighavkar. “Once approved, we will shift high-risk people.”He says the primary concern for health officers is cooperation. “People in slums don’t cooperate. The statements given by the dead man’s wife and children have confused us. We are unable to trace his contacts. We don’t even know if he had visited his shop during the lockdown. Despite symptoms, has he roamed around the slum? The family can’t confirm this activity, and we don’t know how many people he may have infected.”Sanitation and water supply are other issues here. In line with WHO recommendations, the Maharashtra state health department too has advocated regular hand-washing with water and soap to avoid any possible transmission of Sars-Cov-2. In Dharavi, this is a distant dream. Neena More, a local social activist, says the slum averages one toilet per 500 people (official figures peg the number at one toilet per 1440 people), and most residents use the nearby Mahim creek for urination and defecation. “Every morning, people stand in long queues to use the toilets making them susceptible to the infection,” she says. And then, there is economic desperation. Almost every family in Dharavi faces the prospect of spending more than two months without wages on account of the nationwide lockdown and shutting of private business establishments. Shibani Salvi, a 26-year-old mother of two lost her last source of income in the third week of March. Prior to the lockdown, she earned Rs 20,000 a month working as a domestic help in five flats in the neighbourhood. “Now,” she says, “I cannot even go out of my house to collect my salary even though one of my employers called me. We have enough food to last only three more days. I don’t have money to buy even masks or sanitisers for my family.” One of Salvi’s employers is Divya Dhar, a 36-year-old designer who stays with her mother and two-year-old daughter at the affluent Shivaji Park. Even after the lockdown began, she would drive to Dharavi to fetch her domestic help and cook to help her concentrate on being a single working mother. From Wednesday – the day the news broke about the first Covid-19 fatality in Dharavi – Dhar has stopped the practice. “I can’t risk my daughter who is already an asthma patient. I will get tested. Until then, I have locked myself in a room,” Dhar says.Drinking water is another of Dharavi’s challenges. Qamruddin Sheikh, who runs an NGO named Bal Vikas Shikshan Sanstha the area, says that in an area that has scant drinking water, it is impractical to think they will keep washing their hands. “People are using handkerchiefs and cotton masks, both of which are of no use to stop the virus transmission. BMC should provide quarantined people with proper masks and hand sanitisers,” he says.Dighavkar says the primary challenge for health officers will be tracing the people who were in close contact with infected patients. One health officer HT spoke to said on the condition of anonymity, “Many of the shops in Dharavi are illegal, and people do not share information openly. Getting accurate information here is the work of a full-time detective.”According to the ward officer, BMC has been providing rice, wheat and dal to those in home quarantine, but residents HT spoke to, said the ration does not include essentials such as oil and vegetables. Besides, he says, there is little awareness.Sagar Kamble, a Dharavi resident, says, “Almost 80% of the slumdwellers here are uneducated and do not understand the gravity of the situation. Only a few gated colonies in the area have locked their premises; the rest of the population is roaming around freely.” Mane says this is the main reason he has been asking for compulsory screening of all of Dharavi’s residents. “BMC needs to screen all the locals and if needed, send them back to their respective villages using available public transport. There is no other way to enforce social distancing or to contain the virus.”But this is not possible, says BMC. The city’s health officers have overruled the possibility of running universal tests in Dharavi. “There are just not enough test kits,” says a health officer. “There is a shortage of masks and sanitisers in the slum, so with the help of NGOs and philanthropists, we are trying to procure protective masks for quarantined people.” He adds, “There is also large-scale ignorance. When our volunteers counsel on the importance of sanitation and social distancing, many from the Muslim community respond by saying their immunity is high as they eat meat. It’s not going to be easy at all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-outbreak-in-mumbai-an-uphill-battle-called-dharavi/story-rC9AjvgmRw473stwBi0OrJ.html

02-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus outbreak: 2,500 residents of Mumbai’s Dharavi area to remain in home quarantine||Around 2,500 residents of Dr Baliga Nagar in Dharavi have been directed to remain under home quarantine after a 56-year-old man died of Covid-19 on Wednesday, while a 52-year-old man who worked as a sweeper in the area was tested positive for the virus 24 hours later. The colony with 308 flats and 91 shops has already been sealed by the authorities. Local ward office has said no resident will be permitted to step out of their homes and that food and other essential items would be provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).The 52-year-old Worli resident has been undergoing treatment at Seven Hills Hospital in Andheri. The civic body has also stamped 23 workers, who had worked with him in Dharavi, to remain under home quarantine.Meanwhile, the 56-year-old was suspected to be among those who had returned from the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi. However, assistant municipal commissioner Kiran Dighavkar said, “The family and the patient had denied any visit to the Jamaat event in Delhi. We are tracing all his close contacts and getting them in quarantine.” Around 70 high-risk contacts, including his family, neighbours and a physician, will be tested for Covid-19 on an immediate basis. The high-risk contacts of the victim also include 50-60 people in Sion Hospital whom the 56-year-old had met during his treatment. They too have been quarantined too. BMC is also tracing his close contacts from a nearby mosque which the patient regularly visited. “Meanwhile, four people, three from Dharavi and one from Mahim, who had returned from the Tablighi Jamaat event have also been quarantined at a nearby hotel. They will undergo tests and we are also tracing their contact,” said a civic official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-outbreak-2-500-residents-of-mumbai-s-dharavi-area-to-remain-in-home-quarantine/story-eghr5sIdLcI4oF6waCWrPN.html
02-04-2020||City||Coronavirus outbreak: 1,400 from Maharashtra attended Jamaat event||A total of 1,400 people from the state attended the Tablighi Jamaat event at Nizamuddin in Delhi, the state authorities said on Thursday. Of them, the district administrations have identified 1,300 people, including 127 from Mumbai, and quarantined most of them. Of the 127 identified from Mumbai, 105 have been traced and kept in quarantine.State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “According to the guidelines issued by the central government, we have successfully tracked 1,300 people who attended the Markaz congregation from different districts. Their samples will be collected for coronavirus testing.” “We gave ward-wise lists to all ward officers to track the 127 persons. The search operation for the rest is going on,” said a senior official from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “Of the remaining, most of them are either out of Mumbai or Maharashtra. Many of them have given wrong residential addresses with telephone numbers, which is why we couldn’t track them,” he said.BMC officials said considering the chaos in Delhi, many people are unwilling to reveal that they attended the event. A senior IPS officer said the tracing was done in coordination with the special branch-1, the intelligence wing of the city police, which has units in all 13 zones in city, and the zonal police. Police officials said nine people from south Mumbai’s zone one area (Mohammed Ali Road, Dongri areas) have been quarantined, 20 from zone 8 (Bandra East, Nirmal Nagar, Vakola and nearby areas) and 10, including some Indonesian nationals, from zone 9 (Bandra West, Khar areas). Police said 20 members in zone 8 area hail from Gujarat and other states and had come to Mumbai from the gathering and got stuck owing to the lockdown. Twenty-one of the identified are from Andheri and Jogeshwari (zone 10). “Two people have been traced to Pathanwadi in Malad (east), while four from zone 12. These people were traced with the help of their phone call locations and also with assistance from the community leaders,” said an officer.Sources said the police will share the travel details of the members with the railways to get details of their co-passengers.Twelve people from Kalyan and five from Bhiwandi, who attended the congregation, have been put in home quarantine, said the health department of the Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC). “None of them have shown any symptoms so far,” said Jaywant Dhule, medical officer, BNCMC. Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of Thane Municipal Corporation, said, “Twenty-five people had come to Mumbra. Some of them were from Bangladesh, a few from Malaysia while one was from West Bengal. All 25 have tested negative.” The police have registered a case against the trustee and cleric of the mosque in Mumbra for keeping the foreign nationals. Five attendees have been traced to Tulinj, Vasai, Nalla Sopara and other areas in the Palghar district. Of the 1,300 people, a majority are from Pune. Two persons from Pimpri-Chinchwad who attended the gathering tested positive. So far, the Pune administration has identified 182 persons, of which 106 have been sent to quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-outbreak-1-400-from-maharashtra-attended-jamaat-event/story-bmvgwfvwGERXyoJKji4nqN.html
02-04-2020||City||94 FIRs filed, Mumbai Police continue action against coronavirus lockdown violators||The Mumbai Police on Wednesday lodged 94 first information reports (FIRs) against those violating the lockdown orders. While 59 were against those gathering in one place, 24 were for unnecessary use of vehicles and the rest against hawkers and shop owners.Madhukar Pandey, joint commissioner, Mumbai traffic police, said, “If we catch motorists more than twice for using their vehicles unnecessarily, we will suspend their driving licences.” Since March 20, 709 cases have been registered in Mumbai, of which 246 are from north region (Goregaon to Dahisar) and 204 are from east region (Chembur to Mulund). In all 1,364 people have been booked, of which 1,100 have been arrested. In Dharavi, a 19-year-old man was arrested, 17-year-old was detained and 12 others were booked for pelting policemen with stones. According to Dharavi police, the incident took place around 6.30pm when 47-year-old constable Ashok Chavan and his colleague were patrolling the area. A group of 10, mostly youngsters, gathered near Joglekar Nullah road near Om Dutta CHS. Chavan along with his colleague asked them to go to their homes. One of the youngsters started to abuse them. As the constables threatened them with their batons, one of them started to throw stones, which forced the constables to move out of the area. “We detained a minor, who was released after counselling,” said Ramesh Nangare, senior police inspector at Dharavi police station.Meanwhile, the Dongri police arrested two people for circulating fake messages on social media . The police said the arrested accused are identified as Sadik Yakub Shaikh,30, and his friend Siddique Ayub Mada ,34, both residents of Amachi wala building, Dongri. “Action was taken as per the rules,” said Sandeep Bhagdikar, senior inspector, Dongri police station.The police have started to seize vehicles of citizens who refuse to stay at home and violate the lockdown order.

02-04-2020||Mumbai||As Covid-19 cases rose, commuters started to opt for private transport: IIT study||More people shifted to private transport for commuting to work in the transition phase until the national lockdown, states a study by the Indian Institutes of Technology in Mumbai (IIT-B) and Hyderabad (IIT-H). The study looks into the impact of Covid-19 on daily commute to work in the third week of March till the lockdown. In Tier-1 cities, it was found that about 12% of the respondents switched from public to private mode during the third week of March. This modal shift was around 9% in Tier-2 cities and about 7% in Tier-3. The report, said researchers, was based on the responses of over 1,900 participants from tier-1, tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Most responses were received from tier-1 (63.6%) followed by tier-2 (20.6%) and tier-3 cities (15.8%). “Given the uncertainties in the minds of commuters regarding their travel behaviour due to social distancing, it is important for policymakers and local transport authorities to understand the change in travel pattern,” said Digvijay S Pawar, assisstant professor, department of civil engineering, IIT-H. Moreover, nearly 48% of people said that they did not travel to work during the third week of March, whereas 28% continued the old frequency of travel to work. When enquired about the cancellation of trips between the cities using major modes of transportation, around 18 % said they cancelled their flights whereas, 20% cancelled train journeys. The research team comprised Prof. Nagendra Velaga, department of civil engineering, IIT-B, Ankit Kumar Yadav, a research student at IIT-B, S Pawar and Pritha Chatterjee, assistant professors, department of civil Engineering, IIT-H.When respondents were asked about their safety perception towards transport during the pandemic, 93% said that private transport was safer than public mode. The researchers also emphasised upon spreading more awareness about Covid-19, especially among the weaker sections of the society. “The rapidly changing diaspora of this pandemic is a threat to public health and is making human life more challenging,” added Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/as-covid-19-cases-rose-commuters-started-to-opt-for-private-transport-iit-study/story-qapCbvHg2UGt1aLGBEUeaI.html
02-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus lockdown: Thane society sets up medical helpline for residents||A co-operative housing complex in Thane has set up its own medical helpline for its 2,000-odd residents and restricted the entry of outsiders into its premises as part of its preventive measures against the spread of Covid-19.Tarangan Complex Federation in Thane comprises three societies and nine residential buildings. Among its residents are around 30 practicing doctors who work in some of the prominent hospitals in the area. “There are three high-profile doctors in our complex who have committed that they will available 24x7, in case anyone from the society needs help.

02-04-2020||City||Greater Noida: Two who attended Nizamuddin event detained, sent for tests||Two men, who are in their twenties, were detained by the Jarcha police on Thursday after they allegedly fled from Alwar, to where they had been tracked by the Rajasthan police as having attended the Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz in Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month.Hundreds of people from all over the country, including foreign nationals, had attended a congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin Masjid in March, of whom more than 180 have now tested positive for Sars-Cov-2. State governments and administrations across the country are now working on tracing people in their respective states who had attended the event.The Rajasthan government had traced 13 such people to the Alwar district. Eight of these were detained by the state police while five managed to flee. They were traced to Gautam Budh Nagar’s Jarcha area on Thursday.“We received information about them by the Alwar police after which their locations were tracked. Two of them were found in the Jarcha kasba area, after which they were detained and sent for a test at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), after which they will be sent for quarantine,” Anil Rajpoot, station house officer, Jarcha police station.The two runaways included a 22-year-old man from Ghaziabad and a 25-year-old man from Saharanpur.They were booked at the Jarcha police station and a case was registered against them under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code, along with other relevant sections.“The two persons who had helped the runaways to hide were also detained, booked and sent for testing, after which they, too, will be quarantined. The duo had reached Jarcha around 11am. There are other members of the host family as well but they claim to have been away when the two arrived. However, we will have them tested as well,” said the SHO.The other three who had allegedly fled from Alwar were not found and a search is on for them. The Gautam Budh Nagar Police have informed Ghaziabad police about them as they are residents of Loni and officers believe that they may be in Ghaziabad in hiding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-two-who-attended-nizamuddin-event-detained-sent-for-tests/story-Lqf3pnx8ce9ac0FIsYu0OL.html
02-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Health staff allege misbehaviour by patients in isolation ward||The staff nurses of the MMG District Hospital have given a written complaint to the of the hospital’s chief medical superintendent (CMS) about alleged misbehaviour by five suspected patients and one confirmed case of coronavirus who are lodged in the isolation ward. According to officials, complaints have been forwarded to the chief medical officer (CMO) for action and also marked to the district magistrate and senior superintendent of police of Ghaziabad district.According to CMS Dr Ravindra Rana, the complaint alleges that six patients admitted in the isolation ward of MMG Hospital have been passing comments and resorting to unruly behaviour with nurses. They added that the six are those who have been recently picked up by the health department in a drive to identify persons who attended different religious congregations, including the one held at Delhi’s Nizamuddin mid-March.“The nurses have given us in writing that the six male patients were roaming around without wearing proper clothes. They were also passing comments at the female staff and singing objectionable songs, besides demanding cigarettes from them. They have also alleged that the patients are not consuming medicines given to them and also try to come close to the staff even if they are told to stay at a distance. Also instead of maintaining social distancing, they are sitting together on the same bed and talking,” Dr Rana said.“Based on their written complaint I forwarded a letter Thursday evening to the chief medical officer of the district and sought his intervention. A copy of the same has been sent to the local police, the district magistrate and the Ghaziabad SSP. The nurses are working hard day and night at the isolation wards to treat patients and they are very upset with the unruly behaviour shown towards them. The complaint has been submitted by six nurses,” he added.He added that other patients in other isolation wards have shown cordial behaviour towards the doctors and the nurses.Though the ward is meant for suspected cases only the positive case was confirmed late Thursday. Ghaziabad CMO Dr NK Gupta said that with this latest case, the tally of confirmed Sars-Cov-2 cases in Ghaziabad has gone up to ten.“The latest case which tested positive is one of the six lodged in the isolation ward of MMG Hospital, who, we have come to know, has visited the event at Delhi’s Nizamuddin,” Dr Gupta added.When contacted over the issue of the alleged harassment, Shahi Imam Mufti Zameer said that no one should be rude or indulge in any sort of misbehaviour with health personnel.“Any such act against doctors or health staff is unacceptable. They are saviours and are fighting to protect everyone against Covid-19. I would also appeal that anyone who has visited any religious congregation should come forward voluntarily and take up medical examination. This will benefit everyone. Such a message has also been issued from Nizamuddin on Thursday,” he added.Till Thursday evening, the health department officials identified and put under quarantine and isolation at least 136 persons who had attended different religious congregations.“We are yet to receive the formal complaint copy sent by the CMS. However, I have directed the concerned station house officer to visit the isolation ward at least two times daily to ensure that there is no unruly activity of any sort against the hospital staff. We have already stationed personnel outside the ward and officials have been asked to take up legal action in case anyone is found harassing hospital staff,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city).In other two quarantine facilities at Masuri and Muradnagar, the officials have deployed a sub-inspector and two constables to ensure that there is no unruly activity on the part of anyone who is in quarantine.“The personnel have been asked to make use of force if any such activity is witnessed and also ensure that no one runs away from any of the two quarantine facilities. The police personnel have also been given protective suits and are working in two shifts of 12 hours per day,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural).Dr Gupta, meanwhile, said that he has asked police officials to take strict legal action against the six persons.“I have spoken to the CMS of MMG Hospital and he told me about nurses and staff allegedly being harassed by six persons lodged in the isolation ward. The six are those who were recently brought to the isolation ward after they attended religious congregations,” he said.“It was found that most of the time, they sit together on a single bed and do not maintain social distance. They should have been on their respective beds but continue to defy health protocols. What is worse is that one of these six was tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday evening. It is now suspected that the other five have chances of becoming infected as well,” Dr Gupta added.The health department said that 90 of 136 who were recently picked up were lodged at a quarantine facility at Masuri while 35 others are at a facility at Muradnagar. Six of them are in isolation at MMG Hospital while the remaining five are at Sanjay Nagar Hospital, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-health-staff-allege-misbehaviour-by-patients-in-isolation-ward/story-mU1ZDjveiXsrhhFd58X31I.html
02-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus: Mumbai witnesses 81% drop in NO2 levels in six weeks||A six-week assessment of air pollution data showed an 81% decline in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in the air above Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). This is the first air quality assessment using satellite imagery since a lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. “The absence or reduction of almost all major sources of air pollution led to a drastic drop in emissions [during the lockdown], which shows that the air can be cleaned if emissions are controlled. Clean air does not necessarily have to come at the cost which we are paying now due to the Covid-19 outbreak, but this crisis should be used as an opportunity to learn from and move forward,” said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst working with Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).CREA’s assessment showed an 81% decline in NO2 levels over six weeks, based on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) readings across 10 real-time stations in Mumbai, and satellite imagery (TROPOMI/S5P satellite data). The most significant fall in NO2 levels was witnessed between March 23 and 29 when the concentration dropped to 10 µg/m3 and satellite images showed almost no emissions over most of MMR. The daily average on March 29 was 8 µg/m3, the lowest of this year so far, against NO2’s safe limit of 80 µg/m3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-witnesses-81-drop-in-no2-levels-in-six-weeks/story-ak6mlk9ifmvErnVk5ojbNK.html
02-04-2020||Noida||Industrial and institutional areas shut, animals left starved, dehydrated||With industrial areas and educational institutes bereft of people and street food outlets and restaurants shutting shop owing to the 21-day nationwide lockdown to control the spread of coronavirus, animals, especially dogs, have been left starved and dehydrated.According to animal rescue and welfare organisations, while community dogs in and around residential societies are being fed by residents, a number of dogs and even large animals like cattle, which relied on street food vendors in institutional or industrial areas, have no source of food or water. “We have about 82 dogs at our dispensary in Sector 55 while there are over 90 dogs at the shelter in Sector 126. The highest number of cases are of starvation and dehydration, because restaurants and street vendors are no longer operating. Also, people who would normally go out and feed these animals are stuck at home due to the lockdown,” Sanjay Mahapatra, founder of animal welfare NGO House of Stray Animals (HSA), said.He added that while large animals like cows and oxen can still rely on greens, dogs and cats are left with no source of food.“Most of these starvation cases are happening in deserted areas like Knowledge Park (educational hub), Expo Mart (industrial area) and such. Every day, when we go out to feed animals, we get to see a lot of extremely weak dogs with clear signs of starvation — their stomach thin and tongue hanging out,” Kaveri Rana, president from People for Animals (PFA), Gautam Budh Nagar, said.She added that with the season changing, it also brings along the ailments such as parvo and distemper, and the numbers currently being reported are higher than usual.“There are at least four cases of parvo in puppies being reported on a daily basis, which is basically due to an intestinal infection that happens when they end up eating things like polythene, rotten meat or dead rotten animals,” Rana said.Distemper in both pups and adult dogs is another immunity-related disease due to wrong food habit and stress.A number of animal starvation cases are also coming in unauthorised colonies and slum clusters where migrant workers used to live, but are now gone.“Most of the migrant workers have left and those left behind are themselves struggling to meet daily needs, so how would they feed the dogs? Otherwise they take care of their community dogs quite well,” Rana said.While the animal welfare organisations are also facing a crunch in the number of volunteers and staffers available, the animal welfare department has issued 50 passes to animal lovers and volunteers to feed the community animals.“There are several NGOs feeding and taking care of both big and small animals and we have also issued passes to them so that they can feed animals without any hassle. Food is also being dispatched in certain regions. There are cases of ailments among dogs, but most of them are because of the season change. We also urge people to keep water and feeders with some grain in their balconies for birds and outside their houses for dogs, at least till the lockdown ends,” VK Srivastava, chief veterinary officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.Meanwhile, a number of volunteers are coming forwards to help animal NGOs with food items.“There are many who are supplying food items like rice, dog food and milk to shelter homes. These are serious times and we need to be compassionate,” NP Sigh, president District Development Resident Welfare Association (DDRWA), said.“I rescued a puppy yesterday from my society, got the number of a nearby shelter from Google. The pup was in a bad shape, and so we took a risk and went to the shelter. The shelter was short-staffed and needed volunteers, so I applied and will be getting a feeder’s pass to feed dogs outside of our society areas as well,” Samiksha, a resident of Sector 75, Noida, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/industrial-and-institutional-areas-shut-animals-left-starved-dehydrated/story-WqsJRvLogKeJ0v19m6qeiP.html

The authority has converted community centres into shelters after the Uttar Pradesh government issued directions to create more shelter homes to house homeless daily wage workers. “We have put in beds, mattresses and other required facilities at these shelters. We will provide all essential services, including food and medicine etc, to the people in these homes,” Rajeev Tyagi, chief engineer, Noida authority, said.These community halls are meant for holding functions, weddings and cultural events. If required, the authority will convert the remaining nearly 200 community halls into shelters in the time to come.These community centres are located in sector 19, 20, 55, 56, 61, 62, 71, 122, 135, two community centres in Chhalera village, Hazratpur Wazidpur community centre, Parthala village community hall, Nagla Charandas Community Hall, Bhuda Community Hall, Bhangel, Shahdra, Nagli Wazidpur, Jhatta and Kondli.The Gautam Budh Nagar police is keeping a track of all homeless migrant workers, who were passing through Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas. The UP government had directed officials in the district that migrant workers should be kept in isolation till April 14, to ensure that anyone found positive for Covid-19 does not end up spreading the infection. As per an estimate, these 20 community hall can accommodate at least 1,500 persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-converts-20-community-halls-into-shelters-for-migrant-workers/story-icWfZYDm2iGbIdokurZzkO.html

02-04-2020||Noida||GM Nagar DM directs factories to pay all workers by April 7||The new district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar has again asked factories and industries to pay salaries to all their employees by April 7. There are 8 lakh workers in the district, of whom 6 lakh work in the nearly 4,500 small and big factories in the district.“We have spoken to establishments to ensure that all workers are paid by April 7. We have told them that no employee’s salary should be cut because of the ongoing lockdown in view of Covid-19 spread. We have already deposited ₹1,000 in the accounts of 11,893 registered labourers, 1,750 labourers attached to the nagar palikas and panchayats and 1,076 labours under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005,” district magistrate Suhas LY said.Former district magistrate BN Singh had last week passed an order that no landlord will ask for rent from tenants who are daily wagers or employed with essential services maintenance agencies for a month. This was done to stop the mass exodus of migrant workers to their native lands.Officials are trying to maintain the supply of essential goods in the district and have got a stock of 200 tonnes of wheat flour. By Friday, officials will get 500 tonnes of flour to ensure that there is no shortage during the lockdown.“We are holding meetings with officials attached with markets to fix prices of vegetables and fruits. We have enough stock of essential food items and people need not resort to panic buying,” Suhas said.The administration is also going to start a call centre to keep track of people who have been put under home quarantine and to help people who often mistake the common cold and cough for Covid-19 symptoms.“By Friday, we are expecting to start our new advanced call centre to trace contact points of infected persons. Our trained staff and doctors will be available to address grievances of people. Our doctors will help people in identifying symptoms of Covid-19 and to clear their doubts. We will give out the helpline number once all the arrangements are in place,” the DM said.The health department has also come up with 14 rapid reaction teams to immediately reach out to people who are infected with Sars-CoV-2 virus or any other medical urgency. Each team will have two officials and dedicated vehicles have been given to them.On Wednesday, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences in Greater Noida and the Super Speciality Children’s Hospital in Sector 30 faced a shortage of medical and protection kits. “We have now got 512 Viral Transport Media kits, 1,100 personal protection equipment kits, 1,513 N95 masks and 5,000 triple layer masks with us.

It is a good experience to use a wide array of resources available on the internet for online teaching. It is challenging for schools but is also a very good learning experience,” said Kavita Sanghvi, principal of Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School in Vile Parle.EuroSchool and Billabong High have started conducting live sessions through video conferencing and recorded sessions for the new academic year. The learning is further supplemented with digital textbooks, question-and-answer (Q&A) sessions and home assignments. Teachers said the experience has taught them to use the technology which they otherwise would not have tried. “The only issue with the younger kids is that it is more challenging to keep them engaged virtually and avoid distractions,” said a teacher of a suburban school, which has started some of its classes online.However, experts have warned against the complete replacement of classroom teaching with online medium. Francis Joseph, from SLN Global Network, a network of schools, said, “Online academic learning cannot replace face-to-face teaching. Besides, our teachers need training to be online tutors. With elite schools turning to ‘online only’ instruction, disparity between privileged schools and affordable schools are bound to widen due to varying contexts in the students’ home environment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-outbreak-icse-cbse-schools-start-new-academic-yr-with-online-classes/story-tdGAukJaG6hJDsrWz6ZCUN.html

MU’s statement has come two days after the varsity postponed all its 750-plus exams of the current examination session until after April 15.“Due to Covid-19 outbreak, the government has declared lockdown up to April 14 and accordingly, University of Mumbai issued a circular that the varsity and colleges affiliated with us will not conduct any exam until April 14,” said a statement released by Vinod Patil, director, board of examinations and evaluations (BEE), MU. He further clarified that MU will not issue any timetable-related circular before April 14.His statement highlighted that during such “unprecedented times”, it is the collective responsibility of the staff and students to not fall prey to rumours. “We have realised that the staff and students are forwarding timetables of different colleges on WhatsApp groups to seek authentication, which eventually finds its way to others who assume the information shared is true.

02-04-2020||City||2 arrested for spreading communal disharmony via WhatsApp video||Two men, including the administration of a WhatsApp group, were arrested by the Badalpur police on Thursday for allegedly spreading communal disharmony by circulating a video message.The incident came to light in the intervening hours of Wednesday and Thursday, when a man forwarded a video message in a Greater Noida-based WhatsApp group , named Jai Hind, of which several police officials are members.The message shows a family of one particular religion being quarantined, and a man alleging how they are being forced by the members of another religion to stay inside. The video further claims that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic was part of a “conspiracy”.“There were two parts to the message. One was the video itself while the other was an accompanying text message, which used derogatory language towards the members of a particular religious community. The message should not have been forwarded,” said Harish Chandra, deputy commissioner of police(DCP), Zone 2. The suspects were identified as Yusuf Khan, the group administrator, who is a native of the Badalpur area, and Firoz Khan, a native of the Dadri area, who had sent the message.Police officials are now looking to trace the family that had made the video. The police said suitable action will be taken against them once they are identified.A case was registered at the Badalpur police station against the two suspects under relevant sections of the IT Act and Section 153B (promotion of enmity-prejudice to national integration) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC).The instructions to file the FIR were first given by DCP of Zone 3, Rajesh Kumar Singh, who had come across the message. It had a request to forward it as widely as possible. Afterwards, both the suspects had apologised profusely on the group, said the police. The police have also recovered the two phones used by the suspects.Gautam Budh Nagar police had earlier said that strict action will be taken against those who are spreading propaganda or fake news on social media in the light of the ongoing coronavirus crisis.Police officials are maintaining a strict vigil in the district to ensure that lockdown guidelines are being followed. The commissioner of police on Thursday inspected areas near Pari Chowk, while the department also used drones for surveillance. According to the police the purpose behind such measures was to ensure that Section 144 was not being violated and that there was no hoarding of essential supplies.The drones will capture the live footage of the violators making it easier for the police to take action against them. Security forces, including the Rapid Action Force (RAF), have also been deployed in the district to deter people from violating the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-arrested-for-spreading-communal-disharmony-via-whatsapp-video/story-enGNFo0jDpe9x3x10g8tlM.html
02-04-2020||Delhi||Most pvt schools say exams ended before lockdown, govt schools mull over implementation of CBSE directive||A day after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) advised its affiliated schools to promote all Class 9 and Class 11 students to the next grades based on their internal assessments given the Covid-19 pandemic, a majority of private schools in the city on Thursday said they had managed to conduct the exams for these classes before the lockdown began, while those run by the Delhi government said they were yet to take a call on ways to implement the directions. In Delhi government schools, which are also affiliated to the CBSE, one exam was yet to be conducted for Class 9 and two for Class 11 before the lockdown was announced. However, the situation is different in both private and government schools of north-east Delhi where exams were first suspended in February due to the communal riots and later in March after the Covid-19 outbreak hit the Capital.The Delhi government had on Monday announced it would promote all students up to Class 8 to the next grades without them having to write exams under the no-detention policy. The uncertainty around the Class 9 and Class 11 exams was put to an end when, on Wednesday, the CBSE directed all its schools to promote the students of these classes based on their internal assessments. The internal assessment generally carries 20% weightage in the final results. It includes unit tests, projects, practicals and extracurricular activities. A senior official in Delhi government’s education department said that in their schools, only the Urdu language exam was left for Class 9 students and Sociology and Engineering graphic exams for Class 11. However, the government schools in north-east Delhi were yet to take at least four exams for Class 9 and five for Class 11. “We have just received the directions from the CBSE. We are now considering evaluating students based on their internal assessments that were conducted throughout the year and the annual exams that were held until the lockdown was announced. We will have to plan everything differently for the north-east Delhi schools. We will come up with a notification in a day or two,” the official said.Gayyur Ahmed, principal of Sarvodya Bal Vidyalaya in Jama Masjid, said the schools are ready with the internal assessment marks of these classes. “We will go ahead and promote the students as soon as we receive a direction from the government,” he said.Bharat Arora, general secretary of the action committee of private unaided schools, an umbrella group of around 1,000 private schools in Delhi, said, “Almost all schools affiliated to our organisation had completed their internal exams between March 10 and March 15, like every year. Many had also declared the results before the lockdown was announced. However, some schools were yet to conduct the compartment exams.”Officials in several popular private schools, including Amity International School in Saket, Springdales School in Pusa road, Sanskriti School in Chanakyapuri, Delhi Public School (DPS), Mathura Road, and Mount Abu School in Rohini, said that they had conducted the annual exams for classes 9 and 11 before the lockdown. Deeksha Khera, principal of DPS Mathura Road, said, “All our papers were conducted before the lockdown because generally exams are already done by that period. The results were declared online keeping social distancing measures in mind. If students fail in some papers, remedial measures will be taken.”The CBSE had also directed the schools to give class 9 and 11 students an opportunity of appearing in internal tests, online or offline, in case they did not clear them earlier. Salwan Public School in Rajinder Nagar is planning to avail themselves of option suggested by the board. “While our results were declared before the lockdown, some students did not clear the exam and were to appear in the compartment exam. For them, we plan to carry remedial measures in this period through e-learning resources and carry online assessment,” school principal Indu Khetarpal said.Experts said that it was the best alternative the CBSE could have come up with in the time of the pandemic. Shyama Chona, an education expert, said, “The schools can now test these students immediately after they get promoted to the next grades just to assess their learning levels. The teachers should know how much they know and how much they don’t. In this way, they can plan on how to bring the students at par in another two-three months in the same class.”Meanwhile, the students raised concerns over the possible learning gap that can arise because of the lockdown. “This lockdown will affect a crucial academic year for us. As soon as school reopens, there will be academic and extracurricular activities as well. We’ll be under extreme pressure,” Nashita Imtiaz, a Class 12 student of Springdales School in Dhaula Kuan, said. Some students also complained about logistical issues due to the lockdown and the feasibility of online lectures.”Classes have not started and most of us could not manage to procure our textbooks and mock tests before the lockdown. All learning is taking place through online classes, readings, and worksheets. There’s little classroom discussion. How much can one learn like that?” Rohit Kaushik, another Class 12 student, asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/most-pvt-schools-say-exams-ended-before-lockdown-govt-schools-mull-over-implementation-of-cbse-directive/story-fcPJNAXhu2OFO30oklxjPL.html
02-04-2020||Noida||Power demand fall causes discom ₹300cr revenue dip in March||Shutdown of industrial units and the subsequent decrease in power consumption, due to the 21-day nationwide lockdown, has resulted in a ₹300 crore-dip in March revenue of the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), the power distribution arm of the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL).The power consumption last month decreased to 525 megawatts (MW) per day, from the March average of around 1,000 MW per day. The revenue has been hit as commercial and industrial establishments are charged more than domestic consumer per unit of electricity, said officials.Virendra Nath Singh, PVVNL’s chief engineer, says that the dip might be even higher. “We are unable to generate revenue from anywhere. Industrial units are shut due to the Covid-19 crisis, while, as per the rules, our officials are not collecting dues from defaulters. Even the consumption of power, purchased through power purchase agreements (PPAs), has reduced by 50%. We have suffered a revenue loss of over ₹300 crore last month,” he said.Singh said that decreased power consumption will affect the cash flow of the distribution company (discom), which will lead to delay in payments to the power generation and transmission companies. “Industrial and commercial establishments account for about 40% of the power demand in the district. In March, the average power demand per day was supposed to be 1,000 MW in Noida, which fell to less than 525 MW per day,” he said.Outlining the important factors of the financial relief package given by the Centre, Singh said that there is a three-month moratorium on payments for power purchased by all state-owned discoms. “Under this package, the penalty for late payments has also been waived off and the security payment has been reduced to 50% for future purchases,” he said.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, on Wednesday, announced a waiver of fixed charges for industrial units, until the lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/power-demand-fall-causes-discom-300cr-revenue-dip-in-march/story-WWCV7nKbaaXHPX8DCR02gN.html
02-04-2020||Noida||Noida: 10 arrested for offering namaz on terrace despite lockdown||At least 10 men were arrested by the Sector 20 police on Wednesday and Thursday for gathering at a house in Sector 16 to offer namaaz despite the ongoing lockdown. The gathering was also in violation of Section 144 implemented in Gautam Budh Nagar district.According to the police, the incident came to light on Wednesday around 6 pm through a video which was being circulating online in which a dozen men could be seen offering namaaz on the terrace of a house in Sector 16’s JJ Colony.“It was found that the men had gathered during the day to offer prayers. While six of them--a father, four sons and a brother-in-law--are from the same family, the others were relatives and neighbours and had gathered at the house despite the lockdown,” said RK Singh, station house officer, Sector 20 police station.Section 144, which was first imposed in the district on February 16 for two months and then again on March 18, bars the assembly of more than four people at one place. The incident comes in the back drop of concerns over numerous religious gatherings across NCR and the country, held before countrywide lockdown came into force, becoming hot spots. “The owner of the house, Sadiq, was arrested yesterday while nine others were held later. Two of the men, including an elderly man, are missing. We hope to nab then soon because the lockdown is in force,” the SHO said.A three-week nationwide lockdown, to check the spread of COVID-19 in the country, was made effective March 25. “Wednesday’s incident was brought to our attention through social media after which we took suo motu cognizance and filed case against 12 people. None of them is a cleric and they lived separately so they should not have gathered in this manner at all,” said Singh.The suspects were booked under relevant sections of National Disaster Management Act-2005 , the Uttar Pradesh Epidemic Diseased Act-1897 and Indian Penal Code Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-10-arrested-for-offering-namaz-on-terrace-despite-lockdown/story-yiJBBCjpbNpNLFo9X1NJtL.html

Bhargava has been replaced by AP Chaturvedi, an official order said.The decision has been taken after UP principal secretary (medical education) Rajnish Dube submitted his report blaming former district magistrate BN Singh and Bhargava for poor performance in containing the spread of coronavirus in the district.During his visit to GB Nagar on March 30, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had pulled up Singh and Bhargava for the trail of employees at Ceasefire company in Sector 135 and their relatives who got infected with the deadly virus.Chaturvedi, joint director, Directorate General of Family Welfare, is appointed as the CMO of Gautam Budh Nagar with immediate effect, stated the order that was issued on Wednesday night by principal secretary (medical and health) Amit Mohan Prasad.As per the order, Bhargava has been attached with the chief executive officer of the Greater Noida Authority, Narendra Bhooshan.

Officials said they have released the wholesale and retail prices of 21 commodities which include sugar, pulses, oil, rice, salt, mustard oil and other spices.According to the list provided by the district administration, they have arrived at the wholesale and retail prices of the 21 commodities after holding discussions with different traders and market associations. However, officials said the price cap on the 21 commodities will be applicable only when they are sold in loose and not as packaged.“The packaged items and their different varieties, for instance, in the case of edible oils, will be determined by the maximum retail price (MRP). The 21 commodities which we have identified as those which are also sold in loose and the wholesalers and retailers will not charge anything more other than the rate determined by the district administration,” Shiv Prakash Shukla, city magistrate, said.As per the list, a kilogram of sugar must be sold at ₹37 in wholesale and at ₹39 in retail. The price of refined oil is capped at ₹93/litre for wholesale and ₹96/litre in retail.

02-04-2020||Mumbai||State govt records ₹25-K-cr revenue loss; set to worsen||The state government has recorded loss of over ~25,000 crore revenue, due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The first quarter of the new financial year, which began on April 1, is expected to be worse, according to finance officials.The Maharashtra government had estimated annual revenue of ~2.57 lakh crore from tax revenue at the rate of ~21,400 crore per month. However, given that tax collections are typically more than double in the last month of the financial year, monthly tax revenue was expected to be around ~44,000 crore. According to the preliminary estimates, the state was able to accumulate only around ~19,000 crore due to the major drop in collection of GST, excise and stamp duty following the coronavirus pandemic.“We were anyway expecting a drastic drop of ~16,000 crore in annual GST due to the slowdown, but the Covid-19 outbreak has now hit it further. Similarly, there will be a drop of ~2,600 crore in excise against the estimated annual revenue of ~17,977 crore. The losses from stamp duty are expected to be more than ~5,000 crore against the estimated annual revenue of ~29,500 crore. The state government’s decision of a 1% reduction in stamp duty had resulted in many homebuyers deferring their plans to the new financial year, hence we were expecting a drop in revenue. However, the pandemic has worsened it,” said an official from the finance department.Deputy chief and finance minister Ajit Pawar had demanded a special central package of ~25,000 crore, after reviewing the revenue deficit early this week. He also had reminded the Centre of the dues of ~16,654 crore owed towards the devolution of central taxes and grant-in-aide. The government is expecting April and the first quarter of 2020-21 to be worse with the drop in the collection to more than 60% of its tax revenue.“Against only one week of lockdown in March, April has two weeks [of lockdown] with no business and revenue. It will take at least a few months for the business and industrial sectors to regularise. It will result in major revenue losses to the government,” the finance department official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-govt-records-25-k-cr-revenue-loss-set-to-worsen/story-O4fAijZbczvMQy0AqtIlhM.html
02-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM briefs Sonia Gandhi on Covid-19, says no migrants issue in state||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday assured Congress president Sonia Gandhi that the state did not have a migrants issue in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown, as he had directed the industry to absorb all such labourers stranded in the state at this critical juncture.Amarinder gave the assurance after the Congress president raised the issue during a Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting held through video conference to take stock of the situation and formulate a strategy for the party to play a strong role in this hour of crisis, according to an official statement.The chief minister said extensive arrangements had been made by the government to provide shelter and food to the migrant labourers, who could not leave the state in view the nationwide restrictions and sealing of borders.“The state government is taking all steps to address the issues arising out of movement of migrant labour back to UP and Bihar. The issue has been contained due to timely intervention and we are making all arrangements for their food and shelter,” he informed the CWC.In response to the concern expressed by Sonia on the arrangements for farmers in view of the onset of the harvesting season, Amarinder said all arrangements were being made to ensure smooth operations, with strict maintenance of social distance protocols in mandis. The state had also urged the central government to incentivise farmers to go in for staggered transportation of their produce to the mandis for procurement. Briefing the Congress president about the current situation in Punjab, which has a large NRI population, Amarinder said the state had so far been able to contain the spread of the disease through intensive tracing and surveillance. The state government was also preparing to deal with the eventuality of the disease acquiring larger epidemic proportions by May or June, he told the meeting.The CM said the state department of health and family welfare was in regular touch with the Union ministry of health and family welfare and was adhering to all the protocols laid down by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the central ministry. Asked about the problems faced by the state, he told the CWC that it was not receiving its GST share from the Centre, which was causing serious financial problems. On its part, the state government had sanctioned Rs 20 crore to all districts to ensure food and shelter for homeless and underprivileged, among other measures taken to combat the crisis, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-briefs-sonia-on-covid-19-says-no-migrants-issue-in-state/story-LSDL18Ctn2sTWe73hSNw7O.html
02-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram police identify 25 residents who attended Tableeghi Jamaat event||The police have so far identified 25 people from the city who attended the Tableeghi Jamaat congregation mid-March at Nizamuddin in Delhi.The police said 12 of the identified persons were sent to a quarantine facility in Sector 9 on Thursday morning, while10 were sent to the facility Wednesday night. Two persons are yet to be traced, they added.One of the attendees, a 38-year-old-man, whose samples were sent for tests Wednesday night tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, officials said.Police commissioner Muhammad Akil on Thursday said the police are coordinating with the chief medical officer and are sending all the identified people directly to the health department to ensure the samples of the identified persons are collected and they are put under quarantine. “We have to be very careful and have to take precautionary measures so that the people are protected,” Akil said.Police teams are also deployed at the quarantine facility set up at the Sector 9 government postgraduate college by the district health team. The police personnel have been provided with Personal Protective Kits (PPE), safety gear like zero power glasses, gloves, masks, shoe covers, head covers, and hand gloves to ensure their safety. Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, said, “We have taken the samples of those identified by the police. Their samples have been sent for testing to Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak. They will be kept in the quarantine facility at the Sector 9 facility for 14 days. Police teams have been deployed at the facility so that the identified persons do not leave the centre. The police personnel have been provided with safety kits too to prevent contamination.”Haryana’s health minister, Anil Vij, on Wednesday, had said that at least 524 people who attended the Jamaat congregation were traced in Haryana. The congregation has emerged as India’s biggest Covid-19 hot spot till now.The Haryana Police have also formed a special task force with 500 police personnel to identify Jamaat attendees in the state. All crime investigating agencies have been roped in to identify people who attended the congregation.All inter-district borders in the state were sealed on Thursday to ensure that those who attended the congregation cannot enter or exit a district. “ Gurugram borders connecting Jhajjar, Rewari, Delhi, Nuh, Palwal are no longer open for people except for those supplying essential commodities or those facing medical emergencies,” the police commissioner said. “We are even checking all the ambulances plying on the roads near the borders to ensure no affected person is taking advantage of the situation,” he said.33 from Pataudi, Dhankot test negativeAccording to the CMO, 27 persons from Pataudi and six from Gurugram’s Dhankot, who were put under quarantine by the district administration and the police, tested negative for Covid-19 on Thursday.

02-04-2020||Gurugram||March air was ‘moderate’, but pollution dipped sharply since March 25||In March, the city recorded an average daily air quality index (AQI) value of 113, implying that it was experiencing largely ‘moderate’ air quality over the past month. However, the city has seen a sharp dip in pollution levels since March 25, when a nationwide lockdown to contain the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was enforced. Since the lockdown began, most vehicles have been off the streets and Gurugram’s air quality has ranged between 42 to 77, in terms of its daily average AQI value, while levels of particulate matter have remained within nationally prescribed ‘safe’ limits.The city’s average AQI value for February, as per Central Pollution Control Board data, was 190 (also in the ‘moderate’ category). “The air quality has remained in the ‘moderate’ category over February and March, but with a slight improvement due to the lockdown, as well as the rainfall earlier in the month. We will see an even sharper improvement between March and April, as the lockdown continues, mainly due to the shutdown of industries and lack of vehicles on roads,” Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist, said. Morning and evening peaks in the level of PM 2.5 (due to daily rush-hour commutes causing heavy traffic movement) have also flattened in the days since the lockdown came into force, according to an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Data from three of Gurugram’s air quality monitors—at Gwal Pahadi, Sector 51, and Vikas Sadan—confirms that this is the case. All three monitors show PM2.5 to be at an average value between 40 and 50µg/m³ per day over the past 10 days, which is within the national safe limit of 60µg/m³. These monitors also show a sharp reduction in the levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which can be directly attributed to the absence of vehicles on city streets, and closure of non-essential industries, both of which burn fuel and are major sources of NO2 in the atmosphere. “This analysis brings out the pronounced effect of traffic on hourly pollution trend and daily exposures to toxic vehicular pollution. With traffic minimised, hourly trends plummet. This is sharply evident in NO2 trends,” the CSE said in its analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/march-air-was-moderate-but-pollution-dipped-sharply-since-march-25/story-FLRtY79CN9ROyRCY9pGDxL.html
02-04-2020||Gurugram||Pandemic, lockdown likely to hit sales of residential units by 25-30%: Report||The Covid-19 pandemic that has forced the country into lockdown is likely to adversely affect the residential real estate sector, which has already been grappling with reduced demand for the last few years, according to a report.The report, released by a private real estate consultant, Anarock, on Wednesday, predicts a 25-30% decline in the sale of housing units this year, compared to 2019. With a large number of construction workers returning their hometowns, projects across the country could be delayed by a further eight to nine months.City-based realtors and consultants echoed the views, saying that all efforts by developers to stay afloat by reducing supply, completing projects and launching affordable projects will be for nought due to the Covid-19 pandemic.As per the report, 2.61 lakh residential units were sold in top seven cities in 2019 and the number could fall to 1.70 lakh and 1.96 lakh units. The pandemic could also lead to a decline in new launches, from 2.37 lakh units in 2019, to anywhere between 1.66 lakh -1.78 lakh units, according to the report.The top seven real estate markets in the country from which data has been collected are Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Delhi-NCR, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Kolkata.Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock property consultants, says, “Besides demand-supply decline in 2020, significant new trends will emerge across segments of Indian real estate. New business models will be tried, making players more reliant on technology for ensuring business continuity.”Developers said that due lockdown, there are no site visits, discussions, documentation or closures, which indicate a difficult next few quarters.In a earlier report released on March 25, Anarock had stated that about 15.62 lakh units that are under construction in top seven realty markets across the country will be delayed. MMR accounts for nearly 4.65 lakh such units while NCR, which includes Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad, has over 4.25 lakh units in various stages of construction, which are likely to be delayed. All these units were launched between 2013 and 2019.To offset the problems, developers want the government to announce relief measures — relaxation in payment of licence fees, taxes and other levies — for the realty sector. Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HRERA) should also take the delays into account and provide relaxation on late penalties, they said.Pradeep Aggarwal, founder and chairman, Signature Global, a city-based realty company, said that to help businesses, there is need for suspending debt servicing, reducing interest rates across businesses and re-scheduling loan payments, among other things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/pandemic-lockdown-likely-to-hit-sales-of-residential-units-by-25-30-report/story-9PJbcKvXbg7PbyC62cS1tO.html
02-04-2020||Gurugram||At Mapsko Casa Bella, residents ensure all follow lockdown rules||As the country remains in lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), authorities and many citizens are doing everything in their power to ensure people stay at home. At Mapsko Casa Bella, a condominium in Sector 82, residents are playing an active role in dissuading others from stepping out. All residents in the society have been advised against taking walks in the society’s lawns. While most adhere to the rules, some still venture out for fresh air and to discourage such residents, the society has opted for some negative reinforcements.The residents start clapping at those who violate the lockdown to embarrass them for not staying indoors. “The other day, I saw a resident taking a walk in the evening. When other residents noticed it from their balconies, they started clapping and made the walkers aware that they are walking in the park while the rest are staying indoors to keep everyone safe. It naturally embarrassed the walkers who do this often,” said Dr Rajesh Yadav, a resident and member of the condominium’s Covid-19 doctors’ group. The doctors’ group was formed to provide free consultations to residents as well as help formulate a set of precautions to be taken to keep the infection at bay.Yadav adds that since he has to step out to go to the hospital every day, he has isolated himself from the rest of his family. The moment he enters the house after coming from the hospital, he immediately changes his clothes and takes a shower. He remains in a room for most of the time, he said.“The only time I meet my family while having food. It is the only time I allow myself to be with them. This is the best way to ensure that no one gets infected and that everyone stays safe. My family is in quarantine because of me; they don’t go out to meet anyone or invite anyone in to the house,” said Yadav who lives in one of the villas at the condominium.Some of the preventive measures taken by the condominium to prevent the virus from spreading, are maintaining only one exit gate, maintaining records of residents going outside the society and hand-washing and sanitising at the gate.Only one gate at the condominium has been left open and the residents have also installed facilities to wash hands at the gate apart from providing hand sanitisers. Residents and the condominium staff alike are made to wash their hands before entering the society.“It is mandatory for anyone passing through the gate to wash their hands. They have to get down from their car, wash their hands, show their identity card and then go inside,” said Inder Bir Singh, maintenance head at the residency. Records of any resident that leaves the society are also maintained.The society has also cut down on number of staff inside the premises. The residents have also formed a special 15-member group of staffers, called the Casa Bella Emergency Response Team, who are responsible for assisting families in quarantine and helping senior citizens living alone apart from providing other services to the residents.“The idea behind the quick response team is to make sure that there is always a set of hands ready to tackle any issue that arises in the condominium. This includes attending to maintenance breakdowns, contacting emergency services, providing ration to those who are unable to step out and others,” said Satyavir Singh, president, Casa Bella Condo Association.The condominium staff has been provided with accommodation inside the society’s premises. They are also being provided food, cooking space and ration.The residency, which houses close to 850 families, has no grocery store on the premises but has a store attached to the property that has an outside entrance. To maintain social distancing at the store, the management discourages residents to step out to purchase essential items. Instead, the residents can place their orders at the helpdesk in their building or to the building’s supervisor in-charge. The order is then forwarded to the store and the staff delivers the goods to the residents.The society has allowed delivery of online orders of essential supplies to residents. Every package is dropped at the gate by the delivery agent, sanitised and then delivered to the residents by the condominium staff.Inder maintained that if the national lockdown were to continue till the end of the month, even then the society is equipped enough to sustain itself. He also often pens down circulars on tips and tricks to ace staying at home and mails them to all residents each morning. Some of the subjects covered by him in these circulars are how to be active at home, do’s and don’ts of social distancing, being energy efficient during lockdown and others.“I usually write them down in the afternoon after reading government directives online. Then these are mailed early morning to each resident. It is just a small way of keeping things interesting,” said Inder, a former army officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/at-mapsko-casa-bella-residents-ensure-all-follow-lockdown-rules/story-bYiZKTg46wl4zkjFy6PJxJ.html
02-04-2020||Chandigarh||Refused rice, Punjab govt to start giving free wheat, pulses in a week||The Punjab government will start free distribution of five kilograms of wheat per person and one kg of pulses per household to 36 lakh poor households for the next three months under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) in a week.The state has been allocated additional 2.12 lakh metric tonnes (MTs) of wheat by the Union ministry of food, consumer affairs, and public distribution for the April-June period for distribution to 1.41 crore beneficiaries identified under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) to ensure availability of food to the poor during the national lockdown. Of this, 11,565 MTs of wheat will be distributed to 1.92 lakh ‘poor of the poorest’ households identified under Antyodaya Anna Yojana and remaining 2 lakh MTs to about 33.43 lakh priority households in the state. This is in addition to the subsidised wheat provided to all these ration cardholders.“The centre has allocated wheat, but we are still waiting for 10,800 MT of pulses which are expected to arrive from Rajasthan in the next three to four days. The distribution of wheat and pulses for three months will be done in one go and will be started in about a week’s time,” a senior food and civil supplies department said. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had on March 26 announced the free supply of an additional 5kg of wheat or rice per person per month and 1kg of preferred pulses every month for three months to deal with the economic impact of the lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.The state government had requested the food, consumer affairs, and public distribution ministry to divide free ration into 10kg of wheat and 5kg of rice as the latter is ready to cook and also because of food habits of people from other states who have settled in Punjab and are covered under the NFSA. However, the central ministry did not accede to the request and allocated only wheat, citing limited availability of rice stock. Haryana and Rajasthan are the only other states in the country that have not been allocated rice for free distribution under the scheme. Overall, the Centre has allocated 36.88 lakh MTs of rice and 3.58 lakh MTs of wheat per month to the states and union territories under PMGKAY.Similarly, the Punjab government had on March 27 requested the Centre for four varieties of pulses, including moong whole, moongh dhuli, moong chilka, and urad sabut, as per the guidelines which mentioned preferred pulses, but has been allowed only chana dal (split chickpea lentils). The dal will be supplied by National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited (NAFED).“The state food and civil supplies department will first supply the free ration through the ration depots in a staggered manner to avoid overcrowding and subsequently give the subsidised foodgrains to them under the targeted public distribution scheme,” the official said. Principal Secretary, health and family welfare, Anurag Agarwal also issued an order on Wednesday to continue the suspension of biometric authentication of the NFSA beneficiaries through the electronic point of sale (ePoS) devices at fair price shops during ration distribution till April 15.In addition, the state government will supply 15 lakh packets of dry ration, each containing 10kg wheat flour, 2kg dal (lentils) and 2kg sugar, to daily wagers and unorganised labourers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/refused-rice-punjab-govt-to-start-giving-free-wheat-pulses-in-a-week/story-dvx3Yla2geT5eXgbpf10HO.html
02-04-2020||Gurugram||Haryana CM orders food packets for all truckers ferrying essential goods||Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has asked all districts in the state to arrange food for hundreds of truck drivers ferrying essential commodities on the expressway and state highways, as all eateries and dhabas are closed due to the lockdown. There are nearly 800 trucks supplying raw material across the state who have been granted permission to enter the borders. The drivers of these trucks — ferrying essential food items — have complained of finding no eating places on the highways and expressway, due to which they had to work on an empty stomach. Some had even threatned to stop ferrying goods.Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said Khattar has now issued instructions that food packets and water should be made available at all the toll plazas for truck drivers crossing the district borders. “Food packets are available at all the toll plazas. There is no shortage of food and water for them. The staff of the toll plaza and volunteers have been assigned the task to ensure no one leaves without collecting their food packets,” he said.Khattar said the government was taking care of every person involved in supply of essential goods. “We have directed all the district police chiefs to ensure that there is no disruption in the supply chain for commodities across the state. There is no shortage of essential commodities across the state. We are focusing mainly on rice, wheat, pulses, vegetables and fruits, salt, along with petroleum products, among other things, which are all essential commodities and raw material required for the manufacturing,” Khattar told HT.Gurugram commissioner of police, Muhammad Akil, said that directions have been given to all police personnel deployed on the borders to ensure the trucks and vehicles carrying raw material and food supply are allowed to pass after conducting thorough checks. “We have directed to check if any person is taking advantage of the situation and trying to cross the borders in trucks carrying essential goods. Strict action will be taken against drivers who are found misusing the facility. No vehicle is made to wait at the border if their documentation is complete,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-cm-orders-food-packets-for-all-truckers-ferrying-essential-goods/story-xZb4CdkRSHVr6RJvmwyObN.html
02-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Property owners waive off rent to help migrant workers||To help the migrant labourers and distressed workers who have lost their jobs due to the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the Sars-Cov-2, several property and land owners in city have decided to not only waive off rent for their tenants for this month but also to distribute meals and other essential items. The city has over 40 villages where around five-six lakh migrant workers live as tenants in single-room tenements or similar units. Living on their salaries from month to month or day to day, the workers have been caught on the wrong foot as they don’t have money to pay rentals due to lack of work.In Chakkarpur village, which is adjacent to MG Road, a majority of the property owners have decided that they would not seek rent from their tenants in view of the prevailing lockdown. “There are at least 10,000 to 12,000 families living in this village and we have decided to help them by not asking for rent till the situation improves. Most landlords are waiving it off, some have decided to delay the collection for a month or two,” said Anil Yadav, the former sarpanch of the village.The villagers are also providing cooked meals, groceries and other essential items to the workers. The village elders, who are participating in the relief measures, also said that though these workers were crucial not only to the city’s economy, they helped pump in a lot of money in the coffers of the local businesses.Rakesh Daultabad, MLA, Badshahpur, on Wednesday interacted with a number of property owners and exhorted them to waive off the rent and provide help to migrant labourers. “We will provide all help to migrant workers and many owners have agreed to forego rent. The migrant workers are part of and parcel of the city’s economy and the society, and they would be cared for,” he said.Local also said that apart from helping the workers with rent and food, they are voluntarily sanitising adjoining colonies to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Aryan Dahiya, a member of Team Dhanwapur, a group of 15 people from the village who are working to sanitise adjoining areas and are helping migrants, said that he has decided to waive off the rent owed by 20 families for now that are living on properties owned by his family. “We have a 15 members’ team and it is engaged in sanitation works in Tekchand Nagar, Surat Nagar, Ram Vihar, Dhanwapur and adjoining areas. We are spending money from our own pocket to fight the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Dahiya, adding that other villagers are also doing the same.Officials engaged in relief efforts also say that it is because of the support of locals and NGO that the city has not witnessed a reverse migration, the likes of which were witnessed in neighbouring Delhi. “About 80% workers in the city have stayed put after the lockdown was announced as they were assured of help and support by locals,” said an official, requesting anonymity. Basai village, which is a large conglomeration of unauthorised colonies and urbanised village areas, locals say they are providing food and other essentials to migrant labourers. “I have five families living on rent and I have waived rent charges off for now,” said Raj Singh, a Basai resident.In Gadoli village, which is on the outskirts of the city, Harish Mehlawat, a local, said they are working with the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram and other NGOs to provide food to over 1,000 migrant labourers staying in the nearby Ramprashtha city. “Many of us have contributed in cash and kind, some have waived off rent and all efforts are being made to help the distressed workers,” he said. Anirudh Saxena, who works in a private firm and lives in a rented accommodation in the Basai area, said that his landlord has asked him not to pay the rent if there is any delay in salary payment, or in the event of termination of job. “I am thankful to the locals who are supporting us. I will pay my rent later and this has reassured other tenants as well, who are not leaving the city anymore,” said Saxena, adding that this has come as a big relief to many who work as daily wagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-property-owners-waive-off-rent-to-help-migrant-workers/story-hNn7Uhd5ldyxGHQCizW8XM.html
02-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM prohibits religious gatherings, orders tracking of Markaz attendees||With infections linked to a March event of the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi leading to a countrywide surge in Covid-19 cases, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday completely prohibited all gatherings, including religious, in the state.The chief minister said the state government will impose a total ban on all congregations, irrespective of the religion involved. “I will personally talk to the acting jathedar of the Akal Takht,” he said, directing the state chief secretary to discuss the matter with the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) in view of the upcoming Baisakhi festival.Amarinder also ordered 21 days of quarantine for all those who had returned to the state from Nizamuddin (Delhi) since January this year, and asked the police and administrative officials to move aggressively to track, trace and isolate all such people.He directed the police and health department to constitute special teams to track and follow up on those who had returned to Punjab from Nizamuddin. The chief minister issued these instructions while reviewing the current situation through a video conference with DCs and other senior officials of the civil administration and police department. The state authorities were initially slow in tracking and tracing the Nizamuddin returnees and swung into action after reports of a surge driven by infections among the Jamaat’s members came from different parts of the country.200 FROM PUNJAB VISITED NIZAMUDDINAccording to DGP Dinkar Gupta, some 200 persons from Punjab had visited Nizamuddin and returned here, at different times, with 12 districts believed to be affected. They were being tracked, along with some from others states who had arrived in Punjab for Tablighi Jamaat work. The health department was debriefing and contact tracing them, though, so far, no corona confirmed cases had come to light.Health secretary Anurag Agarwal informed the chief minister that the department had so far received a list of 125 of these persons, of whom 73 had been tracked and samples collected in 25 cases, some of whom had come to Mansa as late as March 19. As a precautionary measure, all of them had been placed in quarantine, he added.The Kapurthala deputy commissioner informed the CM that 31 people who returned from Nizamuddin had been quarantined though they had been found to be asymptomatic so far. In Patiala, too, 29 of them had been quarantined but there were no symptoms shown by them.On a suggestion from director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta, the CM ordered quarantine of the Pakistani nationals who were in Amritsar, saying the state could not afford to take any chances at this critical juncture.The Amritsar DC said Pakistan had given permission to allow entry of four of its citizens who had come from Delhi, of whom three had tested positive. The BSF and immigration staff who handled them had been quarantined, he said, but added that there were a few more Pakistanis still stuck in Amritsar. Amarinder also warned the officials against any complacency in terms of curfew enforcement and law and order, as well as relief measures and management of essential supplies. He inquired about the steps being taken to protect and provide for the migrants who are stranded in Punjab due to the sealing of the borders and other restrictions.The Pathankot DC said 111 migrant labourers from J&K were stuck in the district and had been accommodated in marriage palaces and other places, with strict social distancing norms being maintained. Three had been quarantined as they had fever and cough.

The village was chosen for the cremation only because it was on the outskirts. Villagers were apprehensive of the fear of spread of the infection. Khalsa, a Padma Shri awardee, had died due to covid-19 on Thursday about 4:30am. Finally, Khalsa was cremated in a private field at Fatehgarh Shukar Chak village, 2km away. In the afternoon, residents, along with local Congress leader Harpal Singh Verka, had locked the crematorium. “We fear that the smoke will affect the health of people living around the crematorium, since this disease is not curable,” said Harpal. The two main crematoriums, the Durgiana Temple and the Gurdwara Shaheed Ganj, are in densely-populated areas. SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said, “Nothing is as sorrowful as the stand of the villagers, who have invited shame for the Sikh community. We will build a memorial for Khalsa.” Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said, “It is the worst degradation of human values to not give space for cremation to the man, who served at the Harmandar Sahib for decades.” SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said the ragi had been insulted and the CM must not allow such incidents to recur. Akal Takht head granthi Giani Malkeet Singh performed the last rites.

02-04-2020||Lucknow||Three more corona suicides in west UP||Three people, including a government employee, committed suicide in the region in the past 24 hours for fear of Covid 19. While one person each died in Saranpur and Shamli, another ended his life in Bareilly.With this, the suicide toll due to corona fear has touched seven in the state.In Saharanpur, a 38-year-old clerk in Ganna Vikas Parishad office in Shermau area hanged himself from a ceiling fan in his office on Wednesday evening, said circle officer of Nakur area Yatendra Singh Nagar.“A suicide note recovered from his pocket said he was dying as per his own wish because he was afraid of getting infected by corona virus,” the CO said.SSP of Saharanpur Dinesh Kumar P said that the man committed suicide under depression. His body was sent for post mortem examination and people were told to take necessary precautions instead of fearing the virus. In a similar incident, a 35-year-old vegetable vendor hanged himself in a quarantine ward in Shamli on Thursday morning. His sample had been sent for testing in Meerut lab and the report was expected on Thursday. Vineet Jaiswal, SP Shamli said, “A ward boy spotted his body hanging from the ceiling fan and chief medical officer ( CMO) Sanjay Bhatnagar informed authorities about the incident”.The deceased was a vegetable vendor in Delhi and had returned to his village on March 30. The next day he approached health officials and requested them to admit him to hospital as he was feeling sick. He was admitted to the quarantine ward and his sample was sent to Meerut lab on Wednesday. The report was supposed to come on Thursday. The SP said the body was sent for post mortem examination.In Bareilly, a 23-year-old migrant labourer who escaped from a quarantine centre to meet his family in Lakhimpur, allegedly committed suicide after learning that the police were searching for him.The victim, youngest among six siblings, was quarantined at a school on the village outskirts on returning from Gurugram on March 28.According to police, he had escaped from the quarantine centre twice to meet his family, but officials thwarted his attempts on both the occasions and brought him back to the camp.On Tuesday afternoon, police said he again escaped from the camp and went to his village to meet his family. When he learnt that the police were looking for him, he fled from his house and later his body was found hanging on the village outskirts.The police added the body was sent for autopsy and the district administration would provide compensation to the bereaved family.Mitauli SDM Digvijay Singh said, “The victim was quarantined following the government’s directions. We even informed him that isolation was a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of his family members and neighbours. The victim had fled from the camp to meet his family. When police reached the village searching for him, he escaped and was later found hanging.”Maigalganj police station SHO Chandrakant Singh said, “It appears that the victim took the extreme step as he started panicking at the quarantine centre despite repeated attempts by officials to make him understand that it was just a precautionary measure. Authorities have provided proper food and other necessary facilities at the centre. We are investigating the matter and a case will be registered based on the findings.”FLASHBACKOn Tuesday, a farmer, who was suffering from fever and cold, committed suicide to ‘’save his entire village from being infected”. The incident took place in Mathura.Earlier on March 24, a young man who had been suffering from fever and cough, committed suicide in Kanpur by hanging himself because he feared he was suffering from corona virus.Last month, in two separate incidents, two youths had committed suicide in Hapur and Bareilly because they also believed that they were suffering from the deadly virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/three-more-corona-suicides-in-west-up/story-UMD1lLH6Nj9JRaiNuE74eN.html
02-04-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 outbreak: Cases confined to 7 Punjab districts, NRI belt worst-hit||The positive cases of coronavirus in Punjab are restricted to seven of the 22 districts so far, with nearly 65% infected patients belonging to the Doaba region, known as the state’s NRIs belt.Of a total of 47 cases, 31 have been reported from SBS Nagar (19), Hoshiarpur (7) and Jalandhar (5) districts — all falling in Doaba. No case has been reported in the region’s fourth district, Kapurthala, as yet. The state’s other districts with positive cases are Mohali (10), Ludhiana (3), Amritsar (2) and Patiala (1).At five deaths, Punjab is fourth among states in terms of Covid-19 casualties in India followed by Maharashtra (13), Gujarat (7) and Madhya Pradesh (6), according to the Union health ministry. As per the data compiled under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) of the state health and family welfare department, testing was done in the rest of the 15 districts on 300 people put under quarantine but all samples turned out to be negative.Of the 1,434 samples tested in the state till date, 1,236 have been found negative while reports of 151 are awaited. “Due to an aggressive awareness campaign on the ground and, of course, the lockdown, the virus has not been able to find a footprint in 15 districts. If people adhere to the rules of social distancing, we will be able to win this battle,” Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, the health department’s Covid-19 spokesperson said.State health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu claimed things were quite under control in Punjab. “If we keep aside SBS Nagar which has 28 positive patients who came in direct or indirect contact with 70-year-old Baldev Singh, a raagi (Gurbani singer), and two of his associates who returned from Germany via Italy in a connected flight, Punjab’s tally will look satisfactory. The department has controlled the situation in SBS Nagar as well,” said Sidhu. ‘Jamaat participants pose bigger challenge’People from or in Punjab who attended the controversial Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Delhi’s Nizzamuddin are set to become new challenge for the state, said medical experts.The total number of persons who attended the gathering has increased from nine on Wednesday to 125 on Thursday and the hunt is on to trace more.“Even as we have been able to trace 75 people of the 125, finding their contacts has become a serious challenge for us, given the rate at which these participants are turning positive in other states,” a health department official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-17-outbreak-cases-confined-to-7-punjab-districts-nri-belt-worst-hit/story-WbqVZt2KojZtGoTif6PAfJ.html

Dubey said it was more important for UP discoms to stop payment of fixed charges to generators as UP government had announced that industries were exempted from paying fixed charges of electricity to discoms during lockdown.“The imposition of lockdown qualifies as force majeure under the PPA as events and circumstances are beyond the control of the state discoms,” he said.He further said in view of a sudden drastic reduction in demand load, discoms should immediately stop purchasing power from these power plants till the things got normal. “Thus already financially crunched discoms will not be further burdened by paying fixed charges without purchasing electricity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/stop-paying-fixed-charges-to-pvt-generators-aipef/story-iHbKyqPhIsr2BlJ30Hae7H.html

The college goers are at the forefront when it comes to procuring essential food items, medicines and other necessities for those daily wage earners who have been an integral part of their once active campus life — from a bun tikki vendor to a construction labourer. “Reality hit me hard when 45-year-old year old Ganga Devi, who sells sanitary napkins in a slum near Kashmere Gate, told me that feeding her family had become impossible because of the lockdown,” says Sanskar Saraf, a B Com (Hons) student at Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi University, adding that he got motivated to help more daily wage earners and “Spoke to them about their basic requirements, jotted all the government schemes they could avail, and even helped them avail these schemes.” READ | Delhi University staff to contribute day’s salary in fight against Covid-19Students of Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT-D) have managed to raise money, with the support of their faculty members, to fund the living of some workers on their campus, which includes about 350 daily wage construction labourers who have been stuck there due to the lockdown. Pranay Piyush, a final year student of textile engineering at IIT-D recounts, “It all began with a campus wide student initiative to extend financial support to the rickshaw pullers on our campus. Soon our efforts caught attention of our faculty members, and a Benevolent Fund Managing Committee was set-up, which helped to bring in more funds on a larger scale to extend the contributions to mess workers, construction workers and other such people who had been working to make our lives on campus easier. We have now received a a total contribution of around ₹12 lakh, in two days, from the students, faculty and our alumni. I have no words to express how glad I feel that so many students came forward to contribute for this cause. I am grateful to have been a part of this initiative.” The students of Jamia Millia Islamia are all heart. Hundreds of students have come forward to help the daily wage earners in their own capacity, and funds have been collected via online platforms from each department. Adeeba Ashraf, a graduate in Bachelor of Dental Surgery from Jamia Millia Islamia, says, “The students of Jamia Millia Islamia have been collecting money, buying essential items and delivering them on scooties and bikes. I believe the faculty is also thinking of contributing one day’s salary to the PM’s funds.

To help the daily wage workers, there was a core team of students that got in touch with the communities of daily earners, and asked them about their problems and challenges. Students then created a list of beneficiaries near the communities that are ready to help and then they became facilitators for solving problems by connecting the beneficiaries with the daily wagers.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddha Follow @htdelhi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/covid-19-students-rush-to-aid-daily-wagers-in-and-around-campus/story-sUtfBQTb6F8viQFxwczsaO.html

Though not in use since the MSRDC built another bridge parallel to the old one while constructing the expressway, it had earlier decided to retain Amrutanjan bridge.The iconic bridge, often the attraction of tourists for taking photographs of the picturesque Khandala ghat, was causing traffic interruptions after the expressway was built. As the pillars of the bridge were coming in the way for commuters and slowing traffic, MSRDC had written to Indian railways, the custodian of the bridge, for its demolition.“While the planning to demolish the Amrutanjan bridge was on for long, it wasn’t feasible due to the otherwise heavy traffic movement on the expressway. However, with lockdown and deserted expressway, MSRDC has decided to raze the bridge,” said Digambar P Pradhan, superintendent of police, highway safety patrol (HSP), Thane, in his order.According to the police, the bridge often lead to traffic congestion near the old structure. British officer Captain Hughes, responsible for developing railway tracks between Mumbai and Lonavla, built the bridge in one year. The bridge later became a vital link between the two cities of the state. The structure later came to be known as Amrutanjan bridge as a giant advertisement by balm producing firm Amrutanjan was put up near the bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-effect-amrutanjan-bridge-to-become-history-finally/story-2UV96SHeE7lkKzrQ7SUdsI.html
02-04-2020||Lucknow||Outer gate of Sibtainabad Imambada in Lucknow collapses||The outer gate of Lucknow’s historical and heavily encroached Sibtainabad Imambada in Hazratganj collapsed on Thursday afternoon. No one was hurt as shops in the area were closed due to the ongoing lockdown, said officials. The 173-year-old gate was encroached by some shops, including a restaurant, a rejuvenation centre and a paan shop, said a rescue operation staff. “On a normal day, the incident could have wreaked havoc as the market area remains crowded throughout the day,” he said.District magistrate Abhishek Prakash said, “There has been no casualty. Teams of Lucknow Municipal Corporation, district administration and the police are carrying out a joint operation to remove the debris.”Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said he spoke to the district magistrate and LDA V-C for setting up a high powered committee to probe into the collapse of the structure. Prima facie, it seemed that alterations in the structure, including digging of the base, were on. But this has to be ascertained by a team of experts, he said. “The incident calls for a check of structural strength of all the old buildings in Hazratganj and its vicinity. Those guilty will not be spared. The officials responsible for the upkeep of such heritage buildings,” added Tripathi.The Sibtainabad Imambada, situated in the heart of the city, was constructed by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah in 1847 for holding majlis and carry other religious practices during Moharram. Heritage experts said administration officials never made any attempt to get the area and the old gate freed from encroachers.“The gate was encroached by a restaurant and some shops for decades now,” said Mohammad Haider, mutawali of Imambada, Sibtainabad. Haider said he had written many letters to the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) and also informed the local administration about the possible threat to the old structure.A few others also claimed that the foundation of many of such old buildings weakened due to Lucknow Metro’s underground work. Kumar Keshav, MD, UP Metro Rail Corporation, said: “Metro conducted a study before the construction of underground metro line in Hazratganj.” “The lines don’t pass through the place where the incident has occurred. Besides, train operations were not on for the last 10 days. Above all, plying of Metro doesn’t cause enough vibrations to cause damage to a building,” said Keshav.Santosh Kumar, SHO, Hazratganj, who was on the spot with his team, said: “We rushed to the spot as soon as we heard about the collapse. No FIR has been written so far. No loss of life or injury has been reported.”Heritage enthusiast Mohammad Haider said he had lodged a police complaint and named a restaurant owner and another outlet for the encroachments.Sangeeta Agarwal, owner of Ayurveda Rejuvenation Centre, said: “Fortunately there are no casualties. A portion of our balcony and hoarding were damaged. May be there was some fault with the building itself and hence it collapsed,” she said. However, restaurant owner could not be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/outer-gate-of-sibtainabad-imambada-in-ganj-collapses/story-mSUlz8HJap1zyLvft3mLMN.html

02-04-2020||Delhi||Jamia student held for involvement in north-east Delhi riots||The Delhi Police on Thursday said they had arrested a PhD scholar from Jamia Millia Islamia in connection with a case of rioting and criminal conspiracy pertaining to February’s riots in north-east Delhi that claimed the lives of 53 people and left over 400 injured. His alleged “involvement in the conspiracy to instigate the riots, funding the violence and the agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Shaheen Bagh” is also being probed, officers privy to the case said.Joint commissioner of police (special cell) Neeraj Thakur confirmed the arrest of Meeran Haider but did not share further details.A senior police officer from the special cell, who did not want to be named, said that Haidar is the president of Bihar-based political party Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)’s youth wing—Chhatra RJD—Delhi unit. Haider is currently being interrogated at the special cell’s Lodhi Colony office.According to the officer, Haider, a resident of Jamia Nagar, was served a notice on March 31, asking him to join the probe in the case of rioting and criminal conspiracy that was registered by the crime branch after the north-east Delhi riots. Haider was asked to reach the special cell’s Lodhi Colony office at 10am on April 1 (Wednesday).“We arrested Haider in the case, as we have enough evidence to prove the charges against him. His role in funding the riots and anti-CAA protests is being probed,” the special cell officer cited above said.The Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) alleged that Haider was called for interrogation by the Delhi Police’s special cell at their office in Lodhi Road on Wednesday.“Yesterday around 10pm, men in uniform had approached his local residence enquiring about him. He was taken into custody around 10.30pm on Wednesday. The JCC demands that he must be immediately released as all charges against him are baseless,” said the committee in a statement.The University administration said they have not been informed about the incident by the police and denied to comment further.The JNU unit of RJD on Thursday also issued a statement demanding his release. “Delhi Police had asked Meeran Haider, the president of the young RJD, Delhi, to join the investigation and then arrested him without giving any valid reason. Today, when the whole country and the whole world is busy dealing with this pandemic, the government is arresting innocents like him. We demand his immediate release,” the statement read.On March 9, the special cell had arrested Mohammad Danish, a 33-year-old member of the Popular Front of India (PFI), in connection with the case on similar charges.Danish’s arrest came a day after the special cell arrested a couple—Jahanzaib Sami,36, and his 39-year-old wife Hina Bashir Beigh—for their alleged links with the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP), instigating protests against the CAA and spreading hatred between communities in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jamia-student-held-for-involvement-in-north-east-delhi-riots/story-9b7dqUAOb4nY5GSqzWJnSI.html

02-04-2020||Mumbai||Senior citizens tribunals can evict abusive children from ancestral properties: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has held that senior citizens tribunals, established under provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, can evict abusive children from the resistance of their aged parents even if it is an ancestral property.Justice Sadhana Jadhav recently rejected an appeal filed by an Andheri (West) resident and his wife after the sub-divisional officer (SDO), Mumbai suburban district on October 17, 2018 passed an order evicting them from the residence of the man’s aged parents.The order came on an application filed by the aged parents invoking provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. They complained the disputes arose between them and their son and daughter-in-law after the latter purportedly forged their signatures and withdrew a total of ₹2.26 crore from their bank accounts. This, according to the parents, happened when they went to Singapore. After realising that their son and daughter-in-law took the money, the couple lodged a complaint against them. They, however, had to arrange bail for their son as he threatened to commit suicide behind bars.The parents alleged they had to face systematic harassment thereafter and eventually approached the senior citizens tribunal in April 2018.Their son and daughter-in-law then moved the HC challenging the order on the grounds that the property was not self-acquired property of the parents and that they have been living at the premises for a long time and argued that the SDO could not have evicted them from the property at the behest of his aged parents.Justice Jadhav refused to accept the argument and said although the property is ancestral one, the court cannot be oblivious to the fact that the interest in the property would devolve upon the son only through the parents. “As on today, life, liberty and dignity of the respondents (parents) are of paramount importance.”The court said the 2007 Act is a special statute enacted to protect the life, liberty, dignity and property of senior citizens and parents, who are in peril at the hands of their own children and grandchildren, and that the object of the Act is required to be achieved by all means.The court also rejected argument advanced on behalf of the son and his wife that SDO cannot issue an order of eviction and only the district magistrate can do so, in view of the fact that all powers of the district magistrate are delegated to the SDO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/senior-citizens-tribunals-can-evict-abusive-children-from-ancestral-properties-hc/story-miKKQhWOCxWQZvTSY2YOsJ.html

02-04-2020||Mumbai||After traversing over 3000 km, T1C1 finds its home at Dyanganga sanctuary||The three-year-old male tiger (T1C1), whose 3,020 km journey over 13 months was being tracked by wildlife experts, has possibly established its new territory at the Dyanganga Wildlife Sanctuary (DWS) in Buldhana, according to a report shared by the Maharashtra forest department on Wednesday.This is the final report, developed by scientists from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, detailing findings of the longest ever recorded movement of a tiger in the country, monitored via a radio-collar. The carnivore will now be tracked using camera traps.The animal was radio-collared on February 27, 2019 at Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Yavatmal district. From February to June 2019, it covered 360 km within Tipeshwar. From June to December (dispersal period), the tiger traversed through human-dominated landscapes, forests, open lands, agricultural fields, canals and water bodies across the central Indian landscape, covering eight districts and four wildlife sanctuaries in Maharasthra and Telangana trying to find its territory. Though the tiger reached DWS in November, it moved further northwest towards Ajanta caves but soon returned to DWS. From December onwards, the tiger began using the entire sanctuary, and also the adjacent territorial forests that cover an area of 1,185 km as its habitat. He has now made an area of 50 sq km in the forest as his home territory.“Despite travelling long distances, the animal hardly encountered conflict. This shows the ability of tigers to be away from humans while walking, provided the landscape is conducive. We need to ensure these fragmented forest zones, and the overall corridor is stopped from being deteriorated further,” said Bilal Habib, WII scientist who radio-collared the tiger in February 2019 has been tracking his movement along with his team - Parag Nigam, Pallavi Ghaskadbi, and Zehidul Hussain. “The animal has achieved all skills to survive and shows a normal predation pattern with regular kills inside DWS. The movement behaviour shows that the animal is using the main DWS as his core habitat and occasionally using buffer areas as well,” he added. After tracking the tiger for 13 months and receiving a total of 6,240 global positioning system (GPS) locations, the battery of the collar had almost drained, said scientists. On March 28, using the remote drop-off option, the collar was finally removed.“Due to the growth in the tiger’s neck size, the collar would have gotten tighter by the day. From existing 10 camera traps, we are adding another 50 to monitor his movement,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra. “Now we know such long dispersals do take place and without conflict. The first-of-its-kind study proves the elusive behaviour of the animal,” he added. T1C1 is Dyanganga’s first tiger and the forest department is studying the feasibility of releasing a female tiger there for mating. “A committee, set up to check the viability, had its first meeting but they were to visit the site to check the prey position and survey the habitat but couldn’t due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Based on their final report, a decision will be taken,” said Kakodkar. The movement of T1C1 has opened new conservation challenges for the dispersing tigers in the state. It has also shown the ability to disperse individuals (tigers) to traverse through human-dominated landscape without any conflict, the report concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-traversing-over-3000-km-t1c1-finds-its-home-at-dyanganga-sanctuary/story-KCB6YJ8nYe3Q4ma96mxx8N.html

Going beyond their call of duty in Lucknow, four policemen, while they were on ‘assisting people’ job, rushed to a hospital to save the life of a stranger by donating blood to him. They responded to a man urgently needing blood on a WhatsApp group they were members of. “I was distressed as the blood bank that had supplied blood to me easily had started facing problem under the lockdown,” said Dr Nilesh Kumar, a government veterinary doctor posted in Siddharthnagar.“My ailing father Bhagwan Das, 68, was on dialysis at a private hospital in Lucknow. This was much before the lockdown. On March 18, we shifted him to the Vivekananda Polyclinic. His condition was critical and the hospital immediately admitted him. The blood bank gave us blood for transfusion twice. But on March 27, his health deteriorated but by then blood was not available without first donating it and no friends and relatives could come under the lockdown. In such a crisis, an acquaintance messaged someone. Soon, four policemen in their uniform walked in, donated a unit each and left,” said Dr Nilesh.A government spokesperson identified three of them as head constable Dilip Patel, constable Avnish Upadhyaya and constable Pradip Gangwar. The name of the fourth policeman could be established.“Our requirement was two units, they donated four. We now have two units in reserve,” Dr Nilesh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/men-in-khaki-go-beyond-call-of-duty-save-elderly-s-life/story-MeY0ObgF7d8ivPysYaRNTJ.html

02-04-2020||Education||Coronavirus: Classrooms all set to go digital in Patna||With all educational institutions facing closure owing to the nationwide lockdown, most of the private schools in the capital city are now contemplating using digital platforms to kick-start this year’s academic session, informally, soon.Many schools have asked the students to install a digital learning application in their smart phones to facilitate online classes, beginning this week. Usually, the new academic session in schools begin in the first week of April.Prarambhika, a private CBSE school in Patna, rolled out its first interactive online learning class on Wednesday for students of classes nursery to 10.Sumit Prakash, director of Prarambhika, said, “Thanks to virtual classrooms, we started the new academic session using these digital platforms. We began the online class with the school prayer as per the custom. The teachers have designed online content, including study material and video lectures following the CBSE curriculum.”“The school will carry out interesting activities such as storytelling and other fun games to break the monotony and facilitate better learning to students”, he added.Students, when contacted by the HT, said they had downloaded different online learning platforms such as Diksha, SWYAM, and e-Pathshala in accordance with their respective schools’ directives. However, some schools are yet to introduce the electronic mode of teaching. Bishop Scott Group of Schools has come up with a 360 degree virtual curriculum engaging students in academic and extracurricular activities while sitting at home, overcoming the factor of physical absence.Ashfaque Iqbal, vice- principal of Bishop Scott Boys’ School, said, “Anticipating the closure, the school had already prepared interactive study material online in systematized manner for conducting classes. We have prepared a daily timetable for carrying out the lessons. We have also integrated study material, video lectures, and worksheets for comprehensive understanding of the students, followed by revision notes, online assessments and doubt clearing sessions. Apart from this, we have encouraged students and teachers to join Diksha , e-pathshala and other such CBSE forums.”The extracurricular departments have also switched to online mode for keeping the students fit and entertained. “Music classes, dance classes, and yoga classes are facilitated daily through the portal,” he added.Similarly, St. Michael’s High School is all set to employ the online learning method. Principal Father Armstrong Edison said, “In the first phase, we have started with online worksheets for primary to secondary students. Later, we will introduce pre-recorded video lectures for the higher classes.”Principal of Don Bosco Academy, Mary Alphonsa, said, “We have designed e-content for classes four to 12. The online study material available at the school’s smart-class is being shared with students so that they become familiar with the new syllabus. Teachers are giving assignment worksheets online that students need to submit within a stipulated deadline.”Meanwhile, parents have also welcomed this move. Vinay Kumar, whose son studies in class nine, said, “Digital learning tools were much needed during this time. At least, children are now utilising their free time and internet for productive work instead of playing online games. This will also help them to cover their syllabus without getting overburdened after the schools reopen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/coronavirus-classrooms-all-set-to-go-digital-in-patna/story-dlmoGPUW8kCv5wKebmQ8HO.html
02-04-2020||Chandigarh||Social distancing a myth: Colonies in Chandigarh give curfew a pass||People sitting in close groups outside their houses, multiple two-wheelers moving in a narrow street and crowds gathering outside every shop to buy essentials even amid curfew remains the order of the day in various villages and colonies in Chandigarh. Despite various appeals by the UT administration to maintain social distancing and constant vigil by the police, colony dwellers in the periphery stay out and about. Ramlal Yadav, father of three, was sitting outside his house in a densely-populated Maloya colony along with seven other men and children. When asked why all of them were ignoring social distancing, he said, “What will we do while sitting at home all day? We don’t have any work these days, we were just chit-chatting sitting outside.”Spread over around 60 acres across the city, the Colony No 4, Janta Colony, Guru Sagar Colony in Maloya, Sanjay Colony, and Rajiv Colony in Sector 38 and 10 such other colonies and slums are home to over three lakh people, mainly migrant labourers, household maids and garbage collectors, out of Chandigarh’s total population of 14 lakh (an estimate). 10-year-old Sumitra Kumari along with her seven friends went to seven houses for ‘kanya poojan’ in Vikas Nagar, Mauli Jagran, on Wednesday. While Sumitra was “not aware that people were not allowed to go out due to curfew,” her 17-year-old brother, Shailesh Kumar, said, “My friends and I go for a bike ride in the evening because sitting home all day gets boring.”WHERE IS THE ENFORCEMENT?Dalip Sharma, councillor from Bapu Dham Colony, said, “We have appealed to the residents multiple times to stay at homes, yet they are unaware of the intensity of the disease. Police officials are stationed at the spot, but they have to be more strict with people.”Anil Kumar Dubey, councillor from Mauli Jagran, said, “I am aware of the issue. I have talked to the SHO concerned and requested them to deploy more force here.” As per the curfew norms, people are allowed to visit the nearest shops on foot and use of vehicles is not permitted. In fact, various marks for social distancing were also made by UT administration outside shops. However, residents continue to disregard them.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nilambari Jagadale said, “We are taking strict action against violators. There are instances where people are taking out their vehicles deliberately thinking that they will evade police action. We will ensure there is strict compliance of the prohibitory orders.” LOCKDOWN NO DETERRENT IN MOHALI VILLAGES Despite Mohali district seeing 10 positive cases of Covid-19 in the past two weeks, including the death of a 65-year-old man in Nayagaon, residents in several villages are seen defying the curfew imposed to check the spread of the disease with impunity. While residents of sectors and phases in Mohali town have maintained discipline by staying indoors, residents in Shahimajra, Mataur, Kumbra, Sohana, Mauli and Mohali villages are mostly seen out and about, chatting in groups. Small grocery shops in villages, stay open morning and evening, with several customers standing outside without adhering to social distancing norms.Parminder Sohana, area councillor of Sohana village, said, “50% of the people are tenants. We have directed them to stay indoors, but to no avail. I have even requested the police to conduct patrolling regularly.”Jafar Ali, a resident of Mauli, said we come out in the evening hours sometimes as staying indoors the entire day gets difficult. “We also know that the virus is dangerous, but we are adopting all precautions,” he says.Fed up with people venturing out, residents of Phase 11, Mohali, a densely-populated area, barricaded the entry point and even pasted the posters of ‘No Entry’ there. Ravi Kumar, who runs a sweet shop in Phase 11, said, “These are mostly youngsters who do not understand the gravity of the issue and flee when the police comes to the area.”When contacted, additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Aashika Jain said, “We are trying to enforce the curfew. Our officials visited various places and have also asked the sarpanches of the villages to direct the residents to stay indoors. The police have been told to register cases against the violators.”Meanwhile, the district authorities have roped in the gurdwaras in villages in Zirakpur, Dera Bassi and Kharar to regularly make announcements asking to stay indoors.“Apane ghar ch hi raho, khet jan liye vi bahar na aona. Sabun nal haath dhone ne,” goes the announcement made regularly by a gurdwara in Chhat village reminding them to stay indoors and wash their hands regularly, besides inform the authorities if anyone has travelled abroad.Meanwhile, police control room (PCR) vehicles were blowing horns passing through Kharar and Dera Bassi at regular intervals, keeping people indoors.On Wednesday, though, people came out but in small numbers, especially in colonies and villages, but were asked to go back home after strict warning. “Residents of slums, colonies and villages are coming out to collect the food packets being distributed by different organisations,” said a policeman posted at a naka in Balongi.“We have directed all the people distributing dry ration to ensure that the packets are delivered at the doorsteps so that the residents do not move out of their homes,” said Kharar DSP Pal Singh. “Anyone distributing cooked food has to ensure that social distancing is maintained. People have started following it,” said Dera Bassi DSP Gurbakshish Singh Mann.PANCHKULA STAYS INDOORS Ludhiana Implementation of lockdown was in large with most markets wearing a deserted look on Wednesday. Shops, including departmental and grocery stores, barring chemists, remained closed in several markets.Even those that were open, did not witness high footfall, as people have already stocked up on essentials, shopkeepers said.The situation in inner sectors was slightly different where some people were seen moving out. Some were seen stocking up on essential commodities or doing bank work. Shopkeepers have cordoned off corridors to maintain safe distance from customers. Vendors with milk and bread are turning up in sectors by around 7am. Sanjay Goyal, a chemist in Sector 4 market said, “For the last two days, few people are turning up for medicines or other essentials as most have stocked up their monthly quota.”Meanwhile, Swiggy and other e-commerce companies have started delivering ration, dairy and grocery items. As per police data, 10 FIRs have been registered for violation of lockdown and quarantine, 506 challans have been issued and 65 vehicles have been seized, at a total fine of ₹23.14 lakh, till Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/social-distancing-a-myth-colonies-in-chandigarh-give-curfew-a-pass/story-arHQNxxAEMy0AhFNZnn9zI.html

02-04-2020||City||Virus scare takes a toll on poultry sector in Chandigarh; egg, chicken prices down by 30%||Prices of chicken and eggs have crashed by up to 30% with residents staying away from poultry products in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.Even as there is no scientific evidence to show that coronavirus spreads through eating meat products, shopkeepers say due to the outbreak scare, their sales have dropped by over 70%, forcing them to reduce the prices.Meat shops across the tricity are now selling chicken broilers for ₹160 against ₹220 earlier in March, while a tray of 30 eggs, which earlier cost up to ₹150, is now being sold for ₹90. In Chandigarh, meat shops are allowed to be open from 11am to 3pm, while in Mohali and Panchkula shopkeepers are selling poultry products through home delivery. Atul Sonkar, president of the Chandigarh Meat Market Welfare Association, Sector 21, Chandigarh, said, “We are facing the worst times in our business as the demand for chicken has dropped greatly due to the coronavirus fear. Even, eggs are seeing fewer sales. False information on social media is misleading people and affecting our business,” he said.Vikas Kumar, owner of Meat Master in Mohali, said ever since the curfew was imposed in the city, they were receiving minimal orders for chicken and eggs. “The price of the 30-egg tray has dropped from ₹130 to ₹90, while chicken broiler is being sold for half the price since there are no customers,” he said.‘UNPRECEDENTED SLUMP’Poultry farmers say they had never seen such a slump in business. The poultry industry in Barwala-Raipur Rani belt feeds Haryana, Punjab, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, and even Uttarakhand, Uttar Pardesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Assam. Sandeep Punia, a farmer in Ambala’s Nagla village, said his wholesale business had been on a decline since February. “We are compelled to sell broiler for ₹20 per kg, whereas the rearing cost is ₹80. We are incurring losses in the sale of eggs as well. Earlier, we were making ₹2.5 per egg, but now it is just ₹1.8 per egg,” he added.President of the Haryana Poultry Farmers’ Association, Barwala, Darshan Singla said, “Barwala belt is the largest poultry producer in the region. In the past one month, the egg producers of Barwala have lost ₹500 crore due to the coronavirus scare.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/virus-scare-takes-a-toll-on-poultry-sector-in-chandigarh-egg-chicken-prices-down-by-30/story-CjRUjmSO4e6Hvbee8d0jSM.html

His three family members have been home quarantined. The premises of the house has been sanitised by the health department. Information about his contacts in Punjab has been shared, officials said.In Mohali, a 76-year-old woman and her 10-year-old granddaughter, who are residents of Phase 9, have tested positive. The woman is the mother of an NRI who returned from Canada recently and tested positive along with his wife in Chandigarh on March 30.A 55-year-old man of Jagatpura in Mohali also tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. He was in direct contact with a 22-year-old resident of Sector 30, Chandigarh, who had returned from Dubai on March 11 and had tested positive for coronavirus on March 27.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said, “All three positive cases were in contact with Chandigarh patients. We have admitted them to Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur. They are stable. We are taking samples from their areas.”The Jagatpura man’s wife and two children have been moved to a quarantine facility in Phase 6, Mohali.Meanwhile, the test reports of seven family members of the 65-year-old Mohali man, who died due to Covid-19 on March 31, are negative. Even, the second nurse of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) who was tested after coming in contact with the man has been reported to be Covid-19 negative. A 32-year-old nurse had tested positive on Tuesday. Dr Singh said all nine patients admitted to different hospitals of Mohali are responding to treatment and are stable. “We will be taking second sample of a 27-year-old woman admitted to the civil hospital on Thursday, and in case the report is negative, she will be discharged,” he said.Jagatpura, Faidan sealedThe Mohali-Chandigarh border crossing that links Jagatpura with Faidan in the UT was sealed after the 55-year-old man tested positive for Covid-19. Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan along with officials of health department visited Jagatpura, which houses at least 20,000 migrant workers. Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has been deployed to strictly enforce the curfew in the village. A team of the health department is also conducting door-to-door survey to trace contacts of the patient.Meanwhile, a similar situation was witnessed at Faidan village, located adjacent to Sector 48 beyond the railway line. At least 40 people from the village have been kept at the community centre in Sector 47, which has been converted into a temporary quarantine centre. The decision was taken in view of health protocols, as home quarantine was unsafe for the villagers, said officials.UT to shift positive cases to PGIMeanwhile, the UT health department has decided that all the positive patients will be shifted to the Nehru Hospital’s Extension Block at the PGIMER from Friday (April 3).“Present positive patients may also be shifted and the decision in this regard will taken later,” said UT health secretary Arun Gupta.However, all three hospitals (PGIMER, GMSH-16 and GMCH-32) will continue to screen patients and take samples of suspected cases and keep them in respective isolation wards till the receipt of results. The confirmed cases will be shifted to the Covid-19 dedicated facility.A senior UT officer, on the condition of anonymity, said the decision has been taken keeping in view the scarcity of resources, including protective gear, and to make their judicious use.However, PGIMER doctors have reacted sharply to the decision. “This is an unscientific decision as positive patients will be moved from one place to another, increasing the risk posed to health workers. The decision should be reviewed,” said Dr Uttam Thakur, president of the Association of Resident Doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-after-mohali-man-s-death-4-new-cases-in-tricity/story-h7mbIg9WHvYIri3HMg6LvN.html
02-04-2020||Chandigarh||In absence of doctors, drugs, pregnant women run pillar to post||Amid curfew in the districts adjoining Chandigarh, pregnant women are having harrowing time as an already burdened health infrastructure deals with the pandemic. While cities are locked down, these women are being forced to travel from one government hospital to another only to be referred to Chandigarh.Writhing in labour pain, Jaspal Kaur, a 31-year-old pregnant woman, reached a health centre in Kurali at 3am on March 25, only to be referred to Kharar at 9am because, apparently, “the doctor had not arrived”. At 1pm, she was referred again to the Government Multi-Speciality Hospital in Sector 16 citing “blood level is too low”.Requesting the authorities “not to refuse them at the last moment, Kaur said, “We have great trust in you, but when the time (of delivery) comes, you ask us to leave and find another hospital. Amid such circumstances, it becomes difficult to make arrangements last moment.”Breaching all precautionary measures to be taken against coronavirus infection, a 25-year-old Sarita Devi was made to wait outside an ESI hospital in Baddi for four hours as the hospital reluctantly agreed to arrange for transporting her to Chandigarh. This, after the hospital staff earlier refused to attend to her, citing “non-availability of labour inducing drug”.Tired and on the verge of a breakdown, Sarita said, “My delivery was scheduled for today, but at noon I was asked to go to Chandigarh. I waited till 4pm outside the hospital and it was after much reluctance that they arranged for an ambulance.” It was learned that the doctor there was unavailable.sSimilar was the case of Neetu Devi of Bulongi, Mohali, whose delivery was scheduled at Mohali civil hospital, but she was referred to Chandigarh at the last moment. Rinky, a 30-year-old pregnant woman, was referred from Dera Bassi civil hospital to Mohali, and from there to the Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and yet again to Mohali, She finally came to GMSH-16.ADMISSIONS TO LABOUR ROOM HALVEDThe gynaecology department of GMSH-16 conducts on an average 10,000 deliveries a year. “In routine, we have around 40 admissions to the labour room, which has now reduced to 20. But we are still receiving a lot of referrals,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, head of the gynaecology department.In January, there were 195 referrals from three districts—Mohali (130) , Ropar (64) and Fatehgarh Sahib (1)—and in February, the number was 135. In the last 10 days, the hospital has seen 40 referrals, out of which 26 are from Punjab.“Amid curfew, it becomes difficult for families to look after patients and newborns. They have to make frequent visits to the hospital,” she said.PREGNANCY AND CORONA“According to the guideline issued by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, pregnant women are equally at risk just like the normal population. There is no documented evidence of transmission from mother to baby in the womb and neither via breast milk,” Dr Kang said.She advised pregnant women to restrict going out, maintain social distancing, take good diet and multi-vitamins and do moderate exercise.“Due to the pandemic, they should avoid routine check-ups, and visit hospitals only in case of emergencies like labour pains, bleeding or leakage. If you are suffering from dry cough and sudden onset of high grade fever, you should visit a healthcare facility immediately,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-absence-of-doctors-drugs-pregnant-women-run-pillar-to-post/story-QInHDsjxcSELSTg5U8f8JM.html

While Punjab imposed curfew in Mohali on March 23, Chandigarh administration imposed it on March 24. Both introduced curfew relaxations later and started issuing curfew passes online.UT administration allows curfew passes to government employees, persons providing essential and emergency services, grocers, chemists and vegetable sellers.“While UT has been strict with issuing of passes, Mohali is being lenient and issuing them to all and sundry.

On Tuesday, we got a message that both of them have been promoted to the next class. I was overjoyed and told my children about their results. For the past two weeks, both have been helping their mother in household chores and have been repeatedly saying that they miss learning lessons through projectors at school.”​The authorities at GPS, Haibowal Khurd, have informed the parents about the results of their wards through the WhatsApp groups formed by class teachers. Shivani Sood, school head, said, “Many parents do not have smartphones and internet access, so we had called them to inform them about the results of their wards,” adding that she had also sensitised the students about coronavirus and distributed masks and ration to the underprivileged students on March 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/scert-promotes-students-to-next-class-amid-lockdown/story-HGEM65HXPqmVuF2Ab8ljhM.html

02-04-2020||City||Covid-19: Punjab CM’s pic on relief material bags stirs up row||A picture of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on the relief material bag has stirred up a row with the opposition terming it “self-promotion” in time of pandemic.The department has dispatched 15 lakh bags, each containing 10kg wheat flour, 2kg dal (lentils) and 2kg sugar, at a cost of Rs 70 crore to the state exchequer. The material is packed in a bag having a picture of Amarinder in folded hands, with the tagline ‘A small effort of Punjab government to deal with Covid-19’. These bags will be supplied to 15 lakh families, which are not covered under the public distribution system (PDS). Leader of opposition in Punjab Assembly and AAP MLA Harpal Singh Cheema said, “The CM and his cabinet colleagues have failed on all fronts during the past three years and they are trying to take political mileage through Covid-19 relief.”He also alleged discrimination in distribution of relief material at the village level, saying a large number of needy families are being ignored. “While opposition MLAs are not allowed to leave home, Congress ministers and legislators are distributing the relief material in bags having picture of CM to their supporters. It’s not a social service, but self-promotion by the CM at the cost of tax payers’ money in the time of pandemic,” said Cheema. SAD leader Daljit Singh Cheema said there was no need to waste precious time and delay distribution of essential items by packaging them with the chief minister’s picture. “There will be many opportunities to put the CM’s picture on a variety of things, but in today’s crisis, such actions should be avoided.”MINISTER JUSTIFIES MOVEFood and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu justified the move, saying: “The CM’s picture is needed to differentiate the Covid-19 relief material. The state is also distributing atta-dal under the PDS. DCs are distributing ration from money released under CM’s relief fund. A picture is needed to differentiate the Covid-19 relief material, so that it is not used under PDS. If all material is distributed in similar packets, there are chances of bungling as someone can raise bills of this material under PDS.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cm-s-pic-on-relief-material-bags-stirs-up-row/story-Atnx8jRaj0yHITbFk2YEPP.html

02-04-2020||Delhi||Life in a lockdown: In Lajpat Nagar, silence drowns out normal din||In the bustling markets of Lajpat Nagar, a go-to place for shoppers and tourists, the ubiquitous cycle rickshaws that normally vie for space with pedestrians are nowhere to be seen. There is also lots of space, and none that needs to be vied for.Since March 25, when a 21-day nationwide lockdown kicked in to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), long-time residents in the area say they are nonplussed by the silence,, which is only broken by barking street dogs, chirping birds, and the occasional vehicle.The busy Central Market is now empty, its 700-odd shops shut. Only four establishments — two chemists and two grocers -- stay open these days.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“There is complete silence in the area these days. We have been meeting virtually to discuss measures such as providing food to workers and other vulnerable sections. We made around 1,000 kits of dry ration for distribution to families of migrant workers and rickshaw pullers. Our area has a large migrant workforce and a good number of street vendors, all of whom have been left with little means to fend for themselves,” said Ashwani Marwah, general secretary of the Lajpat Nagar traders’ association.  In the Afghan colony in Lajpat Nagar-2, however, business seems a bit more like usual. Also, the direct impact of the lockdown on foreign nationals is visible here. Even though five flights have been arranged so far by the Afghanistan government to get its citizens home, several Afghans who visit India in search of better medical facilities are stranded in the Lajpat Nagar locality that has long been their haunt.For many of them, Lajpat Nagar — a residential area developed to house refugees who immigrated from Pakistan during Partition — is a second home. Thirty-year-old Hamid Hakim, an Afghan, said he wanted to stay back in Delhi as the city has better medical facilities as compared to his country. However, his budget does not permit him to stay for too long.“Due to the closure of banks, we have not been able to exchange currencies. No money transfer is happening and I’m slowly running out of money,” he said.Thirty-year-old Hamida, who was here to collect her degree from a Delhi college, said her flight to Kabul is scheduled for April 5. “ But I cannot return home to Herat province and will have to stay in Kabul at some hotel as Herat is in a lockdown starting Wednesday,” she said.Sayeed Abdul Azeem, a 26-year-old student, said there is panic and uncertainty because the last flight to Afghanistan is set to will depart on April 5 and no one knows when things would return to normal.Among those hurrying back home is 80-year-old Khalid Mohammad, who came for an eye treatment with his wife and daughter. “I will now have to leave my treatment halfway and return to my country,” he said.In other parts of the residential area, the only ones out on the road are some vegetable and fruit vendors, who are conducting business, but with precautions.Satish, a fruit-seller, says business has taken a hit. His faced covered by a mask , Satish makes it a point to wash his hands every time after serving a customer. “I have been maintaining proper hygiene and as a precautionary measure, I have also kept a sanitiser at hand. I close my shop in the afternoon because not many people step out during daytime,” he said.Nisha, a 21-year-old student at Zakir Hussain College, said she and her family are worried about the increasing number of cases from Nizamuddin, which is not far from from Lajpat Nagar.“Due to the lockdown, I cannot join my internship as I was supposed to. The number of cases being reported from Nizamuddin is alarming,” she said. The headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamudding has emerged as a Covid-19 hot spot over the past three days.Meanwhile, the local residents’ welfare associations (RWA) in the area have been ensuring that people don’t step out, unless absolutely necessary. “In the whole of Lajpat Nagar-4 (Amar Colony), only three of the 25 gates remain open during the day. Only one person from a family is allowed to go out at a time to get essentials. We arrange for essentials such as medicines for senior citizens who are living alone,” said Pramod Kumar Taneja, chairman of the Amar Colony RWA.He says the RWA has tied up with the local councillor to provide food and essentials to nearly 4,000 people housed in the slum clusters nearby. “The food is being prepared in our block and two persons take it daily to the slums.”Abhishek Dutt, the councillor from Andrews Ganj, South Delhi Municipal Corporation, says he has been in constant touch with RWAs and was responding to their needs. “On our local helpline number — 8883030201 — for Kasturba Nagar constituency, of which Lajpat Nagar is a part, I have got at least 35 complaints from people who are disabled and could not go out to get food. We have ensured that all such people are catered to. From Thursday, we are also starting an initiative with RWAs to provide cooked meals to labourers and other workers at least once a day,” Dutt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/life-in-a-lockdown-in-lajpat-nagar-silence-drowns-out-normal-din/story-wMSYlP0SlkPwe9XBYfXIzK.html
02-04-2020||Delhi||‘Items flew off the shelves after PM address’, says grocer from Delhi||As an entire country locks itself indoors for 21 days to beat the spread of Covid-19, one man has been working tirelessly — for sometimes as long as 13 hours a day — for the past two weeks. Sajjan Kumar Agarwal, a 50-year-old grocery store owner in east Delhi’s Vasundhara Enclave, says he has never seen a panic like this among customers before. “At our store, the madness begun on March 22 when the Delhi government announced a lockdown. I did double my normal sales that night. The customers said that since the restaurants were also shut, they needed more food supply. But the situation went out of control after the 21-day lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAgarwal said that there was a huge rush at his shop immediately after the announcement. “That night, I sold thrice of what i usually do. People were buying as if they will never get a chance again. By the weekend, my stocks had been completely wiped out,” he said, adding that he and his staff could not even take a lunch break for at least five days.On Monday, he had put up a poster on his shop with a message that read “please do not buy extra groceries”. “The situation has calmed down now. The number of customers we are receiving now is fewer than what we used to get before. People seem to have stocked enough groceries for the next few weeks,” he said.Agarwal, who lives in a joint family in New Kondli — barely a kilometre away from his shop — opens his Ravi General Store every day at 9 am. Immediately after reaching the store, he instructs his employees to tie a rope around the shop to ensure that social distancing norms with customers are followed. He has distributed masks and hand gloves to his employees and has also kept a bottle of hand sanitiser on the counter for them to use. “I have stopped home delivery. We normally have 10 boys working at the store for home delivery but now only four are reporting to work. We only deliver for elderly people now, that too only till the main gate of the residential societies. I am responsible for their safety as well. We also maintain social distance from each other at work. Half of my day goes in telling customers to maintain a social distance and stand in the circles that we have drawn outside the store,” he said.Around 2:30 pm, some disgruntled customers were spotted returning from Agarwal’s store. “We have to send back many customers daily because we are out of stock for many items, including ready to eat items, flour and packed foods like biscuits, chips and Maggi. It’s disheartening to say no to anyone, but we are having trouble in getting supplies these days. The distributors are not being able to transport goods as per our requirements. They do not have enough manpower,” he said.By 4pm, a truck carrying packed drinking water bottles arrives at the store. “We are not receiving Bisleri water daily. Now I’ll call some customers who I had turned back earlier in the day,” says Agarwal, with a smile on his face.While his employees wrap up the work by 9pm and leave for home, Agarwal stays back for another half an hour to ensure that none of his customers is left behind. By 9:45 pm he is home. “I wash my hands before entering the house and take a shower immediately. I interact with hundreds of people every day. I have to take a lot of precautions to keep my family safe. I have my old mother at home,” he said.When asked if he does not feel like staying at home like others , he said, “It’s a privilege to be there for the people. If we stop working what will they eat? I will continue working no matter what. The doors of my store will remain open for all my customers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/it-s-a-privilege-will-continue-working-no-matter-what-grocery-store-owner/story-Ek3Tn5p3J295V5fvOmwgbN.html
02-04-2020||Delhi||16 mosques in Delhi that hosted members of Tablighi Jamaat congregation disinfected||At least 16 mosques, which were earlier identified by Delhi Police for having housed around 150 foreign nationals and over 20 Indians who were a part of the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin earlier this month, were sanitised on Wednesday.The Tablighi Jamaat headquarters has emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hot spot in India so far, with at least 53 people from there testing positive for Covid-19 in the Capital alone, and more than 500 in hospital for showing Covid-like symptoms. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicMore than 1,800 people who attended the congregation have been placed in quarantine in the city.The 16 mosques are located in areas such as Pul Prahladpur, Malviya Nagar, Shastri Park, Chandni Mahal and Turkman Gate in Old Delhi. Several foreign nationals -- from countries including Indonesia, Malaysia and Kyrgyzstan — who visisted the Jammat’s headquarters this month were staying in these mosques.At one of the mosques in Old Delhi’s Chandni Mahal, 15 pilgrims from the Jamaat’s Markaz building — five couples from Indonesia, four men from Algeria, and an Indian national from Hyderabad — have been quarantined on the third floor of the masjid.“They have been here since the lockdown was announced. They are in complete isolation. They cook their own food on the third floor and even offer namaz there. None of them have shown any symptoms. The health officials had come to visit them on Wednesday and gave them a form that was to be filled, if anyone fell sick,” said Shakeel Ahmed, president of the masjid committee.On Wednesday evening, the local police held a meeting with the heads (Imams) of all mosques in the Walled City area at the Jama Masjid police station to discuss measures that needed to be taken.“The police have asked us to not let anyone come inside the mosque premises and maintain hygiene. We had already shut the masjid and nobody is allowed to come in, even for namaz. The police have also collected the passports of the pilgrims and a letter has been sent to the respective embassies,” said Mohammad Ali, imam of the Chandni Mahal mosque.Hafiz Mohammad Javed, a social worker and a representative of the masjid committee, said that he had earlier advised the Markaz authorities of taking precautions as well. “We had told them to take all precautionary measures. However, it was only later that they realised that some people were feeling unwell,” said Javed.At least 12 Indonesia nationals arrived in south Delhi’s Hauz Rani and Malviya Nagar areas on March 30, said Haji Kallu, the president of the masjid committee. These people, Kallu added, have been quarantined at the mosque. “They came to the mosque on March 30; we don’t know where they stayed before that. We immediately informed the area sub-divisional magistrate and the police about them. They came and checked their visa and passport details/”Less than a kilometre away, 13 Kyrgyzstan nationals and one Indian, all members of the Tablighi Jammat, moved to another mosque in the area on March 22.Mohd Aslam, a member of Tablighi Jammat associated with the mosque, said, “Their details were shared with the local authorities. The medical team visited the mosque on March 30. We have kept these people on two separate floors of the mosque as per directions of the medical team. We are not entering the mosque and providing them food and other stuff from outside.”In the Shastri Park area, at least 35 people were shifted to a quarantine facility from two mosques.In Wazirabad, 15 people, including 12 Indonesian nationals, were quarantined inside the area’s Jama Masjid mosque, said an official.Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Delhi’s Jama Masjid said: “I have informed people in the community, especially in mosques, that wherever members of the Jamaat are staying, they should inform the district administration and local police and get those people tested. If someone is staying in their house, even then you should get the person tested. The measures taken by the government are for the welfare of the people. We had closed Jama Masjid for prayers for the general public due to the disease on March 23, after which all other mosques in the city had followed suit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/16-mosques-that-hosted-members-of-tablighi-jamaat-congregation-disinfected/story-sy8DNxn9oHpMztLAM9VTVK.html
02-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 outbreak: 227 workers stranded in Gurdwara Majnu ka Tila rescued||At least 227 migrants from Punjab, who were stranded in Delhi due to the 21-day nationwide lockdown, were evacuated from a gurudwara in North Delhi’s Majnu ka Tila by the police and Delhi government authorities on Wednesday, officials associated with the operation said.They were shifted to two government schools in Nehru Vihar in Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses, after following due protocol pertaining to the coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2) pandemic, police said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAlthough none of the migrants showed any symptom of the virus on Tuesday night, health officials will screen them for a confirmation at the two schools, which have been converted into quarantine centres, deputy commissioner of police (north), Monika Bhardwaj, said.The evacuation comes after 29 people, who had attended a Tablighi Jamaat earlier this month in South Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin, tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, taking the total to 53 of the 152 cases in Delhi. The 53 were among over 2,300 people, including foreigners, who were staying in the religious establishment and were evacuated in the last two days.At least seven such participants, who returned to their homes in Telangana, died due to the infection, triggering panic across the country and prompting authorities to carry out operations to identify, evacuate, and isolate people who had attended the religious congregation. On Tuesday night, the police received information regarding a gathering of around 300 people in the vicinity of the gurdwara at Majnu ka Tila. Upon confirming the information, the Delhi government was intimated and requested to take the necessary steps.“Directions were issued to the district magistrate concerned and the deputy commissioner of police to conduct a joint operation in order to evacuate the gurdwara premises at the earliest. Once done, people should be screened by doctors. Symptomatic cases should be sent to hospitals and asymptomatic cases should be accommodated in the quarantine facilities set up by the government. All individuals will be provided with regular meals and other essentials. After that, the gurdwara premises should be contained and sanitised as per the Delhi government’s protocol,” said Satya Gopal, additional chief secretary of Delhi.After the necessary arrangements, the evacuation operation began on Wednesday. Till afternoon, a total of 227 people were shifted to the schools in the two buses. Amid information that the evacuated people were to attend a religious gathering at the gurdwara, DCP Bhardwaj said, “All of them are migrant workers belonging to Punjab, but working in Delhi-NCR. They all took shelter in the gurdwara after the lockdown orders, as they had no way to return to their homes.”A senior official of the government’s revenue department said, “The gurdwara committee should have informed the police and the subdivisional magistrate concerned about the gathering. A detailed report had been sought from the SDM and the government is likely to request the L-G to initiate the registration of an FIR by the police.”In a video tweet, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, said that none of the evacuated persons was there to attend a religious gathering or employed in the gurdwara. He said that none of them exhibited any symptom of the infection.“All of them had gathered outside the gurdwara from Noida, Faridabad and other parts of Delhi-NCR to board buses to Punjab, as many buses for their states run from near the gurdwara. They took shelter in the gurdwara as no buses were available. Three days ago, DSGMC arranged two buses and sent some people back,” Sirsa said in the video.He said that after a complete lockdown was enforced in the city, many were stranded at the gurdwara, and he had informed the Punjab and Delhi governments about this through tweets and videos. “We also shared a list of those people with a Punjab member of Parliament. From Tuesday night, the Delhi government administration has been taking care of them. They were evacuated and shifted to schools. The administration asked us to provide them food three times, which we will be doing,” he says in the video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-outbreak-227-punjab-migrants-evacuated-from-gurdwara-in-majnu-ka-tila/story-i5ejijgMukq1fOk6TexvmI.html
02-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 update: Phones of those in quarantine to be tracked for violation, says CM||Mobile phones of more than 24,000 individuals in Delhi, who are presently under quarantine to prevent the spread of coronavirus, will be put under surveillance for security agencies to check if they have violated the quarantine. The security agencies will go through their GPS locations to determine if they are staying put, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said Wednesday. Experts said there is no past pandemic to set a precedent for this one, but raised concerns about possible violation of privacy rights. Police said they were yet to be notified on the move.“We have seen several developed nation track phones of their quarantined patients to check against violations and the method seems to have worked. In a meeting with the lieutenant-governor, we too have decided to adopt the method. We have already provided 11,084 phone numbers to the police and another set of 14,345 phone numbers will be provided today (Wednesday),” Kejriwal said.He further said, “By tracking the locations of those numbers for the quarantine period, the police would be in a position to ascertain if the quarantine was violated at any point. We had to take such strict measures considering how the virus has spread across countries.” “We are yet to be notified about the announcement made by the CM regarding electronic surveillance on quarantined people. As and when we are informed about it, necessary steps would be taken to implement it,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.Category A persons – individuals who have returned from coronavirus-affected nations and are symptomatic, and their contacts – are isolated in government facilities. But, asymptomatic persons – classified under Category B and C – are either asked to go for self-quarantine in their residences or remain isolated in government centres, depending on their travel history and other factors that include age and other ailments, as per the guidelines issued by the Union health ministry. In Delhi, till Wednesday, the virus was infected 152 (as on Wednesday) individuals and claimed two lives, Kejriwal said. The city, along with the rest of India, is currently in a 21-day lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Of the 152 persons diagnosed positive in Delhi, Kejriwal said, 49 had a travel history to an affected nation, 29 were people who came into their direct contact and 24 are cases originating from the Markaz gathering in Nizamuddin. A recently held religious congregation in Nizamuddin Delhi has led to many who attended the event contracting the virus.“There have been no past pandemics to set a precedent. Law and order authorities have always had access to call detail records and locations, which now form the basis of many investigations and charge sheets. In the present case, with the invocation of the Epidemic Act, there is even a plausible legal cover, for this action, which maybe justified as checking for possible violations of the Act,” senior Supreme Court advocate Sanjay Hegde said.Srinivas Kodali, a researcher on data and governance, said: “The government has pushed the burden onto individuals. Instead of helping them go through quarantine, the government is forcing its might onto victims. Such exercises do not build trust and could actually lead to more people jumping quarantine and keeping their phones turned off. Not to mention that this is an outright violation of a person’s fundamental right to privacy as there are other less intrusive ways to do this without violating an individual’s privacy.”RATION FOR POOR WITHOUT CARDSDelhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal Wednesday said poor people in Delhi, who do not have a ration card yet, can apply for the same online and avail of ration from fair price shops starting this month with the help of the acknowledgement receipt. He pegged the number of such people at one million. Delhi already has 7.1 million beneficiaries under the public distribution system of essential items. All of them are entitled to receive 7.5kg additional ration – primarily comprising rice and wheat – from April in light of the 21-day lockdown.“I will ensure that nobody stays hungry during or after the lockdown,” Kejriwal said after the announcement made through a video conferencing to address the media.Meanwhile, lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal ordered the use of fire tenders for disinfecting hot spot clusters, quarantine centres and vulnerable public spaces to prevent the spread of coronavirus.“Directions have been issued to use the fire brigade for disinfecting vulnerable neighbourhoods, especially the hot spot areas, quarantine centres, public places, etc. District disaster management authorities will take concerted preventive actions and ensure social distancing at ATMs, food distribution centres, etc.” a statement from Baijal’s office read.So far, Dilshad Garden and Nizamuddin localities have been identified as coronavirus hot spots in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-to-check-gps-locations-of-24-000-people-to-see-if-they-jumped-quarantine/story-yLzRbwp0HqEAoRBIwF42RO.html

They did the same with 37 other buses — both from the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster bus service.The policeman alleged that the people in the buses had not been issued tickets either, and when he asked the drivers and conductors about it, they said they had “received orders from above”.The FIR was registered under the Disaster Management Act and the IPC sections pertaining to negligence that could spread a disease, disobedience to quarantine rule and disobedience to an order issued by a government servant.Apart from the drivers and conductors, the FIR also named the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIIMTS) operations head, CK Goyal.Speaking to HT, Goyal said that he was not a decision maker, an initiator or a violator and that only government orders were followed. “All those buses were on scheduled duty and the drivers had strict instructions to serve only essential service providers,” said Goyal, adding that he had acted on the “written directions of the government”.He said that two officers were suspended in the case in which the FIR has been registered.The Union Ministry of Home Affairs on Sunday had suspended two top bureaucrats of the Delhi government and issued show cause notices to two others for ‘dereliction of duty’ regarding containment of Covid-19.

The foreign nationals, according to Newasa police, were inside Bhaldar mosque also known as Markaz Masjid even as the functionaries of the religious place failed to inform the administration, despite instructions in view of the Covid-19 outbreak.The offence was registered against two trustees of the mosque under Section 188 (disobeying an order issued by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Epidemics Diseases Act, 1897, the official said.The action came against the background of two positive cases of Covid-19 in the last week of March in the district. Those two Covid-19 positive are nationals of Ivory Coast and France who along with 12 others had come for another religious congregation in Ahmednagar city. On Tuesday, three more persons who came in contact with the nationals of Ivory Cost and France, tested positive.In the latest case, the foreigners, who hail from Ghana, Dakar, Djibouti and Benin, were staying at the Masjid since before the lockdown was imposed, said a senior police official.The men were shifted to a nearby hospital and the administration and health department has now collected their swab samples for testing.Meanwhile, the Ahmednagar district administration has traced 46 persons comprising 29 foreign preachers and 17 workers of Tablighi Jamaat who had attended the religious congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in New Delhi which is the world headquarters of the Muslim missionary organisation.

02-04-2020||Pune||Covid-19: Sassoon hospital’s psychological helpline gets 40 calls in 24 hrs||Since the announcement of a 21-day lockdown period on March 24 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to curtail the spread of Covid-19 (coronavirus) cases caused due to the Sars-CoV-2 virus, psychological helpline numbers, including the suicide helplines, have witnessed an increase in the number of calls. Sassoon General hospital on Tuesday launched a 24X7 psychological helpline number for those who may face issues of depression and loneliness due to the lockdown. The helpline number received 40 calls in just 24 hours, according to Dr Nitin Abhivant, head of the psychiatric department, which has started the helpline.These calls are from people seeking assistance in issues like depression, loneliness, irritation, sleep deprivation, fear and family conflict, according to experts.“People were seeking psychological help in OPDs and so we decided to launch a dedicated helpline number. The most common complaint from the callers is fear and anxiety due to the rapidly changing socio-economic conditions and also their physical well-being,” said Dr Abhivant.“Any disaster has a direct impact on the mental health of a person. Within such a short span people are seeing such rapid changes which are bound to have a psychological impact,” he said.“We counsel them and if they need admission or medical treatment we recommend them to come to Sassoon or the nearest government hospital. This fear is among all socio-economic class,” said Dr Abhivant.Dr Abhivant also added that not only common people, but health workers at the forefront are also seeking mental help. He said, “Medical workers are also facing these issues as they are physically and mentally exhausted. They also need morale-boosting and we help them with that.”“The government must look into this issue as well because the psychological impact of this condition is huge and even after the infection reduces, the long term impacts need to be tackled,” he added. Johnson Thomas, director, Aasra, a crisis intervention centre for the lonely, distressed and suicidal, said, “People reaching out to us through our helpline number has increased after the lockdown was announced.”“Even though all the family members are at home they do not communicate with each other as they are busy on their mobile phones and this is leading to conflicts between parents and children,” said Thomas.“The couples with distressed relations are facing more issues as they are confined in their houses all day,” he said.“Senior citizens seek communication and interaction with family members during this time of distress, but as they do not get the required support and help they seek assistance from helpline numbers,” said Thomas.“Staying together all the time also has its own issues as it leads to aggravating the problems and even minor conflicts become a major point of tussle,” he added.

The idea of ‘doctor at your doorstep’ has been launched with the help of Bharatiya Jain Sanghtana (BJS) to reach the population living in slums and at the temporary shelters, with a focus on old-age homes in the city. “The ambulances have been allotted to each of the 15 wards and are equipped with a crew of one doctor, one nurse, one attendant and a volunteer who will work from 10am to 5pm in various localities of the city,” said Dr Anjali Sabane, PMC, health department. The idea was conceived by Shantilal Mutha, founder of BJS and supported by the government of Maharashtra, after most of the physicians closed their clinics in fear of not able to control social distancing at the clinics and fear of spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. “Our main focus for these mobile dispensaries is to look after senior citizens (60 years and above) and also check every one at the temporary shelters set up at PMC schools,” said Shekhar Gaikwad, municipal commissioner, PMC. According to Dr Sabane, “The mobile units will check at least 2,500 people per day and have the strength to check for symptoms of 500 patients in a day. The service will continue until Covid-19 is completely contained.” BJS has taken 15 of their buses and tempo travellers and retrofitted them within 24 hours to be ambulances. The interior of these makeshift ambulances have front seats removed, to make space for a stretcher and movement of doctors, if needed, and has a loud speaker, chairs for patients to sit when stopped in a place, and medicines for those with symptoms of cough, cold and running nose.“Due to the lockdown many of the residents are unable to get out of their homes for treatment of minor ailments and with these mobile OPDs, the doctors can offer their services at the residents’ doorstep,” said Shantilal Mutha. “Also, the data collected of all the residents will come in handy for the government to create a bank of those checked for Covid-19 and eliminate rechecking,” he added.

While fumigation with this solution is expected only in areas where a positive Covid-19 patient or a suspected patient is living, many a times private societies and even Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) staff have been found spraying the solution without protective gear. Indian Medical Association (IMA) also cautions the use of the solution as it is highly inflammable. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, state IMA president, said, “As per the guidelines of the Centre for Disease Control, USA, the same guidelines which we are following, states that sodium hypochlorite solution should be used only for surgical cleaning like the surgical tables, surgical instruments, operation table and floors and clothes using during operation. Government officials and workers who have been spraying the solution are not aware that if anyone is exposed to the solution then it may cause skin irritation, blindness if it enters the eyes, exposure to the vapours can also cause burning sensation in the respiratory tract and if it enters the respiratory system it may cause choking too.”While the Pune fire department staff has fire proximity suits for all the manned fire tenders for spraying the solution, the sanitation workers and its contract labourers do not have protective kits.A fire department official responsible for spraying this chemical, on condition of anonymity, said, “We use about 10ml of sodium hypochlorite for about 10 litres of water. We have given the workers gloves and masks and have asked them to spray the solution in the direction of the wind so that it does not splash onto the workers. We spray the solution only in areas where positive and suspected patients are living in open areas, including the staircase and open passages.”Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 30 tweeted, “This is to inform that all spraying of disinfectants is being done by urban local bodies centrally as per schedule. Please refrain anybody else apart from Urban Local Bodies to step in and spray as their will. The Disinfectant must not be sprayed without the permission of ULB’s as a wrong formula can be more harmful than its intention to citizens and animals. Only ULB’s will spray as per the medical needs and globally advised protocols.” (sic.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/fumigation-with-sodium-hypochloride-solution-without-proper-procedure-more-dangerous-warn-experts/story-Wjg65uWFwMDSpshsToj4RL.html

The respective administration of Pune revenue region’s five districts – Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Solapur – have started collecting swabs of 94 persons quarantined so far while others traced till now are being brought to the quarantine centre. The government officials with help from the police have also launched a search for those who have not been traced by tracking their call details record (CDR), said Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar. “We have discovered that some people have gone to other states and have also changed SIM cards of their mobile phones. Search is on for those individuals. Others traced so far have been put under quarantine and their samples have been sent for testing, the reports of which are awaiting,” said Mhaisekar. Among the 182 persons, 136 are from Pune district, five from Satara, three from Sangli, 17 from Solapur and 21 from Kolhapur. Some of these people as a part of a religious congregation attended markaz in Nizamuddin. Of the 136 persons in Pune district, 70 have been traced so far while search is on for rest, said officials.The search for all those who attended the Delhi event began after the Union home ministry alerted various states, including Maharashtra, that those who attended the religious congregation and then dispersed to various parts of the country may have the possibility of being infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus. Various states are now tracking down these people with an aim to limit the spread of the virus by isolating those who attended the congregation, and the people they came in contact with.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/106-of-182-nizamuddin-event-participants-from-pune-division-traced-search-on-for-others-through-cdr/story-GHaykgDHopDEKyOekQ0UvI.html

Missing his ground practice, Veer is dedicating three to four hours to fitness. Veer who stays in Katraj is currently spending his lockdown phase at his village in Bhor which is 53 kilometres from the city.Morning sessionMy day starts at 7am and I exercise till 10am which also includes meditation. My father keeps a watch on how I go about my exercise routine. It includes different types of squats, lunges, push-ups. Once the session is completed, I have a healthy breakfast and then, I enjoy watching television till the lunch is ready. I like to watch movies and listening to songs, so the TV provides me complete entertainment. On regular days, it is not possible for me to watch the TV for such a long time.Afternoon sessionOnce lunch is finished at 1pm, I play carrom with my father. It is fun to play and also helps to increase your focus. My father enjoys more as he finally gets a partner to play. At 3pm, I go to sleep for two hours.Evening sessionAt 5:30pm, I start my fitness routine which includes core rehabilitation exercises. The session is generally of one and a half hours. On alternate days, I also do bowling practice on the terrace. I am back to rest mode once the session is completed and after having dinner, I switch to my hobby which is – watching videos of Sachin Tendulkar before I go to sleep.No gymI will not say life is difficult without the gym, because I do most of exercises at home and it is not affecting my fitness regime. If I miss doing any exercise, then my father is standing right next to me to remind me.Hobby I have worshipped Sachin Tendulkar since my childhood and whenever I get the chance to watch highlights of his batting performance, then, I am always ready for it. Because of the lockdown, I have the time to watch his video and his batting style gives me confidence. No one in the world can copy him and by watching him, I become mentally strong and keep telling myself that ‘even I want to give my best when it comes to cricket’. Every video of Sachin Tendulkar is like a learning lesson for me. I also enjoy watching Rahul Dravid videos. The whole world is going through a bad period and I urge people to stay at home for our benefit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-u-19-cricket-sensation-siddhesh-veer-dedicates-lockdown-to-fitness-watching-tendulkar-videos/story-g4Y8mOvVC9OviydneML3AP.html

A daily production of 3.10 lakh litres of sanitiser began in the state over the last four days, the state’s sugar commissioner Saurabh Rao said.“In view of Coivd-19, the demand for sanitisers has increased resulting in a shortage. The central government had instructed that distilleries run by cooperative sugar factories should start production. Maharashtra have the necessary permission to 19 sugar factories and the actual production began four days ago,” he said.The sanitiser produced by the distilleries would be supplied to medical colleges and government hospitals,” he said.Rao noted that the National Health Mission’s director Anup Kumar Yadav was coordinating the supply chain across the country. Once the demand of the government hospitals is met, permission would be given for private sale, he said.Factories have been given the freedom to supply in bulk or in bottles of a standard size. A circular had been issued by the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution on March 19 instructing tate governments to give permission to sugar industries to undertake production of hand sanitisers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/daily-production-of-3-10-lakh-litres-of-hand-sanitiser-begins-in-maharashtra/story-GhfiCoclOLdoM4wAtwyoRM.html
02-04-2020||World||Iran parliament speaker tests positive for COVID-19||Iran’s parliament speaker tested positive for COVID-19, state television reported Thursday, becoming the latest official to contract the disease in the hard hit country.Ali Larijani “was tested for coronavirus after showing certain symptoms, and as the result was positive, he is currently in quarantine and undergoing treatment,” the report said.Larijani, 62, is close to the Iranian leadership and president and was re-elected in 2016 for a second term as parliament speaker. He is one of the most senior officials to be infected so far.Iran has been scrambling to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus since it reported its first cases on February 19.Earlier Thursday Iran had reported 124 new deaths from the coronavirus, raising its total to 3,160 with more than 50,000 people infected.The announcement came as President Hasan Rouhani warned at a cabinet meeting that the country may still battle the pandemic for another year.“Coronavirus is not something for which we can point to a certain date and say it will be completely eradicated by then,” he said.Rouhani said the virus “may be with us in upcoming months, or until the end” of the current Iranian year, in March 2021.The virus has not spared Iranian lawmakers or other officials.At least 23 of the legislature’s 290 members have tested positive for the novel coronavirus so far, state news agency IRNA said on Tuesday.COVID-19 has also killed at least 12 serving or former government officials, according to official reports.After weeks of refraining from imposing a lockdown or quarantine measures, Tehran decided last week to ban all intercity travel until at least April 8.There is no official lockdown within Iran’s cities, although the government has repeatedly urged Iranians to stay at home to contain the spread of the virus.Iran has closed schools and universities as well as four key Shiite pilgrimage sites, including the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Qom, Iran’s epicentre for the virus.It has also discouraged travel, cancelled the main weekly Friday prayers and temporarily closed parliament.amh/hkb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-parliament-speaker-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-OHYo17XV6uM4MLnCsPcwHM.html

02-04-2020||World||Israel’s health minister has coronavirus, was in frequent contact of PM Netanyahu||The new coronavirus forced into isolation Israel’s health minister, who has had frequent contact with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after he tested positive for the disease, the Health Ministry said Thursday.The Middle East has over 82,000 confirmed cases of the virus, most of them in Iran, and over 3,600 deaths. Iran’s Health Ministry said Thursday that the new coronavirus killed another 124 people, pushing the country’s death toll to 3,160.In a rare acknowledgment of the severity of the outbreak by a senior Iranian official, President Hassan Rouhani said the new coronavirus may remain through the end of the Iranian year, which just began late last month, state TV reported Thursday.“We always have to follow the health protocols provided by the health ministry,” Rouhani added.In Lebanon, the Philippines ambassador, Bernardita Catalla, died of complications from the coronavirus Thursday, the Philippines said. Lebanon has recorded 494 cases, including 16 deaths.Israel said Health Minister Yaakov Litzman and his wife, who also contracted the virus, are in isolation, feel well and are being treated.Shortly after the announcement, Netanyahu’s office said he returned to self-quarantine because of contact with Litzman. Netanyahu, who has tested negative, had previously been in isolation after a top aide tested positive for the virus.Hebrew language media reported that the head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency and the National Security Council were asked to self-quarantine because of their interactions with Litzman.Israel has gone into near-lockdown to try to contain the outbreak. It has reported over 6,200 confirmed cases and 29 deaths of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.Israel’s large, insular ultra-Orthodox community, of which Litzman is a member, has been particularly hard hit. In the early phases of the outbreak, some rabbis had pushed back or ignored government-mandated movement restrictions, but resistance appears to have diminished.For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia that can be fatal.In Syria, the government extended the closures of mosques until April 16, nearly a week before the start of the holy month of Ramadan when Muslims spend more time in prayers and worship. It also extended indefinitely a ban on visits to prison and detention facilities, citing concerns over the spread of the virus, and expanded curfew times over weekend days.Rights groups have called on Mideast governments to release thousands of political detainees held in crammed and unhygienic jails. In government-controlled Syria, 10 cases of infection and two deaths were reported, amid concerns the virus may be more widespread.The World Health Organization said it was increasing preparedness in the rebel-controlled, northwestern region of Syria that is home to nearly 4 million people, most of them displaced by the war and repeated government offensives. Only half of the health facilities are functioning in rebel-held territory, where displaced camps are crowded and the virus’ transmission would be fast once it reaches the area.Meanwhile, the pandemic is expected to wipe out $23 billion in passenger revenue from airlines across the Middle East and Africa this year, according to an assessment Thursday by the aviation industry’s largest trade association.The International Air Transport Association said Mideast airlines will see a $19 billion drop in revenue this year, compared to 2019. Airlines in Africa, which include EgyptAir, are expected to see a $4 billion drop. Hundreds of thousands of job in the aviation sector are also at risk across both regions.Saudi Arabia’s revenue loss could exceed $5.6 billion this year, as all pilgrimage flights are currently halted in addition to commercial flights to and from the kingdom. The United Arab Emirates, home to world’s busiest airport for international travel in Dubai, is projected to lose $5.4 billion in revenue.Egypt and Qatar could also see more than $1 billion each in revenue loss, while the aviation sector in South Africa is expected to lose $2.3 billion in potential revenue.IATA said projections are based on assumptions that travel restrictions will continue through the second quarter of 2020. Even if travel recovers partially in the second half of the year, it will be slow and impacted by an overall slump in the global economy and weakened passenger demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-s-health-minister-has-coronavirus-was-in-frequent-contact-of-pm-netanyahu/story-8Mth2J2Td5X6GtqLOxS5QJ.html

The announcement comes amid uncertainty over the hajj which is due to take place at the end of July, after authorities this week urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage. “Full 24-hour curfew in Mecca and Medina starting from today until further notice,” the official Saudi Press Agency reported, citing an interior ministry source. The cities were earlier under a 15-hour daily curfew. Authorities have already sealed off Mecca and Medina along with Riyadh and Jeddah, barring people from entering and exiting the cities as well as prohibiting movement between all provinces. Saudi Arabia, which has reported the highest number of infections in the Gulf, is scrambling to limit the spread of the disease at home. On Thursday the health ministry said the deaths from the illness had risen to 21 while 1,885 infections were reported. Last month, Saudi Arabia suspended the year-round “umrah” pilgrimage over fears of the coronavirus pandemic spreading to Islam’s holiest cities. Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year’s hajj. Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from across the world to take part in the hajj, which all Muslims must perform at least once in their lives if able. The Arab world’s biggest economy has also closed down cinemas, malls, restaurants and halted flights as it steps up efforts to contain the virus. King Salman has warned of a “more difficult” fight ahead against the virus, as the kingdom faces the economic double blow of virus-led shutdowns and crashing oil prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-updates-saudi-imposes-24-hour-coronavirus-curfew-in-holy-cities/story-yx6Js5L6HqfnpjyfQWx4ON.html

In response, Zarif tweeted that “Iran has FRIENDS: No one can have MILLIONS of ‘proxies’“Iran responded angrily to the US Patriot deployment warning that Washington risked leading the Middle East to disaster in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.Its armed forces chief of staff said the recent attacks against US bases in Iraq are the “natural reaction” of Iraqi people towards Washington’s continuing military presence.The attacks “have nothing to do with our country. The Americans sometimes attribute such things to us, which is projecting the blame,” Iran’s ISNA news agency quoted Major General Mohammad Bagheri as saying.“Iran has no involvement in these actions and no intention to attack foreign forces,” he said, underlining that Iran would still respond strongly to any aggression.Battle for influence Iran and the US are in a tense battle for influence in Iraq, where Tehran has powerful allies and Washington has close ties to the government.Bases in Iraq housing US troops and foreign embassies, particularly the American mission, have been targeted in more than two dozen rocket attacks since October that Washington has blamed on Iran-backed armed groups.Tensions have risen sharply since Trump withdrew from a landmark nuclear agreement in 2018 and reimposed sweeping sanctions.They escalated in January when the US killed Iran’s Major General Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike near Baghdad airport.Iran retaliated by firing at bases in Iraq housing US troops.While on high alert for a response, Iranian air defences accidentally shot down a Ukrainian airliner minutes after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board.Iran has repeatedly called on the Trump administration to reverse its sanctions policy, which has been opposed even by US allies, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic hit.“This was the best, historic opportunity for the Americans to reverse their wrong path and for once, tell their nation they are not against the Iranian people,” President Hassan Rouhani told a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.Medicines and medical equipment are technically exempt from the US sanctions but purchases are frequently blocked by the unwillingness of banks to process purchases for fear of incurring large penalties in the United States.European nations have delivered medical goods to Iran in the first transaction under the Instex financing mechanism set up to get round US sanctions, Germany said on Tuesday.But it is more than a year since Britain, France and Germany announced the creation of Instex and Iran has questioned European governments’ commitment to seeing it through in defiance of the Trump administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-us-heat-up-war-of-words-despite-coronavirus-pandemic/story-QqNmXReQJUEyGX9x9BkPuN.html
02-04-2020||World||Over 95% who died due to coronavirus in Europe were over 60: WHO||More than 95% of those who have died of coronavirus in Europe have been over 60 but young people should not be complacent, the head of the World Health Organization’s office in Europe said Thursday.Dr. Hans Kluge said age is not the only risk factor for getting a severe case of the virus that has put billions under lockdown and upended the world economy.“The very notion that Covid-19 only affects older people is factually wrong,” he said at an online news conference in Copenhagen. “Young people are not invincible.”Those comments echoed similar statements from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.The U.N. health agency says 10% to 15% of people under 50 with the disease have moderate or severe cases.“Severe cases of the disease have been seen in people in their teens or 20s, with many requiring intensive care and some unfortunately passing away,” Kluge said.He said recent statistics showed 30,098 people have been reported to have died in Europe, mostly in Italy, France and Spain.“We know that over 95% of these deaths occurred in those older than 60 years,” he said, with more than half of the dead over 80.Kluge said more than 80% of those who died had at least one other chronic underlying condition like cardiovascular disease, hypertension or diabetes.“On a positive note, there are reports of people over the age of 100 who were admitted to hospital for Covid-19 and have now — since — made a complete recovery,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-95-who-died-due-to-coronavirus-in-europe-were-over-60-who/story-YbG0aBGn5OIZI5bVkRYK4N.html

02-04-2020||World||Donald Trump casts doubt on Chinese coronavirus figures||President Donald Trump cast doubt on the accuracy of official Chinese figures on its coronavirus outbreak after US lawmakers, citing an intelligence report, accused Beijing of a cover up.“How do we know” if they are accurate, Trump asked at a press conference. “Their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side.”Trump insisted that “the relationship with China’s a good one” and that he remained close to President Xi Jinping.However, controversy around Beijing’s transparency has strained ties, adding to bad feelings triggered by a conspiracy theory in China that the US military was to blame for the virus.Republicans in Congress, pointing to a report by Bloomberg citing US intelligence, expressed outrage that Beijing apparently misled the international community on China’s infections and deaths that began in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.China’s reporting has been intentionally incomplete, with some intelligence officials describing Beijing’s numbers as fake, reported Bloomberg, which highlighted the classified intelligence document sent to the White House last week.China has publicly reported 82,394 confirmed cases and 3,316 deaths as of Thursday, according to a rolling tracker by Johns Hopkins University.That compares to 216,722 cases and 5.137 deaths in the United States, the country with the world’s largest reported outbreak.Asked about the report at a press briefing on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying didn’t directly address it or Trump’s comments, but said that “to slander, to discredit, to blame others or to shift responsibility cannot make up the time that has been lost.”“To carry on lying will only waste more time and cause more loss of life,” she said, adding that politicians who accused China of concealing information were “shameless and without morality.”Republican Senator Ben Sasse attacked Beijing’s numbers as “garbage propaganda.”“The claim that the United States has more coronavirus deaths than China is false,” Sasse said in a statement.“Without commenting on any classified information, this much is painfully obvious: The Chinese Communist Party has lied, is lying, and will continue to lie about coronavirus to protect the regime.”In a statement responding to the report, Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said China is “not a trustworthy partner” in the fight against Covid-19.“They lied to the world about the human-to-human transmission of the virus, silenced doctors and journalists who tried to report the truth, and are now apparently hiding the accurate number of people impacted by this disease,” McCaul said.He and other lawmakers have called on the State Department to launch an investigation into what he called China’s “cover up” of the pandemic.On Tuesday a member of Trump’s coronavirus task force, doctor Deborah Birx, said the medical community saw China’s outbreak as “serious but smaller than anyone expected because I think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-casts-doubt-on-chinese-coronavirus-figures/story-66VI21CwdQTIJMTwY8m3RM.html
02-04-2020||World||North Korea insists it is free of coronavirus||North Korea remains totally free of the coronavirus, a senior health official in Pyongyang has insisted, despite mounting scepticism overseas as confirmed global infections near one million.The already isolated, nuclear-armed North quickly shut down its borders after the virus was first detected in neighbouring China in January, and imposed strict containment measures.Pak Myong Su, director of the anti-epidemic department of the North’s Central Emergency Anti-epidemic Headquarters, insisted that the efforts had been completely successful.“Not one single person has been infected with the novel coronavirus in our country so far,” Pak told AFP.“We have carried out preemptive and scientific measures such as inspections and quarantine for all personnel entering our country and thoroughly disinfecting all goods, as well as closing borders and blocking sea and air lanes.”Nearly every other country has reported coronavirus cases, with the World Health Organization saying on Wednesday that there were nearly one million confirmed infections globally.Aside from China, South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the virus, which has claimed more than 45,000 lives around the world.Experts have said the North is particularly vulnerable to the virus because of its weak medical system, and defectors have accused Pyongyang of covering up an outbreak. The top US military commander in South Korea, General Robert Abrams, said last month he was “fairly certain” the North had confirmed cases of the virus.US President Donald Trump also said North Korea “is going through something” and offered “cooperation in the anti-epidemic work”, in a personal letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.And Choi Jung-hun, a former North Korean doctor who fled to the South in 2012, told AFP: “I heard there are many deaths in North Korea but the authorities are not saying that it’s caused by the coronavirus.”‘Strict control’As part of its anti-virus efforts Pyongyang put thousands of its own people and hundreds of foreigners -- including diplomats -- into isolation and mounted disinfection drives, with state media constantly exhorting citizens to obey health directives.Published images have shown universal face mask use, with the exception of leader Kim Jong Un, who has never been seen wearing one, even though for several weeks the officers alongside him when he supervised firing exercises donned black coverings.More recently his aides have also been seen without face masks, although defector Choi said that did not signal the North’s containment efforts had been widely successful.“Everyone accompanying Kim Jong Un is under strict control and safe from any virus threats,” said Choi.Pyongyang -- which is subject to multiple international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes -- has sought virus-related aid.In February, Russia’s foreign ministry said it provided Pyongyang with 1,500 coronavirus diagnostic test kits at its request “due to the persisting risk of the new COVID-19”.The United Nations has granted sanctions exemptions to relief groups including Doctors without Borders and UNICEF on items such as diagnostic kits, face masks, protective equipment and disinfectants.UNICEF confirmed its shipment of supplies -- requested by the North’s health ministry -- arrived in Pyongyang overland from China last week.The World Health Organisation plans to spend $900,000 to support Pyongyang’s coronavirus response activities, according to data posted on the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-insists-it-is-free-of-coronavirus/story-Aw63KFHXGc5dH7wm6wHOqM.html

The infection has claimed over 40,000 lives across the globe as the pandemic spreads at a “near-exponential” rate. A six-week-old baby became one of the youngest known victims of the contagion. Nearly half of the planet is under some form of a lockdown. While China takes baby steps on the path to recovery, the United States, Italy, France, Spain and Iran continue to grapple with the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths.Here are top global developments in the coronavirus situation.1. In an unprecedented move, the Australian government has announced free childcare during the coronavirus pandemic. 2. The United Kingdom records over 500 deaths in a single day.3. President of Philippines Rodrigo Duterte said that violators of lockdown could be shot dead.4. White House has said that the projections show the number of Covid-19 deaths could go up to 100,000 to 240,000 in the country. 5. China’s Shenzhen has banned the consumption of wild animals, dog and cat meat.6. The United States now accounts for almost a quarter of reported global infections. The country reported its 5,000th death, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The total number of infections rose above 216,000.7. Britain and France reported their highest daily death tolls from coronavirus on Wednesday.8. Italy’s total death toll turned the highest in the world, jumping past 13,000. Spain has witnessed over 9,000 deaths so far.9. The Food and Agriculture Organization, WHO and World Trade Organization said panic buying amid coronavirus pandemic could threaten food supplies across the globe.10. India witnessed the number of cases nearly double in the past week. The number of Covid-19 cases in the country stands at 1,925 including active cases, recoveries and fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-announces-free-childcare-china-s-shenzhen-bans-cat-and-dog-meat-covid-19-updates-from-across-the-globe/story-sWC3QgjDjqCrfCCkDU7VTK.html
02-04-2020||World||Under-fire, PM Boris Johnson says UK will ‘massively increase testing’||Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain would “massively increase testing” amid a growing wave of criticism on Thursday about his government’s failure to provide widespread coronavirus screening.In a video message posted online on Wednesday night from Downing Street, where he has been in self-isolation since announcing on March 27 that he had contracted the virus, Johnson said testing was the “way through”.“We’re also massively increasing testing. As I have said for weeks and weeks this (testing) is the way through,” Johnson said.“This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle, this is how we will defeat it in the end.”He was reacting to condemnation of his government, especially in the media, after officials revealed that just 2,000 out of half-a-million staff in the state-run National Health Service (NHS) had been tested.There have also been reports of staff being turned away from drive-in test centres because they did not have the correct paperwork, or others which were deserted because testing was by appointment only.Figures published Wednesday showed a total of 2,352 people with COVID-19 have died in the UK, an increase of 563, the largest single-day rise. Two of the deaths were medics.Testing for the general public has also been condemned as not being widespread enough. On Tuesday, 10,000 hospital patients and NHS staff were tested in England, well below the daily target of 25,000 and the 70,000 a day achieved in Germany.Various normally pro-government newspapers condemned the plans as “chaotic”, a “scandal” and a “shambles” as the backlash gathered pace.Paul Nurse, chief executive of biomedical research centre the Francis Crick Institute, told the BBC Thursday that the government should summon “the Dunkirk spirit” and let ‘small ship’ labs start screening for the killer disease.So far, Public Health England (PHE), the body tasked with testing, has insisted all screening should be carried out centrally.PHE medical director Professor Paul Cosford defended his organisation’s work.“At the very outset we identified this, we got the tests in place, we designed the tests in our laboratories. We have played our part,” he told BBC radio.Britain is currently in lockdown, with shops shut and the public asked to stay at home to try to limit the spread of coronavirus.The government has promised an enormous package of support for businesses and employees hit by the measures, but is facing questions about how quickly the money is getting through.New government figures show 950,000 people applied for state welfare support known as universal credit in the last fortnight. It is available to the unemployed and those on low incomes.National plane carrier British Airways is expected to announce it will suspend 36,000 staff later on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-fire-pm-boris-johnson-says-uk-will-massively-increase-testing/story-QGVdaUONzO1cvriKaE9a2M.html

02-04-2020||World||Covid-19: US cheers Indian engineers for building low-cost ventilator||Cheering the Indian engineers for building a low-cost ventilator, the US hopes that this invention succeeds and can eventually be mass produced as the critical medical equipment can save many lives from the deadly coronavirus that has killed over 5,000 people in America and 40,000 others globally.The United States, which as per latest projections is expecting between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths due to the coronavirus, requires thousands of ventilators in the next few weeks. It has roped in 11 private sector companies, including car manufacturers and plane makers to build ventilators.“We are cheering on these Indian engineers as they race to build a low-cost ventilator -- a potential game-changer for COVID19,” Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice G Wells tweeted.With support from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineers and production advice from a US-based company, “we hope this invention succeeds & can eventually be produced at scale,” Wells wrote. According to the MIT, in the US alone, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause ventilator shortages of 300,000-700,000 units. An increase in conventional ventilator production is very likely to fall short and with significant associated costs.Mass production of low-cost ventilators by a group of Indian engineers with the support from the MIT engineers and production advice from a US-based company, the US officials hope it would come as a big help to mankind which is racing against time in this fight against the deadly coronavirus.Taranjit Singh Sandhu, India’s Ambassador to the US, described this as an important step in the fight against COVID-19.“Important steps in combating the COVID19,” the ambassador said in a tweet.“Young engineers, with help from doctors and entrepreneurs in India and the US, are developing a low cost ventilator that could save thousands of lives. Here’s wishing them success!” Sandhu said.While the average cost of current ventilators in the US is around USD 30,000, the MIT said that a rapidly assembled volunteer team of engineers, physicians, computer scientists, and others, centered at the MIT, is working to implement a safe, inexpensive alternative for emergency use, which could be built quickly around the world.The team called MIT E-Vent (for emergency ventilator), was formed on March 12 in response to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its members were brought together by the exhortations of doctors, friends, and a sudden flood of mail referencing a project done a decade ago in the MIT class 2.75 (Medical Device Design).Students and faculty working in consultation with the local physicians designed a simple ventilator device that could be built with about USD 100 worth of parts, although in the years since prices have gone up and the device would now cost USD 400 to USD 500 in materials, the MIT said.The key to the simple, inexpensive ventilator alternative is a hand-operated plastic pouch called a bag-valve resuscitator or Ambu bag, which hospitals already have on hand in large quantities, it said.The MIT said that these are designed to be operated by hand, by a medical professional or emergency technician, to provide breaths to a patient in situations like cardiac arrest. As the deadly coronavirus crisis accelerates, a number of countries, including the US and India, are trying to procure ventilators needed for hospitals to deal with the demand caused by the virus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-cheers-indian-engineers-for-building-low-cost-ventilator/story-FHpaOcSJFRvsma9Cqnti2J.html

02-04-2020||World||Coronavirus changes burial rituals for Jews, Muslims||A rising death toll in the coronavirus crisis is forcing a change in Jewish and Muslim burial and mourning traditions in the Holy Land.In Israel, Jewish dead are normally laid to rest in a cloth smock and shroud, without a coffin. Now, the bodies of coronavirus victims are taken for ritual washing - performed in full protective gear - wrapped in impermeable plastic.They are wrapped again in plastic before interment.“Feelings are very much mixed,” said Yakov Kurtz, who works for Chevra Kadisha, the main group overseeing Jewish burials in Israel. “We don’t know what to expect, we don’t know how many dead we will have to tend to. There are many fears.”New decrees for handling the coronavirus dead have been given for Muslim burials, said Sheikh Muhammad Hussein, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and the Palestinian Territories. “This is a rule of necessity and necessities allow for prohibitions, therefore the deceased is not washed, nor shrouded and is buried in a plastic body-bag,” Hussein said. Israel has reported 29 coronavirus deaths so far. The Palestinians have confirmed one fatality so far. Funerals and mourning rituals have changed for everyone since Israeli and Palestinian authorities imposed stay-at-home directives and restricted the size of public gatherings to try to halt the spread of infection.Funerals in Israel can be attended by no more than 20 people in an open space only. Social distancing rules mean that embracing the bereaved is just not done. That has affected the Jewish tradition of Shiva - a seven-day period that begins after a funeral, in which people come to the family home to offer condolences, bring food and reminisce about the departed.In Gaza and the occupied West Bank bereaved families have taken to accepting condolences over social media. Ihab Nasseraldin lost his brother to cancer last week. His body was taken from the hospital to the cemetery, and the family could not hold a service they had planned at Jerusalem al-Aqsa’s mosque. “We buried him and condolences were accepted at the burial site. We had already requested everybody not to shake hands, no hugging or kissing, which is custom here. This was uncomfortable,” said Nasseraldin. Few were able to attend the funeral. Friends and relatives were told not to visit the family home during the customary three-day mourning period.“I truly feel sad that we were not able to pray at al-Aqsa over the body,” said Nasseraldin. “But there is nothing we can do. May God accept this from us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-changes-burial-rituals-for-jews-muslims/story-9npPLvPfqOFGT04T8bnUNL.html

Dress up as usual, put on make-up and dress neatly. OMG! This is what Rina, our Minister of Women, Family & Community Development thinks is important during the #COVID19 lockdown? No tips on how to deal with #DomesticViolence? Just state DV is a crime. pic.twitter.com/FfswtPBIPH In one poster, Malaysia's gender equality movement regresses five decades.

What’s she thinking!?If this is shown to the world we will be a joke!! Malaysia boleh!After the online posters sparked a public outcry, the ministry removed them.“(It) is extremely condescending both to women and men,” said Nisha Sabanayagam, a manager at All Women’s Action Society, a Malaysian advocacy group.Malaysia is ranked 104 out of 153 countries in the latest World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap index, after scoring poorly on political empowerment and economic participation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-nag-husbands-during-lockdown-malaysia-tells-women-hell-breaks-loose-online/story-5rM9sK4nVbzAfaw3IcIwON.html

Here’s why||Pakistan on Wednesday reported the biggest jump in Covid-19 cases for the third consecutive day as the number of people infected with the deadly disease reached 2,238.The country has also witnessed 31 deaths from the disease.Reports of the lack of adequate screening procedures and squalid living conditions at the quarantine camps at the Taftan border crossing with Iran have raised concerns about the surge in the number of infections.The increase in the number of cases showed that there was little impact of the measures, including partial lockdown, taken so far to reduce the spread of the disease.Also Watch | ‘Pakistan army sending COVID-19 patients to PoK’: Activist Amjad Mirza People have so far refused to listen to the authorities. Officials in Pakistan are scrambling to contain the disease by appealing to the public to remain inside homes and go out only in cases of emergencies. But there was little impact on the masses and in several cities, people were seen roaming out while security officials were trying to convince them to go back to their places.Reports say that mosques have not been shut, despite the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country. An event was organised in Pakistan last month where 2,50,000 people had gathered, showing the casual approach adopted by the authorities in the country in controlling the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.While Saudi Arabia and Iran have announced closure of mosques, Pakistan is yet to take such a decision. Friday prayers have been going on in the mosques in Punjab province which has a population of 110 million. Except the provincial governments in Sidh and Balochistan, no other regional government has taken a decision to close the places of worship.This dilly-dallying by the central government in Pakistan has led Opposition parties to launch an attack on the Imran Khan dispensation.“This government has yet to decide if it wants to properly shut down the country or not. We demand that lockdown should be imposed without any further delay,” Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader and former premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said.Khan, on his part, has said that “coronavirus will be confronted by the force of faith”. Pakistani media cited Jamaat-i-Islami’s general-secretary Liaqat Baloch as saying that the Prime Minister is “confused” over whether or not to impose a lockdown in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-is-failing-in-fight-against-covid-19-here-s-why/story-vsRGOpRY7AR2dTogBIymTM.html

Three other men convicted of Pearl’s murder have been acquitted and ordered to be freed.The Sindh high court’s verdict, which overturned the 2002 conviction an anti-terrorism court, gave its ruling following appeals by the four convicts.Daniel Pearl, a 38-year-old American journalist, was abducted in Karachi while researching a story on Pakistan terrorists for the Wall Street Journal in the months after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States. His remains were later found in a shallow grave on the outskirts of the port city. A graphic video showing Pearl’s decapitation was delivered to the US consulate in the city nearly a month later. In this, the journalist’s captors forced him to say that he was Jewish before slitting his throat.Omar Sheikh’s lawyer Khawja Naveed told AFP that since Sheikh has been in prison since 2002, he was expected to be released, but the court had not yet issued that order, Naveed said.Sheikh, a British citizen of Pakistani origin, was freed by India along with Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Masood Azhar and terrorist Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar in exchange for the passengers of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 hijacked by a group of Pakistani terrorists from Kathmandu to Kandahar in December 1999.Thursday’s verdict was pronounced by a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha on appeals filed by the four men 18 years ago.The high court also dismissed an appeal by the prosecution seeking enhancement of life sentence given to the three other men – Fahad Naseem, Salman Saqib and Sheikh Adil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-sentence-overturned-for-briton-convicted-in-journalist-daniel-pearl-s-2002-murder-court/story-M2QgpfI6uMUwBtoIHMPKmN.html

02-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Donald Trump resists national shutdown, leaving it up to states||President Donald Trump is resisting calls to issue a national stay-at-home order to stem the spread of the new coronavirus despite his administration’s projections that tens of thousands of Americans are likely to be killed by the disease. One by one, though, states are increasingly pushing shutdown orders of their own.Trump said Wednesday he wants to give governors’ “flexibility” on whether a stay-at-home policy is the best option for their constituents, but acknowledged that he’s looking at limiting air and rail travel between hot spots within the United States. The president remains hesitant to press a unified policy even after the White House released “sobering” new projections on Tuesday that 100,000 to 240,000 Americans will likely succumb to the coronavirus even if current social distancing guidelines are maintained.Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Wednesday the nation’s federalist system leaves much of the authority on how to properly respond to catastrophes to individual state governors and local officials.“We trust the governors and the mayors to understand their people and understand whether or not they feel like they can trust the people in their states to make the right decisions,” Adams said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”On Wednesday alone, five more states — Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Nevada and Pennsylvania — added or expanded their stay-at-home orders.But the invocation of federalism in the midst of a crisis that threatens a nationwide body count on par with some of the deadliest American wars suggests that Trump and his advisers are cognizant of the political ramifications of their response. Republican governors in states like Florida, Texas and Nebraska have questioned the necessity of applying strong social distancing rules to rural or exurban areas that haven’t reported much evidence of the virus so far.The lack of a unified, 50-state response also collides with evidence emerging that coronavirus infections are being spread by people who have no clear symptoms, complicating efforts to gain control of the pandemic. A study conducted by researchers in Singapore and published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday is the latest to estimate that around 10% of new coronavirus infections may be spread by people who were infected with the virus but not experiencing symptoms.Even while deferring to governors. the Trump administration has issued guidelines that have urged Americans to work from home if possible, cancel on-site instruction at schools, and avoid large gatherings. The resistance to a more robust response comes even as Vice President Mike Pence said White House models for the coronavirus toll show the country on a trajectory akin to hard-hit Italy.Speaking to CNN, Pence said, “We think Italy may be the most comparable area to the United States at this point.” Italy, which has already recorded more than 13,000 deaths, has issued a nationwide quarantine, shutting down almost all industrial production and offices and largely prohibiting residents from leaving their homes.The White House’s best-case projection for loss of life assumes statewide stay-at-home orders, according to a senior administration official familiar with Trump’s thinking. Trump, the official said, is a believer in federalism and that it is up to individual governors to set restrictions for their states. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.More than 285 million people live in the 40 states where governors have declared statewide shelter-in-place orders or have recommended that residents stay home. In other states — places like Iowa and Nebraska, among others — governors have resisted state-level decisions, but some localities have declared residents should stay at home.According to a poll published Wednesday by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 78% of U.S. adults, including 84% of Democrats and 76% of Republicans, favor requiring Americans to stay in their homes except for essential errands. Americans in states that already had stay-at-home orders in place when the survey began are more likely than those in states that did not to approve of their state’s response, 63% to 51%.Still, Trump — who has conducted long, near-daily briefings on his administration’s response to the virus outbreak over the last three weeks — has been reluctant so far to use his bully pulpit to urge governors to issue orders that would help effectively create a national quarantine.“There are some states that are different,” Trump told reporters Wednesday. “There are some states that don’t have much of a problem.”But there are signs that Trump administration officials are pushing behind the scenes for holdout governors to issue statewide quarantines.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had resisted issuing a statewide order but reversed course and issued one Wednesday as federal and local pressure mounted for him to abandon the county-by-county approach he had implemented.DeSantis, a Republican, told reporters that he decided to issue the order after consulting with Trump and White House advisers.Rep. Donna Shalala, a Florida Democrat, said earlier Wednesday that Trump should be pressing governors for a unified approach to help stem the spread of the disease, calling his response so far “fragmented, weak and uneven.”“He hasn’t made a national plea to say we’re all in this together, and he hasn’t even talked to the governors about all doing the same thing,” Shalala, who was secretary of health and human services under President Bill Clinton, said in an interview.Authority to order quarantines inside states rests almost entirely with states under provisions in the U.S. Constitution ceding power not explicitly delegated to the federal government to states, courts have ruled consistently for years. While the federal government itself can’t order nationwide quarantines or impose quarantines on states, courts have said it has clear power under constitutional clauses regulating commerce to quarantine international travelers or those traveling state to state who might be carriers of deadly diseases.A few legal scholars have argued that the Constitution’s Commerce Clause may vest Trump with powers to impose a multiple state or national lockdown with or without states’ approval, though any such move under that minority interpretation would almost certainly be challenged immediately as unconstitutional.Pence told CNN that leaders and residents of states that haven’t been hard hit are already taking action to slow the virus’ spread.In Nebraska, Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts has said he’s basing his decisions on the advice he gets from public health experts at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, which has dealt extensively with outbreaks and served as a quarantine space for Ebola patients. In Iowa, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds has resisted a mandatory shelter-in- place order, saying the data she looks at doesn’t yet justify it in her state.South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, another Republican, said her voluntary guidance had helped slow the infection rate. “The calls to apply a one-size-fits-all approach is herd mentality, it’s not leadership,” she said.Ricketts, a vocal Trump supporter, has repeatedly said he won’t impose a stay-at-home order in Nebraska but has ordered restaurants either to close their dining areas or allow no more than 10 people inside at once, depending on their location in the state.In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered schools to stay closed through at least May and imposed restrictions that doctors and even his critics say are tantamount to a stay-at-home order for the state. Still, Abbott refused to call it that.“This is not a stay-at-home strategy. A stay-at-home strategy would mean that you have to stay home,” Abbott said. “This is a standard based upon essential services and essential activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-donald-trump-resists-national-shutdown-leaving-it-up-to-states/story-hvmKOOOvOtMlOLKKlGQ33J.html
02-04-2020||World||Social distancing guidelines to stay until no new COVID cases, deaths: White House||Social distancing guidelines will likely stay in place in the US until there are “no new cases and no deaths”, the White House coronavirus task force has indicated while confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country climbed beyond 200,000 and deaths topped 4,700.“The ultimate solution to a virus that might keep coming back is a vaccine”, America’s top infectious diseases doctor Anthony Fauci said at a White House briefing on Wednesday. The US now has the world’s highest caseload from the pandemic, the wail of ambulances loudest in New York which is reporting the most crushing numbers. Trump is bracing the nation for “horrific” days ahead. Fauci said that by the time the US is ready to relax social distancing guidelines, testing capacity would have to be available at scale. “The one thing we hopefully will have in place is a much more robust system of identifying someone who is infected, isolate them and then do contact tracing”, Dr. Fauci said. “A really good program of containment”, Fauci said, will give the US enough flex to “never have to get into mitigation”.“We are in mitigation right now”, Fauci said, referring to the social distancing guidelines that are in place till April 30. Speaking about vaccine development, Fauci said the work is “on target”. “We’re still in Phase 1, there were three doses, we’re in the highest dose now. A few months from now, we’ll be in Phase 2”, Fauci said. Fauci has stuck firmly to his timeline of “a year or year and a half” for vaccine breakthrough. On antibody testing, Fauci confirmed that “there is a lot of activity centred around a passive transfer of antibodies of convalescent plasma” but clarified that this is not the first priority right now. Testing, he said, is the most urgent task before the US.“It is very important to get a feel for the penetrance of infection in society. You get a better feel for what the herd immunity would be”, Fauci explained. This week, the Trump administration revealed for the first time multiple predictive models that are being used to estimate its grim assessment of a 100,000-200,000 coronavirus death toll in the country and stressed that community adherence to social distancing guidelines will be the game changer that will flatten the curve. “There’s no magic bullet. There’s no magic vaccine or therapy. It’s just behaviours. Each of our behaviours, translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days”, Dr Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response co-ordinator, said.“Americans should be prepared for that (death toll). Yes, it is a projection but that’s what it is and we have to be prepared for that”, said Fauci. The 100,000-200,000 death toll projection “assumes full mitigation measures” currently in place. The current guidelines stop short of a complete lockdown, still allowing people to go outside the home for solitary activities and for essential tasks. “We trust the American people to keep that six feet distance when they go out, meet people. That is why we have not issued a complete lockdown”, Birx said. She said that if people maintain “that six feet distance”, they have “controlled” the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-distancing-guidelines-to-stay-until-no-new-covid-cases-deaths-white-house/story-BdpaxYkwSGcdxyHrJdhBCJ.html

In dollar terms, this will be the largest measure ever taken in the history of the nation, as Trudeau said during a press conference: “Canada hasn’t seen this type of civic mobilization since the Second World War. These are the biggest economic measures in our lifetimes, to defeat a threat to our health.”Follow latest updates on coronavirus here There is also no clear timeline for when a semblance of normalcy will return and restrictive measures in place to prevent the spread of the virus will be relaxed. Responding to a question in French on whether such measures will remain till July, Trudeau indicated that was a “realistic” assumption.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageHe also said, “We know that they’re going to be in place for a number of more weeks, perhaps more months.” But the outcome, he added, will depend on the “choices” Canadians made, like staying at home or self-isolating.The government has put in place a mammoth assistance package to counteract the financial hardships that will result from Covid-19. According to government figures, direct support and liquidity measures will cost the exchequer CA$ 190 billion. These measures include a wage subsidy that can be utilised by businesses to retain employees as well as a dole for those who find themselves unemployed.Also read: Canada to organise 6 flights out of India for its citizens stuck due to Covid-19 lockdown||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-calls-emergency-parliament-session-to-pass-legislation-on-covid-19/story-kQL0wA47xt9ZD9X0qrvahO.html

The move to buy from Russia comes after a telephonic conversation between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on March 30.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “As a follow-up to the March 30 phone call between President Trump and President Putin, the United States has agreed to purchase needed medical supplies, including ventilators and personal protection equipment, from Russia, which were handed over to FEMA on April 1 in New York City.” State Department Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said on Wednesday.Both the countries have provided humanitarian assistance to each other in times of crisis in the past and will no doubt do so again in the future, she said.Also read| ‘How do we know’: US Prez Trump casts doubt on Chinese coronavirus figures “This is a time to work together to overcome a common enemy that threatens the lives of all of us,” she added. “The countries of the G20 agreed last week to work together to defeat the coronavirus, and we are working closely with these countries and others to ensure that critically needed supplies get to those in need,” Ortagus said. The United States is committed to the global fight against Covid-19, she said, adding that the US is a generous and reliable contributor to crisis response and humanitarian action across the world. “But we cannot do it alone,” Ortagus noted. President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the US was headed for a “very tough two weeks”, advising people to be prepared for the “hard days” ahead, as the country is at war with the deadly coronavirus pandemic that the White House projects could claim one to two lakh lives during the next fortnight.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Deborah Bix, a member of White House Task Force on coronavirus, based on a model from actual data from the ground, said the death toll in the US could be between 100,000 to 200,000, with the strict implementation of the existing mitigation measures including social distancing till April 30. Across the United States, hospitals are facing shortages of ventilators. Some medical device makers have agreed to ramp up supplies. But because patients diagnosed with or suspected to have Covid-19 often require breathing support, there is widespread concern that these devices won’t be developed and shipped quickly enough. A total of 932,605 Covid-19 cases have been reported across more than 175 countries and territories with 16,809 deaths reported so far, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The US has reported 213,372 Covid-19 cases, the highest in the world, and over 5,000 people have died due to the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-us-agrees-to-buy-ventilators-medical-supplies-from-russia/story-0aqPyMlFQoY95fO29841gI.html

We believe this is one of the youngest lives lost anywhere due to complications relating to COVID-19.”Last week Illinois authorities said they were investigating the death of a child “younger than one year” who had tested positive for coronavirus.According to local media that infant was nine months old. The fast-spreading virus that has caused at least 4,476 deaths in the United States is believed to be more dangerous for older adults, though increasingly it appears to be also sending younger patients to hospital as well.New York state, which Connecticut borders, has been particularly hard hit by Covid-19, accounting for nearly 2,000 of the US deaths. Residents of New York, Connecticut and New Jersey are among the millions of Americans ordered to stay home unless they work jobs deemed essential.The tri-state area has posted over 100,000 cases.“This is a virus that attacks our most fragile without mercy,” Lamont tweeted. “This also stresses the importance of staying home and limiting exposure to other people.”“Your life and the lives of others could literally depend on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-six-week-old-infant-dies-of-covid-19-in-us/story-CeZInSA2eVHD7QUdr5bOtJ.html
02-04-2020||World||Coronavirus pandemic could shrink global economy almost 1% in 2020: UN Report||The global economy could shrink almost 1% this year due to the new coronavirus, a sharp reversal from the pre-pandemic forecast of 2.5% growth, the United Nations said Wednesday.The U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs warned in a report that the decline could be even deeper if restrictions on economic activities extend into the third quarter of the year and if fiscal stimulus efforts don’t support income and consumer spending.By comparison, it said, the world economy contracted 1.7% during the global financial crisis in 2009.“Fears of the exponential spread of the virus — and growing uncertainties about the efficacy of various containment measures — have rocked financial markets worldwide,” the report noted, “with market volatility surpassing its peak during the global financial crisis and equity markets and oil prices plunging to multi-year lows.”In the best-case scenario, the report said, moderate declines in private consumption, investment and exports will be offset by increases in government spending in the seven major industrialized nations and China, leading to global growth of 1.2% in 2020.In the worst-case scenario, it said, global output would contract 0.9%, “based on demand-side shocks of different magnitudes” to China, Japan, South Korea, the United States and the European Union as well as a 50% decline in oil prices.This scenario “assumes that wide-ranging restrictions on economic activities in the EU and the United States would extend until the middle of the second quarter,” the report said.It said increasing restrictions on the movement of people and lock-downs in Europe and North America “are hitting the service sector hard, particularly industries that involve physical interactions such as retail trade, leisure and hospitality, recreation and transportation services.” Those sectors account for more than a quarter of all jobs in those countries, and as these businesses lose revenue, unemployment is likely to increase sharply, it said.The report said the negative effects of current economic restrictions in richer developed nations will soon spill over into developing countries, which will see lower trade and investment.The severity of the economic impact — “whether a moderate or deep recession” — will largely depend on the duration of restrictions on the movement of people and economic activities in major economies and on the size and impact of fiscal responses, it said.“Urgent and bold policy measures are needed, not only to contain the pandemic and save lives, but also to protect the most vulnerable in our societies from economic ruin and to sustain economic growth and financial stability,” said Liu Zhenmin, the U.N. undersecretary-general for economic and social affairs.The report said fiscal stimulus packages should prioritize health spending to contain the spread of the virus and should provide income support to households most affected by the pandemic.But the outlook remains gloomy.“A sharp decline in consumer spending in the European Union and the United States will reduce imports of consumer goods from developing countries,” the report said. “In addition, global manufacturing production could contract significantly, amid the possibility of extended disruptions to global supply chains.”It noted that several automobile companies have announced large-scale production suspensions in Europe and the United States and many firms worldwide especially in the auto, consumer electronics and telecommunications industries “are facing shortages of intermediate components as exports from China contracted at an annual pace of 17.2 per cent in the first two months of the year.”“More severe and protracted production disruptions would affect a large number of developing economies that are deeply integrated in global supply networks,” it warned.Developing countries, particularly those dependent on tourism and commodity exports, also face face heightened economic risks, including an increasing likelihood of “debt-distress” for many commodity-dependent economies, it said.The report said the recent collapse in global commodity prices is compounding the bleak fiscal outlook for many of these countries, which haven’t fully recovered from the after-effects of sharp commodity price declines in 2014-2016.The report said the worsening pandemic is increasing deep-seated economic anxiety. “Even in many high-income countries, a significant proportion of the population do not have enough financial wealth to live beyond the national poverty line for three months, causing many to fear for their economic security,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-could-shrink-global-economy-almost-1-in-2020-un-report/story-hVDxf03ST6emhZT7MQrXMJ.html
02-04-2020||World||Canada to organise 6 flights out of India for its citizens stranded due to Covid-19 lockdown||The Canadian government will organise half-a-dozen flights home from India for its citizens and permanent residents who have been stranded due to the 21-day national lockdown . The arrangement came about after discussions between the two governments including between India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Canadian counterpart Francois-Philippe Champagne. There will be six flights: Of these four will depart from Delhi and the other two from Mumbai. The first of these flights will depart on Saturday and the last will leave India on Tuesday.An estimated 25,000 Canadian passport holders and PRs remained in India at the time the lockdown to help curb spread of Covid-19 was imposed and as international flights petered out, there was no opportunity for them to return to Canada.But that changed this week, as Champagne tweeted, “We have facilitated a series of commercial flights from Delhi and Mumbai for Canadian travellers stranded in India to return home.” These flights are not being operated by Air Canada but by a foreign airline. The price for the ticket is also steep, at CA$ 2900 each or nearly Rs 1.5 lakh for the one-way journey.The flights will be via London and those who will be allowed to board them are Canadian citizens, PRs, or their closest relatives like spouses, parents, children or grand-children. Canada continues to impose a ban on the arrival of foreign nationals, which was announced in mid-March by its Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the Covid-19 pandemic gripped the world.All those who return to Canada will have to place themselves into self-isolation for a mandatory period of 14 days.Several persons have petitioned the Canadian government to make these arrangements including Ritu Sihota, a resident of Mississauga in the Greater Toronto Area, who collected more than 15,000 signatures for her effort. In that petition, she wrote, “I am calling on Justin Trudeau to get these stranded Canadian back onto Canadian soil ASAP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-organise-6-flights-out-of-india-for-its-citizens-stuck-due-to-covid-19-lockdown/story-kHxYaJzfR84qOp7Lw0pWWP.html
02-04-2020||World||‘How do we know’: US President Trump casts doubt on Chinese coronavirus figures||President Donald Trump cast doubt Wednesday on the accuracy of official Chinese figures on its coronavirus outbreak after US lawmakers, citing an intelligence report, accused Beijing of a cover up.“How do we know” if they are accurate, Trump asked at a press conference. “Their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side.”Trump insisted that “the relationship with China’s a good one” and that he remained close to President Xi Jinping.However, controversy around Beijing’s transparency has strained ties, adding to bad feelings triggered by a conspiracy theory in China that the US military was to blame for the virus.Republicans in Congress, pointing to a report by Bloomberg citing US intelligence, expressed outrage that Beijing apparently misled the international community on China’s infections and deaths that began in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.China’s reporting has been intentionally incomplete, with some intelligence officials describing Beijing’s numbers as fake, reported Bloomberg, which highlighted the classified intelligence document sent to the White House last week.China has publicly reported 82,361 confirmed cases and 3,316 deaths as of Wednesday, according to a rolling tracker by Johns Hopkins University.That compares to 206,207 cases and 4,542 deaths in the United States, the country with the world’s largest reported outbreak.Republican Senator Ben Sasse attacked Beijing’s numbers as “garbage propaganda.”“The claim that the United States has more coronavirus deaths than China is false,” Sasse said in a statement.“Without commenting on any classified information, this much is painfully obvious: The Chinese Communist Party has lied, is lying, and will continue to lie about coronavirus to protect the regime.”In a statement responding to the report, Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said China is “not a trustworthy partner” in the fight against COVID-19.“They lied to the world about the human-to-human transmission of the virus, silenced doctors and journalists who tried to report the truth, and are now apparently hiding the accurate number of people impacted by this disease,” McCaul said.He and other lawmakers have called on the State Department to launch an investigation into what he called China’s “cover up” of the pandemic.On Tuesday a member of Trump’s coronavirus task force, doctor Deborah Birx, said the medical community saw China’s outbreak as “serious but smaller than anyone expected because I think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-do-we-know-trump-casts-doubt-on-chinese-coronavirus-figures/story-ELFxKSOVxewMsedCkaJt6L.html

The COP26 president-designate is business secretary Alok Sharma.The Scottish government announced this week that the SEC Arena, where COP26 was due to take place, will be turned into a field hospital to cope with coronavirus cases.Sharma said: “The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19. That is why we have decided to reschedule COP26”.“We will continue working tirelessly with our partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis and I look forward to agreeing a new date for the conference”.Espinosa added: “Covid-19 is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, but we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term. Soon, economies will restart”.“This is a chance for nations to recover better, to include the most vulnerable in those plans, and a chance to shape the 21st century economy in ways that are clean, green, healthy, just, safe and more resilient”.Several experts and officials involved with the Paris Agreement endorsed the postponement.Ajay Mathur, director-general of The Energy and Resource Institute, said: “The momentum for climate action has accelerated considerably, and we will have to ensure that this momentum is sustained even as CoP26 is moved to 2021”.“However, this postponement was the right decision - it highlights the centrality of the individual citizens of the world, and of their safety, security, and well-being. We need to keep this centrality in mind as we move to maintain and enhance momentum on climate action, while building a safer, healthier and more resilient global economy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-cop26-un-climate-change-conference-in-glasgow-postponed-due-to-covid-19/story-ghzEnxmAyj1SP4h5XMR53K.html
02-04-2020||World||Coronavirus Update: Will reach 1 mn Covid-19 cases, 50,000 deaths in next few days, says WHO||The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) voiced deep concern on Wednesday about “the rapid escalation and global spread” of COVID-19 cases from the new coronavirus, which has now reached 205 countries and territories.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that his agency, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) backed debt relief to help developing countries cope with the pandemic’s social and economic consequences.“In the past five weeks there has been a near-exponential growth in the number of new cases and the number of deaths has more than doubled in the past week,” Tedros told a virtual news conference in Geneva where the U.N. health organization is based.“In the next few days we will reach 1 million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide,” he said. China, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged in December, reported dwindling new infections on Wednesday and for the first time disclosed the number of asymptomatic cases, which could complicate how trends in the outbreak are read. Its latest figures excluded 130 new sufferers of the highly contagious disease who do not show symptoms, its statistics showed.Asked about the distinction, Dr. Maria ver Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist who was part of an international team who went to China in February, said WHO’s definition included laboratory-confirmed cases “regardless of the development of symptoms”.“From data that we have seen from China in particular, we know that individuals who are identified, who are listed as asymptomatic, about 75 percent of those actually go on to develop symptoms,” she said, describing them as having been in a “pre-symptomatic phase”. The new coronavirus causes the respiratory disease COVID-19.The outbreak continues to be driven by people who show signs of disease including fever and cough, but it is important for the WHO to capture that “full spectrum of illness”, she added.Tedros, referring to proposed debt relief, said: “Many countries, developing countries cannot really support their societies especially during lockdowns, especially those community members who work for their daily bread. That is why we call on the international community to have debt relief to support those countries.“We are proposing an expedited process to support countries so their economies are not getting into crisis, (and) their communities are not getting into crisis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-will-reach-1-mn-covid-19-cases-50-000-deaths-in-next-few-days-says-who/story-4xfD89A0HYA81RbqwkMkHN.html
02-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: Lockdown, emergency measures averted greater epidemic in China, says study||The lockdown of the first Covid-19 pandemic epicentre Wuhan city and the highest emergency response put in place in the rest of China delayed the spread of the outbreak and reduced case numbers by hundreds of thousands by February 19, a new study published this week said.Drawing inferences from statistical and mathematical analyses of human mobility and transmission control measures, the study said “…control measures were strongly associated with the containment of Covid-19, potentially averting hundreds of thousands of cases by February 19, day 50 of the epidemic.”The study published in the academic journal Science on Tuesday was conducted by 22 scientists from China, the US, and the UK.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageTo quantitatively investigate the impact of travel restrictions and social distancing measures on infection spread, according to Chinese state media, the researchers used a unique geocoded repository of data on Covid-19 epidemiology, human movement, and public health intervention in China in an analysis that spanned from December 31, 2019, to February 19, 2020.The epicentre Wuhan was put under a lockdown within that period, on January 23, as China was shutting down for the Chinese New Year (CNY) holidays.Also read: Genetic sequencing takes lead in Covid-19 vaccine development“In summary, this analysis shows that transmission control (non-pharmaceutical) measures initiated during CNY holidays, including the unprecedented Wuhan city travel ban and the Level 1 national emergency response, were strongly associated with, though not necessarily the cause of, a delay in epidemic growth and a reduction in case numbers during the first 50 days of the Covid-19 epidemic in China,” the researchers said.Without the travel ban on Wuhan or the national emergency response, there would have been approximately 744,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases outside Wuhan by February 19, the model suggests.“With the ban alone, there would have been approximately 202,000 cases; and while with the national emergency response alone, the figure would have decreased to roughly 199000,” according to the study.On average, the travel ban delayed the arrival time of Covid-19 in cities by an estimated 2.91 days, according to the study.Also read: Case study of first US community spread patient offers vital Covid-19 cluesCities that implemented a Level 1 response before cases were reported had 33.3% fewer laboratory-confirmed cases during the first week of their outbreaks, the data show.The analysis showed that “…suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings, which were introduced at different times in different places, were associated with the overall containment of the epidemic.”The authors noted the limitations of the study including that the “…number of people who have developed Covid-19 during this epidemic, and therefore the number of people who were protected by control measures, is not known precisely, given that cases were almost certainly under-reported”.“However, in view of the small fraction of people known to have been infected by February 19 (75,532 cases, 5.41 per 100,000 population), it is unlikely that the spread of infection was halted and epidemic growth reversed because the supply of susceptible people had been exhausted,” the researchers inferred.The study adds a note of caution because the number of “susceptibles” in China is far from over.“This implies that a large fraction of the Chinese population remains at risk of Covid-19; control measures may need to be reinstated, in some form, if there is a resurgence of transmission.”The study also puts a question mark on whether the same model can be replicated elsewhere.“Whether the means and the outcomes of control can be replicated outside China, and which of the interventions are most effective, are now under intense investigation as the virus continues to spread worldwide”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-lockdown-emergency-measures-averted-greater-epidemic-in-china-says-study/story-CztCnVJgY1cvRazJidECoO.html
02-04-2020||World||Australian police enforces lockdown for three months||Australia’s most populous state said on Thursday police enforcement of restrictions on personal movement intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus would last three months, as the number of new cases continued to slow.After a federal government order limiting groups of people gathering outside to two, Australian states have instructed their police to issue fines of up to A$11,000 ($6,672) to people who violate the restrictions.In New South Wales, home to nearly a third of Australia’s 25 million population, police have also threatened prison terms of up to six months for people who violate the rules.“When is the turn-off period for these orders? It is 90 days,” state police commissioner Mick Fuller said in a televised news conference.“People will have gotten the message by then, hopefully. And we won’t be talking about the powers, we’ll be talking about what does it look like coming out of this?”Police in NSW and other states have already started issuing tickets to people suspected of breaching orders that the authorities themselves have called “draconian”.Like countries around the world, Australia has ordered the shutdown of restaurants, cafes, bars, movie theatres and instructed people to stay inside unless they are shopping for food or taking their daily exercise as it tries to contain the flu-like illness. So far, about 5,000 people have been infected in Australia, and 22 have died.In NSW, which has about half the country’s coronavirus cases, authorities reported 116 new cases in the past 24 hours, slightly less than the previous day’s increase. Nationwide, health authorities have said the infection rate appears to have slowed in recent days but that it is too early to say definitively.On the other side of the country, a standoff continued on Thursday between immigration officials and foreign-owned cruise ships which were refusing to leave Western Australian waters despite being ordered to do so.Cruise ships are responsible for at least 20% of Australia’s coronavirus cases, and a source of public anger after hundreds of passengers from Carnival Corp’s Ruby Princess were allowed to disembark in Sydney and hundreds later tested positive for COVID-19.In the wake of that incident and amid fears cruise ships were essentially super carriers of the virus, the federal government barred them from docking at Australian port, except in emergencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-police-enforces-lockdown-for-three-months/story-OpjbgBW4nmGso5OX7HgmnL.html
02-04-2020||World||10% global GDP needed to tide over Covid-19 crisis: UN||The Covid-19 crisis is likely to have a profound and negative effect on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change because of which a post-crisis coordination mechanism is vital to ensure that all countries have adequate fiscal space to recover, the March 2020 report of the United Nations stated. Titled ‘Socio-Economic Impact of Covid-19: Shared Responsibility, Global Solidarity’, the report offers suggestions on global responses to tackle the pandemic, which included creating a corpus fund of at least 10% of the global GDP, debt restructuring to help fragile economies, and dismantling sanctions and other trade barriers, especially to allow medicinal and related products. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe cost of remittances - a lifeline in the developing world - should be brought as close to zero as possible, the report stated, adding that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international financial institutions will be critical to this endeavour. Also Read: Genetic sequencing takes lead in Covid-19 vaccine developmentSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by all member states of the UN back in 2015, and aimed at improving the future of countries across several areas, including environment, health care, gender equality, education and sustainable living by 2030. The Paris Agreement signed in 2016, meanwhile, aims to specifically combat climate change. According to the report, the pandemic’s impact on the environment is likely to be positive in the short term as drastic reduction in economic activity has reduced CO2 emissions and pollution in many areas. However, once countries resume economic activity, the report warns of the “significant risk” that nations would be tempted to divert all political capital and limited financial resources away from the implementation of the SDGs. If this were to happen, the negative impact would be felt across sectors, the UN report warned.“A hard truth is that we could have been better prepared for this crisis. The MDGs and the SDGs could have put us on track towards a world with access to universal health coverage and quality health care... Instead… most countries are characterised by weak, fragmented health systems that do not ensure the universal access and capacity needed to face the Covid-19 health crisis,” the report said.MDGs or Millennium Development Goals, set in 2000 to be achieved by 2015, are a set of eight global goals aimed at reducing poverty. Had countries achieved the MDGs or SDGs better, then the health care crisis facing even developed nations like the US, as well as the developing nations of South Asia, would be better equipped to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. However, as it stands, more than 50% of the world’s rural population and over 20% of the urban population lack legal health care coverage, while 2.2 billion people lack access to water depriving people of the most basic and effective prevention measure against the Covid-19 virus, frequent hand-washing, the report stated.Calling for a concerted global effort to tackle the crisis, the UN report offered a host of suggestions to avoid the impending humanitarian crisis after the pandemic has run its course.“This is the moment to dismantle trade barriers, maintain open trade, and re-establish supply chains. Tariff and non-tariff measures as well as export bans, especially those imposed on medicinal and related products, would slow countries’ action to contain the virus. Import taxes or restrictions on medical supplies need to be waived,” it stated. “Sanctions imposed on countries should be waived to ensure access to food, essential supplies and access to Covid-19 tests and medical support. This is the time for solidarity, not exclusion,” the UN report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-global-gdp-needed-to-tide-over-crisis-un/story-i021VH5E6KEB3jEWepOVoL.html
02-04-2020||India||Cats susceptible to virus, but may not infect humans||New Delhi: Ferrets and cats are susceptible to contracting coronavirus (Covid-19) but not dogs, ducks, chickens and pigs, a non-peer reviewed study published in bioRxiv has found and said these findings can be important for vaccine and antiviral drug development for the disease. BioRxiv is a free online archive and distribution service for unpublished preprints in life sciences. There is, however, no reason for panic among pet keepers or cat lovers because the findings are based on only lab experiments, and there has been no study on whether cats can pass on the infection to humans, according to experts. It is also unclear which species of cats was used for the experiments for the study. According to the authors Hualan Chen et al, the experiments were conducted to understand how the virus behaves in animals and which among them can be used to model the efficacy of control measures in humans like drugs or vaccines. The authors are scientists affiliated to Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (China), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and National High Containment Laboratory for Animal Diseases Control and Prevention (China). The scientists isolated the virus from an environmental sample in a seafood market in China’s Wuhan, where the pandemic originated from, and some samples from humans. Animals studied were inoculated and the viral RNA load was quantified from organs of those euthanised and faeces of animals isolated.“In summary, we found that ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 [which causes Covid-19], dogs have low susceptibility, and livestock including pigs, chickens, and ducks are not susceptible to the virus. Ferrets have frequently been used as an animal model for the study of human respiratory viruses. Unlike influenza viruses and other human SARS-coronavirus, which replicate in both the upper and lower respiratory tract of ferrets, we found SARS-CoV-2 only replicates in the nasal turbinate, soft palate, and tonsils of ferrets,” the study concluded.But its too early to draw any conclusion on whether cats can contract the infection in natural conditions (non-experimental) and whether they can infect humans. Dr Nivedita Gupta, a viral diseases expert at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said some animals will be susceptible to the virus and that is how animal models are created for research on vaccines. “But to jump to the conclusion that they can infect pet owners and humans is not right. We have domestic cats in India which can be very different from the cats in China. First, we need to understand what is the spill over point to cats there. Such spill overs happen due to zoonotic interface between humans and wild animals. In the SARS epidemic also we saw that civet cats were a reservoir of the virus. Nobody keeps civets as pets.”Amit Singh, an associate professor at Benguluru’s Indian Institute of Science, said there is a question mark on whether an animal could have played an intermediate host in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. “That is the most probable hypothesis in how the virus may have transmitted from bats to humans. The study is important because some animals are in close contact with us. The paper is also interesting because it has looked into infection replication and viral load. We cannot ignore these findings because cats and ferrets can then serve as elegant animal models to verify vaccine and anti-viral drug efficacy. It will add to fundamental science on Covid 19,” he said Uma Ramakrishnan, an associate professor at the National Centre for Biological Sciences, called the study significant because it shows that cats and ferrets could be reservoirs for the virus. “The study is significant because it shows that cats and ferrets could be reservoirs for the virus. Macaques also have been found to contract the infection in other studies. It shows that the virus does replicate in them. But we can’t say yet whether they can transmit the infection to humans because the density of cats is not as high. Also, they have been infected during an experiment. We don’t know if they can get infected naturally,” she said.Another study by Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences published on March 14 in BioRxiv said rhesus macaques can be infected and show symptoms of the disease. There was weight loss in some infected monkeys and viral replication was noticed in nose, pharynx, lung and gut and some also developed interstitial pneumonia.Some media reports have suggested that even dogs can be infected. Bloomberg carried a report on March 19 saying two dogs tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cats-susceptible-to-virus-but-may-not-infect-humans/story-q2vUIYRFcJUiG3UoicA5QL.html

The Union home ministry also directed police chief s of all States and Union Territories concerned and the Delhi Police to take necessary legal action against all such violators, on priority, under relevant sections of the Foreigners Act, 1946 and Disaster Management Act, 2005.The government has been spurred into action after hundreds of foreigners took part in a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area last month which turned the locality into a coronavirus hotspot.The Home Minister’s Office asked Delhi Police and police chiefs of other states, where these foreigners are currently living, to take legal action against them under the Foreigners Act and the Disaster Management Act.“The Home Ministry has blacklisted 960 foreigners and their Indian visas have also been cancelled for their involvement in Tablighi Jamaat activities while coming on tourist visas,” the home minister’s office tweeted.The action against the foreign Tablighi Jamaat members was taken after over 2,300 members including 250 foreigners were found to be living at its headquarters in Nizamuddin despite the 21 days lockdown and a prohibitory order in force in the national capital.Most of these foreigners came to India on tourist visas, which prohibit involvement of any religious activities. The government has also decided not to issue tourist visa to any foreigner who wishes to visit India and take part in Tablighi activities.The home ministry also said over 1,300 foreign Tablighi Jamaat activists, including those from the US, France and Italy, have been identified in different parts of the country and most of them have quarantined.More than 300 of the Tablighi Jamaat activistshave tested positive for coronavirus . About 400 cases of coronavirus and about 12 deaths in the country have been linked to the Nizamuddin event so far.On Tuesday, the home ministry had said had said that about 2,100 foreigners had come to India since January 1 and indulged in Tablighi activities in different parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-amit-shah-orders-blacklisting-of-960-foreigners-who-took-part-in-tablighi-jamaat-events/story-Vn3JjBTIa2m8dooQ1IMwKN.html

There have been 53 deaths, of which at least 12 deaths have been reported in the past 24 hours.Nearly 9,000 people who attended New Delhi’s Tablighi Jamaat congregation between March 10 and 15, have been traced across India, confirmed home ministry spokesperson Punya Salila Srivastava, in a news briefing on Thursday. Of the total number of people traced so far, 1306 are foreigners and the rest are Indians.In the national capital, of all the 2,138 people evacuated from the Markaz, 250 are foreign nationals. Health workers have sent 1,804 people to various quarantine facilities in and around Delhi, and 334 symptomatic people have been hospitalized.“In some positive news, 151 people have recovered so far,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry said.The Nizamuddin cluster was discovered after aggressive contact tracing done by Telangana of its positive cases.People from Delhi went to different states such as Telangana, Jammu & Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, and Rajasthan making the south Delhi area a Covid-19 hotspot.At least 400 positive cases have been identified from these states and their epidemiological linkage has been established with various clusters.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has expressed concern that the numbers may go up further as countrywide contact tracing of the people who attended the event, progresses.On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video-conference with Chief Ministers of several states on the coronavirus pandemic, where he asked them to decide on the phased movement of the population as the lockdown is lifted. The Centre, has asked states to take stern action against people who violate the lockdown.There has been a death in the Dharavi slums in Mumbai, Maharashtra. The building from where the death was reported has been sealed. There are 300 flats and 90 shops in the area that are being screened.Very few doctors, so far have been infected in the line of duty, the health ministry official said.The ICMR’s epidemiology department has said there is no change in testing protocol yet, but new tests are being introduced so the committee is reviewing the protocol. To expedite the detection of coronavirus cases in Maharashtra, the Centre has allowed the state to conduct rapid Covid-19 tests. The Maharashtra government will from now on use blood samples instead of swabs in rapid tests to detect the highly contagious coronavirus, according to state Health Minister Rajesh Tope. The highest number of coronavirus confirmed cases have been reported from Maharashtra so far, followed by Kerala and Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-deaths-climb-to-53-in-india-positive-cases-cross-2-000/story-Uobg2C1XxRGZUrKrvvzBbO.html

The minister said India has taken quick and effective steps to control the spread of Covid-19 and the world is praising it for the timely action it took by announcing the lockdown.“People have made the lockdown successful. There will be pain, hurdles and hardships, but the government with the cooperation of people, state governments, district administrations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and all political parties is doing a laudable job. Political discussions can take place after we defeat the virus together,” he said.The minister urged political parties to join forces with the government in its battle against Covid-19. “I hope wisdom will prevail upon the Congress leadership … everyone needs to be on the same page. I hope such comments won’t be repeated again till we overcome our battle against the virus.”Union Home Minister Amit Shah tweeted: “Under PM @narendramodi’s leadership, India’s efforts to fight coronavirus are being lauded domestically and globally. 130 crore Indians are united to defeat Covid-19. Yet, the Congress is playing petty politics. High time they think of national interest and stop misleading people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-president-s-comments-unfortunate-says-javadekar/story-4LC4vgWUSaVpeMeYMo3C1O.html

02-04-2020||India||Imprison coronavirus lockdown violators, Centre tells states||The Centre on Thursday told state governments that those violating the coronavirus lockdown or obstructing officials should be imprisoned amid reports of doctors and healthcare personnel being attacked.In a letter to all chief secretaries of the states and union territories, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla directed states and union territories to book those who violate lockdown rules or make false claims under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Disaster Management Act, 2005 ,“Violators of lockdown should be punished under the IPC. Anyone obstructing enforcement of lockdown could be punishable for jail term of up to 2 years,” Bhalla wrote according to PTI.

The home secretary’s letter came in the wake of reports of violation of lockdown in different parts of the country and people clashing with health workers and police.Under the Disaster Management Act, obstructing government officials from discharging their duties can land the offender in jail for a year which could extend to two years if the obstruction results in a death and anyone making false claim on any matter can be punished up to two years of jail with fine and laws.“Anyone making false claim on any matter can be punished up to 2 years of jail with fine and laws,” his letter said.Under the Disaster Management Act, misappropriation of money or material in disaster-like situation invites two years of jail with fine.The home secretary reminded the chief secretaries that he had already asked them to strictly implement the lockdown measures issued by the home ministry under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 without any exception.The government invoked the Disaster Management Act on March 24 to enforce the lockdown shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imprison-coronavirus-lockdown-violators-centre-tells-states/story-n6s3Uk0aWvS4ru7U7vaDsL.html

02-04-2020||India||Air India crew who operated evacuation flights tests positive||One of Air India’s cabin crew that recently operated one of the evacuation flights between Mumbai and Newark in the United States has tested positive for Covid-19, said officials aware of the developments. The staffer who tested positive is a resident of Vasai-Virar, a Mumbai suburb, and was servicing the Newark- Mumbai flight on March 20. She has now been admitted to Kasturba hospital after testing positive.The national carrier has operated special flights to China, Germany, Iran, Israel and is expected to operate more flights to the US, UK and Canada. Air India’s cargo handling subsidiary- AI Airport Services(AI APS), had recently asked 14 of its employees to go into home quarantine after one of their employees tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday.The infected woman, who handled the check-in counter for Air India, is in her early twenties and got herself tested voluntarily on March 27 after reporting fever and uneasiness in breathing. However, while addressing media on a video conference, Air India chairman and managing director Rajeev Bansal said there were no COVID-19 cases among the airline’s ground staff. He did not mention the status of the cabin crew. Air India pilots involved in rescue missions for stranded Indians and those operating chartered flights to rescue foreign nationals amid the coronavirus outbreak have raised concerns over their safety. The Air India management pilots, on Monday, had alleged that operating pilots and cabin crew are being provided with substandard, ill-fitting and flimsy personal protective equipment (PPE) that tear easily during operations. They also alleged that sanitizers were not being provided in sufficient quantities and disinfection processes were short of industry best practices.“These inadequacies compound the chances of viral exposure and equipment contamination - and may even lead to a community (Stage 3) transmission of Covid-19 infection within crew members, passengers and the public at large, since most reside in large residential societies,” the airline’s executive pilots stated in a letter written to Hardeep Puri- the civil aviation minister on March 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-crew-who-operated-evacuation-flights-tests-positive/story-SvBBSw8Hy2wcFf1haldWJN.html
02-04-2020||India||International flights may resume from April 15 on case-by-case basis: Hardeep Puri||Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri said on Thursday that the government would like to ensure that international flights are resumed on a case by case basis after the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown, which was enforced on March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, ends on April 15. All modes of conveyance, including rail traffic, road and air transport, have been suspended after the lockdown came into effect. Initially, international flights were suspended for a week from March 22 but later extended until April 15 coinciding with the lockdown. Domestic flights were suspended from the day the lockdown started on March 25.“We can think of resuming international flights after the government examines the situation. Both the health and home ministries have to assess that the Covid-19 outbreak is under control in other affected countries before international flights become operational again,” said Pradeep Kharola, secretary, ministry of civil aviation.The minister said incoming flights to bring back Indian nationals will remain suspended until the lockdown ends on April 15.“We’re under lockdown till April 15. Any incoming flights to bring back Indian nationals will have to wait until the lockdown is lifted,” Puri said. “We can start considering the resumption of (international) flights on a case by case basis depending on where they are coming from,” he added. Airlines are open to start advance bookings as per their own discretion and contingency plan, the minister said. “The ministry is proceeding on the understanding that the lockdown is in place till April 15. There is no directive from the ministry about the contingency planning of airlines. But, as an eternal optimist, I am hoping that on April 15, flights can at least start, if not all, then in a calibrated manner. But that is a decision that we still need to take,” Puri said.India has also established an aerobridge with China for setting up medical cargo freight services. Rajiv Bansal, chairman and managing director (CMD) of the national carrier, Air India, said flights to Shanghai will operate on April 4 and April 5. “We’ve also got approval to operate flights to Hong Kong,” he added. India has also signed a contract with Germany, France, Canada, and Ireland to repatriate their citizens on commercial charges, he added. The government has operated 84 flights to date to carry essential medical supplies and goods. A total of 76 tonnes of cargo has been transported so far, according to the ministry.Carriers involved in Lifeline Udan operations include Air India, Alliance Air, Indian Air Force (IAF) and Pawan Hans. Private carriers such as IndiGo, SpiceJet and Blue Dart are also operating medical cargo flights on a commercial basis.The Centre has granted special permission to conduct cargo operations using passenger aircraft for ferrying medical equipment and essential goods during the lockdown. Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in an order issued on Wednesday said there has been an additional demand for transporting essential cargo services due to the viral outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-flights-to-resume-from-april-15-on-case-by-case-basis-hardeep-puri/story-SPNxdVQrC1QaCcXDbpWzXP.html

02-04-2020||India||Tragic spectacle of migrants walking home will remain a blot on Modi govt: CWC||The Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, on Thursday said the tragic spectacle of thousands of migrant workers taking a long walk back to their villages in the wake of the 21-day nationwide lockdown will “forever remain a blot” on the Modi government.The CWC, at its meeting held through video-conferencing and chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, criticised the government for “not giving any thought to the deteriorating” economic situation in the wake of the pandemic, and demanded a task force consisting of world renowned economists to suggest measures to deal with the crisis.It also pledged to continue its unstinted support to the Centre and state governments in dealing with the situation.“The CWC is of the opinion that the government has not given any thought whatsoever to the deteriorating economic situation. This does not brook any delay. Many useful ideas are on the table,” read the CWC statement.“The CWC demands that the government should immediately appoint an economic task force consisting of world renowned economists to suggest three plans – firstly an emergency plan within one week, secondly a short to medium term plan within one month and thirdly a medium to long term plan within three months in order to protect and revive the economy,” it said.The CWC said it is conscious that India and the whole world face an unprecedented crisis due to the rapid spread of Covid-19 that has the potential to claim hundreds of thousands of lives and devastate the world’s economy. “From the day the first person tested positive in India, the Congress has extended its total support to the central and state governments in their efforts to deal with the grave and unfolding circumstances. The Congress pledges to continue its unstinted support,” it added. The statement said the order of priorities before the government should be to contain the spread of virus, medical treatment to the infected persons, livelihood support to the poor and maintenance of supply of essentials and measures to deal with a sliding economy. “It is in a spirit of co-operation and constructive criticism that the CWC wishes to point out that the measures taken by the Modi government so far leave much to be desired and there are several grave shortcomings. It is imperative that we address these shortcomings,” it added. “On containment and treatment, the government has erred in adopting a strategy of limited testing. A lockdown or any restriction is futile unless accompanied by extensive testing. Inexplicably, we have not put to full use even our limited testing capacity. The flawed strategy must be revised and testing must be scaled up urgently.”The CWC urged the government to undertake massive production and procurement of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), Hazmat suits, body overalls, goggles, gloves, N-95 masks and ventilators. “Medical infrastructure should be expanded on a war footing with more isolation wards, hospital beds, testing labs, quarantine facilities etc. Supply of drugs must be maintained at pre-February levels and all drug stores must be directed and facilitated to function for an adequate number of hours a day.”The CWC regretted that the government has “miserably failed” to provide adequate livelihood support to the poor.“The Financial Action Plan I announced on March 25 was miserly, hopelessly inadequate and left out several vulnerable sections. It failed to instill confidence in the poor and, as a result, we witnessed the tragic spectacle of thousands of migrant workers desperately trying to go back to their villages by any means whatsoever, including on foot. That spectacle will forever remain a blot on the Modi government.”The CWC demanded that the government should immediately announce FAP II that will reassure the poor people and also provide adequate financial support to the sections that were left out including tenant farmers, landless agricultural workers, MGNREGA workers, laid-off industrial workers and male Jan Dhan account holders.“It is the foremost duty of the government to ensure shelter, rent relief, wages and food to the poor. The NYAY scheme put forward by the Congress offers a useful model that can be adapted and implemented,” the statement said. The party said supply chains to crores of people, especially those living in towns, cities and remote villages have been severely disrupted by poor preparation and thoughtless orders and notifications.“If people have to survive in a lockdown, these supply chains must be immediately restored and maintained throughout the period of restrictions,” it added.The Congress urged the government to initiate measures such as cutting GST rates for a period of three months on goods of mass consumption, mandatorily postponing tax payment deadlines and EMI dates to June 30 and beyond, restoring the thoughtless reduction in interest rates on PPF and small savings.“Each step, though small, will bring significant comfort to the people in these difficult and stressful times.”The CWC noted that all the measures will require massive resources to the tune of Rs 5-6 lakh crore or USD 70-80 billion. “Anything less will be totally insufficient and may actually exacerbate the situation. These resources can be found within the country and largely within the expenditure budgets of central and state governments for 2020-21.”The CWC said eminent economists have supported the party’s assertion that “we must do whatever it takes” and find the resources to fund the multi-dimensional effort to save the people and the country.The party further urged the government to ensure the return of thousands of Indian students, Indian citizens and sailors stranded abroad to their homes after appropriate testing. It said majority of state governments have complained of inadequate financial resources in absence of the Centre not releasing state’s share in the GST, and demanded its immediate release to enable them to fight Covid-19 more effectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tragic-spectacle-of-migrants-walking-home-will-remain-a-blot-on-modi-govt-cwc/story-aoiTuCzTVin7yBSieKo2nI.html

02-04-2020||India||Spike in domestic violence cases since lockdown, 69 complaints received: NCW||The National Commission for Women has received over 250 complaints since the country-wide lockdown was imposed to control the spread of coronavirus, out of which 69 are cases of domestic violence which indicates an alarming rise in such cases, its chairperson Rekha Sharma said on Thursday.Since March 24, a total of 257 complaints related to various offences against women were received, out of which 69 were of domestic violence, she said. State-wise analysis of the data showed that the maximum number of complaints were received from Uttar Pradesh (90), followed by Delhi (37). Thirty domestic violence complaints were received between March 2 and March 8, while 58 such complaints were received between March 23 and 30, according to the data. Complaints of other crimes like rape or attempt to rape and dowry harassment saw a slight reduction in the mentioned period, the NCW data showed. Sharma said the number of domestic violence cases must be much higher but the women are scared to complain due to constant presence of their abuser at home. She said from March 24 till April 1, the NCW has received 69 domestic violence complaints and it is increasing by the day. “Women are not approaching the police because they think that if they take her husband away, the in-laws will torture her. Because of the lockdown, women are not able to reach out to the police. They don’t even want to go to the police because they are afraid that once their husband comes out of the police station, he will again torture her and she can’t even move out,” she said. “Earlier women could go to their parents’ place but now they are unable to reach. The NCW is in touch with these complainants,” she added. Women rights activists said they have also received numerous complaints of domestic violence from women since the enforcement of the lockdown. Activist Kavita Krishnan, also the secretary of All India Progressive Women’s Association, said vulnerable women could have moved to safer places if the government had given some warning of the lockdown. “All the women (domestic violence victims) who contacted me said had they known (about the lockdown), they would have tried to get out earlier and be somewhere safer,” she said. “The only thing to do is help and rescue domestic violence survivors. Their situation is worse now in the lockdown,” Krishnan added. According to Vani Subramanian, who is a member of the women’s group Saheli Trust, “captivity anyway drives people crazy and abusive situations only make it worse”. Ranjana Kumari, the director of Centre for Social Research, said everyone is at home due to the lockdown and women are not getting the courage to contact for help. “It is not a good situation for women,” Kumari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spike-in-domestic-violence-cases-since-lockdown-69-complaints-received-ncw/story-UHbBLGugkp5dxDXteN1ZML.html
02-04-2020||India||Massive sanitisation drive carried out in Covid-19 hot spot Nizamuddin||Delhi Fire Services personnel sprayed on Thursday thousands of liters of disinfectant in south Delhi’s Nizamuddin in a massive sanitisation drive after over 300 people who visited the area in March for a religious gathering tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in different parts of the country.The six-storey building of Islamic missionary group Tablighi Jamaat in the congested Nizamuddin area has emerged as a hot spot of the infection, and authorities across states have launched efforts to trace the footprints of the attendees.DFS director Atul Garg said the department sanitised the Markaz, as the building is known, in Nizamuddin, lanes surrounding the building and other adjoining residential areas.“We sprayed at least two fire tenders full of disinfectants. One fire tender contains 10,000 litres of water mixed with sodium hypochlorite (liquid bleach). We used two fire tenders…,” he said.Garg said fire personnel sprayed the disinfectant on shops (which were closed), footpaths, walls, parked vehicles and buildings in the vicinity as well. On Wednesday, in a meeting with the chief secretary and top bureaucrats in Delhi, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal directed that the fire department be used to disinfect Covid-19 clusters, quarantine centres and vulnerable public places in Delhi.Health workers from the integrated diseases surveillance programme are also preparing to go door-to-door in the area as they seek to track and contain cases of Covid-19.On Wednesday, the last of the 2,346 people who had been in the building were evacuated; 536 of them were sent to the hospital and 1,810 placed in quarantine. So far, the March congregation has been identified as being responsible over 358 infections and 11 deaths.Everyone within a 3km radius (focal area) of the building and in the buffer area (5km radius) will be screened for symptoms. Those who are symptomatic -- a cough will do -- will be tested. This will entail door-to-door coverage, first in the focal area and then the buffer area.“The cluster containment strategy has two components: one is to mark the epicentre and the buffer zone where extensive door-to-door surveys will be conducted. We do a complete lockdown in and around the area. The next step is identifying all potential positive cases by going in for aggressive testing. We pick samples from everyone with any respiratory illness in the area,” said a senior technical expert with the Union health ministry who asked not to be named said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/massive-sanitisation-drive-carried-out-in-covid-19-hot-sout-nizamuddin/story-aIkiPtRZlWAXXC9SA6cG0I.html
02-04-2020||India||‘We are the worst affected, but we hope to recover the fastest,’ says Sanjeev Balyan||Union minister of state for animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries Sanjeev Balyan is hopeful that the sector reeling under the impact of the 21-day lockdown, which started on March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19} outbreak, will bounce back as soon as normal services resume. In a telephonic interview to HT, he said the ministry is taking stock of the sector’s problems on a daily basis and pulling out all stops to address its concerns. Excerpts from the interview:Q How is the ministry dealing with the crisis in the dairy sector? Pictures of farmers throwing away tonnes of milk have gone viral on social media.A. The ministry officials are meeting daily to take stock of the situation. We are closely monitoring the production of milk, its collection and the problems being faced by the milk producers. There are three sectors involved in the milk production business --- the cooperatives, the private players and the small, independent milk suppliers, who are involved in door-to-door milk supply, to sweetshops and other commercial establishments such as those that make cheese, etc. The third category has been impacted the most because the overall consumption of milk has drastically fallen after restaurants, ice cream manufactures and sweetshops were closed due to the lockdown.While we cannot legally impose on the private sector to buy more quantity of milk but we’ve instructed the cooperatives to increase their collection, which has gone up by 8% since the lockdown started. We’re focusing more on the cooperatives during this period.Q: What about the meat and poultry industry? There has been a decline in the sales of meat and chicken products, as shops are largely closed across states.A: The ministry has issued an advisory to the states to ensure that meat and poultry items are included in the list of essential commodities and be exempt from the lockdown. However, there have been swirling rumours that it’s unsafe to consume meat and poultry products, which, in turn, have impacted their sale. The states have to take a call on whether to keep these shops open, as the ministry has already issued the advisory.Q: Several animal protection organisations have urged the Union government to regulate all meat markets in the country in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. Is this being looked at?A: Our slaughters houses are being run in keeping with the laid down rules and procedures. There is no mixing up of various kinds of meat, such as poultry with fish. There are designated places for each segment. The fear and the perception that has arisen that it (virus) originated from meat markets have not yet been scientifically proven.Q The Rs1.7 lakh crore economic package announced by the government as a cushion to bailout sectors in the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak has left out over one crore fish workers. They have not even been included in the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme that offers Rs2,000 to each farmer.A: The ministry is acutely aware of the fisherfolks’ difficulties. The poultry sector is also one of the worst affected because of the ongoing lockdown. Talks are on to include them under the PM-KISAN scheme.Q: How will the sectors cope with the shortage of manpower that will arise from the mass movement of migrant workers back to their respective native places?A: My ministry is among the worst affected sectors but we hope to recover the fastest. Poultry farmers don’t need too much manpower; those who run dairies also have the required manpower. Other sectors will also not be impacted, as the reverse migration of labourers has stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-the-worst-affected-but-we-hope-to-recover-the-fastest-sanjeev-balyan/story-2DYKH15Mhots7A22KaarPO.html

So, one would be well advised to maintain necessary cash reserve at home and complete other banking needs on time to meet utility payments.According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) website — rbi.org.in — Indian banks will remain closed for 14 days.

Kejriwal, however, added that there was no evidence of community transmissions in Delhi so far as per the available data which establishes travel and contact history for the existing cases.“There are two questions that worry me more, is Corona spreading among the commoners in the community and secondly how many have died due to the virus,” he said.He further analysed the figures to say that data suggested that the virus was not spreading among the people in the capital.“As I have told you, 51 people brought coronavirus from abroad and infected their family members. They have infected 29 people so far but not everyone in their families is infected. This figure of 29 has remained static for some days now, this would mean coronavirus is not spreading in Delhi,” Kejriwal said.“There is a slight increase in the corona cases, there are 219 cases including 51 flyers, 108 from Markaz, 29 close relatives of foreign returned individuals and 4 people are unfortunately dead,” Delhi CM said.He added that the some of the infected people from the Nizamuddin Markaz of the Tablighi Jamaat were appearing to be in a serious condition, adding that two of them had died on Thursday. “Out of 2346 people brought out from Markaz in Nizamuddin, 1810 have been quarantined and 536 have been admitted to hospitals in the city,” he said.He added that all 2346 attendees were being tested for coronavirus.Delhi’s Health services department director general, Dr Nutan Mundeja, had said yesterday that the asymptomatic people will be tested for Covid-19 only if necessary. “Due to this it is possible that the no. of Covid-19 cases in the city might rise in coming days,” Kejriwal said.The Delhi Police on Tuesday filed a case against the Jamaat functionaries for flouting social distancing rules formulated to check the spread of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-nizamuddin-congregants-succumb-to-covid-19-in-delhi-all-2346-participants-to-be-tested/story-sIdu1TCFPHAjjTymN5Fo7J.html

02-04-2020||India||Cats, ferrets susceptible to contracting SARS-CoV-2: Study||A new study has found that ferrets and cats are susceptible to contracting SARS-CoV-2 but not dogs, ducks, chickens and pigs. The yet to be peer-reviewed study published in bioRxiv suggests that these findings can be important for vaccine and antiviral drug development.But there is no cause for panic among pet keepers or cat lovers yet because these are only lab experiments and there has been no study on whether cats can pass on the infection to humans. Also, its not clear from the study which species of cats have been used for the experiments.According to the authors from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and National High Containment Laboratory for Animal Diseases Control and Prevention in China, the objective of the experiments were to understand how the virus behaves in animals and which animals can be used to model the efficacy of control measures in humans (such as drugs or vaccines). The scientists isolated the virus from an environmental sample in the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan and some samples from humans. Animals studied were inoculated (infect or introduce) and the viral RNA load was quantified from organs of those euthanised and faeces of animals isolated.“In summary, we found that ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, dogs have low susceptibility, and livestock including pigs, chickens, and ducks are not susceptible to the virus. Ferrets have frequently been used as an animal model for the study of human respiratory viruses Unlike influenza viruses and other human SARS-coronavirus, which replicate in both the upper and lower respiratory tract of ferrets, we found SARS-CoV-2 only replicates in the nasal turbinate, soft palate, and tonsils of ferrets,” the study published on Wednesday concluded.Some media reports have suggested that even dogs can be infected. Bloomberg, for example, carried a report on March 19 that two dogs had tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong. But it’s too early to draw any conclusion about which animals are reservoirs, said scientists. “Definitely some animals will be susceptible to the virus that’s how animal models are created for further research on vaccines. But to jump to the conclusion that they can infect pet owners and humans is not right. We have domestic cats in India which can be very different from the cats in China. First, we need to understand what is the spillover point to cats there. Such spillovers happen due to zoonotic interface between humans and wild animals. In the SARS epidemic, also we saw that civet cats were a reservoir of the virus. Nobody keeps civets as pets,” said Dr Nivedita Gupta, viral disease expert at Indian Council of Medical Research.Based on genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 released earlier by Chinese scientists, scientists from the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at US-based The Scripps Research Institute recently said the virus cannot be a “laboratory construct” or “purposefully manipulated”, and has natural origins. The virus is believed to have jumped from bats to an intermediate host animal which may have passed the infection to humans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cats-ferrets-susceptible-to-contracting-sars-cov-2-study/story-sJGHGWZPKiuaNoKjR7DggP.html

02-04-2020||India||In 4 years, India put 4,200 foreigners on visa blacklist for Tablighi activities||As many as 4,200 foreigners have been blacklisted by the Home Ministry’s Immigration Department for flouting tourist visa norms and engaging in Tablighi activities, particularly missionary work, since 2015.The focus on Tablighi Jamaat has come after a large number of its workers were infected with the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen that causes Covid-19 virus from foreigners visiting the Markaz in Nizamuddin last month.While Maulana Saad, the fourth emir of Jamaat, has made it clear from his quarantine that Tablighi workers must follow medical advice, the initial resistance or hesitation by the group has been blamed for a spike in virus positive cases all over India.About 216 foreigners were still in the six-storey building in central Delhi when Indian officials began their evacuation a few days back. Another 824 had touched base at Nizamuddin before dispersing to different parts of the country for their activities.Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba has told state police chiefs to run a quick background check on them to ascertain their activities.According to North Block officials, Tablighi followers from abroad attract the immigration blacklist if they are found preaching or proselytizing in India. It is not a violation to merely listen to sermons from the Jamaat leadership, one official clarified.Once it is found that an individual engaged in missionary work on a tourist visa, the Tablighi Jamaat follower is blacklisted for two years. Since January 2020, more than 2,000 foreigners particularly from Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Myanmar have visited the Markaz at Nizamuddin.It is understood that in cases where the immigration finds that a Tablighi preacher with a big following is misusing the visa norms by not applying for a missionary visa but coming on a tourist visa, then the Home Ministry blacklists the culprit permanently.A foreigner on the blacklist will not be given a visa again for two years. Now the Home Ministry is debating if it should extend the validity of the blacklist to at least four years or more to send a strong message.“Under the existing provisions, such kind of visa condition violations do not attract permanent blacklisting. But we intend to revisit the issue,” said a senior official.The Tablighi Jamaat, an off-shoot of Deobandi movement, preaches on how to be a good Muslim by focusing on Quran and Hadiths while also incorporating some of the local traditions. In that way, it is different from Ahle-Hadith and Wahabbi movements of Islam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-4-years-india-put-4-200-foreigners-on-visa-blacklist-for-tablighi-activities/story-8oT12RFAzKQMuDq8aYuNgP.html
02-04-2020||India||From post-lockdown strategy to teamwork: What PM Modi told CMs||Underlining that India’s goal is to ensure minimum loss of life and outlining the next steps in India’s strategy to deal with the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday indicated that once the lockdown ends, the Centre and the states will together ensure a staggered re-emergence of the population. Interacting with the state chief ministers over video conference from his residential office at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, the PM emphasised that in the next few weeks, “testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine” should remain the focus areas of the local administrations, according to an official statement. During the interaction, Modi also spoke about formulating a “common exit strategy” to ensure “staggered re-emergence of the population” once the lockdown ends. The PM asked the state governments to brainstorm and send suggestions to the Centre on how to do this. He emphasised that even after the lockdown ends, the importance of social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 must continue. This is the first hint of the government’s thinking on what happens after April 14; it suggests that while a complete lockdown will not continue, neither will there be entirely free movement of people, with restrictions in place for certain geographical clusters, demographic groups and on travel. The video conference with CMs took place two weeks after the first such meeting on the pandemic on March 20. Thursday’s meeting focused on the current strategies in force and the next steps in the battle against pandemic. The PM praised different states for their “teamwork” which had helped check the speed of the virus, and thanked them for supporting lockdown, due to which, the PM suggested, India had achieved some success in limiting the spread of COVID-19. He also asked the states to make available dedicated hospital facilities for COVID-19 patients, tap into the resource pool of AYUSH doctors, organise online training and utilise paramedical staff and civil society volunteers. States could consider setting up crisis management groups at the district level, in line with groups of bureaucrats formed by the union government, and appoint district surveillance officers, he suggested. At a time when there remains a debate about whether India is testing enough, the PM underlined that data for testing must come from accredited labs so that there is congruence in data of district, state and the Centre. The PM also asked for staggered release of funds to the beneficiaries under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana to avoid crowding at banks.Talking to the CMs, the PM said that the Centre has provided some relaxation of rules to harvest crops but monitoring and social distancing must take place during harvesting. He also asked the states to think of other platforms for procuring grains apart from agriculture produce marketing committees, and explore the possibility of creating pooling platforms for rural areas, like that in ride sharing apps, which can be used for this purpose.He also appealed to work on war footing and quick identification of virus hotspots and to encircle them to ensure the virus does not spread out. He emphasised the need to maintain law and order across the country and added that COVID-19 has “attacked faith and belief and is threatening our way of life”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-post-lockdown-strategy-to-teamwork-what-modi-told-cms/story-gBLCuktxlBlwmdx5duwDgO.html

02-04-2020||India||Kyrgyzstan nationals test negative belying speculations of Jamaat links||Samples of all 17 foreign nationals from Kyrgyzstan, and two tour guides, who were in the eye of a media storm, tested negative for coronavirus (Covid-19) in Patna on Thursday resulting in huge relief for state officials.A section of the media (not the Hindustan Times) had questioned the authorities for not taking samples for a confirmatory test of the foreign nationals during their initial screening at AIIMS-Patna on March 23.Patna AIIMS had defended the administration’s decision to not collect suspects’ oropharyngeal samples for confirmatory testing.“The foreign nationals did not show any symptoms of coronavirus. Besides, they did not have any international travel history during the last 14 days. They had arrived in India in the month of January and to Bihar only on March 3,” said Dr Neeraj Aggarwal, nodal officer for Covid-19 and dean of AIIMS-Patna.He added that the foreigners had denied coming in contact with any high-risk Covid-19 patient, including those from the Nizamuddin religious gathering.“They also did not tell us anything about having visited Nizamuddin markaz in Delhi. As per the health ministry’s guidelines, taking their oropharyngeal sample was not necessary. Based on their clinical assessment and results of thermal scanning, our doctors advised 14 days of home quarantine to them,” Dr Aggarwal added.Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi was guarded in his comments when this reporter asked him if any of the 19 people tested had visited the Nizamuddin markaz.“That is for the police to investigate,” said Ravi, while confirming that all 19 samples had tested negative.Efforts to reach Patna senior superintendent of police Upendra Kumar Sharma proved futile, as he did not respond to phone calls or text messages.Twelve of the 19 people, who have now been put under home quarantine, were staying at a mosque in Kurji area of the capital and another seven at Phulwarisharif, before apprehensive locals informed the police on March 23.On Wednesday, the electronic media reports speculated that the 17 Kyrgyzstan nationals could have also been among the 86 Tablighi Jamaat attendees from Bihar, identified by the centre.The swab samples of these foreigners were collected on Tuesday evening and sent for test to ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Institute of Medical Sciences in Patna. It was necessitated as a precautionary step following a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country due to cases linked to the Nizamuddin congregation.Bihar chief secretary Deepak Kumar said the samples of 4,000-odd foreigners, who reached Bihar between March 15 and 23, were now being mandatorily screened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kyrgyzstan-nationals-test-negative-belying-speculations-of-jamaat-links/story-YAUxjarBzilweehuZRFveM.html
02-04-2020||India||Police arrest Jamia scholar for alleged role in Delhi riots||The Delhi Police on Thursday said they have arrested a PhD scholar of Jamia Millia Islamia in connection with a case of rioting and criminal conspiracy pertaining to February’s communal violence in north-east Delhi that claimed 53 lives and left over 400 others injured. His alleged “involvement in the conspiracy to instigate the riots, funding the violence and the agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Shaheen Bagh” is also being probed, officers privy to the case said.Joint commissioner of police (special cell) Neeraj Thakur confirmed the arrest of Meeran Haider but did not share further details.Haider is also the president of the youth wing of the Delhi unit of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). He is currently being interrogated in the special cell’s Lodhi Colony office.A senior police officer from the special cell, who did not want to be named, said a notice was served to Haider, a resident of Jamia Nagar, on March 31, asking him to join the probe in the case of rioting and criminal conspiracy that was registered by the crime branch after the northeast Delhi riots. Haider was asked to reach the special cell’s Lodhi Colony office at 10 am on April 1 (Wednesday). “We arrested Haider in the case, as we have enough evidence to prove the charges against him. His role in funding the riots and anti-CAA protests are being probed,” said the special cell officer cited above.Jamia media coordinator Ahmed Azeem said that the University has not been informed about the incident by the police and denied to comment further.The Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), a group of alumni, alleged that the charges against Haider were baseless. “Yesterday around 10 pm, men in uniform had approached his local residence enquiring about him. He was taken into custody at around 10:30 pm on Wednesday. The JCC demands that he must be immediately released as all charges against him are baseless,” said the committee in a statement.On March 9, the special cell had arrested Mohammad Danish, a 33-year-old member of the Popular Front of India (PFI) in connection with the case on similar charges. Danish’s arrest came a day after the special cell arrested a couple – Jahanzaib Sami,36, and his 39-year-old wife Hina Bashir Beigh -- for alleged links with the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP), instigating protests against the CAA and spreading hatred against India and between communities in the country.The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) unit of RJD on Thursday issued a statement demanding Haider’s release. “Delhi police had asked Miran Haider, the president of the youth RJD, Delhi, to join the investigation and then arrested him without giving any valid reason.

02-04-2020||India||Amid fight against Covid-19, Prateek Hajela moved from health commissioner’s post||Former National Register of Citizens (NRC) coordinator for Assam and 1995-batch IAS officer of Assam-Meghalaya cadre, Prateek Hajela was removed as commissioner of health services, Madhya Pradesh by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.Hajela’s removal comes on the ground of his ‘dereliction of duty during the Covid-19 pandemic,’ according to a government statement.“Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan instructed immediate removal of Prateek Hajela from the post of commissioner, health services on his extreme carelessness towards his duties amid the Covid-19 pandemic”, said an official statement from directorate of public relations on Wednesday evening.The CM expressed his displeasure with Hajela’s work during his review meeting with officials over coronavirus situation in the state on Wednesday evening, as per an official.The health department is tasked with taking all possible measures for identifying, quarantining and treating the Covid-19 patients and suspected patients besides working as a nodal department to coordinate among all the departments engaged in the fight against the pandemic.A native of Madhya Pradesh and BTech in Electronics from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, Prateek Hajela moved to Madhya Pradesh on deputation as per an order of the Supreme Court passed on October 18, 2019.Earlier, in Assam, he was appointed as a coordinator to prepare National Register of Citizens (NRC) as per a directive of the Supreme Court in September 2013.However, he had his share of controversies too.The Assam police registered two cases against Hajela and other unidentified officials in September 2019 for alleged “discrepancies” in the final NRC list published on August 31, 2019.Nearly two million people were left off the list as a part of an exercise to check illegal immigration.According to Assam Police, a businessman and an indigenous Muslim students organisation — All Assam Goriya-Moriya Yuva Chatra Parishad (AAGMYCP) — filed separate FIRs against Hajela in Dibrugarh and Guwahati.In its complaint, the indigenous organisation alleged that “even when people had correct documents, NRC coordinator Prateek Hajela intentionally excluded the names of Goriya, Moriya and many indigenous sons of the soil”.In Dibrugarh, the police registered a case against Hajela and other NRC officials on the complaint of businessman Chandan Mazumdar who was upset over his exclusion even as his mother made it to the list.An Assam-based NGO, Assam Public Works (APW), also lodged an FIR against Hajela and two persons who were declared as foreigners in 2016 and included in the NRC list.Despite efforts, Hajela could not be reached for his comments. He didn’t take calls and didn’t respond to the text message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-fight-against-covid-19-prateek-hajela-moved-from-health-commissioner-s-post/story-ufUSGyasALLDZTmAJJryEN.html
02-04-2020||India||Coronavirus cases and deaths in India much lower than global average||India has only one positive case of coronavirus for every million of its population against a global average of over 120 cases/million, according to the data available on Worldometers, a website that records all coronavirus cases across the world and follows them to their outcome—cure or death.The data suggests that the country fares well on ‘deaths per million’ statistics with 0.04 reported deaths per million against the world average of over 6 deaths.An analysis of the data of the countries that reported at least one coronavirus case indicates that India ranks 133rd among the 208 countries listed with respect to ‘deaths per million’.Several European countries including Italy, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Switzerland and the UK top the list of countries with most deaths per million.Iran is the only Asian country among the top twenty nations via-a-vis deaths/million calculation. The United States, which has registered the most number of coronavirus deaths, is 21st on the list.In terms of infections per million people, India is ranked lower, at the 178th spot. Bangladesh and Nepal are the only other Asian countries with an even lower average of 0.3 and 0.2 positive cases per million.The statistical calculation of the people who have been infected in the past is not an indicator of the future, particularly given how the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen is highly contagious and can spread.It is in this context that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his interaction with the chief ministers too, underscored that the country has had “some success” in checking the spread of the disease. PM Modi asked the chief ministers to ensure the lockdown is enforced strictly and contact tracing carried out scrupulously so that the successes are not reversed.The case fatality rates for Covid-19 have fluctuated over the past few months and varied from region to region, in part because of comorbidities.Scientists from the MRC Center for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London have estimated that symptom onset to death is 18 days and that the case-fatality rate in and outside of China is 1.4%, but declined to 0.66 after adjusting for undiagnosed cases, according to an update by the US-based Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy on Wednesday. This study is based on case data from people who died from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-cases-and-deaths-in-india-much-lower-than-global-average/story-6HLReJbyOCvdcq1KDrurDJ.html

For example, we should avoid gathering at places and provide support and help to the government in these times,” Khandhlawi said in an audio message posted on the group’s YouTube channel.“We should not go against the law, it is against our principles,” he further said in the audio message. The message from the Jamaat chief came amid the ongoing raids by the police in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Khandhlawi is believed to be hiding at an undisclosed location and had earlier released an audio clip in which he had said that he is under self-quarantine.One of his lawyers too released a video message in which he said that this Covid-19 crisis should be taken seriously. “This is a serious thing. We should not indulge in any discussion on this, as to who is responsible for this disease. With folded hands, I urge all the countrymen to unite in fight against this disease,” said the lawyer Musharraf Ali Khan.Some 9,000 people were exposed to the country’s biggest infection cluster at the gathering organised by the group at its global headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area last month. The number of Covid-19 positive cases jumped by more than half to 1,965 on Wednesday, fuelled by infections among people who either attended prayers and lectures at the Jamaat’s headquarters or came into contact with them later.Khandhlawi claims to have over 100 crore followers in nearly 200 countries. The Nizamuddin markaz serves as the global headquarters of the Jamaat.His family comes from Kandhla, a place near Shamli district of western Uttar Pradesh, around 80 kilometres away from Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/listen-to-the-doctors-jamaat-chief-in-message-to-tj-workers/story-iyrSWftzPXYS5vekvoiARJ.html
02-04-2020||India||Air India to operate special flights to London for foreigners stranded in India||Air India (AI) will operate charter rescue flights from Delhi and Mumbai to London between April 4 and 7 to fly back foreigners, who got stranded in India after the 21-day nationwide lockdown started on Mach 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. The national carrier will use Boeing 777 aircraft for these rescue flights. Delhi to London flights will operate as AI 161 and will take off from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) at 2 am between April 4 and 7 and arrive in Delhi as AI 162. However, AI’s flights from Mumbai to London will operate only on April 5 and 7 as AI 131 (Mumbai- London) and AI 130 (London- Mumbai). The carrier has not released information on the number of passengers who will be flown to London. The stranded passengers do not need to pay any air fare but will have to arrange their journey from London onwards. The aircraft will return as ferry flights --- without any passenger --- on their way back to Delhi and Mumbai. Earlier, AI operated rescue flights to Israel, Wuhan, China and Frankfurt, Germany to bring back passengers stranded in these countries due to Covid-19 outbreak. Usually, the airline flies with two sets of crew members during such rescue flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-to-operate-special-charters-to-london-to-fly-out-foreigners-stranded-in-india/story-hJ7oD0NwrYtHHzhF73gDoM.html
02-04-2020||India||Covid-19: ICMR advises antibody testing in hot spots for faster diagnosis||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) advised on Thursday antibody tests (or blood tests) in areas that are emerging as hot spots of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a move that will ensure faster detection of all possible cases in these clusters and help authorities buy some precious time to contain the fast-spreading pandemic. The test used now --- PCR (polymerase chain reaction) --- identifies the Sars-CoV-2 virus from throat of nasal swab samples of people with symptoms or high-risk individuals (health workers and family members) who might have come in contact with a Covid-19 patient. The antibody detection blood test will identify people who already have been infected, but have mild or no symptoms, according to experts who say the move will help us know how many have been able to fight off the infection and have become what could be called a “corona-blocker”.While the results of PCR tests take up to five hours, the antibody test results will be available in 15-30 minutes.“Population in hotspot areas may be tested using rapid antibody test. And antibody positives to be confirmed by RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) using throat/nasal swab, and antibody negatives to be quarantined at home,” said the interim ICMR advisory.This means positive results will be reconfirmed using the PCR test. The antibody test uses a few drops of blood to determine whether a person has antibodies against the coronavirus. Antibodies in the immune system means the person had the disease at some point in the past, even though the person was never tested for it, and has now recovered. An ICMR official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, the move will mean getting quicker results even if there is a large number of people.“However, to ensure there are no false positives or false negatives, we recommend confirmatory PCR-based test for all positive results,” this official said.The ICMR also released a link (www.finddx.org/) having an information on all available CE-marked rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests. CE-In Vitro Diagnostic approved kits can be used directly after due approval from Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and intimation to ICMR.ICMR earlier made public an expression of interest to procure a million anti-body testing kits from manufacturers across the globe. However, due to the shortage of supply, the number was revised to 500,000 testing kits. The first shipment is expected by this weekend (April 5).Experts say that India’s decision to introduce anti-body testing kits could be a game.“These tests are expected to be very economical, simple and give results within 15-20 minutes. They are being used for contact-tracing in some countries. The Indian health system has lot of experience in doing such tests, like the ones for dengue and chikungunya. So it will be easy to ramp up the screening. It is also a great tool for surveillance, and building up epidemiological data. Indian companies would be able to produce them easily and at massive scale,” Lalit Kant, a senior infectious disease expert, said.Kant also had a word of caution. “While using these tests, one has to be careful about false positives as there may be cross-reaction with other virus antigens. Antibodies take time to develop, so if the test is performed early in the phase of the infection, may not give correct results. This decision is transformational,” he said.But he pointed out that the move would ease workload off main laboratories, as sophisticated equipment or highly trained manpower would not be needed for the process. “Mass screenings can be done using these tests to give us vital information on the number of people infected who never went to the hospital. It would give us an idea of the denominator to calculate fatality ratios,” he said.On Thursday, the Union health ministry said it identified 20 existing and 22 potential hotspots in the country, and asserted that although there was no evidence of widespread community transmission, containment measures will require large human resources.The advisory stressed capacity building, saying identified human resource needs to be trained online in areas such as field surveillance, contact tracing, packaging and shipment of specimen and hospital infection prevention and control, including use of appropriate personal protective equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-icmr-advises-antibody-testing-in-hot-spots-for-faster-diagnosis/story-UVYeChipleiLNc9re5gbyH.html

India has “achieved some success” in limiting the spread of Covid-19, the prime minister told chief ministers at a conference with chief ministers via video conference.This was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s second video conference with chief ministers on tackling the huge challenge posed by the coronavirus disease. The first was on March 20.PM Modi, who heard the chief ministers praise the Centre for the nationwide lockdown ordered nearly 10 days ago, said the country’s common goal is to ensure minimum loss of life.“In the next few weeks, testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine should remain the areas of focus,” he said, emphasising on the necessity of maintaining supply of essential medical products, availability of raw material for manufacture of medicines and medical equipment.PM Modi and other central government functionaries also stressed on enforcing the lockdown, helping the poor cope with food and contact tracing of people known to have been infected with the deadly virus, particularly in context of the Tablighi Jamaat participants.Home Minister Amit Shah talked about the need to implement lockdown more strictly in some states and the importance of effective district level implementation of the guidelines issued by the Centre.Union Health Secretary Preeti Sudan updated the chief ministers of the rise in number of cases in India. She also outlined the spread of cases from Nizamuddin Markaz and the Centre’s preparations to tackle medical cases arising out of further spread of the virus and need to break transmission chain in the districts with high number of confirmed cases..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-outbreak-pm-modi-pitches-for-staggered-relaxations-after-covid-19-lockdown-ends/story-AVLLVNM2vv33fgl7LdDtBN.html

The primary concern is the acute shortage of PPE such as N-95 masks. However, the crisis is not restricted to India, as China supplies 80% of the global requirements. Fortunately, the industry has chipped in and indigenous production has started. We’ve been told that we’d get supplies in the next 10-15 days,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, president, IMA.Harsh Vardhan urged the private sector to help the government in spreading awareness on the viral outbreak and disseminate authentic information on the disease at the grassroots level to dispel several myths doing the rounds. He also reviewed the preparedness and concerns of the medical staff across the country, including the availability of hospital beds, isolation wards and laboratories’ readiness in coping with a high volume of tests.“I urged the members to create a task force and take a proactive role in helping the official machinery at state, district and local levels. It is critical due to your position in the society as being medical professionals,” the minister said.The doctors were apprised of the various guidelines, treatment and protocols that the government has come up with to inform the public about effective Covid-19 management. He also sought their support regarding strict enforcement of the ongoing nationwide lockdown that started on March 25 to contain the viral outbreak.The minister assured the IMA representatives that the government is pulling out all stops to ensure doctors and health care workers are not ostracised or targeted because of the panic created among common people by the Covid-19 outbreak.Doctors from Delhi, Kerala, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Arunachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Mizoram, Karnataka, Manipur, Assam, Odisha, Gujarat, Chandigarh, Telangana and Uttarakhand participated in the meeting.The private sector has been involved in Covid-19 tests after the government approved 51 private laboratories on March 21. The designated private laboratories have conducted around 1,500 Covid-19 tests to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-in-meeting-with-harsh-vardhan-ima-flags-ppe-shortage/story-KQU0uvo8ssAIvceDmsSQ3J.html

A bench of the high court comprising justices AK Jayasankaran Nambiar and Shaji P Chaly called the government order “disturbing” and a “recipe for disaster”.The bench was hearing appeals against the government order filed by activists, doctors and the state wing of the Indian Medical Association.On Monday, Kerala’s Excise Department issued orders allowing liquor vends to sell liquor in controlled quantities to addicts if they come with a recommendation from a government doctor.The government order had drawn immediate criticism from medical practitioners and opposition parties. The Pinarayi Vijayan government had defended the order, pointing out that eight people had killed themselves due to unavailability of liquor due to the national lockdown.In court on Thursday, the government presented a similar defence but the judges weren’t convinced. The state’s law officer tried, pointing that liquor in moderate quantities was administered to addicts as part of treatment also.The judges expressed concern at the state’s unilateral decision to administer alcohol to persons suffering from alcohol withdrawal syndrome, calling it a disturbing decision that wasn’t supported by scientific studies.This is a recipe for disaster, the bench observed, ordering the government to immediately stop implementing the decision for the next three weeks.The government had initially tried to keep liquor vends open by classifying them as an essential service but had to backtrack after opposition attacks. It also considered online sale of liquor so that social distancing norms aren’t violated.Before the lockdown was ordered, the state-run Beverages Corporation was selling an average of liquor worth Rs 40 to 45 crore a day. In 2018-19, the corporation sold alcohol worth Rs 14,508 crore. Excise duty on liquor is between 300 per cent and 500 per cent in the state which means a Rs 100 bottle of rum in the brewery will cost in the Rs 400-500 in the market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-stops-kerala-from-liquor-sales-amid-lockdown-says-recipe-for-disaster/story-IUihXg3X9WTAX4d5E4xtTK.html

This comes soon after an FIR was registered against him in connection with the religious gathering organised at a Markaz (centre) in the Nizamuddin area of the national capital.“We should avoid gathering at places and follow what the government and law want us to do. It is also our duty to provide support and help to them in these times,” Khandhlawi appealed to members of Jamaat through an audio message posted on the Markaz’s YouTube channel.“Quarantine yourself, no matter where you are, it is not against Islam or Shariyat,” he added. He is believed to be hiding at an undisclosed location. An audio clip has surfaced in which Khandhlawi purportedly saying he is in self-quarantine. “I am in self-quarantine in Delhi as advised by the doctors and appeal to all Jamaat wherever they are in the country to follow the directives of the law,” Khandhlawi is purportedly saying in the clip.The Delhi Police’s crime branch has been conducting raids at several places in the national capital and in Uttar Pradesh since Wednesday to find Khandhlawi.

02-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: Supreme Court seeks government’s response on price gouging of masks, sanitisers||The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notice to the central government and Delhi government in a plea by the NGO, Justice for Rights Foundation highlighting price gouging of masks and hand sanitisers.The petitioner claimed that due to the rise in demand for these commodities, as a result of the coronavirus threat, chemists and medical shops were selling them at a price much higher than the maximum retail price (MRP) as well as the price prescribed by the government.“If the chemists and other medical outlets persist with the current mode of functioning, it will affect the most vulnerable section of our population like daily wage workers and other economically challenged citizens, who would not be able to purchase masks at such prices”, the petition said.The court gave liberty to the petitioner to serve a copy of the petition to the central government’s second senior-most law officer, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and posted the case for hearing on April 3.The petitioner alleged that several chemists and medical outlets, in an attempt to defraud and profit from the coronavirus outbreak, were striking out the MRP of masks and sanitisers and applying their own price labels.In order to deal with this, the government had come out with notifications and orders declaring face masks and hand sanitizers as essential commodities and capping their prices.“The Department of Consumer Affairs, in wake of the need and urgency of the present condition, published a notification dated 21 March 2020, fixing the prices of the mask i.e. 2 ply masks to be priced at Rs 8 and 3 ply masks to priced at Rs 10 and that the sanitiser bottle of 200 ml to be sold at a price of Rs 100,” the petition pointed out.The petitioner claimed that despite the notification, medical outlets were still selling masks and sanitisers at higher prices in brazen defiance of the notification.Fair and equitable distribution of N95 masks and hand sanitisers is essential in order to deal with the pandemic of Covid-19, the petitioner submitted.The Supreme Court on Wednesday also sought the response of the central government in another petition filed by a Nagpur based doctor, Jerryl Banait seeking directions to ensure that all health professional including doctors, nurses, ward boys, other medical and paramedical professionals who are attending to and treating Covid-19 patients, are provided with World Health Organisation-graded protective equipment.“It is imperative for doctors to be in constant contact with patients, so as to monitor them on regular intervals and observe their symptoms. In the absence of appropriate protective gear, doctors put themselves at the risk of being affected by the virus in the discharge of their duties. It is the duty of the States to ensure graded protective gear to doctors and other welfare facilities, so as to aid them to combat the virus”, the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-supreme-court-seeks-government-s-response-on-price-gouging-of-masks-sanitisers/story-ard7fqVM7bNLbdeTv69HxI.html
02-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Lockdown necessary but unplanned implementation causing chaos, says Sonia Gandhi||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said that the 21-day nationwide coronavirus lockdown may have been necessary but the unplanned manner in which it has been implemented has caused chaos and pain in the lives of millions of migrant workers all over India.“We meet today in the midst of an unprecedented health and humanitarian crisis. The magnitude of the challenge before us is daunting but our resolve to overcome it must be greater,” she said in her opening remarks at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, on Thursday.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Gandhi said there is no alternative to constant and reliable testing to fight Covid-19. “This is the most effective way to combat it. Our doctors, nurses and health workers need all the support possible. Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as hazmat suits and N-95 masks must be provided to them on a war footing,” she said.“Equally important are ventilators and breathing equipment, isolation beds and designated hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients. The onus lies on governments to ensure that the spread of infection and casualties are not caused owing to lack of infrastructure or preparedness,” Gandhi told the meeting held through video-conferencing.The Congress president said the pandemic has already caused untold suffering across the world, but it has also reaffirmed the bonds of brotherhood that unite humanity.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage“In our country, those who are most vulnerable to the consequences of this pandemic are the poor and disadvantaged. We must come together for their sake and do all we can to support them through the difficult days that lie ahead,” she added. “It has been heart-breaking to see lakhs of people walking for hundreds of kilometres towards their villages without food or shelter. It is the duty of us all to do our utmost to lessen their suffering. I wish to thank all those who are offering them help, our workers, civil society and people who have shown their kindness and compassion to them.”Gandhi urged the government to publish and make available details of designated hospitals, number of beds, quarantine and testing facilities, as well as information regarding the availability of medical supplies to the general public.Referring to farmers, having to cope with the harvesting season at a time when the entire country is under lockdown, she said the government should urgently provide them with fertilisers and pesticides, give them access to easy lines of credit, help them in preparing for planting the kharif crop and remuneration prices to enable them to survive the present economic onslaught.About medium and small-scale enterprises, Gandhi said they are gravely threatened and have been hit hardest by recent events. “The livelihood of crores of our citizens has been imperilled. Government needs to put in place a comprehensive strategy to manage this crisis,” she added. “Close to 90% of our fellow Indians toiling in the unorganised sector are also extremely vulnerable. The economic consequences of the pandemic threaten to destroy their livelihood. They are already facing tremendous hardship due to hunger and lack of health facilities. As a nation, we owe them our full and constructive support.” Gandhi said the middle classes too are vulnerable. “Wage cuts, job losses across all sectors, high petrol, diesel and gas prices are causing them acute distress. If this was not enough, while EMIs have been deferred, no interest subvention or relief has been provided. This offsets the entire purpose of the deferment.” The Congress chief urged the central government to prepare and publish a ‘Common Minimum Relief’ programme, saying it is vital and help alleviate several of the concerns that currently afflict the people. She said covid-19 does not differentiate between political ideology, religion, caste, age or gender. “The choices we make today will have a direct impact tomorrow on our family, neighbourhood, community, environment and nation. How effectively we meet this challenge, how we protect all sections of our society, specially the most vulnerable among us will define us for generations to come. Only if we act together in solidarity, we will overcome,” added Gandhi. Gandhi also urged Congress governments, frontal organisations, party leaders and workers to step forward and offer their help to those families who are at extreme risk. “We must take immediate measures to guarantee adequate shelter, food and medicines to as many of them as we can,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-lockdown-necessary-but-unplanned-implementation-causing-chaos-says-sonia-gandhi/story-o7w9loCjBpbIHN1gUVca2K.html
02-04-2020||India||Navy develops Rs 1K temperature guns for Covid-19 screening||The Naval Dockyard, Mumbai, has designed and developed a hand-held infrared temperature sensor and it has the capacity to scale up production if agencies require these instruments in large numbers to screen people for fever amid the Covid-19 outbreak, the navy said in a statement on Thursday.The navy said the instrument had been developed to overcome the scarcity of temperature guns in the market where these were being sold at a very high cost. “The instrument has been manufactured for under Rs 1,000 using in-house resources. The cost is a fraction of the price of the temperature guns in the market,” the statement said, adding that the country’s medical infrastructure was being tested by the surge in the count of Covid-19 cases.The dockyard’s temperature sensor has an accuracy of 0.02 degree Celsius, it said.The temperature guns will be used for screening the 20,000 personnel who visit the dockyard daily and this will reduce the workload of the sentries at the gates, the navy said.“In view of Covid-19, initial screening of these personnel entering the dockyard was essential to prevent the spread of the disease within the yard and the navy’s Western Fleet. The most preliminary method to screen a probable patient is to check for body temperature by non-contact means,” the statement said.As the country prepares to handle a rising number of cases and meet its need for ventilators, which about 5% of the Covid-19 patients may require, the navy has also pitched in with an innovative ventilator design that can cater to six patients simultaneously.The Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam, has manufactured this portable multi-feed oxygen manifold ventilator.“To cater to the requirement of oxygen supply for multiple patients during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, personnel from Naval Dockyard Visakhapatnam have designed an innovative ‘Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold(MOM)’ using a 6-way radial header fitted to a single cylinder. This innovation will enable one oxygen bottle to supply six patients concurrently thus enabling critical care management to a larger number of Covid patients with the existing limited resources,” the navy said in a statement earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-develops-rs-1k-temperature-guns-for-covid-19-screening/story-wBvWwtv6Qg8k3Nc9IsiARJ.html

Funds invested will be used for scaling production of COVID-19 testing kits and expansion of molecular diagnostic solutions,” the company said in a statement on Thursday.AP Globale, a positive impact business solutions company, will be helping Mylabs scale its operations within India and globally. Abhijit Pawar, chairman of APG, will be joining the board of the company.Many of the 51 private labs approved by the ICMR for Covid-19 testing in the country have not been able to conduct tests as per their capacity and demand because of the shortage of kits.“The kits are in short supply; the orders are getting delayed and, as a result, we are not able to conduct tests. The manufacturers are overburdened,” said Dr Naveen Dang, founder, Delhi’s Dr Dangs Lab, one of the first private labs to have received ICMR approval for testing. From the day the first batch of private labs was given approval on March 21, all of them put together so far have done about 1500 tests.With the tie-up, in the next few weeks, the production of kits is likely to be ramped up from the number that currently can perform about 150,000 test kits per week to at least 20 lakh tests per week.“The shortage of testing kits will come to an end in a month or two,” said Serum Institute of India’s CEO Adar Poonawalla.Mylab is the first Indian company to get commercial approval for its testing kits called Mylab PathoDetect COVID-19 Qualitative PCR kit.The testing kits that get endorsed by the ICMR are further approved by Indian FDA or Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) for manufacture, sale and distribution in India.“Global innovation is the need of the hour to curb this pandemic that has affected millions across the world. The need for the maintenance and manufacturing of medical and healthcare equipment at the pace required to keep the numbers at bay has never been more important. Mylabs and their team have shown exceptionally innovative capabilities when they were able to develop a time-saving testing kit within 6-weeks of its outbreak. Keeping in mind their resilient approach and quick response, I am certain that the company has a variety of similar innovation-driven projects which will help bring drastic improvements in the healthcare sector. The investment towards Mylab will enable them to build their infrastructure and expand their capabilities further,” said Poonawalla.“The Mylab manufacturing facility, approved by FDA/CDSCO is compliant with MDR 2017 regulation for Manufacturing Medical Device of Class A,B,C and D and ISO 13485: 2016 certification,” said the company statement.Sujit Jain, director, Mylab, said, “This will help Mylabs create a world class organization, which will help India become a leader in molecular diagnostics.’’The ICMR has so far validated four PCR-based testing kits that have not had US FDA or European CE approvals. The US FDA and CE endorsed kits are already eligible for use. However, for the rest, ICMR recommends usage after thorough evaluation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mylab-ties-up-with-serum-india-for-covid-19-testing-kits/story-oR7TUW2MboOSZvTXf7oDNK.html

A hospital official quoted by news agency ANI said this was putting the security of the medical staff at the hospital at risk.Medical director of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narain Hospital (LNJPN) in Delhi, said 188 out of 216 Covid-19 patients at the hospital were from the Tablighi Jamaat from Nizamuddin and 23 out of the 24 samples tested from the group had come out positive. He called the situation “alarming”.“We’ve 216 Covid-19 patients, out of which 188 belong to one group (attendees of Tablighi Jamaat event). We had received reports of 24 patients from the group out of which 23 tested positive. This is alarming,” said Dr JC Passey, Medical Director of Delhi’s LNJPN HospitalHe added that police has been deployed around the three blocks were the attendees of the Jamaat were admitted to prevent them from causing any trouble.“Many of them (attendees of Tablighi Jamaat event) are objecting against testing and they feel they don’t need admission (to the hospital). So, this puts the security of our staff at risk. Now, police have been deployed around 3 blocks where they have been kept,” Dr JC Passey was quoted as saying by ANI.The Indian railway authorities, too, had reported alleged misbehaviour by some of the members of the Tablighi Jamaat admitted at its quarantine facilities on Wednesday. The authorities had complained that some members had made unreasonable demands related to food and raised a din at the centre that also included threatening behaviour towards the nursing staff.In another related incident in Madhya Pradesh, two doctors are reported to have suffered injuries in an incident of stone-pelting in Indore when they were out to screen and identify possible Covid-19 patients in the city, which is among the worst affected in the state.Roughly, 8,800 members of the Jamaat, who had attended a three-day religious meet at the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin, are being traced by Indian authorities after it emerged that several of them were infected with coronavirus and could spread the disease further in the local communities in different states. The congregation is being called the single largest source of infections in the country, as of now and efforts are on to trace, test and quarantine its members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jamaat-members-resisting-testing-hospitalisation-complains-delhi-hospital/story-2XEDL38NHvKp2rdpAktMHP.html

02-04-2020||India||In rare move, Centre turns to young IAS officers to up Covid-19 battle||Bureaucrats across the country have offered a host of suggestions such as indigenously producing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) testing kits and ventilators as well as ending the 21-day nationwide lockdown, which began on March 25 to combat the pandemic, in a phased manner.In a survey, conducted by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG), 266 Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers submitted their suggestions and identified Covid-19 hotspots across 16 states. They flagged crucial gaps such as an acute shortage of medical staff, equipment, and facilities like intensive care unit (ICU) beds at hospitals, ventilators, ambulances, oxygen cylinders. They also underlined the hardships faced by people in their daily lives because of the lockdown at such a short notice. Also read | PM Modi holds Covid-19 review meeting with Chief MinistersThe bureaucrats also pointed out the lack of quarantine, isolation and testing facilities. “Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves, etc; for the medical staff are an area of major concern for several districts and across states,” the National Preparedness Survey report, seen by Hindustan Times, said. The Union Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Jitendra Singh, along with K Shivaji, secretary, DARPG, and V. Srinivas, additional secretary, DARPG, will release the report on Thursday.The survey was conducted between March 25 and 30, where 410 district collectors and IAS officers, who belong to batches between 2014 and 2018 and have served as assistant secretaries, registered for the nationwide exercise. Altogether, 266 bureaucrats submitted completed reports to the DARPG.“This is the feedback we have received from across the country,” a DARPG official told Hindustan Times. “This the situation on the ground. We want to highlight the gaps in our fight against Covid-19. The suggestions have been noted and will be addressed appropriately,” he added. According to the report, the civil servants have “encouraged” the domestic production of testing kits. “It has been suggested that testing kits and ventilators be manufactured in the country,” the official mentioned above said. The respondents have recommended that issues related to procurement, logistics and supply chain of medical equipment should be addressed on a priority basis to bridge the massive demand-supply gap. More testing centres, including separate facilities for rural areas, and isolation wards should be set up to help prevent further transmission, the report said.The bureaucrats have also suggested using the expertise of health care start-ups to fight the pandemic.“Other countries are doing this as well,” BS Baswan, said a former director of Indian Institute of Public Administration. “Many are retooling the engineering sector in a bid to take care of the mechanical aspect of producing ventilators. It’s important to take advantage of global innovations and cater to growing needs such as testing kits and isolation wards,” he added.The bureaucrats have pitched for a regular mapping of quarantined people by creating a database that is shared at district level. There is a “need to coordinate with big data analytic firms for studying state-wise patterns, identifying areas of infection and disseminating the information through media”, the report said.“The respondents suggested an increase in the fiscal spending (around Rs 5-10 trillion, or 2% of GDP) on health care infrastructure, essential commodities for the poor and vulnerable sections in the society,” it added. Other economic relief could include partially waiving commercial rent of shops during the lockdown period, they suggested. Also read | Govt launches coronavirus tracker app called Aarogya Setu: Here’s what it doesThe bureaucrats have recommended issuing “standard operating procedures and guidelines for inter-state movement of people across state borders considering temporary/migrant workers’ exodus after the nationwide lockdown”. They have also urged the government to come up with relief packages and ensure food supplies to daily wagers.“Lockdown should be continued until the Covid-19 is not controlled. Any instances of non-adherence to lockdown should be dealt with harshly, particularly, where there is a gathering of over 50 people,” the report said. Research is also one of the key areas that the civil servants believe will provide a long-term solution to fight the viral outbreak. “The government should strengthen the research and development facilities to develop vaccines to fight Covid-19 with a long-term solution. Research institutes may be given all the necessary support and increased funding,” it said. The bureaucrats are in favour of doing away with the ongoing lockdown in a phased manner, suggesting the government lift it in states that have stopped reporting fresh Covid-19 positive cases.“A majority of districts across the country highlighted the shortage of medical staff, equipment and facilities like ICU beds, ventilators, ambulances, oxygen cylinders etc. The sub-district hospitals and health centres’ readiness is an area of focus, particularly in the north-eastern region,” the report said. The bureaucrats noted that there was a lack of awareness about Covid-19 among people living in backward districts and the tribal population. They have also flagged other concerns such as migrant workers’ unwillingness to adhere to the lockdown, inadequate sanitisation of public places and people hiding their travel histories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-health-care-to-migrants-ias-officers-take-on-fighting-covid-19/story-oTOe5oWzvPGP0ltKC2D04L.html

02-04-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 cases nearly double in week, could hit 10,000 by end of 21-day lockdown||Coronavirus cases in the country are on the rapid rise, showing no sign of abating. A look at the historical figures points to the fact that the cases have more than doubled in India in the past week. Last Thursday, Covid-19 cases in the country were under 700. This Thursday, the cases have nearly jumped to 2,000 with 1,965 patients. The figure includes 1,764 active cases, 150 recoveries and 50 deaths.At this pace of increase in fresh coronavirus cases, the number of patients could go beyond 10,000 by the end of the 21-day lockdown, Hindustan Times’ business publication Mint reported.It will be too early to predict whether the rate of the increase in coronavirus cases in the country will pace up or hit a plateau in days to come. The government is also trying to push the testing numbers which could further have an impact on the number of fresh cases. Also Watch | India’s COVID-19 cases rise, 7 Delhi Doctors test positive & more: Top 5 stories from HT In a conversation with Hindustan Times’s Amandeep Shukla, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan talked about ‘flattening the curve’ and said that it may take anywhere between 2 to 4 weeks to bend the curve.“There have been only a few sporadic cases, which do not indicate a wider community-wide spread of infection at the national level,” the minister said. India reported 437 new Covid-19 cases between March 31 and April 1. As many as 131 new coronavirus cases have been reported across the country in the last 12 hours, the health ministry announced today.With a staggering 335 patients, Maharashtra leads the Covid-19 tally in the country followed by Kerala which has reported 265 cases so far as per the central government figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-cases-nearly-double-in-week-could-hit-10-000-by-end-of-21-day-lockdown/story-EAfWM6N32iTmvt1L0xcIeM.html
02-04-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi seeks interest subvention with deferment of loan EMIs, slams govt||The Congress has hit out at the Centre for not announcing an interest subvention scheme along with the moratorium announced on payment of EMIs for three months against loans including for house, personal requirements, auto and other purposes, and said that it defeats the purpose of the relief.“The middle classes, too, are vulnerable. Wage cuts, job losses across all sectors of the economy, high petrol, diesel and gas prices are causing them acute distress. If this was not enough, while EMIs have been deferred, no interest subvention or relief has been provided. This offsets the entire purpose of the deferment,” party’s statement says. The statement issued by Congress president Sonia Gandhi after meeting of the party’s working committee also accused the centre of implementing the 21-day nationwide lockdown without any preparation, resulting in the suffering of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers who walked on foot in an attempt to return to their home states.The party also demanded that the government made public the list of all medical facilities devoted to fighting coronavirus including hospitals, number of beds, ventilators, quarantine and testing facilities.“We urge the government to publish a common minimum relief programme. This is vital and will help alleviate several of the concerns that currently afflict all people,” the release saidThe official release urged all the Congress-ruled states, party’s frontal organizations and its leaders and workers to “step forward” and offer their help to those families who are at “extreme risk”.Lastly, in a reference to the focus on attendees of a religious gathering at Nizamuddin, who have arguably become the single largest source of Covid-19 infections across the country, the Congress statement adds that the disease doesn’t differentiate on the basis of religions, castes, political ideology, age or gender and therefore utmost care must be taken to protect the vulnerable among all communities against the spread of the disease.“Covid-19 doesn’t differentiate between political ideology, religion, caste, age or gender. The choices we make today will have a direct impact tomorrow on our family, neighbourhood, community, environment and nation. How effectively we meet this challenge, how we protect all sections of our society, especially the most vulnerable amongst us will define us for generations to come. Only if we act together in solidarity, we will overcome,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-seeks-interest-subvention-with-deferment-of-loan-emis-slams-govt/story-4qjat1xVdFGWK71gnpQUAK.html

02-04-2020||India||As coronavirus cases rise, here are simple tips that may boost immune system||Experts have said that up to 50% people infected with coronavirus are unlikely to feel any discomfort or symptoms of the disease while it may prove fatal for elderly people and for those suffering from other serious ailments like diabetes, hypertension, respiratory problems and heart diseases to name a few.It is widely believed that a healthy person with a strong immune system stands a better chance to survive the disease than most, however, there is no concrete scientific evidence so far that establishes a direct link between a person’s immune system and coronavirus.While the government has started online information dissemination campaign to counter myths and fake news related to Covid-19 and its treatment, it is at the same time, also encouraging people to adopt healthy lifestyle habits that may boost a person’s immunity, making them less prone to illnesses.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, referred to these tips and said he had been following some of these for ages now. Here are the tips to stay healthy as released by the Ayush ministry and recommended by a panel of Ayurveda and Yoga experts. It must be made clear at the outset that none of these can either be considered to be a vaccine or medicine against coronavirus.General Measures1. Drink warm water throughout the day even during summers2. Daily practice of Yogasana, Pranayama (breathing exercises) and meditation for at least 30 minutes3. Use of spices like Haldi (Turmeric), Jeera (Cumin), Dhaniya (Coriander) and Lahsun (Garlic) are recommended for cooking.II Tips to boost Immunity as per Ayurveda1. Take Chyavanprash 10gm in the morning. Diabetics should take sugar-free Chyavanprash.2. Drink herbal tea and or decoction, also known as ‘Kadha’, made from Tulsi (Basil leaves), Dalchini (Cinnamon), Kalimirch (Black pepper), Shunthi (Dry Ginger) and Munakka (Raisin) - once or twice a day. Jaggery and or fresh lemon juice could be added to this preparation to suit one’s taste.3. Golden Milk- Half teaspoon Haldi (turmeric) powder in 150 ml hot milk - once or twice a day.III Ayurvedic procedures for detoxification and sinus care 1. Nasal application - Apply sesame oil or coconut oil or ghee in both the nostrils in the morning and evening. This is also called Pratimarsh Nyasya in Ayurveda.2. Oil pulling therapy- Take 1 table spoon sesame or coconut oil in the mouth. Do not drink, swish in the mouth for 2 to 3 minutes and spit it off followed by a warm-water rinse. This can be done once or twice a day.IV During dry cough / sore throat1. Steam inhalation with fresh Pudina (Mint) leaves or Ajwain (Caraway seeds) should be practiced once in a day.2. Lavang (Clove) powder mixed with jiggery or honey can be taken 2-3 times a day in case of cough or throat irritation.These measures generally treat normal dry cough and sore throat. However, it is best to consult doctors if these symptoms persist. The above measures can be followed to the extent possible as per an individual’s convenience.These measures are recommended by following eminent Vaidyas from across the country as they may possibly boost an individual’s immunity against infections.1.

Vaidya K N Dwivedi, VaranasiThe ministry describes Ayurveda as the science of life which propagates the gifts of nature in maintaining healthy and happy living. It says that Ayurveda’s extensive knowledge base on preventive care derives from the concepts of “Dinacharya” - daily regimes and “Ritucharya” - seasonal regimes to maintain a healthy life. It is a plant-based science. The simplicity of awareness about oneself and the harmony each individual can achieve by uplifting and maintaining his or her immunity is emphasized across Ayurveda’s classical scriptures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-coronavirus-cases-rise-here-are-simple-tips-that-may-boost-immune-system/story-mDAa80Ly3T1kgxVgj1Dh2M.html
02-04-2020||India||Pakistan court commutes death sentence of key convict in Daniel Pearl killing||Ahmed Omer Saeed Sheikh, the terrorist convicted of murdering journalist Daniel Pearl, had his death sentence commuted to a prison term of seven years by a Pakistani court on Thursday.The Sindh high court gave its verdict following appeals by Sheikh and three other men convicted of kidnapping and murdering Pearl in Karachi in 2002, the Pakistani media reported. The high court overturned the verdict of an anti-terrorism court.Sheikh, a British citizen of Pakistani origin, was freed by India along with Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Masood Azhar and terrorist Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar in exchange for the passengers of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 that was hijacked by a group of Pakistani terrorists from Kathmandu to Kandahar in December 1999.Sheikh’s death sentence was commuted to seven years in jail while the three other men convicted of Pearl’s murder were acquitted and freed by the Sindh high court.Reports in the Pakistani media said Sheikh’s seven-year prison term will be counted as part of the 18 years he has already spent in jail.A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha announced its verdict on appeals filed by the four men 18 years ago after hearing arguments by prosecution and defence lawyers and examining the records of the case.The high court also dismissed an appeal by the prosecution seeking enhancement of life sentence given to the three other men – Fahad Naseem, Salman Saqib and Sheikh Adil.Pearl, an American national and the South Asia bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped on January 23, 2002 in Karachi and later beheaded by his captors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-court-commutes-death-sentence-of-prime-accused-in-daniel-pearl-killing/story-Ggnl4dmo3S0jXkBSGP7IGO.html

The state also said it was planning to conduct diagnostic tests on over 300 of its residents who attended the event.According to data from states, over 300 confirmed cases and 11 deaths, including the three in Telangana on Wednesday, could be linked to the March gathering.

They are all recovering. Many of them have been discharged. No case among them was serious. Nobody died. But the positive cases for the past few days involve those who went to Markaz,” it said.The chief minister also appealed to the Markaz attendees, their family members and those who came in contact with them to undergo tests. “Since the virus is spreading through those who went to Markaz, they all should undergo tests without failure,” he said.ANDHRA REPORTS 67 POSITIVE CASESThe neighbouring Telugu state of Andhra Pradesh reported 67 positive cases in a span of 24 hours.

A 93-year-old from Pathanamthitta district in Kerala recovered after contracting the deadly coronavirus disease Covid-19.Thomas Abraham and his 88-year-old wife Mariyamma have been fully cured after days of life-and-death battle against the deadly virus which they contracted from their son, daughter-in-law and grandson who returned from Italy last month.The secret behind their recovery seems to be the healthy lifestyle they have been leading, said Rijo Moncy, their grandson.

He said the police stopped him on Tuesday saying it might lead to crowding in violation of the 21-day lockdown orders.“I was only inspired by the chief minister,” Dutta said after he was stopped by police from distributing rice, pulses, etc among poor people. Also read: Two patients die in West Bengal, death count reaches 6Dutta left the Trinamool Congress and joined the BJP last year. BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu also alleged he was not allowed to distribute food in the Hare Street police station area on Tuesday and the matter was resolved only after a long argument. Interestingly, the administration did not stop the BJP’s West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh or the party’s Asansol Lok Sabha member and Union minister Babul Supriyo from distributing relief material on Monday and Tuesday. No police officer commented on these incidents.“So, we have to conclude that it is alright when the chief minister distributes relief material but when the BJP does the same it is a violation of lockdown orders. This is absolutely unacceptable,” Dilip Ghosh said. “We have received reports that people are not getting relief material in many districts. Hoarding of essential items has led to price rise and the state government is doing nothing,” Ghosh added.Urban development minister and Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim said the opposition leaders were breaking the rules of the lockdown announced to stop the spread of coronavirus disease.“Opposition leaders should not put people at risk by starting a political competition. This is not the time for it. By drawing crowds while distributing relief materials they are only violating the lockdown announced by the Prime Minister,” Firhad Hakim said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stopped-from-distributing-food-during-covid-19-lockdown-bengal-bjp-leaders-target-tmc/story-DiXKOKcyMHcYHdHXVDYV3I.html
02-04-2020||India||Social distancing goes off rails as 32 migrant workers ‘hidden’ on truck||Around 32 migrant labourers, including women and children, were packed on a truck like sardines in a tin can and covered by a tarpaulin, as the vehicle stopped at a compressed natural gas (CNG) pump for a refill at Lucknow’s Gomtinagar around midnight on Tuesday.The labourers were trying to evade the 21-day nationwide lockdown enforced since March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. They were travelling on a truck with a Delhi registration number to their native villages in violation of the strictly enforced social distancing norms to combat the contagious viral outbreak. The labourers, who were travelling at the dead of night would have got away unnoticed, had it not been mandatory for all passengers to get off their vehicle at a CNG pump for a refill.The migrants were employed at a Delhi factory and whiled away their time chatting among themselves during the refill. Some even lit up their beedis during the brief timeout. A few children in the group gawked wide-eyed, as their parents stretched themselves out in the open.Some of the labourers were wearing masks, but most were ignorant of the threats that their travel posed to them and the community at large.Vijay, who identified himself as the leader of the group, said, “It’s been two days since we left Delhi. We managed to enter UP, despite the border being sealed because we knew alternative routes to sneak in. We’ve managed to reach Lucknow with great difficulty. We didn’t choose to leave Delhi. The factory, where we worked, has shut. We’re left high and dry without any food, water and other essential commodities. We’ve somehow managed to come this far and now not too far from our destination,” he said.“I belong to Bhatpura village in Barabanki district. Please call me later. I will answer whatever you want me to ask, but right now we need to reach our villages safe,” he said as the truck hurriedly sped away after the refill, barely before he could share his mobile phone number with the reporter.He responded to the call only once since the last conversation at the dead of night.Asked over the phone, how they were doing and how did his neighbours treat them, he said, “All of us are doing well and are quarantined at our homes.”He, however, glossed over whether they have been discriminated by their neighbours.“Well, there are all kinds of people in a village. Some would say whatever they want to. The gram pradhan knows that we’re back at our homes,” he said.“I will call you later,” he said before disconnecting the phone. Neither did he call back, nor answered his phone later.Crazy rush for govt busesThere has been a mad scramble for buses ever since the UP government announced that it would provide transport facilities to ferry stranded migrant labourers back home. The rush is palpable from Lucknow to Bahraich and from Barabanki to Bualandshahr. The migrants, who have defied the lockdown with impunity because of the sudden loss of livelihood and depleted savings, travelled hundreds of kilomteres by foot in a bid to reach their native villages. Most of them claim they are not aware of community kitchens and the financial help announced by the UP government for the daily wagers. Consider the case of an eight-month pregnant woman, who accompanied by her labourer husband, travelled around 500 kilometres from Delhi to Mahoba on foot to reach her native village. The desperate movement is fraught with fears of community transmission of Covid-19, which the Central government is still maintaining hasn’t reached that stage yet.Manning villagesLocal youths at Prahladpur and Dhikoli villages in western UP’s Baghpat district have taken the responsibility to check the entry of outsiders.“If they’re from our villages, we’ll ensure that they are quarantined for 14 days as advised by the government,” said Mahendra, a village youth.UP chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari said hundreds and thousands of people from other states have entered the state. “We have set up over 300 shelter homes to screen migrant workers who are on their way back to their respective native villages,” he said.“We’re appealing to them to stay wherever they are as chief minister Yogi Adityanath has spoken to his counterparts from other states to ensure that they’re safe. But for those who’ve travelled here, we’re making sure that they are screened and quarantined,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-social-distancing-goes-off-rails-as-32-migrant-workers-hide-in-truck-in-uttar-pradesh/story-avNgC6IloMBVjcFRBG9zMM.html

Guru Sangappa Janganavvar lived in Kalliganuru village in the Gajendragad Taluk of Gadag district.This was the fifth such instance in Karnataka where a person took the extreme step over the fear of contracting the dreaded Sars-CoV-2 virus.According to police, Janganavvar used to work in Mangalore as a labourer and returned to his native place four days ago. After returning, he developed mild fever and cough. He went to a government hospital in Shantageri located in the same district.

The man did this after the doctors declared that his brother died due to coronavirus disease.With the latest death, the Covid-19 toll in Telangana reached seven.Gandhi Hospital Superintendent Dr P Sravan Kumar told reporters that the brothers had been undergoing treatment at the isolation ward for the last few days. One of them, a 56-year old, was in critical condition and had been put on ventilator.“On Wednesday, his condition deteriorated and he succumbed to the disease. His brother, who was informed of the death, turned furious and attacked the resident doctor and other healthcare workers in the ward. He also broke the window panes in the ward,” Kumar said.He said the attack caused panic among the doctors and other staff of the hospital who had been working under tremendous pressure since the outbreak of Covid-19.The hospital staff immediately alerted the policemen stationed in the hospital, who initially hesitated to enter the isolation ward because they had no safety gear like Personnel Protection Equipment (PPE).Later, Hyderabad Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar rushed to the hospital and took control of the situation and restored normalcy.

This is due to the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing nationwide lockdown. The holy festival of Navratri would culminate on Thursday.The famous pilgrimage attracts lakhs of devotees from various parts of the country and abroad throughout the year. Katra, the base camp, bursts at the seams during Navratri festival when the footfall of the pilgrims goes up to 35,000 to 45,000 every single day.However, this Navratri, the hustle-bustle was missing and the Katra town, two tracks and the sanctum sanctorum remained deserted.Consequently, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board suffered a loss of around Rs 4 crores this Navratri.“During Navratri festival, the base camp of Katra, on an average, witnesses a footfall of 35,000 to 45,000 pilgrims in a day. And, during this nine-day long festival, offerings in cash, ornaments and online donations accrue to Rs 45 lakhs on a single day. The major share always belongs to cash offerings and donations at the shrine. However, this Navratri festival no pilgrim could come to the holy cave shrine because of the Covid-19 infection and subsequent lockdown,” said an official of the shrine board.He estimated that the shrine board may have suffered a loss of Rs 4.05 crores.“However, despite the lockdown, Pooja and other rituals are being performed twice a day in the morning and the evening by a team of dedicated priests,” he said.“Devotees of the goddess were very disappointed because they could not come to pay obeisance here but the shrine priests have advised people on how and where to immerse “Saankh” and how to do “Kanya Poojan” on the culmination of the nine-day long festival,” said the official.“The head priest said that social distancing has to be maintained at every cost to defeat this virus. He also advised the people that in place of worshipping ‘Kanjaks’ (little girls), they should worship “Suparis” (betel nuts). Similarly, ‘Saankh’ can be respectfully immersed in a utensil filled with water and then kept in flower pots in the house,” he added.The pilgrimage, considered to be second richest after Tirumala Tirupati Devsthanam, was suspended on March 18 because of the coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-vaishno-devi-shrine-remained-deserted-this-navratri-loses-offerings-worth-rs-4-crore/story-80xN0FFq4Up0ncjukfhI0N.html

The repatriation from India is part of the massive effort being undertaken by the US for its citizens from across the world. So far, the US has repatriated over 30,000 citizens from over 60 countries on more than 350 flights. “We began our repatriation efforts from India yesterday with a flight that brought in some 170 US citizens,” Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Ian Brownlee told reporters during a conference call on Wednesday. “We will begin a steadier flow of flights out of New Delhi and Mumbai in the coming days, really beginning toward the end of this week and into the weekend,” he said in response to a question. There are more than 80 flights scheduled or in the planning stages from various locations, he added. Reluctant to share the specific numbers which remain highly dynamic, Brownlee said the number from India is in the multiple thousands, who have indicated a possible interest in being repatriated to the US. “We have found the Government of India has been very cooperative and very helpful with us in arranging these repatriation flights. We are thankful to them for their assistance and their support as we undertake this important mission,” Brownlee said. The US has run into some complications with regard to its efforts in Africa because of the closures in airspaces there, he added. In Africa, out of the 57 international airports on the continent, over 30 of them are either at restricted or no operations, and every repatriation flight is being negotiated by the country team on the ground on a case-by-case, flight-by-flight basis in a great number of the countries involved, said William Walters, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Operations, Bureau of Medical Services in the State Department. The United States has some 20 million people living overseas. Walters said the Department of State was making every effort to assist US citizens overseas who wish to return to the country. “But as the COVID-19 situation develops, our ability to provide such assistance, whether working with commercial airlines or arranging for evacuation flights, may become more limited or even unavailable,” he said. Brownlee said that if US citizens wished to return to America, they should make arrangements to do so now, and contact the nearest embassy or consulate for assistance. “There’s no guarantee the Department of State will be able to continue to provide repatriation assistance, and transportation options from many countries to the United States may become unavailable in the future, even in a few weeks’ time,” he warned. Those who choose to remain overseas should be prepared to remain there for the foreseeable future, he asserted, in an indication of the gravity of the situation. “If you were on the beach when an earthquake struck, you wouldn’t just stand there waiting for the coming tsunami. You would head for higher ground immediately. Well, in this case, the earthquake has happened. It’s time to seek higher ground now, and not hope for rescue later,” Brownlee said. A nationwide 21-day lockdown was enforced on March 24 in India to check the spread of coronavirus as social distancing is possibly the only way to prevent people from infecting the deadly virus. A total of 932,605 COVID-19 cases have been reported across more than 175 countries and territories with 16,809 deaths reported so far, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The US has reported 213,372 COVID-19 cases, the highest in the world, and over 5,000 people have died due to the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-us-begins-repatriation-of-its-nationals-from-india-receives-help-from-govt-says-official/story-9bnfM4FvdhSmyy4tvHliJM.html

State officials said that the railways is providing lists of passengers to the district authorities which are being compared to the list of participants of the event to ensure contact tracing. Of the contacts being traced, one is the case of 10 Indonesians who took the AP Sampark Kranti Express back to Karimnagar district after the event on March 13, and subsequently reported positive for coronavirus.Around 60 passengers who travelled on the New Delhi-Ranchi Rajdhani Express in the same B1 coach as a Malaysian woman who tested positive for the virus, believed to be part of the Nizamuddin Tablighi cluster, are under the scanner with the district authorities scrambling to find their whereabouts. The woman who travelled on the train on March 16 with 23 others tested positive and is Jharkhandś first confirmed case of COVID-19.According to inputs from states, two people who attended the congregation and later tested positive travelled by the Duronto on March 18 in the S8 coach along with “two companions”, two of them travelled by the Grand Trunk Express in the S3 coach with two minors, while a couple of others took the Tamil Nadu Express.What is making the contact tracing of these individuals a herculean task for both the railway and district authorities is the fact that they moved around freely at that time as it was before any restrictions were imposed.Both Hazrat Nizamuddin stations and the New Delhi railway station are one of the busiest railway stations in the country. While Hazrat Nizamuddin station in Delhi, sees 56 long-distance trains departing every day and 130 trains from other sources halt here, 62 trains originate and 76 trains halt at the New Delhi railway station every day. While the former has a footfall of about two lakh every day, the latter has a daily footfall of around 5 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-5-trains-thousands-of-passengers-under-scanner-over-travelling-with-tablighi-jamaat-participants/story-n8jSMwIVFDgKqokAecldXO.html
02-04-2020||India||NIA files case to probe Kabul attack||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday filed a case to probe the March 25 terror attack on a gurudwara in Kabul, Afghanistan, in which 27 Sikhs including an Indian citizen were killed by four gunmen. It is the first time that an Indian agency has decided to investigate a terror attack on foreign soil in which an Indian citizen fell victim. The NIA has registered its case under criminal conspiracy and terror charges. An NIA official, who didn’t wish to be named, said: “We will first seek all the documents from Afghanistan authorities through official channels to see what kind of evidence they have collected so far. A team will later visit Kabul”.Tian Singh, a resident of Greater Kailash Part-I in Delhi, was among the 27 Sikhs killed in the attack, which took place when there were 150 worshippers in the Gurudwara.The Narendra Modi government last year amended the NIA Act, empowering the agency to investigate terror activities against Indians and Indian interests abroad apart from cyber crimes and human trafficking. The amended law came into force on August 2, 2019. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has such powers and an FBI team had even travelled to India to investigate the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 in which six American citizens were among the more than 160 killed.The Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) had claimed responsibility for the Kabul terror attack, saying it was staged to avenge alleged atrocities on Muslims in Kashmir.Initial investigations have revealed that one of the attackers in the Kabul attack was Muhsin alias Abu Khalid al-Hindi, a resident of Kerala’s Kasargod district, who had left India around five-six years ago. Others who left Kerala to join Islamic State are also under the scanner.Indian officials suspect that a few others from Kasargod who left India in 2016 to join the Islamic State, including a man known simply as Sajid, is also behind the Kabul attack. A large number of ISKP members are said to be from India including those who travelled to Afghanistan from Kerala’s Palakkad and Kasargod.Indian agencies are not ruling out the role of Pakistan’s spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in helping Mushin, who was killed by Afghan security forces, and others involved in the attack as there are reports that he first joined the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba and later switched to the Islamic State.ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-files-case-to-probe-kabul-attack/story-yxGPagt3aGHoYeTwsZFQSN.html

And if trends continue, the White House fears that 100,000 to 240,000 deaths are likely in the country. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, warned that the numbers are what “we need to anticipate, but that doesn’t mean that that’s what we’re going to accept. Our hope is to get that down as much as we can”.Fauci, a member of the White House task force, and Deborah Birx, who also serves on the task force, said in a presentation that 100,000 to 240,00 Americans could die despite the social distancing and other mitigation efforts.

In addition to the three people who previously died of Covid 19, three more who died on Tuesday night and Monday morning are suspected to have been infected with the coronavirus.“Two male persons both aged 57 years and one male person aged 62 years all having Severe Acute Respiratory illness expired. One of them had chronic renal failure, another had respiratory failure and the third one had hypertension and other co-morbid conditions. They had all reportedly tested positive, which is subject to confirmation,” the bulletin issued on Wednesday night said. In the evening, a worried Banerjee held a meeting with the health task force comprising senior doctors to chalk out elaborate treatment plans. She also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, seeking a grant of Rs 25,000 crore, release of dues and relaxation of debt management.In her letter to the prime minister, Banerjee wrote, “I earnestly urge you to sanction a grant of a minimum of Rs 25,000 crore for the state of West Bengal and release the funds still due to us from the Government of India, as per my earlier letter to you. To uphold the spirit of cooperative federalism, we need this minimum help from the central government to cope with the unprecedented impasse at this hour to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,” Banerjee wrote in her letter. Addressing the media, Banerjee insisted that “a complete lockdown” had become absolutely necessary to prevent the infection from entering “stage 3”, which is community transmission of the disease. She expressed dissatisfaction over a section of people who were not abiding by the lockdown and loitering on the streets.“We are still in stage two. The coming two weeks are going to be very very critical and sensitive. We must ensure we do not reach the third phase. Lockdown must be made completely successful. I can see people still roaming around, chatting together. I plead before you like a sister, please do not do this.

02-04-2020||India||Aggressive testing to begin near Nizamuddin||Nizamuddin, in the heart of Delhi, will see health workers from the integrated diseases surveillance programme start going door-to-door from Thursday as they seek to track and contain cases of Covid-19 in what has emerged the latest and biggest cluster of the coronavirus disease in the country. Cases of Covid-19 around the country have been traced back to a religious congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat at its headquarters in the area, attended, through March, by thousands of the group’s members. On Wednesday, the last of the 2,346 people who had been in the building were evacuated; 536 of them were sent to the hospital and 1,810 placed in quarantine. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThus far, the congregation has been identified as being responsible for 358 infections and 9 deaths. So, starting Thursday, everyone within a 3km radius (focal area) of the building and in the buffer area (5km radius) will be screened for symptoms. Those who are symptomatic -- a cough will do -- will be tested. This will entail door-to-door coverage, first in the focal area and then the buffer area.“The cluster containment strategy has two components: one is to mark the epicentre and the buffer zone where extensive door-to-door surveys will be conducted. We do a complete lockdown in and around the area. The next step is identifying all potential positive cases by going in for aggressive testing. We pick samples from everyone with any respiratory illness in the area,” said a senior technical expert with the Union health ministry who asked not to be named.The health ministry has come up with a detailed “Micro-plan for Containing Local Transmission of Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19)” in a defined geographic area. The cluster containment strategy has been refined over the past two weeks and is being used in 12 clusters around the country. Nizamuddin is the 13th. The strategy involves mobile testing units with experts that go to the epicentres of the clusters to collect samples. The clusters where containment measures have been put in place over the past 10 days include Dilshad Garden in Delhi; Bhilwara in Rajasthan; Sangli in Maharashtra; Parts of Mumbai and Pune, also in Maharashtra; Srinagar in Jammu & Kashmir; Agra and Meerut in Uttar Pradesh; and Kasaragode, Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta and Kannur in Kerala. State governments have been asked to aggressively identify and contain cases that could lead to clustering. Movement in and around the epicentres of the clusters are completely prohibited. In Nizamuddin, for instance, these are the lanes in and around the Jamaat’s HQ, the Markaz Nizamuddin. The government is already testing all severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases for Covid-19, but in clusters, it will test anyone with any kind of respiratory illness.“SARI cases are usually hospitalised, but this (cluster containment) is about picking up samples from within the community. We have well-equipped mobile vans with adequately trained people to collect samples that are sent to these hot spots,” said the expert from the health ministry. Doctors said cluster containment is the correct approach, especially because it aggressively widens testing. “It is a very good idea to test aggressively as it will help in knowing the exact magnitude of the problem. To look for a solution you need to know the extent of problem. Covid-19 is a highly infectious disease that needs aggressive containment strategy, like locking down hot spot areas. No person should be allowed to leave these areas” said Dr Chand Wattal, chairman, clinical microbiology and immunology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Local clustering of cases usually occurs when family members, neighbours, friends or colleagues are infected by the same P0 (index patient, in medical terminology) or infect each other. Aggressive contact tracing is also a part of containment strategy.“The increase in numbers during the past couple of days is related to the congregation in Delhi, and all efforts are being made to trace the contacts and quarantine and isolate suspected cases. Close to 1,800 people have been moved to various hospitals and quarantine facilities in and around Delhi, and we are expecting positive cases to increase as and when the results start pouring in.

How can you say no to the household chores , right from cleaning the house to washing utensils and clothes, when all family members are expected to pitch in! These times have drastically changed the dynamics of almost every family, and that’s the reason why most are feeling that their house has turned into Bigg Boss ka ghar — the house of the popular reality TV show. Picture this, family members are contestants, who are having dramatic stand-off and arguments over household chores while locked in, and to top it, they are also being given tasks to fulfil. Wonder how? Remember the 5pm call for thaali (utensil banging) and taali bajana (clapping), for the corona warriors? For some people who are locked in, their burst of excess energy is taking a hilarious turn! “Yeh lock down bandh kara do, nahi toh Savdhaan India (real-life crime story show) ke bahut episodes ban jaayenge, with husband and wife in lead characters,” says Charanpreet Singh, a resident of Delhi’s Defence Colony. READ | Sidharth Shukla on coronavirus lockdown: ‘In Bigg Boss 13, we were locked up with strangers but now it’s with loved ones’The frustration of not being able to go out and having to do all the work in the house has even lead to division of tasks between life partners. Urmika Sahai , a resident of Delhi’s Vasant Kunj, Sector C, says, “Our life has become so similar to that of contestants in the Bigg Boss house. We don’t feel like getting up in the morning, and the house help doesn’t come so there’s further no one to disturb by ringing the doorbell. Mood change karne ke liye I start the day by playing peppy songs to wake up my husband. Also, we have been living on a limited ration, and without a luxury budget! Ab toh bahar ka khaana aana bhi band ho gaya hai... And we have divided the house tasks. While I do the cooking and brooming, my husband does the mopping and washing of the utensils. That’s another thing that my husband keeps postponing his tasks, and I have to remind him.” Soumya Shrivastava, a resident of Gaur City 2, Noida is facing a similar experience. She says, “My hubby and I keep switching roles from ripping each other apart like actors Dolly Bindra and Manoj Tiwari (former contestants of Bigg Boss), to being hopelessly romantic like Shehnaaz Gill and Sidharth Shukla (contestants of the recently concluded Bigg Boss 13). We get along pretty well as far as the cooking and cleaning are concerned because we have assigned our responsibilities, and neither of us interferes in the other department.” READ | Big Brother Germany contestants are still unaware of coronavirus pandemic, will be told in special live showAsk about the tasks and Neha Bindal, a resident of Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave cracks up, “We feel we did our assigned tasks like thokoing tali and thali quite well!” So, has anyone found a way to survive in such a house without ending up in unnecessary fights that call for Salman Khan’s ire? Meharr Dhatt, a resident of Nirvana Country in Gurugram, says, “Over all, through this lock down our family has proved that we can actually tolerate each other. We will see this thing through together, as we are together... We are taking it as a summer break that has arrived early, except that we are holidaying in prison style! Just that the wine is a saviour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/coronavirus-lockdown-is-it-your-house-or-bigg-boss-ka-ghar/story-ihn6AXqtExNE3B8gF6cEKN.html
02-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Foreign returns face the heat||A panic-stricken Indian student, who was studying in Paris, returned to Delhi just days before the city started inching towards a complete lockdown. She chose to come back because it was getting difficult for her to survive in Paris — where the lockdown was already underway. “My university was going to shut down in a week’s time. The lockdown of the city I lived in was had begun, and people had started panic stocking toilet rolls, sanitizers and food from the supermarkets. I felt that there is soon going to be a scarcity of food; I didn’t know French, the public transport was avoidable in these times and I didn’t own any form of a conveyance. If something would’ve happened to me, I would have been completely stranded,” says the 34-old-student who has now returned to her home in Noida. Upon landing at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, this student says that she was had to not just undergo tests but was also escorted to a quarantine facility in Chhattarpur, before she was released a few days later, and asked to home quarantine further. “We were taken to a bus, escorted with plenty of policemen after hours of screening at the airport. While we sat in the bus, the public from outside started making our videos and taking photos as if we weren’t international returns but zoo animals! It was really unnerving,” she recalls, adding that the treatment of her neighbours and those living in her society hasn’t been much different with her parents having to face scorn every now and then. She asks, “Now I’m thinking, did I make a mistake by returning home in between the coronavirus outbreak?” READ | 2 million NRIs residing in 10 countries hit by coronavirusAssociation of those societies that house residents with family members who have recently returned from abroad, are having a tough time tackling the situation of ostracization of these foreign returns. Take for instance Shweta Gupta, joint secretary of the society Mahagun Moderne in Noida. Gupta had to deal with multiple cases of foreign return nationals in her society. Concerned residents kept messaging her. Gupta says, “Our tower people were concerned because the foreign return individual would be using the same common place areas, like the lift, to go home. Furthermore, people were afraid that the maid who would be working at that individual’s place would be working at other places in the society as well. I asked the individual to write in our society’s WhatsApp group assuring other residents that all the necessary precautions are being undertaken by her. We even sent a mailer to all residents that the society has been thoroughly cleaned, and that the individual is practising self isolation properly.”Did this help in comforting the society residents and their fear around the foreign return resident? “Absolutely! Overnight, because of proper communication and pro-active attitude of the international resident in taking precautions, she became the hero of the society. Other residents also reached out to her, and offered to deliver groceries to her doorstep. Once the society residents were assured that they are safe, the panic subsided,” adds Gupta. READ | Facing the virus of hateThe cold-shouldering of people who recently travelled abroad is quite an issue in some cases. A Gurugram resident, who runs a pre-school, says on condition of anonymity, “I had just returned from my travel at a time when the coronavirus epidemic hadn’t reached India. So a parent asked me, ‘Mere bachche ka khaasi zukaam theek nahin ho raha bahut din se. Mujhe pata chala aap bahar se ho kar aaye ho. Toh yeh poochna tha ki aap theek ho ya nahin’. I immediately clarified that I was fine!”But experts say that ostracization isn’t the right way to deal with the present situation. Dr Jivitesh Satija, who currently working as a resident in cardiology, addresses how to tackle this problem, and says, “Please follow the guidelines that the government has issued. Sanitize often, maintain social distancing and adhere to the lockdown. All foreign return individuals must also practice self quarantine. Help the foreign return individuals by encouraging them to maintain isolation, but do not shun them or stop talking to them through messages because the need of the hour is that people who are travelling from abroad must feel encouraged to report their travel history and voluntarily self isolate. If we make a big deal out of this issue, the fear is that the foreign returns might try to hide their travel details, because of feeling unwelcome. Do not panic, just be well informed, and let’s work together to tackle this pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/covid-19-foreign-returns-face-the-heat/story-cZ9360VX2tqs4Pq47AJQFP.html
02-04-2020||India||GST collection dips, auto sales fall as Covid-19 takes toll on economy||Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections for March saw an 8% decline over the same month a year ago to the lowest in five months, and auto sales in the month for India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki were down almost by half as the lockdown imposed to combat the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) took a toll on the economy. The numbers are significant because they are among the first available so-called high-frequency indicators of the economic impact of the pandemic and the hard lockdown that India has imposed for three weeks till April 14 to slow its progress. Over the next few days, more indicators, including Purchasing Managers Index, a measure of economic health, will become available. GST collections in March fell to Rs 97,597 crore. Apart from Maruti, which has a close-to-50% share of the Indian car market, Tata Motors, the leading maker of trucks and buses, said sales of these commercial vehicles were down 87% in the month. Demand for commercial vehicles is considered an indicator of economic activity. India imposed a lockdown starting March 25. The lockdown has exacerbated an existing slowdown in vehicle sales. Sales at Hyundai Motor were down 47% in the month and at SUV-maker Mahindra & Mahindra by 88%. Analysts and economists say India is unlikely to meet its target of 5% growth in 2019-20 and have revised downward their estimates for 2020-21 too. SBI Research said in a report that India could grow by 4.5% in 2019-20 and 2.6% in 2020-21. Nomura has said in a report that it expects India’s GDP to fall by 0.5% in 2020 (calendar year), revising its earlier estimate of 4.5% growth. Total GST for the financial year 2019-20 has increased by 3.8% to Rs 12,22,131 crore compared to Rs 11,77,369 crore collected in 2018-19. Experts said things could get worse. Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consulting firm EY, said, “With most businesses being non-operational for a considerable period in March and the relaxation of delayed payments being allowed, the collections in the coming quarter would see quite a fall.” The fall in March breaks the trend of four months of robust GST collections since November that saw monthly revenue figures crossing the Rs 1 lakh crore benchmark. Out of the gross GST revenue for March, the share of central GST is Rs 19,183 crore, state GST is Rs 25,601 crore, integrated GST is Rs 44,508 crore (including Rs 18,056 crore collected on imports) and cess is Rs 8,306 crore, a finance ministry statement said. Pratik Jain, partner and leader of Indirect Tax practice at PwC India said although the March collection has seen some impact of the Covid-19 lockdown, the real impact would be reflected in April. “There is around 7% reduction in filing of GSTR 3B (returns) over last month. It seems that many businesses may not have been able to pay GST because of liquidity issues.” Vishal Raheja, deputy general manager (DGM), Taxmann said: “It is noteworthy that the import of goods has also shown a negative growth of 23% as compared to March 2019. It has also played a crucial role to push back the GST collections.”Experts said the impact of coronavirus and consequent lockdown of major economies will continue to be a drag for global growth and India will also be impacted. International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva said last week that the outlook for global growth in 2020 is negative and remarked it a recession “at least as bad as during the global financial crisis (2008) or worse”. Moody’s Investors Service on Friday slashed India’s economic growth projection for calendar 2020 from 5.3% to 2.5% and ICRA Ltd estimated India’s growth at 2% for FY-21.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-kitty-dips-auto-sales-fall-as-covid-19-takes-toll/story-RPaUJfPWIAnKch4F6J34uO.html

Two doctors, a couple that worked in two mohalla clinics in north-east Delhi, had tested positive earlier.One of the doctors treated Covid-19 patients at Safdarjung hospital, home to at least 21 positive patients at present. Another two of the doctors – from the Delhi State Cancer Institute in Tahirpur and the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel hospital in west Delhi – were among the 23 people who tested positive on Tuesday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We have still not seen any proper PPE kits that can prevent droplet infections. We are using an HIV kit instead, which does not cover the body entirely. So, residents are using a scarf to cover the head, a towel to cover the neck, and N-95 masks along with them in the hope of preventing infection. This is dangerous, especially for those collecting throat swabs because patients tend to cough when the samples are collected,” said Dr Srinivas Rajkumar T, general secretary of the resident doctors’ association at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced a compensation of Rs 1 crore to family members of health care workers who die treating Covid-19 patients. So far, there have been 120 cases and two deaths due to Covid-19 in the city.The affected 35-year-old doctor from the Delhi State Cancer Institute worked in the department of preventive oncology and has been admitted to Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital in Rohini, where he resides. The doctor’s wife and child have been admitted to Lok Nayak hospital near Delhi Gate on suspicion of having the disease.The hospital had to suspend its out-patient clinics on Wednesday to sanitise the area.“Yes, the OPD has been suspended in order to sanitise it. We cannot take the chance of spreading it to our patients. At the moment, we only have emergent cancer patients coming to the hospital, all of whom are immuno-compromised and at a greater risk of developing severe disease,” said Dr BL Sherwal, director, Delhi State Cancer Institute.The hospital has been receiving around 100 to 150 people in its out-patient department since the nationwide lockdown. Usually, between 1,000 and 1,500 cancer patients visit the hospital clinics.Another doctor to have tested positive is a 32-year-old paediatrician from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel hospital in East Patel Nagar. He was tested after his wife — a doctor from the biochemistry department at Safdarjung hospital — tested positive for the disease two days back.Another of her colleagues — a 26-year-old man from the respiratory department — who treated Covid-19 patients at the hospital tested positive.Apart from these, a doctor couple from Delhi’s mohalla clinics in north-east Delhi’s Maujpur and Baburpur area tested positive on March 21 and March 25. They and their daughter is also admitted to GTB hospital in Dilshad Garden after testing positive. The 49-year-old husband had contracted the disease from a 38-year-old woman who had returned from Saudi Arabia and is the index for a 10-person cluster.Delhi’s integrated disease surveillance programme is tracing around 2,600 people who visited the two mohalla clinics.Another 48-year-old doctor from west Delhi’s Hari Nagar tested positive for Covid-19 after providing home consultation to a person who had returned from New Zealand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ppe-scarcity-a-concern-as-7-city-doctors-infected/story-d9k5skIkencMziCaKPUkVN.html
02-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Nizamuddin markaz trail widens; coronavirus cases in India hit 2,000||The number of Covid-19 cases in India soared over 2,000 on Wednesday, fuelled largely by infections linked to a March event of the Tablighi Jamaat in the heart of Delhi that emerged this week as the biggest domestic source of the disease in the country. According to a tally of numbers released by 25 states and union territories, close to 8,500 people have been identified as having been to the Islamic sect’s headquarters in the capital’s Nizamuddin area, prompting authorities to intensify efforts to trace them since they may be carrying the virus and potentially infecting others.This is in addition to the 2,346 people who have been evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat’s six-storey mosque complex – called a markaz – in Delhi since Sunday, including 531 who have now been taken to hospitals as they showed symptoms of the disease. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn all, 358 confirmed Covid-19 cases across the country have been linked to the markaz.Covid-19 infections across the world crossed 900,000, with the United States, Italy, Spain and the UK now reporting the bulk of approximately 4,000 new daily fatalities.In a video conference with the police and administration heads of the states, Union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba asked all states to launch on “war footing” a contact tracing of all those who attended Tablighi Jamaat events in Delhi this month. In a briefing later in the evening, the health ministry said the country recorded 386 new cases in 24 hours – a surge that was driven by the infections among the sect’s members. “I want to highlight that the rise in the number of positive cases does not represent a national trend, but if there will be a failure anywhere, obviously cases will rise,” said health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal, reiterating the need for people to follow social distancing guidelines and not violate the nationwide lockdown underway at present.Over the weekend, officials discovered infections were multiplying at the markaz after alerts began streaming in from other states where people who had been to the building had developed symptoms after heading out to other cities. At least nine of these people – six in Telangana and one each in Kashmir, Gujarat and Karnataka – have died due to the disease.By 1pm on Wednesday, the markaz was sanitised by sanitation workers in decontamination suits. The workers said they found the insides of the building to be damp. “We have sprayed every corner of the building, but its insides are damp due to the absence of sunlight. Usually the surfaces we have been spraying all these days were dry, so we don’t know how effective the disinfectant would be,” said Harish Kumar, a sanitation worker.Kumar described the markaz as comprising mostly large halls, many of which had rows of beds spread out. “Rows and rows of mattresses were spread out in the halls, floor after floor,” he said. Authorities may now begin an exercise to canvass the Nizamuddin area, a congested residential locality. “As part of the cluster containment strategy, Nizamuddin, which is turning out to be a big cluster, would require aggressive- door-to-door- contact tracing and testing to pick up positive cases. After the evacuation and segregation at the epicentre, next step will be to trace possible cases that may have directly or indirectly come into contact with them; and test them,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting anonymity. The Delhi Police and Intelligence Bureau separately estimated that around 6,500 to 7,000 people visited the markaz between March 10 and March 24 – when active infections are believed to have been taking place at the building. At least 300 of these were foreign nationals, including the six Indonesians who died in Telangana. Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have seen the bulk of infections linked to the markaz, with the three states reporting 237 cases. Tamil Nadu added 110 on Wednesday alone, taking its total to 190. Officials in at least two other states — Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra — said they are using cellphone location and call data to search for people who had been to the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi.According to intelligence bureau officials who asked not to be named, about 2,000 foreign nationals arrived on tourist visas from at least 70 countries to take part in the sect’s work across the country since January 1. Participating in religious activity while on a tourist visa is prohibited by Indian immigration rules. According to the home ministry’s assessment, a majority of these foreign nationals were from Bangladesh (493), Indonesia (472), Malaysia (150) and Thailand (142). “All the ambassadors of the concerned countries have been contacted and they’ve been informed about the position of various nationals that are involved in this [matter],” said a person who asked not to be named.The home ministry has now directed state authorities to immediately deport foreigners who test negative for Covid-19 by the “first available flights”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/markaz-trail-widens-cases-hit-2-000/story-1FQGNRLqLYTspZSILnoilM.html
02-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Centre receives 916 complaints from citizens||From groceries not being delivered in Goa to pleas from the UK and New York to evacuate stranded Indians, from frantic requests for garbage disposal to complaints about police harassment -- these are some of the matters that have come to the Central government ‘s notice since the 21-day lockdown to curtail the spread of the coronavirus disease began on March 25.Around 916 complaints, from departments/ministries and states were received by the Department of Administrative Reform and Public Grievances (DARPG) relating to Covid-19 as of April 1. While many of these complaints were registered through the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), others were filed on the Department’s website after it launched a separate section for COVID-19 grievances on Wednesday. The DAPRG has sorted 336 complaints, received as of March 30, into 11 categories to “expeditiously address them.”“Many of these grievances were filed through the Prime Minsiter’s Office on the PM”s website, now they are all being forward to the separate COVID-19 grievance portal,” a senior DARPG official said on condition of anonymity. “There is a 60 -day period for the redressal of grievances filed through the PMO. But since these are urgent, and a huge data dump has taken place, a separate portal has been set up to monitor and address them.”These complaints will be resolved in a period of three days.The 11 categories include inadequate facilities in hospitals, problem in donating to the PM-CARES fund, essential supplies not being provided, request for rescue from another country, stuck in some place because of lockdown, harassment, lockdown not adhered to, examination-related and quarantine-related matters, suggestions and others, according to data accessed by Hindustan Times.A majority of the grievances are health-related, the official cited above added. These include overcrowding of isolation wards, lack of masks and sanitisers and not enough testing facilities or hospitals being ill-equipped to test patients.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAccording to the official, the DARPG has also received requests for immediate garbage disposal and evacuation of Indians from overseas.“We have received requests from UK and New York to evacuate Indians stranded there as the situation has gotten really bad in those countries,” he said. Several students, family members and concerned parties have also reached out to external affairs minister S. Jaishankar on the same issue, including senior Nationalist Congress Party leader Supriya Sule.“We are looking into it. People have also complained that essential services, like garbage collection, are not happening anymore,” the official said.There have also been requests from people to intervene with banks since the Reserve Bank of India has allowed a moratorium on payments of equated monthly instalment but the banks haven’t responded, leading to concerns among consumers about being penalised in case of non-payment of dues.“There are also litigants who have reached out to us,” said the first official. “They haven’t been able to reach courts on time and are afraid it may adversely impact their cases. They have asked us for help.”The DARPG has also received requests to help ease supply chains so that essential services may not be hampered. In Goa, according to the analysis accessed by Hindustan Times, people have complained about groceries not being provided. Seven requests to postpone government exams have also been received.Among the harassment complaints are cases of people being evicted from college and police high-handedness. Around 28 grievances have been lodged under the lockdown not being followed category; that includes private sector and postal employees being called to work, according to the data.“In the general pipeline (PMO or CPGRAMS) we receive lakhs of grivances,” a second official said. “The Covid-19 specific ones have been segregated for immediate attention.”CPGRAMS is short for Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System.The department has also received suggestions to extend the lockdown. There have also been bogus claims like discovery of a Covid-19 cure. A person even lodged 54 grievances not related to Covid-19 that the department has noted.The grievances have been collated on a portal on the DARPG website launched by minister of personnel, public grievances and pensions Jitendra Singh on Wednesday. These have further been allocated to each department/ministry for redressal.On the day of the launch, the National Monitoring Dashboard received 43 grievances related to the ministry of health and family welfare, 31 grievances under the ambit of the ministry of external affairs and 26 grievances in the domain of the ministry of finance.“It is the endeavour of the Modi Government to ensure timely redressal of Covid-19 grievances and directions have been issued to all ministries/ departments to prioritize these grievances and provide redressal in a period of three days,” Singh said on Tuesday.“For the remainder of the lockdown, these will be addressed on a priority basis and anyone wishing to lodge a complaint may log on to the website,” the first official said. “After that, they may be merged addressed via the PMO.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-receives-916-complaints-from-citizens/story-8gJuoTBafknk9q2hrGhq4H.html

02-04-2020||India||One list of essential goods for all states||The Centre is in the process of issuing a comprehensive, indicative list of what constitutes essential commodities and services to all states and union territories to iron out supply chains disruptions caused by the lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, an official who serves on an interministerial team overlooking coordination with states said, requesting not to be quoted. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe list aims to bring inter-state parity of what constitutes essentials, the official said. The list of essential items and transportation norms have been found to vary across states, which tends to clog supplies and spark shortages, the official added. Currently, all states have exempted transportation of medical supplies, food, pharmaceutical raw materials, including for masks and sanitisers, and petroleum products from the lockdown, the official explained.However, a review meeting with states showed that some are regulating transportation of supplies according to their own norms which are being enforced by district collectors or magistrates. The review found “bottlenecks” in inter-state coordination. For instance, a state that doesn’t recognize a particular item as an essential item may not allow entry of the item originating in another state. Moreover, inter-state transport permit norms also differ. “To streamline these bottlenecks, an indicative list of essential items and services will be sent out to states. The transport ministry will also take steps to bring uniformity in land transportation norms,” the official said. The government is looking to amend rules to the Essential Commodities Act to streamline supplies.The consumer affairs ministry has held a series of video conferences with heads of civil supplies departments of all states to bring about uniformity in supply of essential items. States have been asked to utilize the Essential Commodities Act to crack down on hoarding and black-marketing and have already been given a free hand to impose maximum retail price caps on any item considered necessary, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-list-of-essential-goods-for-all-states/story-87XRoKWRdvTpCAc3IeNnJO.html
02-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Food, migrants on Government panel agenda||Hassle-free movement of food, diary products, and other essential goods and a close watch on the movement of migrant workers -- these are the main areas where the government’s senior bureaucracy sees need for urgent intervention, as 1.3 billion Indians continue to stay under a federal lockdown. Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed 11 empowered group of secretaries to monitor different aspects of the situation arising out of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) . The groups, empowered to take decisions, meet every day to take stock of the unfolding ground situation. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicDuring their internal discussions on Wednesday, many bureaucrats found several complaints about non-compliance of the government’s order on movement of food and dairy products. According to a senior official who is a member of one of the committees, continued “production and seamless supply of food items right to the neighbourhood level holds the key to the success of the lockdown.”According to a government official, the issue related to the supply of food is significant and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to take it up in in his video conference with state chief ministers scheduled for Thursday. Also Read: Genetic sequencing takes lead in Covid-19 vaccine developmentOn Wednesday, the supply of essential commodities also came up during the video conference between cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba and the chief secretaries of the states. A press release that was issued subsequently said: “The manufacturing of essential goods should be ensured. It should also be ensured that the supply chains of such goods are maintained.”The government also wants to keep a tab on the movement of migrant workers and will ask panchayats to inform local police about the return of any workers in their area or if anyone shows symptoms of the coronavirus disease in the village. The rural development ministry has sent a letter to the states, asking them to involve gram panchayats in the identification of a migrant workers and any anyone showing symptoms.Following the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25, millions of migrant workers sought to rush home -- walking hundreds of kilometres in some cases in the absence of public transport. The panels also discussed several other issues, including the compliance, in different states, of norms issued by the Centre. They will also explore how to widen the use of Corporate Social Responsibility funds in tackling the pandemic. There is also a proposal before the government to further increase the duties on petrol and diesel. “After the duty was hiked a few weeks ago, the price of crude oil in international markets have fallen further. So, a section of the establishment wants to hike the excise appropriately. The final call on this issue will be taken by the finance ministry,”said a secretary-level officer. The government gave itself the width to raise special excise duty by ₹3 per litre on petrol and diesel on March 14 by increasing additional excise duty and special additional excise duty. Former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra said, “I hope these groups are getting feedback from the ground and are not relying entirely on what government officials are feeding them from the states. The government also needs to come up with a plan regarding the crop harvesting season that starts from mid-April.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/food-migrants-on-govt-panel-agenda/story-cLxS4BXdpGg2mpUlBi4pVL.html

The ministry, under its technical textiles arm, is now working with 16 companies, a second official added. “Orders of 3.3 million coveralls and five million N95 masks have been placed with these manufacturers. While 1.9 million masks have come in, the supply of overalls have been slow as it needs more specifications,” the second official said.“Supply of coveralls have just started this week, and less than 500,000 have come in,” the official added. In a release on March 30, the government said the textiles and health ministry have been able to ensure the supplying 6,000-7,000 coveralls per day. “... this is expected to go up to 15,000 per day within the next week,” read the release. The Hindustan latex Limited, under the health ministry, is looking at the procurement of all PPEs including medical equipment like ventilators, while the textile ministry is supplying PPE with textile material. This involves masks, both of N95 and surgical 2/3-ply ones, and coveralls with meltblown material, which is a special kind of polymer. The manufactured product is sent by the ministry to the Coimbatore-based South India Textile Research Association (SITRA) for test specifications. SITRA chairman Prakash Vasudevan told HT that the scarcity of meltblown fabric producers was one of the key reasons for the PPE shortage. “Meltblown material has a general shortage of supply around the world, and the pandemic has made matters worse,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-ropes-in-local-firms-to-boost-supply-of-ppes/story-CjhmYklWwb3EsoYgm4nXNL.html

We have been told the work has already started on converting 5,000 coaches in the first batch. By doing so, India will get at least 80,000 additional isolation beds,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry. Railways minister Piyush Goyal also said in a statement that all the zones will meet the challenge of making these coaches fully ready and equipped at the earliest. “…work on the conversion of first lot of 5,000 coaches has already started in a phased manner.”Also, under the Lifeline Udan initiative of the ministry of civil aviation, 74 flights have been operated to date for transporting medical cargo across the country. A total of 37.63 tonnes of cargo has been transported, of which more than 22 tonnes was transported on March 31.“The flights are helping in transporting medical and essential supplies. The supplies include personal protection equipment, masks etc,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rlys-plans-isolation-quarantine-units-with-80-000-beds/story-O9phSWZIvR7IfaW5d8CBnI.html
02-04-2020||India||India open to foreign donations for PM fund||New Delhi The Indian government has decided to accept contributions from abroad for the Prime Minister’s Citizen Relief and Emergency Situations (PM-CARES) fund ,created to carry out relief efforts in the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak, and similar emergencies in the future. The decision marks a shift from India;s earlier position of refusing foreign donations during crises.People familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity the decision was in line with the unprecedented situation created by the Coronavirus outbreak that has resulted in more than 850,000 infections and around 42,000 deaths worldwide.“The pandemic is unprecedented and when the prime minister spoke to envoys [via video conference on Monday], he asked them to make efforts for contributions towards this fund. A decision has been taken to accept contributions from abroad in the PM-CARES Fund,” said one of the people.The PM-CARES Fund was set up in view of several spontaneous requests from India and abroad for making contributions to support the government’s relief efforts in the wake of Covid-19, the people said.Contributions to the fund can be made by individuals and organisations, both in India and abroad, in view of the expressed interest to contribute to the government’s efforts and keeping in mind the “unprecedented nature” of the pandemic, the people said.In 2018, the government refused all foreign aid, including a reported offer of $100 million from the United Arab Emirates, for disaster relief following floods in Kerala that displaced millions of people. Offers of help from Thailand, Qatar and the Maldives too were declined.This was in line with a long-standing policy put in place after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, and at the time, the external affairs ministry had said in a statement that the “government is committed to meeting the requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts”.The people cited above pointed out that no overseas government had so far come forward to donate to the PM-CARES Fund, which has largely attracted pledges from non-resident Indians (NRIs) and people of Indian origin based in several countries.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has directed the heads of Indian missions around the world to explore the possibility of sourcing medical equipment needed to fight Covid-19 – especially personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, ventilators, and three-ply, surgical and N95 masks – as there is a huge shortage of such products in the country, the people said.In the case of China, some relief materials were coming to India from independent sources as donations while the mission in Beijing is looking at procuring available equipment on a commercial basis, the people said.“The embassy in Beijing is working on this and we are looking at various options and sources,” said a second person. “There is a huge shortage and we will source materials from wherever they are available.”At the same time, domestic companies are being encouraged by the health and textile ministries to ramp up production of PPE and medical equipment, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-open-to-foreign-donations-for-pm-fund/story-JR5MM0AUnIno5y6V7n2bgN.html
02-04-2020||India||Coronavirus outbreak lockdown will affect forecasts: WMO||The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has flagged that lack of meteorological data from commercial aircraft, grounded across the world because of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic will affect the reliability of weather forecasts.In a statement issued on Wednesday, WMO said it is very concerned about the impact of Covid-19 on the quantity and quality of weather observations and atmospheric and climate modelling exercises. In-flight measurements of temperature, wind speed and direction are used both for weather prediction and climate monitoring. Commercial aircraft contribute this data to the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay Programme (AMDAR) of the WMO, which utilises onboard sensors, computers and communications systems to collect, process and transmit weather data to ground stations via satellite or radio.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn several parts of Europe, the decrease in weather observations over the past couple of weeks has been dramatic, WMO said.The AMDAR used to produce over 700000 (7 lakh/0.7 million) high-quality observations per day of air temperature, wind speed and direction. In developed countries, surface based weather systems are all automated but in developing countries most observations are still taken manually, which are already affected by the outbreak. But even for automated systems missing repair, maintenance and supply work will start having an impact if the pandemic lasts a few more weeks, the statement cautioned.India Meteorological Department (IMD) is also impacted by this loss of weather data from aircraft. “This is a worldwide problem. India is no exception. Data from aircraft is very important, no matter where they are flying over the Indian territory. When they land, they send us crucial meteorological data, which is then compiled. We brief them about the forecast before they fly, and when they land, they debrief us. This debrief is used for numerical prediction models, which is further used for weather forecast,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.“The IMD and Ministry of Earth Sciences Network are being operated with hardship but our people are cooperating, so we will continue issuing forecasts and observations based on our own data. There is no disruption in giving information,” added Mohapatra. IMD and state governments have 552 manually operated weather stations, from which data needs to be collected by personnel every three hours. This may be affected later as people will have to be available to collect and compile this data.“The impacts of climate change and growing amount of weather-related disasters continue. The Covid-19 pandemic poses an additional challenge, and may exacerbate multihazard risks at a single country level. Therefore, it is essential that governments pay attention to their national early warning and weather observing capacities despite the Covid-19 crisis,” said WMO Secretary-General, Petteri Taalas.“Meteorological organisations usually use ground observations, satellites, pilot balloons and weather radars on commercial aircraft. Stable weather is expected in the southern hemisphere now and pre-monsoon activity will begin in the tropics. I am hoping the disruption will not cause much of a problem,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, Skymet Weather.“At the present time, the adverse impact of the loss of observations on the quality of weather forecast products is still expected to be relatively modest. However, as the decrease in availability of aircraft, weather observations continues and expands, we may expect a gradual decrease in reliability of the forecasts,” said Lars Peter Riishojgaard, Director, Earth System Branch in WMO’s Infrastructure Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/outbreak-lockdown-will-affect-forecasts-wmo/story-0cFa3p8RCACco1m5gkDMEK.html
02-04-2020||India||Lockdown offers best time to study soil, seismic activity||This is possibly the best time to monitor and study seismic events like the detection of small earthquakes as many parts of the world are in lockdown. The transient seismic “noise” from vehicles, trains, metros, construction work etc which used to mask the sound of seismic activity beneath the soil is now reduced greatly, according to analysis by seismologists.The Royal Observatory of Belgium tweeted on March 20: “The earth continues shaking. Ground movements at frequencies 1-20 Hz, mainly due to human activity (cars, trains, industries,...) are much lower since the implementation of the containment measures by the government.” Thomas Lecocq, a seismologist from the Royal Observatory of Belgium, who is studying the changes in seismic noise due to the lockdown, tweeted on March 27 that mean noise level was 33% lower since stay-at-home orders were issued in Belgium. Our staff is teleworking. The earth continues shaking. Ground movements at frequencies 1-20 Hz, mainly due to human activity (cars, trains, industries,...) are much lower since the implementation of the containment measures by the government. #StayHome @ibzbe @CrisiscenterBE pic.twitter.com/pGgQAyLuUP“This is probably the best time for scientists like me to study soil structure and natural waves because there is little transient noise being recorded by our monitors. It will help understand a particular site and conduct hazard assessments,” said AP Pandey, seismologist at National Centre for Seismology under the Ministry of Earth Sciences. But India has not analysed seismic noise reduction because of the lockdown yet.Nature journal reported on the observations of seismologists on Tuesday. “If lockdowns continue in the coming months, city-based detectors around the world might be better than usual at detecting the locations of earthquake aftershocks,” Andy Frassetto, a seismologist at the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology in Washington DC was quoted as saying in the report by Nature.Stephen Hicks, Faculty of Engineering, Department of Earth Science & Engineering at the Imperial College, London, also tweeted on March 27 about how a seismometer saw the UK lockdown. Data from the British Geological Survey’s station suggests a reduction in average daytime background seismic noise because of much reduced traffic on roads. There are similar tweets from seismologists in other parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-effect-best-time-to-study-soil-seismic-activity/story-ChyVxpwsV4AyPhOa6zlCQM.html
02-04-2020||India||Congress slams Centre over PPE Serbia export amid shortage||New Delhi: The Congress on Wednesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the export of 90 tonnes of personal protective equipment (PPE) to Serbia at a time when India’s health workers are struggling to get their necessary supply amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“What is this happening Mr Prime Minister Narendra Modi? While Frontline Indian Health workers are struggling for protective equipment we are supplying Serbia. Air India to fly out Germans and 90 tonnes of Protective Medical Equipment to Serbia. Are we nuts? This is CRIMINAL,” Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari tweeted.People familiar with developments said an assessment by the commerce and external affairs ministries concluded the equipment sent to Serbia – 3.5 million pairs of surgical gloves sold by a Kerala-based private company – was not on the list of medical gear whose export is prohibited.At the Congress’ news briefing through video conference, Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill hit out at the government on the issue. He alleged that when doctors and nurses across the country are crying for better equipment, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government was exporting PPE to Serbia.Shergill attacked the government for using Air India to fly out German nationals when Indian migrant labourers are dying on the roads.“This is heartless, shameless and brainless behaviour of the BJP government,” he alleged.On March 29, the official Twitter handle of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Serbia said a Boeing 747 had arrived in Belgrade with 90 tonnes of medical protective equipment from India.“The transportation of valuable supplies purchased by @SerbianGov has been fully funded by the #EU while @UNDPSerbia organized the flight & ensured the fastest possible delivery,” it tweeted.The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the guidelines regarding medical equipment whose export is prohibited are very clear. “The restricted items can be exported on a case-by-case basis with the approval of the DGFT [Director General of Foreign Trade],” said a person.Notifications issued by the DGFT on Feb 25 and March 19 state the exports of surgical and disposable masks, ventilators, and textiles and raw materials for masks and overalls are prohibited. Other equipment such as gloves, non-woven shoe covers and gas masks with chemical absorbents can be exported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-slams-centre-over-ppe-serbia-export-amid-shortage/story-EgTc47BdCN0iTOshjFbppJ.html
02-04-2020||India||Genetic sequencing takes lead in Covid-19 vaccine development||In the race to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), scientists around the world are simultaneously using multiple vaccine-development platforms, with DNA- and RNA-based platforms taking the lead because of their potential for speed.RNA and DNA are fragments of genetic material . The genome of the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, was sequenced and shared by China in early January. Since then, several countries, including India, have sequenced the virus. These genetic sequences are used to grow the live virus and study its behaviour, including how it enters human cells and causes disease -- information critical in developing drugs and vaccines to fight it.Work on the Covid-19 vaccine began soon after the first genetic sequence was available, and Moderna’s mRNA-based Sars-CoV-2 candidate entered a phase-1 trial (to test safety and dosage in healthy volunteers) on March 16. A non-replicating vector-based vaccine has also received regulatory clearance to start phase 1 studies in China, while approvals of for phase 1 trials of nucleic-acid vaccines are expected in April.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAlso Read: ‘Biggest challenge is fighting stigma’: Dr. Harsh Vardhan“The speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,” says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), a non-profit supporting development of vaccines against five epidemic pathogens on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority list, in a statement.Despite the optimism, a Covid-19 vaccine is at least 18 months away. “There are candidate vaccines that are emerging all over the world. I’ve watched vaccine development on other atypical viruses, and I don’t want anybody to believe that we will have a vaccine within a month or two,” said Dr David Nabarro, one of the six World Health Organisation special envoys on Covid-19.“Any vaccine development requires a lot of testing for to establish it’s efficacious and safe, we need to make sure countries licence the vaccine through proper procedure. They then need to get a massive build up in manufacturing capacity and have a system to ensure that those who need the vaccine the most get it first. So we really have to recognise it’s an 18-month delay; we should not anticipate (it) quicker,” said Dr Nabarro.Vaccine development is an expensive process with high failure rates, with developers following a linear sequence of steps that include massive data analysis and manufacturing-process checks. To develop a vaccine quickly, carries higher financial risk as it requires a fast start and many steps executed in parallel before confirming a successful outcome, according to a new paper in New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). For example, for platforms that have been tested in humans, phase 1 clinical trials may be able to proceed in parallel with animal testing.“The use of reverse genetics and next-generation sequencing is used to shorten the time taken for development, compared to conventional vaccines. In the case of coronaviruses, the virus’s spike protein is a promising immunogen for protection and optimising antigen design to optimise immune response,” said Dr N K Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research.According to the study, preclinical experience with vaccine candidates for other coronaviruses, such as the ones causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and middle-east respiratory syndrome (Mers), have raised concerns about exacerbating lung disease, either directly or as a result of antibody-dependent enhancement.“Since the adverse effects could be because of type-2 helper T-cell (Th2) response, vigorous animal testing and clinical trials to establish safety, dosage and adverse-effects in humans cannot be neglected. Given that Covid-19 will infect millions, there can be no compromise in data quality and regulatory reviews,” said Dr Ganguly. Th1 cells generate immune responses against intracellular parasites, such as bacteria and viruses, while Th2 cells work against helminths (parasitic worms), infections from which are very common in Asia and Africa.Also Read: Kerala to Punjab, places that became epicentre of coronavirus infectionLessons from vaccine development against H1N1 influenza, Ebola, and Zika, are guiding scientists. The H1N1 influenza vaccine was developed fairly quickly because influenza-vaccine technology is well developed and vaccines made using egg- and cell-based platforms could be licenced rapidly under the rules for strain changes in influenza viruses. The vaccine is now part of the commercially available seasonal influenza vaccines.Vaccine and biotech companies are now investing in development-and-manufacturing platforms that can be adapted for new pathogens. The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is supporting early development and test of platforms against prototype viruses from different viral families.Moving beyond phase 2 trials for monitoring efficacy and side-effects would also need scaling up manufacturing to commercial levels before substantial safety and immunogenicity data are available, which means if the vaccine fails, the investment in manufacturing will be wasted. “It’s therefore critical that vaccines also be developed using tried-and-true methods, even if they may take longer to enter clinical trials or to result in large numbers of doses,” said the NEJM article.Cepi also supports development of platform technologies to prepare for Disease X, the yet unnamed next big emerging epidemic disease, such as Covid-19. “An ideal platform would support development from viral sequencing to clinical trials in less than 16 weeks, demonstrate elicitation of consistent immune responses across pathogens, and be suitable for large-scale manufacturing using a pathogen-agnostic platform,” according to NEJM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/genetic-sequencing-takes-lead-in-covid-19-vaccine-development/story-A4mjutfeefKjkSeGeM8NCL.html
02-04-2020||India||South Korea church was first religious hot spot||On February 18, a 61-year-old South Korean woman associated with a religious group in the city of Daegu tested positive for the coronavirus disease Covid-19 – becoming the country’s 31st patient. Before she was isolated, she was part of a congregation with an estimated 1,000 group members at the Shincheonji church. In less than a month, as South Korea’s cases rose from 50 to close to 8,000, officials estimated at least 60% of these – around 4,300 -- were linked to the group.Also Read: Covid-19 update: Markaz trail widens; cases hit 2,000India’s biggest source of Covid-19 infections – the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area – now bears a striking resemblance to what happened in South Korea, and if social contact patterns of the preachers and the members pan out in a similar manner, the number of people infected in the vicinity could balloon to thousands.But the Shincheonji cluster and the city of Daegu now also offer the biggest lesson for India. South Korea launched a widespread testing programme in the city and the mayor and the head of the disease outbreak response steered a programme to identify what would later turn out to be 10,000 members of the group. “We used dorms and similar facilities to set up 5,500 hospital beds,” Min Pok-kee, who heads the response in Daegu, told Wired in an interview on March 26. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe mass mobilisation to round up and isolate the group members helped Daegu reduce transmission, going from the province with the highest share of cluster infections to the third-highest by April 1.“In Daegu, we had more than 10,000 members of Shincheonji. When we tested those who were symptomatic, 87.5 percent turned out to be positive. When we tested a sample of people who weren’t symptomatic, it was 74.4 per cent,” Pok-kee said in the interview, adding: “If we hadn’t done it from the very beginning, we’d be where the US is now, where Italy is now.”The Shincheonji group and the Tablighi Jamaat are not the only instances where religious gatherings have acted as super-spreaders of the disease. In Singapore, the health ministry linked three churches to 38 of the country’s confirmed cases when total infections were at a mere 313 around March 14. On April 1, the country had over 900 cases.In India itself, a 70-year-old Sikh religious leader in Punjab returned from Italy and went preaching in several villages, leading to at least 28 more infections.

02-04-2020||India||Cabinet secretary tells states to trace Jamaat attendees on ‘war footing’||Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba on Wednesday directed all state governments to, on a “war footing” trace all the people who came in contact with participants in the Tablighi Jamaat’s congregation last month in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin, which has become the country’s biggest coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hotspot.Gauba informed all state chief secretaries and director generals of police (DGPs) in a video-conference that the unfettered travel of Tablighi Jamaat followers to various parts of India after the congregation has put at risk the government’s efforts o contain the virus. At he meeting, the central government’s top civil servant also asked state police forces to take action against foreigners who participated in the congregation as well as the organizers of the event for violating visa conditions. Many of the foreign participants came into India on a tourist visa, while they should have ideally come in on a religious missionary visa. Gauba’s directive comes as the Centre strives to ensure the success of the three-week lockdown of India aimed at breaking the chain of transmission of the rapidly spreading virus. The effort is to trace and isolate the people who may have come in contacts with the thousands of Jamaat followers who attended the congregation and then fanned out across the country.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAccording to estimates by Delhi Police and the Intelligence Bureau, around 6,500 to 7,000 people, including at least over 300 foreigners, attended the congregation in rotation at Markaz Nizamuddin , the headquarters of the Islamic missionary organisation, starting on March 10, an official who didn’t wish to be named said. The main event concluded on March 15, but followers of the sect came calling at the headquarters until March 23. The ministry of home affairs, after initial cases of Covid-19 from among the congregants were recorded, issued an advisory to the states on March 28 in which it mentioned that an estimated 2,000 foreigners from 70 countries, who came to India on tourist visas, spread out across India for the Tablighi Jamaat’s religious work over five-six weeks. A majority of the foreigners belonged to Bangladesh (493), Indonesia (472), Malaysia (150) and Thailand (142). Central agencies are now tracing how many more among these 2,000 foreigners came to Delhi or travelled back and forth to different states.The Delhi government and police have stated that the sect had been warned against holding the congregation and had been asked to vacate the Markaz building.The Tablighi Jamaat participants, who violated the tourist visa norms by travelling across India on religious activities after arriving in the country on tourist visas, are now being treated as biggest carriers of the Coronavirus in India. For example, in Andhra Pradesh alone, a third of the Covid-19 patients were those who attended the congregation.The government also recently asked all its missions abroad to stop giving tourist visas to any foreigner in future “who is likely to use it for Tablighi activities”. Gauba also asked the states to implement the Prime Minister’s Garib Kalyan Yojana,aimed at providing benefits to the poor for loss of work because of the national lockdown, within a week. “This will involve large cash transfer to beneficiaries. It should be organized in a staggered manner to ensure social distance,” said a statement fro the Press Information Bureau (PIB).The cabinet secretary also directed the states to coordinate and manage the movement of migrant workers in ensuring lockdown measures. The meeting noted that the lockdown was being implemented effectively all over the country. The states were asked to ensure that interstate movement of goods was allowed without any hindrance while maintaining social distance.Gauba also asked the officials to ensure that manufacturing of essential goods and supply chains of such goods were maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-secy-tells-states-to-trace-jamaat-attendees-on-war-footing/story-UwDqknZMri1qOd2uX1pBAO.html

Saad received his early education from his father and he went on to get degrees from prominent Islamic seminary Darul Uloom in Deoband. He also studied at a Delhi seminary, his family in Kandhla said.Saad has an ancestral house in Kandhla’s Maulvian locality. A relative of Saad, Maulana Badrul Hasan, claimed 14-century ruler Muhammad Bin Tughlaq had gifted their family a tract of land in the town in Shamli district.Hasan called Saad a cult figure, who maintains a low profile during his regular visits to his hometown. “Within no time, big crowds gather to meet him. Therefore, he avoids meeting people here to stay in peace for a day or two,” said Hasan.The Delhi police on Wednesday said Saad has been the run since a case was registered against him for flouting social distancing and allowing a gathering at the Jamaat headquarters in Delhi. Officials across the country have been trying to trace the people who attended the gathering at the headquarters that later emerged as an infection hotspot.Shamli police superintendent Vineet Jaiswal said he had no information about Saad’s presence in Kandhalvi.Hasan said Saad usually stays at Jamaat’s Nizamuddin centre in New Delhi and visits Kandhla for a day or two every month. He denied reports of his presence in Kandhla. Hasan insisted Saad is not a fugitive as suggested by a section of the media. He added Saad is in Delhi and supports every action and order of the government.Hasan said Saad and other organisers of the gathering are yet to receive a copy of the First Information Repot lodged against him  He called for an end to Saad’s media trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kin-call-jamaat-chief-cult-figure-with-low-profile/story-gSVqrRG54sjihelY4v8kDJ.html

Samples of as many as 143 of them have so far been taken for testing while 800 have been screened.Health and family welfare department principal secretary Jawaid Akhtar said the department had received the list of the 1,500 people from the Centre. “Of them, 800 have been identified and the 143 who were symptomatic have undergone tests. We expect the results to start coming in from tomorrow. Efforts are on to trace the rest of the people who attended the meeting.”Akhtar has issued an appeal asking all those who participated in the Jamaat’s Delhi congregation to voluntarily get in touch with the department. He added the 800 will be in public quarantine and after 14 days would be put under home quarantine. “We are in the process of collecting travel history of all these people.”Officials said the 1,500 belong to all the 30 districts of the state, where nine more people tested positive for Covid-on Wednesday.In Andhra Pradesh, two people, who attended the Jamaat event, have been quarantined along with their family members. Both of them belong to Krishna district. “It has been found that many of those who went to Delhi Markaz [centre] and returned are testing positive for coronavirus,” said Nandigama deputy police superintendent GV Ramana Murthy. “Tests have been performed but the results are pending.”Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy appealed to all those who had attended the Delhi gathering to get tested voluntarily.In Puducherry, two people, who attended the Jamaat event, tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday while seven others were under observation. Chief minister V Narayanasamy appealed to all those, who took part in the meet, to volunteer themselves for screening.As many as 21 people from Puducherry had attended the congregation last month, and only nine returned to the Union territory.Health and family welfare director Mohan Kumar said the two had been admitted to a government hospital and undergone tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/800-in-karnataka-to-go-under-quarantine-two-identified-in-andhra/story-EYRxmR3nVE2WvNY7xOgyHJ.html
02-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Highest single-day spike in Tamil Nadu, all 110 attended Jamaat||Tamil Nadu on Wednesday recorded a spike of over 110 fresh cases of Covid-19 all of whom had attended the Tablighi Jamaat religious conference held in the densely populated area of Nizamuddin in New Delhi in the middle of March. This is the highest number of new cases recorded in Tamil Nadu in a single day so far. The state now has 234 positive Covid-19 cases, of which 190 are related to the religious conference, which is now being treated as the largest cluster in the country as several states scramble to contain, identify and treat the attendees.Wednesday’s fresh cases are spread out across 19 districts including Chennai, Coimbatore and Dindigul, among others.Till Wednesday, the state had traced 1103 conference attendees and all of them are in isolation wards in their respective districts, Tamil Nadu health secretary Dr Beela Rajesh said. Close to 1500 persons from Tamil Nadu are believed to have attended the religious conference, of whom over 1130 people are believed to have returned to the state. Till Tuesday, the state had traced and tested 515 persons. In the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, over 580 persons came forward following the government’s appeal asking attendees to get themselves tested, raising the total number of those traced to 1103.“Through the night we have also been testing and admitting people who are coming in,” Rajesh said. In all, the state had tested 658 persons till Wednesday evening. Officials said that all 1103 persons would be tested by Thursday.“We have seen a spike of cases over the last two days to prepare ourselves, the state is building capacity accordingly,” Rajesh said on Wednesday.The state has rolled out a containment plan which involves contact tracing the attendees of the conference, their family members, and their primary contacts, all of whom will be investigated and tested. Health workers have been instructed to conduct door-to-door surveillance of the attendees’ families across several districts in the state. The district authorities have also been instructed to cordon off a 7-8 km radius area around the attendees’ homes, where movement will be restricted. “This plan will come into effect not just for those who tested positive, but whoever participated in this conference. It is already under process by district administration,” Rajesh said adding, “The good thing is today is the eighth day of the lockdown so several of these people were already at home.” At least 300 persons from the state, who attended the conference are believed to be in quarantine in New Delhi.The Hindustan Times spoke to a Jamaat attendee who is under quarantine in the national Capital, and who did not wish to give out his name. He said that the result for his Covid-19 test had come out negative.“I reached Delhi around March 20 and even then several people were coming to the gathering (in Nizammudin). That weekend at an event, we heard that transport was going to be restricted so those who had money left immediately,” he said. “We followed all instructions in quarantine and made sure that the senior citizens or those who had ailments like diabetes among us got help first.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-single-day-spike-in-tn-all-110-attended-jamaat/story-u3IQ7mMYXAmSRZ6Wpzoo6L.html
02-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: States scramble to map trail of 8,700 Jamaat attendees||State governments identified on Wednesday nearly 8,700 people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi and deployed a large posse of police and intelligence officers and anti-terror personnel to trace anyone who attended the event that has emerged as the country’s biggest Covid-19 hotspot. All of them, including the son of a Jharkhand minister, have been quarantined.Data from the Union health ministry showed that 154 of the 356 new cases of infection reported on Wednesday -- -- or nearly 43% -- were people who attended the event held in Delhi’s Nizamuddin. So far, seven of the attendees --- six in Telangana and one in Kashmir --- have died. The Centre has sounded a nationwide alert and asked police in states to trace all people who attended the congregation and get them tested for Covid-19.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWednesday was the second day of tracking attendees but top officials said they expected the number of people linked to the event to rise in the coming days as many people who attended the weeks-long event came back to their homes in the first week of March. In some states like Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, members of the Jamaat attended the summit on a weekly rotational basis, officials said. “Entire Muslim dominated areas are being scanned,” said a Bihar government official, who was not willing to be named. Across states, officials scanned all local mosques and directed heads of gram panchayats to provide information about the attendees who haven’t contacted the authorities. The biggest jump was reported in Haryana, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Officials In Haryana and Rajasthan, most of the 503 and 524 attendees identified, respectively, hailed from the Mewat region, which begins at the edge of the national capital region and comprises parts of Haryana and Rajasthan. Police officers in the two states said they were trying to find out whether some of the attendees were foreigners. “If they turn out to be foreigners, the persons who provided them lodging will be booked for violating the orders asking people to inform presence of foreigners,” said a senior Rajasthan police officer on condition of anonymity. Haryana home secretary Vijai Vardhan said the entire Mewat region was being scanned with the help of Rajasthan government. In Himachal Pradesh, the state government released a list of 840 persons who travelled to Nizamuddin but it was not immediately known how many of them attended the Jamaat event. On Tuesday, the figure was 17. In Maharashtra, authorities identified over 300 persons and in Gujarat, officials named 72 people who attended the congregation. All of them have been quarantined and their swabs have been taken for Covid-19 tests. In Uttar Pradesh, the police identified 569 Jamaat members who attended the Nizamuddin meeting in March, said additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi. In Uttarakhand, 230 attendees were identified. Awasthi said the police were also searching for 218 foreign nationals, who had come to participate in the congregation in Delhi and were staying in different places across Uttar Pradesh. Awasthi said they were also looking whether the foreigners violated visa norms, which prohibits persons coming on tourist visa to visit a religious function. In Andhra Pradesh, as many as 812 people were identified as having direct and indirect links with the Jamaat meeting . In Telangana, the government identified 1,030 persons who had attended the event. Officials in the two states said their health conditions are being monitored. In Assam, all 13 Covid-19 patients had attended the congregation. Of the 547 attendees, 230 have been traced, said health minister Himata Biswa Sarma, appealing to the attendees to voluntarily contact local health authorities.In Bihar, where only 86 attendees, apart from 57 foreign nationals, have been tracked, the government asked the state’s anti-terror squad and district police to look for the returnees. “Those who attended the religious gathering at Nizamuddin will be traced. We are coordinating with other states to trace them,” said Bihar police chief Gupteshwar Pandey. In neighbouring Jharkhand, Mohammad Tanveer, the son of Jharkhand minister Haji Hussain Ansari, was among the 37 people who attended the event. Tanveer is now in quarantine. “The minister’s son Md Tanveer and one another have been sent to quarantine run by the administration. Their samples had been taken and sent for testing for Covid-19. They are fully cooperating with the administration,” Deoghar SP NK Singh said, Ansari, however, said his son had not gone to Delhi since 1993 when he studied there.

02-04-2020||India||Kerala to Punjab, places that became epicentre of coronavirus infection||Almost half of the coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab have been traced to areas spread over a few kilometers, with these hot spots accounting for 226, or about 14%, of the infections in India so far, according to an analysis of the numbers. INDOREMadhya Pradesh has so far reported 86 Covid-19 cases and almost 50% of them, 63, are from Indore, which has for two years been ranked as India’s cleanest city by Central government. Of the 63, 43 cases have been reported within the last three days. Indore is Madhya Pradesh’s most populous city with a population of around two million. Most of the cases in Indore been reported from congested neighbourhoods such as Ranipura, Nayapura, Daulatganj, Hathipala, Chandan Nagar and Khajrana, where maintaining social distancing is a challenge.A health official said about 50,000 people from these localities are being monitored. “More than 650 have already been quarantined while the process is going on to identify others with Covid-19 symptoms,” he said on condition of anonymity.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIndore district collector, Manish Singh, said it is challenging to conduct surveillance in such areas but that the administration has deployed at least 500 people for the purpose. “We fear a further increase in cases once more Covid-19 test resukts come,” he said. He added that swab test results of about 285 people are awaited.Only two of the those who tested positive in Indore had a history of foreign travel.

Of the four, three belong to a jeweller’s family, which had visited Dubai. The fourth Covid-19 positive patient had returned from Germany. Four more Covid-19 patients in Jabalpur are the jeweller’s employees.KASARAGOD In Kerala, of the 241 Covid-19 cases, 128 have been reported from Kasaragod in the northern part of the state with a population of 1.3 million. The region has a poor doctor-population ratio of 1: 1500, as against 1: 300 in rest of the state. Experts said Kasaragod is home to a large number of expatriates living in West Asia and added that slack surveillance and poor medical infrastructure has led to such a large number of cases.An alleged smuggler jumped quarantine and transmitted the disease to many in the city. After his case came to light, customs officials found he had made 14 trips to West Asia over three months. Officials said at least 8,000 people have returned to Kasargod from West Asia since February 15 and were put under home quarantine. But many violated the quarantine restrictions and aggravated the situation. Also Read: ‘Biggest challenge is fighting stigma’: Dr. Harsh VardhanThe officials said out of 128 cases in the area, 90 were of those who returned from West Asia or had come in contact with them. A few patients have no travel history or any direct contact with the returnees and officials said this is a cause for worry. The district is under a complete lockdown and two top government officials are camping in the region to ensure there is no community spread.“We literally pleaded with foreign returnees to remain in their homes for at least 3-4 weeks. Many followed our advice but some flouted it and the district is paying a heavy price. We are fighting with all our might to contain the spread,” said Kerala minister E Chandrasekharan, who belongs to the district.SBS NAGAR Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar in Punjab accounts for about 45% of the total Covid-19 cases in the state. Most of these cases have been reported from 15 villages and been linked to a religious preacher, who returned from Germany via Italy on March 7 along with two other people.Officials said the preacher, who held meetings in 15 villages and spread the disease, died on March 19. His test was conduced following his death. The other two have also tested positive for the disease and are now in isolation.Officials have put about 1,000 people in government quarantine facilities in the area. Deputy commissioner Vinay Bublani said 361 samples of suspected Covid-19 cases have been taken across the 15 villages and that 19 of them have tested positive. He added that 14 of them are the preacher’s family members and include his two year-old grandson. “No patient has been found positive over past five days. We are hopeful that we will shed this tag of being a hot spot,” he said.Also Read: 800 Jamaat attendees in Karnataka to be quarantined, 2 identified in AndhraBHILWARA In Rajasthan’s textile city, Bhilwara, where two doctors are among those infected, the disease has spread to another 25 people and necessitated a massive screening exercise in a district with a population of 2.8 million. A curfew has also been imposed in the district.The doctors tested positive for the virus on March 19 and are undergoing treatment. “One doctor is a general physician and the other was ICU [intensive care unit] in charge. They were unwell since March 11 or 12 and were still working,” said district collector Rajendra Bhatt, who has deployed over 1,000 personnel for contact tracing. Curfew was lifted on Monday in Bhilwara town as no new cases were reported.Till Monday, Bhilwara contributed to about half of the 51 cases in Rajasthan.

02-04-2020||India||Goods trucks seek extension on payment of road tax, GST||Trucks carrying goods have sought government intervention for extending the due date of payment of road tax and GST to September 30 amid growing concerns of penalizing truck drivers during the lockdown period. “After the Centre relaxed norms on expired national permits we have also requested the government to grant extension on payment of road tax. The issue of e-way bill expiry is yet to be resolved. There is a growing concern of overzealous personnel extorting and penalizing truckers once the trucks start moving. Other concerns about, insurance premium, goods tax, road tax etc. too needs to be addressed urgently. On an average we are facing a loss of Rs 2000 crore per day,” Kultaran Singh Atwal, president All India Motor Transport Congress said. Under GST, transporters have to carry an e-way bill for movement of goods.“More than 85% of the trucking population is of small operators having one to five trucks and once their wheels stop moving there is no other source of income for them. In the ongoing lockdown, there is no business or revenue inflow to the transporter. Given the present critical situation of the trade, the poor truckers and transporters are devastated and the situation has been further aggravated by the lockdown due to the coronavirus crisis. It will be very difficult for them to pay road tax, goods tax or token tax till September 30,” a letter written to Union Minister for Road Transport and highways Nitin Gadakri by the apex body of registered goods trucks said. Transport associations have also raised concerns with the ministry of road transport and highways alleging non-compliance of the ministry of home affair’s order to all states allowing transport of both essential and non-essential goods. “MHA’s order has not percolated to the ground level even though operators want their vehicles to move. Trucks are still being stopped at various state borders and many complaints of vehicles being stopped have come from states like Delhi, UP and Haryana. We are also getting reports of consignors pushing transporters to move fresh loads. There is no staff left, no labour, traders, factories and workshops are also closed, and the drivers have no facilities for eating or basic shelter,” Singh said. The transport ministry has also discussed the issue of the logjam across highways with lakhs of trucks stranded as movement has been stalled since the lockdown, with the home ministry. The lockdown left nearly six lakh cargo carrying trucks stranded across the country. The home ministry on March 29 had allowed transportation of all goods, without distinction of essential and non-essential items during the lockdown period.In a clarification issued on March 29, Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla had said the changes have been incorporated as addendum in the consolidated guidelines issued under the Disaster Management Act five days ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goods-trucks-seek-extension-on-payment-of-road-tax-gst/story-juBmLDA3hZMI43L4v8a8XM.html
02-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: 36-hour operation to evacuate 2,346 Jamaat attendees||Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area and two lanes leading to it were sealed on Wednesday as 2,346 people were rescued from there in India’s biggest coronavirus (Covid-19)-related rescue operation so far that lasted 36 hours. The evacuees were sent to quarantine centres and hospitals even as officials across the country scrambled to identify, trace and isolate the people, who, this month, attended a congregation at the headquarters that has emerged as the country’s biggest source of Covid-19 infections and has been linked to at least 10 deaths. “A total of 536 symptomatic people, out of all those who were brought out of Markaz [headquarters], have been admitted to hospitals. Besides, 1,810 asymptomatic people have been put in quarantine facilities. So, a total of 2,346 have been brought out of Markaz,” said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicDelhi’s Health services department director general, Dr Nutan Mundeja, said the asymptomatic people will be tested for Covid-19 if necessary. “As of now tests have not been conducted on those being quarantined. But, in all likelihood, we will conduct a few in the days to come. No specific decision on this has been taken as of now.”Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia thanked the people involved in the evacuation--the medical staff, administration, police, Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC)--who put their lives at risk for the operation. “Heartfelt gratitude to all of them,” he saidDTC officials said they deployed around 25 buses for the evacuation and each bus made at least two trips. A DTC official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said people were brought out of the building in batches of 30-35. “They were screened for their body temperatures and then taken to hospitals or quarantine centres in DTC buses. The [bus] drivers wore protective suits. No conductors were deployed since health officials were escorting them.”By 1 pm on Wednesday, workers wearing decontamination suits sanitised the building, the plants outside and the path the evacuees had walked. Dr Vivekanand Bhagat, a deputy health officer who supervised the work, said it took them around two hours to sanitise the building that stands on a 1,000 square yard plot.Harish Kumar, a sanitation worker, said they sprayed every corner of the building even as parts of it were damp due to the absence of sunlight. “Usually the surfaces we have been spraying all these days were dry. So we do not know how effective the disinfectants would be.”Kumar said there are mostly large halls in the building with beddings spread out. “Rows and rows of mattresses were spread out in the halls and floor after floor.”A health official involved in the evacuation process, who did not wish to be named, said the Delhi government ordered the closure of cinemas on March 12, saying they do not get sunlight and people sit in close proximity for long hours there. “The scene inside the Markaz was exactly the same. Despite being aware of the outbreak, there was no social distancing practised inside,” he said.The Delhi Police on Tuesday filed a case against the Jamaat functionaries for flouting social distancing rules formulated to check the spread of the pandemic.Tauseef Khan, a lawyer representing the Jamaat, said social distancing inside was not possible and that is why Markaz functionaries repeatedly urged the government for help once the three-week national lockdown was announced on March 25 and hundreds of people were stuck in the building. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation continued sanitising operations in Nizamuddin Basti, Nizamuddin West and other areas adjoining the Jamaat headquarters on Wednesday. A team of 40 people, with sodium hypochlorite (a disinfectant) on shoulder-mounted knapsack pumps and three tractor-driven tankers, sanitised the area.Another team, comprising over 50 people, have been tasked with keeping the area clean by sweeping and collecting garbage. Civic officials said they have sprayed at least 60,000 litres of disinfectants in the entire area.A police station near the building, too, has been sanitised. “Some of us have taken the road on which the Markaz is located as part of our policing duty. We were also actively involved in the evacuation process. We know the threat that we exposed ourselves to, but this is part of our job,” said a policeman. Delhi health department officials said of the 536 hospitalised evacuees, over 200 are in Lok Nayak, some 130 in Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital and 100 in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jhajjar. The rest have been admitted to the Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Guru Teg Bahadur hospitals.AIIMS, Jhajjar, was on Tuesday authorised to treat Covid-19 patients. An order to this effect was issued late last night as the authorities feared a surge in the number of infections following the discovery of the Nizamuddin infection hot spot. The five dedicated Covid-19 centres now have at least 5,850 beds for coronavirus patients.At least 1,810 people have been sent to the government’s quarantine centres in Railway Colony, Tughlaqabad, and the flats of New Delhi Municipal Council at Bakkarwala. Around 1,000 people were initially believed to have been at the Markaz.Delhi had 152 Covid-19 cases till Wednesday night. Out of them, 53 were traced to Nizamuddin. Teams of civil defence volunteers and health officials were on Wednesday involved in contact tracing as the authorities started advising home quarantine for those suspected to have had any contacts with the Markaz. Officials have put up ‘under home quarantine’ posters outside some houses in the Nizamuddin West area. They did not give any number for the people advised home quarantine in the area.Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal separately held a review meeting with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Sisodia and all the district magistrates. “He has issued directions to utilise fire brigades to disinfect Nizamuddin and Dilshad Garden, both of which are top coronavirus hot spots,” said an official, who attended the meeting via video conferencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-outbreak-two-lanes-leading-to-tablighi-jamaat-headquarters-in-nizamuddin-sealed/story-CDRSawMSngagRAVV88PyQI.html
02-04-2020||India||Covid-19 outbreak: Some patients hid during checks at Markaz, says Police||Tablighi Jamaat head Maulana Saad, who has been booked for defying restrictions on public gatherings, concealed crucial information on the number and the health condition of those inside the Islamic missionary group’s headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, which has emerged as a hot spot driving up the tally of Covid-19 cases in India, according to multiple police and government officials.On March 25, when a joint team of police and health officials went inside for the first time, people in the six-storey building hid in bathrooms, concealed symptoms of the contagious disease even as some took medicines to reduce their body temperature, a senior police officer said on the condition of anonymity.This officer also said the Jamaat management lied about the size of the gathering, putting the number of people present between 800 and 1,000. The joint team of police, health workers, and the World Health Organization has evacuated 2,346 people, including at least 250 foreigners, from the building in a 50-hour operation till Wednesday morning. They have been sent to quarantine centres and hospitals.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicSaad and six other top functionaries of the group were booked on Tuesday after the Jamaat headquarters emerged as the single-biggest source of Covid-19 infections in the country. By Wednesday evening, the headquarters, also known as Markaz, was linked, directly and indirectly, to at least 283 infections and eight deaths.States have been instructed by the cabinet secretary to trace the thousands of attendees of the March event organised by the Jamaat. Over 500 people who were at the headquarters have shown Covid-19 symptoms.The Centre has separately begun the process of blacklisting about 250 foreigners who attended the congregation, allegedly flouting visa rules by claiming to be tourists. Ideally, they should have applied for a religious missionary visa.Amid reports of Saad going missing, another senior officer of the Delhi Police’s crime branch said: “I am not sure if you can say he is absconding. He [Saad] is not at the Markaz. He is also not at any hospital or quarantine facility. We have just started the probe...The police were busy clearing the site and getting it sanitised while also identifying others who may have been infected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus [which causes Covid-19].”Fuzail Ayyubi, the legal counsel of Jamaat, said Saad was in Delhi, and denied allegations of concealing information. “... [He] will join the investigation when police summon him. We got to know about the FIR from the media reports. The allegation of concealing information is wrong because between March 25 and 28, the police and health teams came inside and took several pilgrims.”Between March 25 (the day a three-week, nationwide lockdown was imposed) and March 28, officials evacuated 39 people showing symptoms of the infection and sent them to hospitals.A third police officer, who too spoke on the condition of anonymity, said until the night of March 28, Jamaat members tried to hide from health workers who were allowed inside the building.“The health authorities found about 40 cases of people showing symptoms till then (March 25-28). Nobody volunteered to take the test. Most of the persons who had symptoms were hiding in the rooms above. Some of them had taken medicines to reduce fever. The actual number of people with symptoms was likely over 500. When we realised that they were not cooperating, we decided to visit each room to find those people on the morning of March 29. The main process of evacuation started then,” this officer said. Officials also said they were seeking to interrogate Saad over an audio recording (mentioned in the FIR filed on Tuesday) in which he is purportedly heard asking his followers to flout social distancing guidelines. Jamaat counsel Ayyubi, however, said the allegation about the audio tape was “completely misplaced”.“Before the lockdown, they [Jamaat management] should have sent back the visitors. Instead of making arrangements, the head [Saad] wilfully misled the gathering and asked them to stay put. The case against him and others has been registered under sections of criminal conspiracy and the Epidemic Diseases Act,” the third police officer said.Investigators said Saad allegedly ignored the government’s March 13 and March 16 orders banning gatherings of over 200 persons and any form of religious congregations.The Tablighi Jamaat issued a statement on Tuesday, saying the visitors were stuck at the headquarters because of the lockdown. Its spokesman, Mohammed Shoaib, said the group sent a request for curfew passes to the Delhi government to help the visitors leave the Jamaat headquarters but received no reply.A Delhi government official said Jamaat reacted late. “The orders to ban gathering were issued more than 10 days before they sent the request for passes [on March 24]. Panic over coronavirus had already gripped Delhi when the first order was issued on March 13. Schools were closed. Holi celebrations were cancelled across the city,” the official said on condition of anonymity.He said despite knowing that foreigners and people from across the country were inside the building, the Jamaat stayed put and “endangered the lives of everyone”.“Their request for passes was kept in abeyance because there was confusion on whether issuance of passes to them would have violated the lockdown norms as their request did not come under essential services [which were allowed to function]. We are still looking at lapses, if any, on the part of government officials,” he said.This official added that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office asked for an explanation on why the district magistrate and the sub-divisional magistrate did not escalate the matter after meeting Jamaat members inside the building on March 26 over health concerns involving those who attended the gathering earlier in the month.(With inputs from Sweta Goswami and Vatsala Shrangi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-outbreak-tablighi-jamaat-head-concealed-crucial-information-about-health-of-those-inside-finds-police/story-3YtMpirbamjahlf2L54JAO.html
02-04-2020||India||Markaz leadership resisted, then NSA Ajit Doval dropped by at 2 am||When Maulana Saad, head of Nizamuddin Markaz, refused to yield to pleas from Delhi Police and security agencies to vacate the Banglewali Masjid, Home Minister Amit Shah requested National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval to get the job done.According to top home ministry officials, Doval reached around 2.00 am on March 28-29 night at the markaz and convinced Maulana Saad to get the occupants to be tested for the Covid-19 infection and be quarantined. Shah and Doval knew about the situation building up since the security agencies had tracked down the nine test positive Indonesians at Karimnagar, in Telangana, to the markaz on March 18 itself.The security agencies had sent an alert on the markaz infection the very next day to all state police and subsidiary offices. Also Watch | How Ajit Doval cleared Nizamuddin Markaz. Now for contact tracingWhile the markaz allowed 167 Tablighi workers to be hospitalised on March 27, 28 and 29, it was only after the intervention of Doval that the Jamaat leadership yielded to cleaning up of the masjid. Doval, for the past decades, has built very close connections with the various Muslim movements in India and abroad. He is on a first name basis with virtually all the Muslim ulemas and spends time with them to form a national strategy for India.The operation has now moved into Phase 2. In this, security officials say the effort is to trace all the foreigners who are in India, get them medically screened and then take a hard look at violation of the visa norms. There were 216 foreign nationals in the markaz in Delhi but there are over 800 more in different parts of the country. Most of them are nationals of Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh.Since January, the home ministry has said, about 2,000 foreigners have attended the markaz congregation. Initial reports indicate almost all of them violated their visa conditions by entering India on visas for tourists, not missionaries.This, officials said, had happened despite the government’s repeated reminders to file visa requests under the missionary category. They will be blacklisted from entering the country again.Apart from the foreigners, a massive effort is also afoot to identify all Indians who attended the congregations in Delhi or came in close contact with people who did. They are also being screened for Covid-19 and placed in quarantine.The Tablighi Jamaat was founded by Maulana Ilyas Kandhlawi, great grandfather of Maulana Saad, in the Mewati region. The Tablighis, then comprised of Muslim converts of Mewati rural population, fought with Rana Sangha of Mewar against Babur in Battle of Khanwa near Bharatpur against Mughal ruler Babur in 1527 after the first Battle of Panipat. The Jamaat purely focuses on Quran to preach on how to be a good Muslim with the objective of proselytisation.The movement has now been split into many factions with Pakistan using the Tablighis to take control of the group in South Asia and use it for spreading radical preaching.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/markaz-leadership-resisted-then-nsa-ajit-doval-dropped-by-at-2-am/story-RhL243HMbRgTGBbriNIVzL.html
02-04-2020||India||Coronavirus death rate lower than estimates: Study||A new analysis of data from at least 70,000 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from China puts the death rate at 1.38%, lower than earlier estimates ranging between 2% and 8% but higher than previous pandemics such as H1N1 influenza, which killed around 0.02% of the people infected in 2009-10.The study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal on Monday, warned that 50% to 80% of the global population could get infected with Covid-19, and without interventions such as lockdowns and social distancing, the number of sick people needing hospital treatment could overwhelm even the most advanced health care systems. It, however, said that outcomes may change as the pandemic unfolds and evolves, which would result in the data being revised.According to the study, by UK researchers from Imperial College London, Queen Mary University, London, and the University of Oxford, the death rates from confirmed Covid-19 cases came to 1.38%, and the overall death rate to 0.66% after adjusting for undiagnosed cases and population size (not included in earlier studies), according to the analysis of data from 70,117 laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases in mainland China, combined with 689 positive cases among people evacuated from Wuhan on repatriation flights.The death rates varied substantially with age, ranging from a low 0.0016% for people up to none years old to 7.8% for people aged 80 and above. Previous studies have estimated the death rates in people over the age of 80 years to be between 8% and 36%.While previous estimates of deaths from confirmed cases of Covid-19 ranged from 2% to 8%, deaths from overall infections were estimated to be between 0.2% and 1.6%. Since the past estimates were not adjusted for the fact that only people with more severe symptoms are likely to be tested, and the people in quarantine following repatriation to other countries, the numbers did not reflect the true number of cases across populations, some experts said.“Estimated death rates of Covid-19 will vary based on how many infected people are entered into the denominator while deaths are in the numerator. While deaths are easier to verify and attribute, the number of infected cases will vary according to the numbers tested with virus specific tests or identified on clinical criteria. Even if these are very liberally applied, we still may not define the denominator precisely as asymptomatic or very mild cases may escape detection by either criterion,” said Dr Srinath K Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.“The larger the denominator, the greater likelihood of including more mild cases and hence lower the mortality rate. In the initial stages of the epidemic, tests were restricted and diagnostic criteria were narrow, yielding higher mortality rates. Now the denominator is expanding with more inclusive testing and diagnostic criteria, which is showing lower mortality rates that are closer to truth,” said Dr Reddy. Death on average occurred on average 17.8 days after getting infected, and hospital discharge happened after 24·7 days, the study found. The proportion of deaths from both diagnosed cases and from milder, unconfirmed cases was strongly influenced by age.The study said that one in hundred people under 30 years of age infected with Covid-19 were likely to need hospitalisation, compared with close to 20 in hundred people who are 80 or above, with both hospitalisation and deaths increasing sharply with age.It further said that around 11.8% of infected people in their 60s, 16.6% of people in their 70s, and 18.4% of those above 80 developed symptoms severe enough for hospitalisation.“Our estimates can be applied to any country to inform decisions around the best containment policies for Covid-19,” said Professor Azra Ghani from Imperial College in a statement. “There might be outlying cases that get a lot of media attention, but our analysis very clearly shows that at aged 50 and over, hospitalisation is much more likely than in those under 50, and a greater proportion of cases are likely to be fatal.”Hospitalisation rates nearly doubled from 4.3% in 40-49-year-olds to 8.2% in 50-59-year olds, and were a low 0.04% for 10 to 19-year-olds, 1 % for people in their 20s, and 3.4% for people aged 30 to 39.“Retrospective modelling of data from China and Korea helps to identify the interventions needed to stop transmission and treat the severely ill in countries where mass testing is not being done. With many mild cases not even being tested, there is a danger of governments underestimating the nature of the pandemic, much to their peril,” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-rate-lower-than-estimates-study/story-Fd8ItB66VPqiBGZamHU0xM.html
02-04-2020||Editorials||Help the health workers, now | HT editorial||India cannot fight the coronavirus pandemic if its health care warriors — doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, and support staff in hospitals — are not safe. This is obvious, but needs to be reiterated because of the rapid rate at which members of the medical fraternity are getting infected. In Delhi alone, eight doctors have tested positive. In Chandigarh, two nurses and a doctor have tested positive. Mumbai’s Jaslok Hospital has scaled down operations after two nurses tested positive. In Bihar’s Nalanda, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times, doctors were exposed to a patient who tested positive — and developed symptoms themselves. Yet, they were told to keep working, which in turn, has potentially put all of them and the newer patients at risk.These are just illustrative examples of a larger pattern. The implications are clear. One, this will lead to the spread of the infection — for the interaction of medical workers with each other and patients is very high in these times. Two, India already has a grave shortage of health care workers in relation to the population. An increase in cases is inevitable. This will require all available human resources — but if doctors and nurses get infected on a large scale, the opposite will happen. They will need to be quarantined and treated, depleting resources. Three, it deals a blow to the morale of the medical fraternity. There are already reports of doctors and nurses contemplating mass resignations — which authorities are in no position to accept. While this may seem irresponsible, it is important to recognise that they are individuals, with anxieties and fears, families, and want to survive. India cannot afford its health care workers to be low on motivation at a time when it needs them at their finest. There is only one solution: Source and supply personal protective equipment (PPE) immediately. The government is aware of the challenge. On Monday, it announced its plans to ramp up manufacturing and procurement of protective gear. But on the ground, each passing day without adequate gear puts at risk the lives of doctors, medical staff, their families, and patients they are treating. This will undermine the lockdown, lead to the emergence of many more “super-spreaders” and clusters, and undermine the effort to flatten the curve with the lockdown. Empathise with the frontline workers — and act on it by giving them what they need, to save their lives and lives of citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/help-the-health-workers-now-ht-editorial/story-vGw1BPg280wMttuT8r08WJ.html
02-04-2020||Editorials||The dollar cements its position | HT editorial||The pre-eminence of the United States (US) dollar has been underlined with a thick green line during the present pandemic. The dollar has surged against all currencies since the crisis began. Which is why there was a collective sigh of relief among central banks everywhere when the US Federal Reserve announced on Tuesday that it would exchange US Treasury bonds for overnight dollar loans. The facility was also extended to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), though it is yet to take advantage of the offer. It had carried out a $2 billion swap recently and with oil prices having crashed, it has no urgent need for dollars. Like most major economies, the bulk of India’s international financial transactions are dollar-denominated. If its external position unravels further, India’s central bank may yet need a dollar infusion. With the recently announced swap arrangement, RBI can use its roughly $160 billion holdings of US Treasury bonds, about a third of the country’s foreign exchange reserves, to match any dollar requirements. The bank’s decision to greatly increase its dollar holding over the past several years has proved prescient. While there has been much talk about the rise of the Chinese renminbi, about 90% of international transactions are denominated in dollars. The sudden surge in dollar demand caused by the pandemic put many central banks in a tight spot, including that of China. The Fed’s decision immediately eased pressure on the dollar as it meant the trillions of dollars of US Treasuries held by other central banks were effectively as good as cash dollars. Dollars represent 60% of global foreign exchange reserves. The US central bank, in a simple and responsible action, has served to remind that there is still only one central bank of central banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-dollar-cements-its-position-ht-editorial/story-QwOpHSNcDEbfIQdbsi75pM.html
