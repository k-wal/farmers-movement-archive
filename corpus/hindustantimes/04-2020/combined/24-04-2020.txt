24-04-2020||News||Covid-19: India needs a green economic stimulus | Opinion||The economic impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is likely to be steep. This comes on the heels of a broader economic slowdown in the country over the last three years. Reviving growth will require an unprecedented stimulus package to address the collapse in aggregate household demand and resulting shocks to supply. In India, this stimulus should be “green” — addressing the risks of the climate crisis while also tackling the economic fallout of the virus. Continuing with business-as-usual at this juncture will compromise future economic growth, as we fall behind in cheaper and cleaner technologies, investors divest from fossil fuels, and countries consider climate-related trade barriers. The government can start with steps in three key areas — electricity, transport, and the urban economy — to deliver broad-based growth and improve environmental outcomes.Even before Covid-19 struck, power demand, a good proxy for economic activity, grew at its slowest pace in six years. The fall in electricity consumption due to the shutdown will further stress distribution companies (discoms), which remain in precarious financial shape and contribute to systemic risks across the financial ecosystem. The government’s move to allow discoms to suspend payments as temporary relief will create downstream problems of lower renewable energy deployment and worsening the financial health of coal plants. For the latter, a long suggested path should be considered seriously with the creation of a power-sector specific “bad bank”, a dedicated holding agency to own and manage the problematic coal fleet. This move would free up ~2.5 trillion from the books and accelerate lending to the post-Covid-19 economy. It also allows the government to set the pace to phase out older and more polluting coal power plants. With power demand stagnant, there is also no economic justification for new coal plants, particularly as the government encourages ambitious capacity targets of renewable energy (RE), which is increasingly dispatchable (with storage) and competitive. Instead, the focus ought to be on improving the utilisation of the stranded lower carbon and more flexible gas fleet, that can help integrate higher shares of renewables on the grid. Overall, improving the finances of discoms will also require creating new forms of electricity demand in urban areas, through related sectors such as transport.The lockdown has led to clean air and clear skies in cities, highlighting how much vehicles contribute to air quality. Electrification of transport is yet to take off as the Government of India’s electric vehicle (EV) policy has been inconsistent. India’s EV trajectory need not replicate the rest of the world — most of the potential lies with two- and three-wheelers which make up a sizeable chunk of transportation in cities. An analysis by Carnegie Mellon with NITI Aayog shows how high upfront costs for electric two-wheelers due to the cost of battery packs can be reduced by domestic manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, under the Make in India initiative. Electrification of transport can be a positive for discoms with an increase in revenue and potential to manage charging infrastructure. Utilities and discoms should proactively strategise on how urban electric mobility can help diversify ancillary sources of revenues and integrate charging infrastructure development with urban planning.Future urban planning in India will contend with choices to grow outwardly or vertically with a collective memory of the pandemic in the background. Indian cities fare poorly on all metrics of resiliency — be it as a response to climate, public health, or economic shocks, which often share common stressors. We will reach, if we haven’t already, decreasing returns on the expansion of megacities, and should instead focus on tier-2 cities with investments in human and physical infrastructure. New Indian cities should adopt transit-oriented, mixed-use urban planning with accessible public transit and EVs that expand the economic radius, free up productive hours stuck in worsening traffic, and reduce emissions and criteria pollutants. Services are easier to supply and monitor as opposed to the ad hoc development that usually takes place. Top-down projects pushed by the Centre and states remain short-term, narrowly-focused, five-year spurts rather than holistic plans with immediate accountability in the local government. Public-private partnerships (PPP) will be strained, especially in the post-Covid-19 economy with public spending having to do the heavy lifting. Once the economy stabilises, a concerted push is needed to clean up the bad debts of banks, redesign PPP, and create a robust municipal bond market.As governments around the world move to restart economies, capital adequacy requirements — which became more stringent in the aftermath of the financial crises and hurt developing countries like India — are being relaxed and guidelines suspended. A wave of new capital is expected. The pandemic exposed many of the world’s faultlines, but this can also be a fresh start for decarbonisation. Tools exist; technologies have not only broken even, but have become cheaper; and people around the world appreciate the importance of resilience needed to tackle this complex crises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-india-needs-a-green-economic-stimulus-opinion/story-MnFm3MdzRWWv1pD5COFKzJ.html
24-04-2020||News||West Asia is staring at an economic crisis. India has to be prepared | Opinion||Often jocularly called “India’s fifth metropolis” or “India’s cleanest city”, Dubai is the economic power centre of not just West Asia but increasingly the global financial system as well. There are over 300 weekly passenger flights between Dubai and various Indian cities, showcasing its importance, and of the larger region, to the Indian economy and society. Of the 3,336 coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-positive Indians currently abroad, 2,061 are reportedly in the Gulf.However, larger problems await New Delhi in the extended Gulf region with the global economy heading towards a critical downturn. Some analysts suggest that the crisis will be bigger than the Great Depression.Fractures have already started to show in the Gulf economies, as markets crash, lockdowns are imposed, businesses stall, and an oil price war plays out in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and beyond. Over eight million Indians work in the larger West Asian region, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia taking the bulk of those numbers. These eight million-plus workers are also responsible for sending more than $50 billion in remittances back to India annually. Now, the World Bank predicts a 23% overall drop in remittances this year.Estimates suggest that the Gulf economies may need in excess of $40 billion in this fiscal infused into the regional financial ecosystem to cushion the Covid-19 blow. The Indian skilled and semi-skilled workers in the region will feel the significant fallout of this, as they lose contracts with major events in the region such as DubaiExpo 2020 and others being postponed till next year.Kerala, which has over 1.5 million of its citizens working in the Gulf, is expecting a return of up to 400,000 of its people soon after the lockdowns are removed due to the pandemic fallout. Migration figures had started to slow down over the past few years, with a record number of semi-skilled labour returning. The reasons behind this trend have varied, from wage stagnation, cost of living, inflation, oil prices, migration policies of the Indian government and a shift towards the requirement of more skilled labour than semi-skilled. Even in Dubai, once synonymous with general Indian labour, the Indian chief executive officer and the Indian engineer are now more sought after.Beyond the immediate crisis, the pandemic is also certain to put a spanner in the process of regional reforms. For example, Saudi Arabia — with its king-in-waiting, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS)’s grand plans of opening up the Saudi economy in efforts to wean the kingdom away from its reliance on oil — will certainly experience turbulence, putting the country’s “Vision 2030” plan under duress and possibly draining foreign exchange reserves.With oil prices stunningly falling below $25 per barrel in the recent past due to both a crash in global demand reeling from the pandemic and disagreements between Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia over crude production, the political and economic faultlines in an already conflict-ridden neighbourhood will deepen. While it is true that these low oil prices are good news for New Delhi, it will come as a bounty for the Indian government only if the economy is thriving, and consumption is robust. The latest GDP data from the International Monetary Fund for India’s growth over the next year puts the figure at 1.9% in the current fiscal. For now, the biggest boon of these low prices is only in topping up the country’s strategic crude reserves cheaply.It is also imperative to remember that while the UAE and Saudi Arabia take a lot of the spotlight when it comes to trade and migration issues between India and West Asia, smaller Gulf nations such as Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain also hold a significant stake. Kuwait, where New Delhi recently sent medical teams to help fight the pandemic, is home to nearly one million Indians. Together, these three small countries alone have around 1.5 million Indians as residents and workers. Beyond this, even conflict-ridden states like Iraq have Indians working as oil workers, truck drivers and logistics handlers — there were over 17,000 working in the country as of last year.A significant reverse-migration in the post-Covid-19 era will add extra strain on the Indian economy, as the returning workers will add pressure on an already faltering job market along with the exchequer losing out on remittances that could go into billions of dollars.India’s outreach during the pandemic towards West Asia, from Saudi Arabia to Israel to Iran has been robust. However, the government should also use this crisis to empower states to have a larger say on migration and economic resettlement issues as part of the Centre’s foreign policy. The time is opportune to prepare and act collectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/west-asia-is-staring-at-an-economic-crisis-india-has-to-be-prepared-opinion/story-07fRmWgoMkYS6dKGEMnuEP.html
24-04-2020||News||Positioning panchayats as India’s agents of change||Panchayats have always been an integral part of India since ancient times. There are many references about it in the shastras like the Manusmriti, Arthasastra and the Mahabharata. In the pre-Independence era, Mahatma Gandhi emphasised on village-level self-governance to improve the local economy and ensure overall development. He believed in the bottom-up approach. After Independence, nearly one-third of India’s villages had traditional panchayats, but their functioning was below par. One of the landmark efforts was setting up a committee in 1957, to study Community Projects and National Extension Service. It recommended, among other points, the three-tier system. But the watershed year for the Panchayati Raj system was 1992-93, when the 73rd Amendment Act gave constitutional status to the gram sabha.In keeping with the bottom-up tradition, the current government has gone all out in improving the functioning of panchayats. On National Panchayati Raj Day, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, talked about women’s empowerment, and called for ending the “sarpanchpati” practice, which is the husband acting in place of the woman sarpanch. In April 2016, the ministry of Panchayati Raj celebrated National Panchayat Day by organising the “Gramodaya Se Bharat Uday Abhiyan” in the panchayats across the country to sensitise the masses and other stakeholders of the programmes and activities carried out under the Abhiyan.Nationwide efforts have been made to strengthen the Panchayati Raj system, and, through it, promote social harmony, foster farmers’ welfare, support livelihoods of the poor, and enhance rural development. In April 2016, a conference meant for panchayat representatives resolved to bring urban amenities to villages, strive for open-defecation-free villages, and ensure enough toilets for women in villages.The 14th Finance Commission (FFC) had recommended assured transfers to rural local bodies for delivery of basic services. It advised that the expenditures incurred by panchayats on basic services should follow the rules and regulations. It proposed that elected representatives should utilise the rural body funds according to the FCC recommendations – on planning and provisioning basic services such as water supply, sanitation, waste management, and maintenance of roads and footpaths. It also emphasised on the need to have Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP).Other initiatives taken by the government include monitoring the outcomes such as prevention of malnutrition among children, making available proper diet for pregnant women below the poverty line, and ensuring zero casualties during delivery. It also includes ensuring regular panchayat committee and gram sabha meetings.Besides, people living in villagers and elected representatives were encouraged to work for solid waste management. They were asked to have close and regular interaction with school authorities to ensure punctuality in attendance. To ensure children’s health in villages, immunisation campaigns have been launched. Steps have been taken to empower villages economically and improve their purchasing capacity, which in turn will help the economic empowerment. Programmes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, have helped create durable assets. The e-NAM Yojana has also been planned to realise Bhartodaya through Gramodaya.In 2018, the People’s Plan Campaign (PPC) was conceived to institutionalise the GPDP. Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas (PPC-I), from October 2 to December 31, 2018, was meant for planning at the gram sabha level, through a convergence between Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and line departments. The second PPC (PPC-II) was initiated on October 2, 2019, which aims to prepare GPDP for all the panchayat by 2020-21. The preparatory activities include a central portal, appointment of nodal officers at the state, district and block levels, deputation of frontline workers, the establishment of a dedicated Project Monitoring Unit, and organising special gram sabhas. Also, it lays down the roles and responsibilities of ministries, departments, and facilitators, stipulates timelines, arranges effective communication system, and helps in environment creation.Each state has its initiatives on, for example, capacity building refresher training and joint training programmes for elected representatives and officials. Thematic training is given to make the panchs (the leader of the panchayat) the “agents of change”. Details of state and central schemes have also been prepared as booklets for general awareness on various schemes for convergence. Resource teams, including Gram Panchayat Planning Facilitation Team, were also engaged to ensure training up to the grassroots level. The National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj has also played a central role in the capacity building and training initiatives during both the campaigns.A Mission Antyodaya (MA) Survey was conducted, which measured 146 parameters, covering gaps spanning infrastructure, human development, and economic development across 29 states. The survey provided the baseline data for the GPDP preparation by the gram panchayats (GPs). PRI-self help group convergence was given prominence, and livelihood action plan was prepared with the support of the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).A few states have set up help desk systems at the district level. States have also created social media tools like WhatsApp and e-mail groups to clarify doubts. Wide publicity has been given to include as many schemes converging with the schemes of the ministry of rural development, ministry of health, ministry of women and child development. Notably, PPC-I focused on capacity building for gender-mainstreaming activities, convergence with NRLM, and constituting working groups for preparing schemes for the economic development of women. PPC-II went a step ahead by including Women Component Programme (WCP) in GPDP (as in the case of Manipur and Kerala). The intent and vision for panchayats to play a proactive role in nation-building are in place. All that the country needs now is maximum implementation.Anushree Sinha is a professor and Rajesh Jaiswal is a fellow at the National Council of Applied Economic ResearchThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/position-panchayats-as-india-s-agents-of-change/story-6qBRbyPSsEn2r2dYH7exjP.html
24-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body has spent ₹95 crore in a month on Covid-19 fight||In the past one month, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has spent more than ₹95 crore for tackling the coronavirus outbreak in the city and has anticipated an additional expenditure of ₹200 crore for the next two months to contain the spread of the virus. The BMC has been utilising money from its contingency fund for the expenditure since March 11, when the city’s first coronavirus case was reported. In the 2020-21 budget, the BMC had allocated ₹850 crore for its contingency fund – a reserve of money set aside to cover possible unforeseen future expenses.“The expenditure of ₹95 crore that has been incurred in the fight against coronavirus is an unprecedented expense. But as of now, we are able to meet the expenses, as we have an annual allocation of around ₹850-900 crore as contingency fund. So there are no plans to raise money from the market or break BMC’s fixed deposits invested in banks,” additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said. In the past one month, the BMC has spent towards various initiatives, from enhancing health care to opening community kitchens for migrant labourers. According to its estimates, around ₹20 crore has been spent only on providing food. The health expenses have also increased, as the BMC, in its annual budget for 2020-21 in February, had allocated only ₹2 crore to upgrade Kasturba Hospital in the light of a possible coronavirus outbreak. Currently, the BMC spent substantial amount of money to set up institutional quarantine facilities for around 6,000 people A majority of the BMC’s donations is in form of kind via corporate social responsibility (CSR) or organisations. Though the civic body is yet to calculate the exact quantum of donations in cash, as per its estimates, its expenditure can surge upto ₹130 crore a month in the upcoming months if the donations come down.According to BMC officials, the major expenditure in the coming days could incur on setting up institutional quarantine facilities and dedicated hospitals for coronavirus, procuring medical equipment and PPEs, purchasing groceries, as well as recruiting manpower.Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of Opposition in the BMC, said, “One can understand that it this is an unprecedented situation, but our preparedness was very poor. Today, we are procuring equipment at much higher rate owing to the general increase in demand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-has-spent-95-crore-in-a-month-on-covid-19-fight/story-UNEtx1hzwJycJPH0Qm8M8N.html

The helpline has received 800 calls till Friday evening. Forty psychiatrists and counsellors from the state health department take calls from 10am to 8pm at the helpline number 1800 180 4104. Governance reforms department additional chief secretary Vinni Mahajan had launched this helpline. Doctors and psychiatrists associated with the helpline do not get to know the name of the caller.“Most calls we have received in two days are about people who are in extreme stress, just because they or somebody in their family has a mild cold or cough. A caller from Ludhiana said he was convinced that he had contracted covid-19 based on such symptoms. Our psychiatrist took an hour to persuade him that such fear only because of the stress,” said Kamal Gupta, manager technical, department of governance reforms.Senior citizens are also calling in with complaints of anxiety. “A family member of one such person, saying that his father was so stressed that he was reporting loss of memory and had even developed suicidal tendencies. Our team guided him,” a psychiatrist deployed with the helpline said.Another psychiatrist added that the unprecedented scenario over the past month had led to manifold rise in stress levels. He added that calls had been received from youngsters as well, who wanted to share their stress and relax before making critical choices for career, and examinations to take. “We plan to expand this helpline to provide career counselling for young people. The department is working on it with speed,” said Ravi Bhagat, CEO, governance reforms department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-helpline-to-beat-lockdown-stress-getting-200-calls-a-day/story-EbhTv2plnUlPQNAA207PKN.html

He also clarified that the kits are at the disposal of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and will be distributed to states, if demanded by them.The court was hearing a petition filed by Nagpur resident CH Sharma in 2000, raising concerns about the quality of healthcare provided at the four government medical colleges in the Vidarbha region.Sharma had complained that the four colleges did not have enough medical seats for imparting medical education to students, lacked proper equipment required for taking care of the patients and imparting education, as well as they lacked adequate staff, expert teachers and suffered from paucity of funds.This year on March 18, he moved HC again pointing out that the government medical colleges in Vidarbha were completely ill-equipped to handle the Covid-19 patients and create isolation facilities.During the course of hearing, the court on Thursday was also informed that VRDL laboratories cannot be made operational at Yavatmal and Chandrapur before May 20, for want of infrastructure.Dr Ajay Kewaliya, dean of Indira Gandhi Medical College at Nagpur, also informed the court that the Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Machines (RT-PCR) required for the laboratories are procured through Haffkine Institute, which in turn imports the machines from Singapore, and the shipment of the machines is a time-consuming process.In this backdrop, justice Sambre directed the authorities concerned that “once the equipment is received and the labs are installed, the operation of the same shall not be withheld for want of testing kits and it shall be the duty of the competent authority, including the state government, to make available sufficient number of testing kits for making such labs operational.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/have-put-use-of-rapid-antibody-kits-to-detect-coronavirus-on-hold-centre-tells-bombay-high-court/story-OUlEVoVTF8d0fBGr24wE1H.html

The demand came a day after the government increased salaries of only 100 NHM employees, who are working under Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP), as an appreciation for their work amid the Covid-19 outbreak.There are 13,400 other NHM employees, including doctors, staff nurses and ANMs, working in the state.Union state president Amarjeet Singh said, “Doctors, staff nurses, ANMs, community health workers, pharmacists and asha workers of NHM are risking their lives every day. Most of them are working on meager salaries. However, the government hiked salaries of only those who are working under IDSP.”“We are demanding immediate hike in salaries of all NHM employees. On Monday and Tuesday, we will wear black badges to show our resistance. We will go on strike from Wednesday if the government fails to meet our demand,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/salary-hike-demand-nhm-employees-threaten-to-go-on-strike-in-punjab-from-april-29/story-lvZhv7Ow81NiCqgBkKwZMK.html
24-04-2020||City||High Court tells Delhi govt to set up helpline for pregnant women||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court has directed the state government to set up a helpline for pregnant women who may be facing difficulties during the nationwide lockdown, imposed to curb the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The Delhi government’s counsel had submitted that they were starting a helpline for senior citizens and will now ensure that it caters to pregnant women as well.The court passed the directions on April 22 while hearing a petition filed by a Delhi-based NGO through advocate Vrinda Grover on issues pregnant women across the city are facing. The NGO in its plea also highlighted the case of a 25-year-old woman, Malti, from Nizamuddin, who was supposedly denied admission to a hospital as she was a resident of a containment zone. The plea said that the woman had developed labour pains on April 25 after which she visited the Safdarjung Hospital, but was denied admission. The woman then visited another hospital, which also turned her down. She was finally admitted to AIIMS on April 16 where she gave birth to her child, the plea added.Citing the woman’s case among other such cases, the plea contended that ASHA workers should ensure that the delivery takes place smoothly. The plea had also sought that a nodal officer is appointed in every Covid-19 hotspot, whose a contact number of the helpline is made public and a dedicated helpline is set up for pregnant women seeking essential health services, which includes arranging transportation to and from hospitals and securing movement passes.Appearing for the Delhi government, its counsel Anupam Shrivastava told the court that they do not have any problem in setting up the helpline. He also submitted that one ASHA worker is assigned for every pregnant woman across the city. Following this, the bench comprising judge Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad directed the Delhi government to ensure that the helpline number, which is proposed to be set up within two days for assisting senior citizens in Delhi, shall also be made available for pregnant women.“The helpline number shall be publicised adequately in newspapers and social media as also through the Delhi Police, wherever possible. The UOI (Union of India) and GNCTD shall work in tandem to make sure that no barriers are faced by pregnant ladies and their family members residing in hotspots during the lockdown,” the bench said while disposing of the matter.Ever since the nation-wide lockdown began on March 25, pregnant women in different parts of the city have faced problems in reaching hospitals. At least 300 women have called the police control room so far, after which they were rushed to the hospital in police control room vans..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/high-court-tells-delhi-govt-to-set-up-helpline-for-pregnant-women/story-yG32KFhCdbXbHuOmXHQnXN.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||IIT-D researchers develop dashboard to predict the spread of Covid-19||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT-D) have developed a web-based dashboard for predicting the spread of Covid-19 across the country. The dashboard, PRACRITI (PRediction and Assessment of CoRona Infections and Transmission in India), gives detailed state-wise and district-wise predictions of infections in India, the institute said on Friday.According to a statement issued by IIT-D on Friday, such a platform will be highly useful for health care bodies, local and central authorities, to efficiently plan for different future scenarios and resource allocation.“A key parameter of interest on COVID-19 is the basic reproduction number ‘R0’ and its countrywide variability. R0 refers to the number of people to whom the disease spreads from a single infected person. For instance, if an active Covid-19 patient infects two uninfected persons, the R0 is two. Hence, reduction of R0 is the key in controlling and mitigating the Covid-19 in India,” the institute said in a statement. “PRACRITI provides the R0 values of each district and state in India based on the data available from sources such as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Govt. of India; National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and World Health Organization (WHO).”NM Anoop Krishnan, Civil Engineering Department, IIT- Delhi said, “Getting the district-wise R0 is crucial as this will enable authorities to know the exact rate of spread in India locally.”The predictions in the dashboard will be based on a mathematical model that divides the population into four classes i.e. susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed. “Susceptible” refers to people who have not been exposed to the coronavirus, “exposed” refers to those who have been exposed to the virus from an infected person, “infected” refers to those who are actively infected with Covid-19, and “removed” refers to those who are no longer a carrier of the virus,” the statement read.It will also include the impact of the movement of population across states and districts in the spread of the Covid-19.“Based on the computed values of R0, a detailed district-wise model for India to predict the number of an actively infected person in each district can be developed,” it added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/iit-d-researchers-develop-dashboard-to-predict-the-spread-of-covid-19/story-y6DNf2cyfosnLwAklQsAsJ.html
24-04-2020||City||Amritsar DC orders inquiry into purchase of PPE kits for hospital||Deputy commissioner Shiv Dular Singh Dhillon has ordered an inquiry into the purchase of 2,000 Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Amritsar, after doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff refused to use these, alleging that these were substandard and did not even include N-95 masks. They have also accused the authorities at the hospital, run under the name of Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, of paying over Rs 41 lakh for the kits, claiming that the consignment should not have cost more than Rs 7 lakh. The kits were handed over to them a couple of days ago.Local MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla, who had given Rs 1 crore from his Member Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MLADS), part of which was used in the purchase had also written a letter to the Amritsar DC seeking an inquiry on Friday. “As medical professionals are facing issues with PPE kits and masks purchased from MPLAD funds, I request the administration to immediately mark an inquiry and audit into the purchase of the kits,” Aujla said. Dr Shiv Charan Singh, head of medicine department at GMCH, said, “The PPE kits ripped apart, when the staff tried to wear them. The poor quality kits will not offer any protection and the staff will remain at risk even after wearing these. We have six covid-19 patients in our isolation ward. I wrote to the principal, seeking an inquiry into the purchase.” “The kits were incomplete and did not even have N-95 masks. Even the nurses have refused to wear thes. Such poor quality kits are of no use to us and should not have cost more than Rs 7 lakh,” claimed Narinder Singh, lab attendant in GMC Amritsar.GMCH principal Dr Sujata Sharma said, “Authorities at the GNDH, mainly the medical superintendent Dr Raman Sharma purchased the kits.” Dr Sharma did not respond to repeated calls on his mobile number. The DC added, “The allegations made by the staff may or may not be true but we cannot risk their lives, amid the covid-19 outbreak. I have ordered an inquiry into the purchase of the PPE kits and the funds used for it. Additional deputy commissioner (development) Dr Pallavi will head the inquiry and submit a report soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amritsar-dc-orders-inquiry-into-purchase-of-ppe-kits-for-hospital/story-Qn6OpZ2tFsl2eMJ0k6EgeJ.html
24-04-2020||Mumbai||No gathering at Mumbai mosques during Ramzan||The Mumbai police on Friday stated that gathering on terraces and mosques will not be allowed during the Ramzan festival. “Actions are being taken at the zonal level keeping in mind the lockdown guidelines. We are communicating with community leaders and encouraging them to observe the fasts keeping in view the lockdown,” said deputy commissioner of police (operations), Pranaya Ashok. “The food for Ramzan for those in red zones and containment zones will be taken care of through NGOs and volunteers who will deliver food at doorsteps,” he added. The police have also beefed up security by roping in quick response teams (QRT), state reserve police force (SRPF) and other special forces. “Drones will be used to monitor. Gathering at terraces and mosques is not allowed and public announcements will be made,” said Ashok. 141 FIRs on Thursday over lockdown violations The Mumbai Police on Thursday registered 141 FIRs against 210 people and arrested 121 of them over lockdown violations. A maximum of 78 cases are for gathering in public followed by 49 cases for not wearing masks. Till Thursday, about 20,563 calls were received on Mumbai Police helpline (100) over Covid-19 queries since the beginning of the lockdown. A total of 68,601 FIRs have been registered across the state and 14,806 have been arrested over lockdown violations.

A case was registered against the father-son duo for disrupting a public servant from performing his duty. The police alleged that the vegetable vendor began to obstruct police action when they asked him the reason to sell vegetables in a containment zone. The police are also enquiring on the alleged high handedness of the police constables captured on a video beating the vendor. Hotelier booked for denying rooms to BMC An FIR was lodged by Matunga police against owner and manager of a hotel for denying access to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for using the hotel for quarantine facility.

24-04-2020||City||Delhi Police, LG quell fears over rumours of ban on Azaan||New Delhi: With Ramzan starting Saturday, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and the police on Friday said there is no ban on Azaan (a call to prayer) from mosques in the national Capital.This comes a day after a video of two Delhi Police constables purportedly warning the caretaker of a mosque in north-west Delhi’s Rohini did the rounds on social media. In the video, the constables can be heard telling the caretaker and a local resident that “Azaan ke liye bhi mana kar diya hai LG saab ne (The Lieutenant Governor has banned Azaan as well)”.Delhi L-G Anil Baijal, in a tweet on Friday, said Ramzan should be observed while following the lockdown guidelines, and made a reference to the Delhi Police’s instructions for the same.About an hour before Baijal’s statement, the Delhi Police had tweeted: “Azaan may be carried out in accordance with NGT [National Green Tribunal] guidelines,” along with some other instructions. By the evening, though, the L-G tweeted that disciplinary action had been initiated against the erring police personnel. “It has come to notice that a video has been circulating in social media regarding instructions being given for not reciting azaan by police. @DelhiPolice has already communicated that no such instructions have been given and has clarified the same in their advisory,” Baijal tweeted.“Disciplinary action is being taken against the erring police officials. Appeal to observe the holy month of Ramzan as per the advisory given below to stay safe and follow lockdown in your, and public interest. Stay home, stay safe,” he added.Clarifying the Delhi government’s stand, Sisodia tweeted, “There is no restriction on Azaan. In a lockdown, there is a complete ban on the gathering of people for prayers in mosques or for worship etc. at any other religious place.”According to deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pramod Kumar Mishra, the constables in the video were confused between the meaning of “Azaan” and “Namaaz”. “We have removed the two policemen from the beat. There is no ban on Azaan. However, the gathering of people in any religious establishment for prayers is banned to maintain social distancing. Those already inside the establishments can offer prayers there while the general public can do so inside their homes,” the DCP said. Local religious leaders, however, allege that in some places, local mosques were not allowed to use loudspeakers for Azaan. Hafiz Mohammad Javed, a social activist, said: “Due to some misinformation, mosques in some parts of Delhi were not allowed to use loudspeakers for Azaan. With Ramzan starting Saturday, Azaan is important to inform people about the timings for Sehri and Iftar so that they can observe fasts and offer prayers.”Maulana Jameel Ahmed of Madeena Mosque in Durga Park in west Delhi’s Sagarpur area said the police have not allowed him to perform Azaan for around 20-25 days. “They said it is not allowed. We have requested senior officials to allow us to do Azaan during the month of Ramzan. There are a lot of people who are uneducated and depend on announcements from their local mosque for prayers,” said Ahmed.A senior police officer from southwest district, of which Sagarpur is a part, said they had verbally advised religious establishments in the locality against the use of loudspeakers, because people had started to step out of their homes and head to the establishments to pray.“It was negating the purpose of social distancing and police personnel were finding it difficult to enforce lockdown orders. However, it was a temporary restriction and not for the Ramzan season. Azaan should be done but within the decibel level permitted by the NGT. Also, there should be no violations of the lockdown,” the officer said, asking not to be named.“It is requested that Namaz may be performed while staying indoors and have Sehri at home. All must stand united to fight Covid-19 pandemic and follow the guidelines,” the Delhi Police tweeted Friday.Javed said, “I have been making announcements from nearby mosques telling people to stay at home due to the Covid-19 outbreak. It is in our interest that we all stay at home.”Many police officers said they have been taking the help of religious leaders to convince people to stay indoors.On the video and allegations of the ban on Azaan, the Shahi Imam of Delhi’s Jama Masjid, Syed Ahmed Bukhari, said the issue had been resolved after he brought the matter to the notice of senior officials in the police department and the Delhi government.“Both Azaan and Namaaz will be performed, but all guidelines issued by the government will also be followed. I have appealed to people to maintain social distancing and offer prayers at their homes. This coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can be eradicated from our country only when we follow the lockdown norms strictly,” Bukhari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-lg-quell-fears-over-rumours-of-ban-on-azaan/story-6g4PrU2qutAernSVmhq7gK.html

These include 7 family members of a co-worker, a resident of Basti Danishmanda in the city.The Raja Garden man, who was suffering from severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), tested positive for coronavirus on April 13. He neither has any travel history nor close contact with any positive patient.The health officials said a 26-year-old man, who worked in the same media house, also tested positive in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh on April 15.Jalandhar civil surgeon Dr Gurinder Kaur Chawla told HT that more than 250 samples of the close contacts of positive patients linked to the media house were collected.Asked about the source of infection of the Raja Garden man, she said all these positive cases seem to be inter-linked to each other as the patients had been distributing langar among the people together. “They might have got the infection from there.”However, Chawla said that she won’t able to tell the source of infection of “a particular patient as we are screening thousands of persons.” The health officials said more than 100 persons linked to the media group have been put under home quarantine. They said all the positive cases from the media house are linked with the Raja garden man.In Jalandhar district, the number of Covid-19 rose to 64 on Friday, which is equal to the tally in Mohali, the worst-affected district in the state.Jalandhar has reported more than 50 cases in the past two weeks.As per the state government’s status report till April 22, the health department has no information about source of infection of 12 positive cases reported in Jalandhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-dept-clueless-about-source-of-infection-of-jalandhar-super-spreader/story-To4AlijvA4JygTckrNvzzM.html

24-04-2020||City||Health dept issues notice to senior deputy mayor for violating quarantine protocol||The health department, on Friday, issued notice to Patiala senior deputy mayor Yoginder Singh Yogi for flouting quarantine protocol.On Thursday, Congress’ Yogi had violated the home-quarantine norms by distributing ration in the city.He was tested negative for the virus on April 15, but was put on home-quarantine along with two of his family members till April 29 as a precautionary measure.Patiala civil surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said a notice has been issued to the senior deputy mayor, asking him to submit a written explanation by Saturday.“After studying the written explanation further action will be recommended,” Dr Malhotra said.Meanwhile, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has demanded Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to sack the senior deputy mayor.In a press release issued on Friday, SAD’s Surjit Singh Rakhra said it is shocking that Yogi endangered lives of people by distributing food packets when he should have been in quarantine.“Yogi was directed to be on home-quarantine till April 29. Instead, he violated the norms and came out to attend a public function,” Rakhra said.Rakhra said that SAD has also demanded the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Sunil Jakhar to take strict action against the Congress leader.CORRECTIONIt was inadvertently reported in these columns on April 23 that senior deputy mayor Yoginder Singh Yogi was tested positive for coronavirus. It is clarified that his reports were found negative on April 16 and he is home-quarantined as a precautionary measure.

24-04-2020||City||Lockdown effect: India’s largest scientific instruments industry in Ambala reluctant to re-open despite relaxations||India’s oldest and largest hub of scientific instruments in Ambala district, with nearly 2,000 small, medium and large-scale units, is facing the heat of lockdown despite some relaxations given by the state government earlier this week.Five days on, only a few of these units fulfill the conditions of operating in the district, an office-bearer claimed. Industrialists assert that the relaxations are not enough to re-open the units and the conditions are creating confusion for them.With an annual turnover of nearly ₹2,000 crore, most of these units supply the instruments to educational and technical institutes or export them to other countries. Closure of these buyers and further raw material markets in Punjab, Chandigarh and Delhi, will remain a big problem even if they re-open their units.Ambala Scientific Instruments Manufacturers Association president Sanjay Gupta said, “Most of the small or medium units are spread across the industrial areas of both Ambala Cantonment and Saha town, while there are also some micro-units in Ambala Cantonment and surrounding villages. The government has asked us to fill forms online that will allow us to re-open our units, but the form itself is very complicated and is creating confusion for us.”“The labourers we have engaged come mostly from nearby villages and other parts of the district. The industrial space is not sufficient to accommodate them all and arrange for their food, so most businessmen are reluctant to open their units. The few who have applied, their applications are being rejected. As per my knowledge, there is not a single unit that is operating, but news reports citing government data are claiming that a couple of them have started working,” Gupta added.There are two industrial areas in the district – Ambala Cantonment and Saha. The latter is dominated by bottling plants associated with Coca-Cola, Tuborg, Frooti and other aerated/non-aerated drinks. There are also some units of packaging and scientific instruments in this area. Pointing out the “strict conditions” by the government, Saha Industrial Area Association president Rajbir Chaudhary said the conditions are creating confusion, but the clearance on FIR in case a worker gets infected, has come as a relief.“We were expecting more relaxations from the government, but the strict conditions imposed are not favourable for the industrialists. The government has asked us to complete medical insurance-related process for the workers among other conditions, but it is not possible on such a short notice. However, the government’s clearance that there will be no FIR against the owner if a worker tests positive for Covid-19, has come as a relief and I expect this will motivate many to begin operations. Out of 225, over a dozen industrial units are operating in Saha right now,” Chaudhary said.Deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma, however, refused to mention particularly about scientific instruments and said, “We allow only those units to re-open and start operations who fulfil the prescribed conditions, as directed by the state government. There are over 100 varied units that have started operations in the last few days in the district.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-effect-india-s-largest-scientific-instruments-industry-in-ambala-reluctant-to-re-open-despite-relaxations/story-QPIRK2hiERrTju5H5u6lHJ.html

She also had her little savings other than the pension.Her gesture also got appreciation from Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi.“Your gesture has made us proud. Helping people at the time of crisis is true patriotism. My admiration for you elevated further when I came to know that you are a widow living in an old-age home. Country will always show its gratitude for your sacrifice. Salute to your zeal for selfless service,” wrote Priyanka to her in an appreciation letter.Speaking to HT over phone, Saini said, “Priyanka is like my daughter and I am elated that she noticed and appreciated the little contribution from a poor woman.”Former MP Harendra Malik and Congress leader Zunaid Rauf handed over Priyanka Gandhi’s appreciation letter to Saini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/old-age-inmate-donates-her-savings-from-widow-pension-to-pm-cares-fund/story-ewxX2q62wiusgVnXYL5jyO.html
24-04-2020||Mumbai||State tells BMC to increase bed capacity for Covid-19 patients to 7K from current 2K||The state government has directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to increase the bed capacity in the city’s hospitals to 7,000 from the current 2,000.This comes after an official estimated projection that the number of Covid-19 positive cases in the city will rise to 70,000 by mid-May or May end. Currently, around 80 to 90% of patients are asymptomatic and don’t need hospitalisation, going by this trend about 7,000 people (10%) of the projected 70,000 are likely to need hospital beds.Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary on special deputation to the BMC, as part of the core team of bureaucrats handling Covid-19 matters in the city, said, “All positive patients do not need hospitalisation. Going by the present figures, around 80% to 90% of the patients are asymptomatic. As per the projections, around 7,000 patients that show symptoms will need to be hospitalised. Thus, the BMC and private hospitals will have to ramp up to a capacity of 7,000 beds.”The number of cases in Mumbai is doubling every 7 days hence official reports project the figure at 70,000 by mid-May or May-end.Currently, Mumbai has 2,000 beds each across 26 private, municipal and state government hospitals in the city. BMC will now increase this capacity to 7,000 by converting non-Covid beds into those reserved for coronavirus patients. On priority, the capacity of existing Covid-19 hospitals will be increased and if required more private hospitals will be roped in to meet the demand of 7,000 beds. Preparations will include making oxygen points available at each bed and ventilators at some. “All Covid-19 patients do not need ventilators, only about 5% of the critical ones do. But all beds catering to Covid-19 patients must have oxygen points,” added Mhaiskar. BMC made the current 2,000 beds available by converting some of its current infrastructure. For example, from the Nair hospital at Mumbai Central, which was recently converted into a Covid-only facility, all non-Covid but critical patients were shifted to KEM Hospital at Parel and Sion Hospital.The civic body has also put elective medical procedures - such as a knee surgery - temporarily on hold to dedicate its resources to Covid-19. Similar measures will be taken to ramp up to 7,000 beds. However, hospitals will continue to treat non-Covid critical patients with serious health issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-tells-bmc-to-increase-bed-capacity-for-covid-19-patients-to-7k-from-current-2k/story-G0Bn2FpAP5EoF6icGxWqyJ.html
24-04-2020||Chandigarh||With five more cases, covid-19 count swells to 275 in Haryana||With five new positive cases — two each from Panipat and Gurugram and one from Rohtak — the Covid-19 count in Haryana swelled to 275 on Friday. Senior officials of the health department said while a 34-year-old woman and her 14-year-old son were found infected in Panipat, two persons, who were in contact with a Covid patient, tested positive in Gurugram. In Rohtak, a vegetable seller is the latest victim of the coronavirus. Panipat chief medical officer Dr Sant Lal Verma said the woman and her son, residents of Dhoop Singh Nagar, have been kept in an isolation ward at the local civil hospital. They had recently returned from Delhi. Stating that their locality has been sealed, Dr Verma said the woman’s husband, two more sons and nine other people in her contact have been isolated as well. The woman’s son, who tested positive, studied at a madarsa in Delhi and she had brought him back on April 21, the doctor said. FIVE TEST POSITIVE IN SONEPATFive people were said to have been found positive for coronavirus in Sonepat on Friday, though the health department bulletin did not mention them. They included corona infected nurse’s husband, a class IV health department employee in Sonepat, a cancer patient from Sahri village, a woman of Shahzadpur village here, who is wife of a health employee posted in Delhi and a man from Sonepat , who had also visited a cancer hospital in Delhi. Sonepat civil surgeon Dr BK Rajoura said all these patients have been shifted to Bhagat Phool Singh Medical College at Khanpur Kalan. Meanwhile, a constable of the Delhi Police was found infected in Panipat. As per the information, he is a resident of Sonepat, who had gone to his sister’s place in Panipat on Thursday. His sister, who is an ASI in Panipat police department, took him for examination and his samples were sent for testing. On Friday, his report came out positive.

24-04-2020||Mumbai||Housing societies in Mumbai order mangoes in bulk from farms||Unhappy with the high prices and poor quality of mangoes available with the vendors amid lockdown, residents of various housing societies in the city have started ordering mangoes in bulk directly from farms across the state. “Maybe because there is no export happening this year, good quality mangoes are available with farmers but are not reaching the markets. In a lockdown situation like this, one cannot really go hunting for mangoes all the way till Crawford market,” said Pervez Cooper, a resident of Colaba.The Colaba residents’ association ordered more than 225 dozen mangoes which are expected to arrive on Friday from Nashik.“If the quality turns out to be good, we could place a second bulk order. When my friend went to Crawford to find mangoes, there was too much crowd and police didn’t allow people to stand there, so he had to come back disappointed,” added Cooper.Other societies from across the city have opted for mangoes to be brought in bulk from coastal areas of Maharashtra such as Ratnagiri or Devgadh, which specialise in Alphonso mango.The traders and buyers also attributed this to APMC markets being shut.Kolan Bhumi Pratistan, a group which support farmers from Kokan region, said they have so far delivered around 10,000 dozen mangoes to 100 societies in Mumbai, Thane, Vasai and Pune.Sanjay Yadavrao, founder of the group, said they have started taking orders on online platforms and are in the process of launching an application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/housing-societies-in-mumbai-order-mangoes-in-bulk-from-farms/story-8dqZFjgEcwOWUgivJD78lO.html
24-04-2020||City||Delhi prepares for Ramzan in days of pandemic||New Delhi: For Delhi, or Dilli, Ramzan -- the most important month in the Islamic calendar when Muslims observe fasts and perform special prayers each night -- is a festival. For the entire month, specially in the old quarters, thousands gather every night for a grand feast at hundreds of eateries, and it continues till early morning just before the time for ‘sehar’ ends and the devout begin their fast. It resumes later in the day, an hour before ‘iftar’ when the devout break their fast. “But, then this is pandemic year. All mosques have been shut down, there is a national lockdown in effect, all markets are shut, all food items are in limited supply and there is widespread panic and apprehension. It doesn’t feel like Ramzan at all,” said Mohammad Faisal, a resident of Kucha Pandit, Old Delhi, referring to the restrictions imposed by the government to contain the spread of Covid-19.With Chandni Mahal, situated just a kilometre away from Jama Masjid, reporting several Covid-19 cases so far, the usual hustle bustle ahead of Ramzan is missing. “People used to stock up groceries specially for Ramzan, local shops used to start making items such as ‘Khajla, Pheni’ (snacks eaten with milk during Sehar) and the bazar would come alive. There is nothing like that this year,” said Mohammad Sirajuddin, a resident of Haveli Azam Khan area. Chandni Mahal RWA said they were asking residents to not gather at local mosques for prayers. RWA president Anwarullah said the residents would observe fasts and offer prayers at their homes only considering the precarious situation in the area. The central district, which includes the Walled City, has seven containment zones. Of these, five are located in Old Delhi -- Sadar Bazar, Chandni Mahal, Nabi Karim, Nawab Ganj and Bara Hindu Rao, spread over less than two square km. The other two containment zones are in Sant Nagar Burari and Oberoi Apartment in Civil Lines.“It is not just feasting. Muslims donate generously and feed the poor daily during Ramzan. Special arrangements are made at mosques for ‘taraveeh’ and Friday prayers as the number of people coming to perform prayers almost double during this holy month. It is not just us, think about those who knew they wouldn’t have to go hungry at least for one month since they would find plenty of food and alms,” said Mohd Feroze, a resident of Matia Mahal. Taraveeh are special prayers that are performed during Ramzan after the Isha (night) namaz. Since mosques would remain shut, Imams and the Darul-uloom, Deoband, have appealed to all the Muslims in the country to stay inside their homes and perform taraveeh and other prayers there only. The iconic Jama Masjid also remains shut due to lockdown. Till last year, besides hundreds of people gathering at the iconic mosque for prayers, there used to be a fair-like atmosphere in its grand courtyard every evening during Ramzan with people breaking their fast with snacks and delicacies bought from the local market. Also there used to be ‘iftar dastarkhawans’ (special feasts) where people invited others to break fast with them. “Jama Masjid is shut, so are local mosques. It is difficult to imagine Ramzan in Old Delhi without Jama Masjid,” said Naseem Ahmad, a local resident. The Rahmatullah Hotel, another Jama Masjid area landmark, where hundreds of the poor are fed daily by the patrons and the hotel owners, is locked. Fazalur Rahman, the hotel owner, said, “This shop was established in 1948, and its has never shut down since. However, with the lockdown in place, this restaurant would also remain closed.” The hotel is known for its sheermal, paranthas and kebabs, besides meals that comes as cheap as Rs50. Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, the Shahi Imam of the Fatehpuri Masjid, said he has appealed to the people to stay inside their houses and offer their prayers. He also said that if for any reason, someone is not being able to keep the fast, he can observe it later during anytime of the year. “Those with medical or any other condition are allowed to skip fast during Ramzan and keep it when they attain health. We have appealed to the people that they should listen to what doctors and experts have advised,” he said. The Mufti also urged the authorities to make arrangements so that the markets, in some areas, can be opened in the morning at 3am and also in the evening for sometime so that the people can buy essential commodities, while maintaining social distancing. Sanjay Bhargava, president, Chandni Chowk Traders Association, said the area got additional footfall during Ramzan which meant extra business for the traders. “This would be a double whammy for the traders whose businesses are already shut from the last one month,” said Bhargav.Hazrat Nizamuddin, another centre of activity during Ramzan, also shows no signs of the usual hubbub. The Dargah has been shut down and the entire area has remained secluded ever since hundreds stuck inside the Alami Markaz, the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat, were evacuated with symptoms of Covid-19. Farid Nizami, caretaker of the Hazrat Nizmauddin Dargah, said the dargah was never shut down in its over 700 years of history. He also said that it would be the first Ramzan when there would be no arrangements for iftar, taraveeh at the adjacent Jamaat Khana Masjid.“During Ramzan, it used to be a different environment altogether. The place is completely crowded with people and also visitors who come to offer namaz. At any given time during the holy month, around 2,500 people offered prayers here. But it is for the first time in 700 years that we had to shut down the dargah,” the dargah caretaker said.“We have already told local residents and devotees to stay indoors and offer namaz. For Eid festivities, a decision will be taken only a week before the festival,” Nizami said. It is also a difficult time particularly for those living inside the containment zones. Mussarat Begum, 50, who lives with her son in Nizamuddin area said at least the authorities should have allowed access to ATMs and banks so that people could withdraw money for essential things. “I had some cash but it is finishing fast. Not many local shopkeepers and vendors accept e-payments. We need to shop daily for sehar and iftar, how are we going to do it now,” she said.Another resident, Mehrunissa Khan, a health worker, said the supplies are hit and many daily use items are not available. “Many food and other items that we associate with Ramzan are not there this time,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-prepares-for-ramzan-in-days-of-pandemic/story-p192NJKX0xA40GRo4QIHrK.html
24-04-2020||Gurugram||80 factories, 35 construction projects get go-ahead to resume ops in Gurugram industrial areas||At least 80 industries, 35 construction projects and 10,000 workers have been allowed to resume work this week. Development follows announcement of standard operating procedures (SOPs) announced by the state government on April 19 to reopen economic zones. The administration has allowed workers to cycle or ride a motorcycle to work if they stay within a five-kilometre radius of their workplace. For others, the employers will have to apply for to the administration for transport, officials said.In Gurugram, around 1,100 applications from industries and 150 applications for construction projects were received on the Saral portal till Friday. “Around 80 applications for resuming industry operations and 35 for construction projects, by government and private developers, were approved by Friday evening. The volume of applications is high and we are approving them only after proper scrutiny of the documents uploaded on a first-come, first-service basis. Applicants must read the application criteria properly and upload the SOP accordingly. In absence of these, applications are being rejected,” VS Kundu, GMDA chief executive officer and chief coordinator of Covid-19 response in Gurugram, said. About 6,700 industrial workers have been issued movement passes and nearly 4,000 such passes have been issued to workers at construction sites.Given the volume of applications being received from industries across the district, government said norms are being relaxed and their officials across departments, such as Industry, labour and the Haryana state industrial infrastructure development corporation (HSIIDC), were involved 24x7 in scrutiny of documents.“Travelling norms are being relaxed. Cycle and bike travel in 5km radius of the factory has been allowed for workers as in maximum industrial locations workers normally reside in nearby villages and, for them, industry owners need not provide additional transport facility, as was mandated under government guidelines currently in place. Beyond this range of 5km, industry owners will have to arrange transport and government has decided to provide its buses. Industry owners, through their associations, will send requirements to local administration,” HSIIDC chief coordinator Sunil Sharma said. The 80 industrial units that have received sanction are in Manesar, Udyog Vihar and Sector 37. “Government is currently allowing resumption of work in approved (regulated) industrial zones. In the entire state, 850 industries had been granted approval, as on April 24, and around 61,000 movement passes had been issued. The scrutiny of documents is underway in every district,” said Sharma.Those who got permission are to resume operations over the next couple of days.Rakesh Vohra, Sector 37-based industry owner, said, “Ours is packaging business and we will currently work with only seven workers. I applied on April 20 and I got approval on Friday morning.”Sanjiv Puri, Udyog Vihar-based industry owner who is in the garment business, said, “We got permission on Friday, but we have to see our staff/workers are available and they are in a position to resume work. All this will take a few days.”The industry owners in non-confirming zones such as Kadipur, Daulatabad, Basai and elsewhere will have to wait till the lockdown is lifted.“We are small-scale industry owners and we have been neglected on many fronts, and for long. We have no water, sewer etc; we have been fighting for these basic facilities for a long time. Currently, our operations are not even being considered by the government. This, after we applied for permission,” Kadipur-based industry owner Sanjiv Bansal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/80-factories-35-construction-projects-get-go-ahead-to-resume-ops-in-gurugram-industrial-areas/story-6EyPjZOyS7jhsTqe0oyosN.html

Their RT-PCR testing will be done alongside routine screening and testing of citizens, especially those in the 24 containment zones.On Friday, the department screened 60 government employees in Mini Secretariat, out of which 20 people gave their samples for Covid-19 testing. The team took swabs from nose and throat for Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) after the antibody test for community surveillance was put on hold by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) following inaccuracies citied by different states.“Besides the routine surveillance and sample collection, we are now reaching out to government employees and workers who have been working at the forefront. Government employees are exposed to multiple people as they visit different areas,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer. Starting with district administration employees in Mini Secretariat, the team will cover judiciary, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and police personnel. “While testing the government employees and people from judiciary we will be covering more than 2,500 people. For police personnel, we are preparing a plan to cover them in phases as the workforce is huge and their working cannot be disturbed,” Dr Anuj Garg, a rapid response team member, said, adding that the process will continue till next week.PVT SECTOR AIDHelping the health team is an online pharmacy company which has provided a van for sample collection and a lab technician. “We have been given 10,000 VTM (viral transport kits) by the company for collecting the swabs of government workers. The samples of identified persons with flu-like illness were easily collected inside the van,” said Dr Garg. These samples will be sent to PGIMS-Rohtak for testing.According to Punia, journalists who were earlier tested through antibody kits will now be tested through RT-PCR. On Tuesday, the health team tested 30 journalists and 36 people from the Sohna containment zone by using rapid testing kits. All the tests were negative. In Gurugram, 47 cases have been reported till now, of which 35 have been discharged, while 12 are undergoing treatment.

A large number of health workers stay in these high-density areas, locals said, adding that supply of essentials has been hit. In all, six cases of the Coronavirus disease have been reported from Sector 39 and Jharsa village, as per the health department officials. Three cases were reported from Jharsa village over two days this week, prompting the district administration to declare it a containment zone. Earlier, on April 10, Sector 39 was declared a containment zone after three positive cases were reported. Till Friday evening, 47 Covid-19 cases were reported in the city, authorities said. The Sector 39 containment zone has 1,820 houses and 10,000 people while the Jharsa village, located in Sector 39, has a population of around 50,000 people and is a high-density area.The health department, on its part, said surveillance in the area has been increased and more teams of ASHA and ANM workers have been deployed here. “Each health department team has been doing door-to-door for surveillance in the sector assigned to them. They are looking for clinically suspected cases. The residents will have to give information about the suspected cases and, if required, they are being taken to Sector 10 hospital for taking swab sample. The teams have been trained to create awareness in the community about preventing disease from spreading, importance of home quarantine and reporting about cases if they see any signs and symptoms of cough and cold,” Chief medical officer Dr Jaswant Singh Punia said. SUPPLY WOESFollowing the containment order, officials said authorities concerned have barricaded the area and entry and exit of residents has been banned. However, residents said that in the last two days after the number of cases increased they were facing problems in getting dry ration, vegetables and milk. “My house is along the street where most cases of Covid-19 have been detected; these house have been sealed completely. We are not allowed to go out and buy vegetables or milk. There is need for the administration to supply essential commodities at door steps,” Jharsa resident Parveen Thakran.Sector 39 residents and RWA members, which is spread in five large blocks comprising HSVP plotted area and cooperative housing around Jharsa village, also said that getting essential supplies had been a big hassle. Pradeep Kumar, who is resident of Housing Board colony in Sector 39, said shops inside their condominium have closed and they were managing with whatever they had left in stock. “The situation is becoming difficult as movement is difficult. We understand the problem but basic issues need to be addressed as well,” he said.“There must be a dedicated official in every containment zone, who can interact with residents and resolve their problems. We have registered our issues with administration and hope something is worked out soon,” RWA president MS Dahiya said.Officials involved in managing the containment zone, however, said that shops were to operate from morning to 4pm. “Shops have been closed by owners on their own due to fear of Covid-19. Although movement of people outside containment zone is banned, essential supplies are being delivered. If any resident is facing problems they will be resolved,” said Chander Shekhar, duty magistrate, sector 39. Jharsa village duty magistrate Sanjay Yadav said that they have allowed supply of essential commodities but everyone will have to maintain social distancing and wear a mask while going out. “We have also installed warning board for residents,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sector-39-jharsa-village-see-highest-number-of-covid-19-cases-in-gurugram-city-3rd-highest-in-district/story-EDnbrDH3thaFtEcHWeDyRJ.html

If shop timings are restricted, we expect that it would also restrict the movement of people. Any selling of fruit or vegetables in residential localities will be allowed only up to 2pm. The grocery shops will also not open after 4pm,” Shiv Prakash Shukl, city magistrate, said.Till Friday, such shops were allowed to open from 6am to 9pm. Two days ago, the administration also restricted the timing of shops at Old Sabzi Mandi (near Navyug Market) till 2pm in order to avoid any crowding.On Monday, the district magistrate had also given directions prohibiting the movement of people between Ghaziabad and Delhi.

The tax is calculated on the basis of annual rental value of a property.“Last financial year (2019-20), we received about ₹127 crore as property tax. There was a proposal of 10% on annual rental value which has now been put on hold. We are now encouraging people to pay the property tax online. We are also thinking of making arrangements for manual collection of tax,” Sanjeev Kumar Sinha, corporation’s chief tax assessment officer, said.A tax payer gets a rebate of 20% if the tax payment is made by August 31; 15% in case tax is paid in September; 10% in case the payment is made in October or November and 5% if paid in December or January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-administration-restricts-timings-of-vegetable-and-grocery-shops-corporation-defers-hike-in-property-tax/story-EVO3rLMLcik3Y5RYywR1SM.html
24-04-2020||City||Nearly 50% fall in domestic violence calls amid Covid-19 lockdown||Ghaziabad: The instances of domestic violence in the district during the first phase of lockdown have seen a sharp decline of about 50% as compared to the pre-lockdown period in March. According to the data compiled by the Ghaziabad police for 18 police stations in urban and rural areas, cops received about 501 calls related to domestic violence from March 1 to March 22, while only 258 calls were made between March 23 and April 14 when the lockdown was put in place.The data showed that only two police station areas of Niwari and Kaushambi received such calls, which landed at police emergency number 112, in single digit while eight police station areas stood in single digit during the lockdown period.“The calls reduced drastically during the lockdown period. It could be due to regular movement of police in different areas and closure of liquor shops. It is generally seen that people consume liquor and resort to fight at home or indulge in domestic violence. The trend of decline in figures is encouraging and we expect that it should continue,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural) and nodal officer for police response vehicles (112).The police station areas where major decline in calls was witnessed include Vijay Nagar (reduced from 63 to 30), Indirapuram (33 to 19), Kavi Nagar (44 to 12), Loni (46 to 30), Loni Border (41 to 26), and Sahibabad (47 to 22).The police said that they will quantify more data for further analysis once the lockdown period ends.Overall, the Ghaziabad police received 312 calls from the urban pockets and 189 from the rural areas during the pre-lockdown period. The number of calls from the urban centres dipped to 161, while in the rural areas it went down to 97 during the lockdown period.Dr Saket Tiwari, consultant psychiatrist with National Mental Health Programme, who is also looking after counselling of patients at quarantine centres in Ghaziabad, said that currently people are more focussed on dealing with coronavirus.“They are trying to fight the disease which is spreading. There are responses of humans where we conserve our energies to deal with the imminent danger. So, these energies are getting conserved to deal with coronavirus situation. There is also a fear of survival and people are also inclined to analyse the future,” Tiwari said.“The lockdown has also given us a situation where people are at home and spending more time with family. So, the communication gap has also got reduced. Further, the stress levels which people bring home from their workplace has also reduced now. Generally, from the cases, we see that a male is inclined towards domestic violence. But now he is in protection mode and thinking more about his family,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nearly-50-fall-in-domestic-violence-calls-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-igGiGDc92KyLal1TZgVZZN.html
24-04-2020||Gurugram||Tulip Violet makes the best use of lockdown||The lockdown to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV2 is seeing people across the country get innovative with their time indoors. At Tulip Violet in Sector 69, residents are being motivated by the residents’ welfare association (RWA) of the society to share their quarantine experiences through a contest. Residents who upload unique ways of spending their time doing what they love the best will be rewarded when the lockdown ends.Quarantine fun The details of the contest was shared on the society’s Facebook group. “We started the contest #VioletBeatsCorona in late March. So far we have got around 250 entries. The idea was to encourage residents to share their activities and experiences while being under lockdown,” says Puneet Goyal, RWA president.Goyal adds that the entries were a mixed lot. From recipes to art works, from musical performances to innovative versions of familiar games, the list is long. “One of the residents turned around the old snakes-and-ladder game into a task-oriented one. Suppose, if you hit five, then you may have to do five sit-ups,” says Goyal. The closed Facebook group dedicated to the society’s residents routinely sees various posts of memes, TikTok videos, home recipes for hand sanitisers and others. In the absence of any physical engagement due to the lockdown, the residents have shifted their interactions online.Help at handThe condominium has a special task force to help tackle the various challenges being faced during the lockdown.It consists of eight members, including a resident doctor and public health expert. The force formed around March 20, has been responsible for all the safety measures taken by the society. “Initially the team met every day to plan out steps. Now, the meeting is held on a weekly basis as well as when required,” said Anoop Kumar, RWA secretary.For instance, upon realising the urgent need of servicing AC units due to the approaching summer, the RWA has taken a unique initiative. Realising that residents calling in maintenance services individually would mean at least a hundred outsiders stepping inside the society, the RWA has decided to call in a team of service personnel, who have been provided accommodation at the society for the duration of their service. “A team of six servicemen for AC repair and servicing have been hired and they are now staying in an apartment at the complex. They are expected to stay here for the next 15 days or so till the maintenance work is complete,” said Goyal. The society currently has a reduced team of in-house technicians, electricians and plumbers, whose services can be availed by residents at any time. “I used the services of the electrician to do a few repairs around the house. I am glad they were available during this time,” said Rakesh Gupta, a resident. A few home chefs in the society have came together to form a group that provides home-cooked food to residents based on the number of orders received. The customers usually include elderly residents, who are unable to cook in the absence of maids. The menu is altered on a day-to-day basis and is shared on their WhatsApp group. It usually includes rice, chapatti, sabzi and an array of evening snacks. “My menu usually includes rice, dal, subzi, chapatti, samosa, lithi chokha, dal bati and others. There are a lot of orders for evening snacks as well. Residents know that the food is made at home and is hygienic and safe,” said Pallavi Sharma, one of the of home chefs. She adds that the price of a vegetarian thali starts at ₹140. The orders are usually collected from the apartments of the home chefs. Caring for the poorThe society has also put together a ration-distribution drive for the support staff employed at the society. The RWA collected funds from residents for the purpose. A fund amounting to ₹1.5 lakh was created and the ration bought with that money was distributed to families of the tower guards, gardeners, maids and others employed at the society. “The ration drive saw donations by residents. The fund was used to provide ration to the support staff at the society,” said Aditya Kumar, joint secretary, RWA.The residency has one departmental store and a vegetable store inside its complex that cater to the close to 3,000 residents, said Sumit Gulati, vice-president of RWA. For the time being, all doorstep deliveries during the day have been stopped. Executives are allowed only till the tower lobby. The society is also maintaining a no-walks-allowed policy but it agrees that there are a few rule breakers. For such residents, the RWA is holding an awareness drive. “We found that roughly 1% for the condo population was coming out for walks. These were mostly senior citizens. We tried to convince them and made them aware of the situation. A few insisted further and provided medical proof of why they need to walk. For those cases, we have made special provision and allowed them to take walks on the rooftop,” said Goyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/tulip-violet-makes-the-best-use-of-lockdown/story-GqsyudsvwEWpybZkkKyRuK.html

Our multiple teams are working in sectors 8 and 5,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, GB Nagar.Since April 8, hundreds of people have been shifted from the slums in sectors 8 and 5 to government quarantine centres as a precautionary measure. The step was taken after four persons, with one linked to Ceasefire company, tested positive for Covid-19 in JJ Colony in Sector 5.The officials are taking more precautionary measures in areas where there are no residents’ welfare associations and where social distancing is not possible because of higher population density, such as the slums. The health department has been waiting for the sample reports of over 500 Covid-19 suspects, the officials said.Meanwhile, a 27-year-old woman and a 26-year-old man were discharged from the Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute in Sector 30 after being cured.By Friday night, the health department collected a total of 2,821 samples.

24-04-2020||Delhi||400 labourers, traders at Azadpur mandi screened for Covid-19||Over 400 labourers and traders at the Azadpur wholesale fruit and vegetable market were screened for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday. The step came three days after a trader from the market died of Covid-19.“Today we sent a 19-member surveillance team, which included 12 doctors, to conduct thermal screening, temperature measurement and other tests on labourers, traders and others linked with the Azadpur mandi,” said Deepak Shinde, district magistrate (north). Meanwhile, the business partner of the dead trader has tested negative for the disease. HT has seen his test report. However, the test results of the 15 employees at the shop are still awaited, Shinde said.Adil Khan, chairman of agricultural produce marketing committee said there was no shortage in supplies of fruits and vegetables at the market. “The supply has rather increased by around 30% with the market functioning round-the-clock for seven days a week. There was no rise in the rates as well. In view of the coronavirus epidemic, general cleanliness is being emphasised and regular sanitisation is going on,” he said. The team of doctors who visited the market on Friday also created awareness about social distancing norms and other steps to prevent the Covid-19 infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/400-labourers-traders-at-azadpur-mandi-screened-for-covid-19/story-ExmFGFWPnoloYiJARIcKKN.html
24-04-2020||City||Gurugram: Three arrested for assaulting police officers when asked to show curfew pass in Manesar||Gurugram: Three men were arrested for allegedly assaulting a police official when they were stopped at a checkpoint in Manesar and asked to show curfew passes on Thursday night. Police said the accused allegedly hurled abuses at the policemen, tore the uniform of a traffic police official and threatened them of dire consequences. According to the police, the incident took place around 11.50pm when a police team was inspecting vehicle movement at a check point near the Manesar bus stand. Police said they noticed a car headed towards Jaipur and flagged it down. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said the driver did not slow down and the car was eventually stopped when a police official closed the barricades.Police said the driver claimed to be headed to Rewari with his two friends on the pretext of purchasing some medicine but when questioned, he could not name the medicine he was out to buy. “A traffic police official asked the driver if they had a curfew pass. The driver got agitated and started hurling abuses at the police officials. He alighted from the car and grabbed him by the collar and tore his uniform. The accused claimed to have “connections” and threatened to have the police official fired for stopping him,” alleged the police official.When other policemen tried to reason with him, his two friends also allegedly started arguing and manhandling the officers. Police said the three were arrested and later released on bail. A case was registered against the accused under sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act at the Manesar police station on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-three-arrested-for-assaulting-police-officers-when-asked-to-show-curfew-pass-in-manesar/story-v4zZZ3AdKvhwmBl7iZmIyL.html
24-04-2020||Noida||Patients cry foul over faulty sample collection as test results prove inconclusive||The health department of Gautam Buddh Nagar is facing a problem of sample collection from patients suspected of suffering from coronavirus disease(Covid-19). Over 100 samples sent to the laboratory of Government Institute of Medical Sciences(GIMS) in Greater Noida in the past four or five days turned out to be inconclusive. The inconclusive reports have forced officials to once again collect samples from suspected Covid-19 patients, leading to panic and restlessness among those who are currently under quarantine at various government centres in the district.Since April 20, the doctors and lab technicians involved in the testing of Covid-19 samples are facing a huge challenge as most of the samples have failed to be of any use. Officials have said that either the samples have not been collected properly as per the guidelines or the quantity so collected is not adequate for testing. “A lot of the samples collected from suspected Covid-19 patients have turned out to be inappropriate for testing. Most often, the quantity of nasal and throat swabs are not enough for producing conclusive results. Further, the lack of experience of the technicians collecting the samples is another cause of concern. However, we are still trying to figure out the exact reasons behind the poor collection of samples,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS.“Our lab doctors are working till late at night in three shifts to clear the pending reports. Sample collection are being carried out by multiple teams, including those from the health department and GIMS,” added Gupta.A large proportion of the 92 samples that were sent for testing at GIMS turned out to be useless as the results proved to be inconclusive. GIMS has received over 600 samples in the 10 days.A 30-year-old dentist from Greater Noida, who is at a paid quarantine centre at Stellar Gymkhana in Greater Noida, now wants to shift to Delhi for Covid-19 test after two of his samples got wasted. The dentist had come in direct contact with an elderly couple from Jharkhand who had come down for a hand surgery at a private hospital in Ghaziabad and were staying in Greater Noida.“The couple is from my home town. As such, my father had asked me to help them out. The 76-year-old man was discharged from the Ghaziabad hospital on April 18. I picked him and his 72-year-old wife from the hospital to take them to a rented place. The moment we reached Greater Noida, I got a call from the hospital, saying that the man was found positive for Covid-19. Immediately, two ambulances arrived that took the couple to the Saket branch of the same hospital,” said the man who runs a dental clinic in Greater Noida.“On April 19, his wife was also found to be positive for the infection. I went to GIMS on April 20 and gave my sample for the test. I took a room in the paid quarantine for ₹2,500 per day. On April 21, I was informed that they needed to collect my sample again as the first one got wasted. On April 24, I was again told that they needed to take my sample for the third time as the previous two samples proved to be inconclusive. This shows that the technicians collecting the samples are not experts. I have been panicking because there is no communication from the administration,” added the doctor.The doctor now wants to be shifted to some Delhi hospital to get himself tested. “I have written to the district magistrate(DM) and the chief medical officer(CMO) regarding the problems of sample collection. I have also suggested that I can go to a Delhi hospital to get myself tested but they haven’t got back to me on that. Every passing hour is taking a toll on my mental health as I wait for my results,” said the doctor.Another family of four undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at the Sharda Hospital had a similar story to share. The family shifted to a private hospital in Delhi on Friday afternoon after sample reports were delayed repeatedly. The family from Sector 50, includes a 45-year-old man, his 41-year-old wife, their 19-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter.“My mother was found to be positive for Covid-19 at a private hospital in Okhla on April 8, after which we were found positive for the infection. On April 19, our samples were collected, which showed that I was still positive while the other members of my family were negative. On April 21, officials again took the samples of my wife and children to confirm the negative test. The reports were expected on April 23 but on Friday, when we enquired, we were told that the samples got wasted and they need to collect all three samples once again,” said the 45-year-old patient from Sector 50.“If the reports had come on time, then at least my wife and children could have got discharged. We wrote to the DM and the CMO asking for the permission to shift to Apollo Hospital. All four of us have now shifted to Apollo because we were panicking following the delayed reports in GB Nagar,” added the man.The doctors inside the GIMS lab are also worried as they are not being able to complete the test following the poor collection of samples. “We are being exposed to the virus while testing the samples of Covid-19 suspects. When the samples turn out to be unfit for test then it is indeed very demotivating,” said a lab technician from GIMS.“We have once again collected the samples which had got wasted. The exact reason behind the reports turning inconclusive is not known, but either the tests failed or the collection procedure was not followed properly,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/patients-cry-foul-over-faulty-sample-collection-as-test-results-prove-inconclusive/story-isYIqnzCfhenSVNjZWqEdP.html

24-04-2020||Gurugram||MCG asks RWAs to not dump horticulture waste outside parks||To curb open waste burning, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Friday asked all Resident Welfare Association (RWAs) responsible for the upkeep of parks in the city to keep horticulture waste within the respective boundary walls and not dump it elsewhere. In their directions, MCG officials said that they are facing issues with the lifting waste across the city during the lockdown period, as most of their tractors are currently engaged in sanitisation and disinfection drives. Since last month, the MCG has been disinfecting and sanitising common spaces of all condominiums, gated societies, plotted colonies, and other residential sectors across the city. MCG officials said that from now on, horticulture waste will be directly lifted from parks. Officials added that they have been receiving several complaints from residents that such waste was being burnt in the open, while some of it was simply being dumped in open areas, and the waste could catch fire which could spread to nearby residential areas. “If any RWA is found violating the directive, then the entire cost for lifting waste from their area would be borne by the RWA management. Scattered dumping of horticulture waste can cause accidents or fire and hence, the MCG is enforcing such heavy measures,” Said Devender Bhadana, executive engineer, MCG horticulture wing.The city has over 793 parks that fall under the MCG’s jurisdiction. Of these parks, 483 are maintained by RWAs and 310 by the civic body. On March 22, the MCG had closed all parks in the city to curb the spread of Covid-19.“We will support MCG in this initiative. We will issue circulars and spread messages to residents via WhatsApp groups informing them that they need to coordinate with the RWA for dumping horticulture waste at designated points within a park. Further, we will also ask residents to inform us if such waste is being dumped elsewhere so that corrective measures can be initiated,” said Dhruv Bansal, official spokesperson of DLF Qutub Enclave Resident Welfare Association (QERWA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-asks-rwas-to-not-dump-horticulture-waste-outside-parks/story-Y1tuuGTK5fLVpv2TeOqkdK.html
24-04-2020||Gurugram||Some construction work to resume in city, all social-distancing, lockdown procedures to be followed||The work for building an underpass at Huda City Centre Metro station resumed on Friday, a day after the district administration granted approval to this site and three other sites — Basai Chowk, Shankar Chowk and Sohna Road — to restart construction, while adhering to prescribed guidelines and social distancing norms amid the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown.The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is custodian authority of underpass and Basai Chowk flyover, while NHAI is looking after the construction of the Sohna Road flyover. NHAI and GMDA together are building the Shankar Chowk flyover. The two agencies applied separately for resumption a week ago. The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, which is the custodian authority of the underpass project, had applied for permissions for resumption of work along with other development projects such as one at Basai Chowk flyover and other for flyover at Shankar Chowk, NH 48, in the city that had been stopped in the last week of March after the Centre announced a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19.Work on the L-shape underpass at HUDA City Centre, which is coming up near the Metro station’s Gate No 1, started in September last year on a 11-month deadline, which will most likely not be met now, officials said. Officials said permission had been granted to start work with 40 workers only instead of the original strength of 200. The availability of construction material continues to be an issue during the lockdown, which will be in place till May 3 at least..A senior GMDA official said, “The contractor cannot be forced to expedite the construction work in such a situation when there is a shortage of manpower and construction material. However, we will try to complete the underpass work by November this year.”Once completed, commuters heading from Signature Tower on NH 48 towards Sector 45, 44 and Bakhtawar Chowk can use this underpass to travel signal-free.VS Kundu, GMDA chief executive officer, said, “Deadlines of stalled projects will be reviewed in the current scenario. All such projects are bound to go slow in terms of construction activities, due to many constraints. We have to make sure all norms of social distancing and lockdown restrictions remain in force.” The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has got approval for lane widening and flyover work for Sohna Road. NHAI, along with GMDA, is constructing flyover at Shankar Chowk, work on which is likely to resume from Saturday. GMDA’s flyover work at Basai Chowk will start from Sunday.Ashok Sharma, NHAI project director, said, “Approval for Sohna Road project and Shankar Chowk project has been granted and contractor will start work in day or two.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/some-construction-work-to-resume-in-city-all-social-distancing-lockdown-procedures-to-be-followed/story-aQc4e9gvK7pjkYQZxeeGHO.html
24-04-2020||City||Covid-19: Quarantined patient’s relative attacks doctor||Kasarvadavli police have arrested a man for attacking his family member’s doctor for making him waiting for a long time and not allowing him to keep tiffin and other items at the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) treatment centre.According to Kasarwadvli police, the accused, who is in his 30s, had gone to the Covid-19 treatment centre near Bunderpada where an infected family member is receiving treatment. The accused wanted to drop off some food and other items for his relative but was asked to take them back home.The man waited for a long time and then got into an argument with the authorities. He then attacked Doctor Sunil Katkar, 30, and slapped him several times for not allowing him to deliver the items.Senior police inspector K Khairnar said, “The accused is a family member of one of the patients. Because it is against the rules, the authorities didn’t allow him to keep the things in the hospital, following which he got into an altercation and slapped the doctor. We have therefore booked him under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-quarantined-patient-s-relative-attacks-doctor/story-cLJtbdwJVQhX3QamDG9VEM.html
24-04-2020||Chandigarh||Jalandhar, Mohali and Patiala account for 60% cases in Punjab||Even as Punjab has witnessed more than 100 Covid-19 cases in the past eight days bringing its tally to 298, nearly 60% of the total cases have been reported from the three districts of Jalandhar, Mohali and Patiala.These districts have contributed 181 cases to the overall tally of the state with most cases coming from Jalandhar and Mohali, 63 each.An analysis of the medical bulletin of the Punjab health department reveals that out of 100 cases recorded in the state in the past eight days (since April 17), 80 have been reported from the three districts, including 44 from Patiala and 29 from Jalandhar.Mohali, the district which witnessed a sharp spike in number of cases in the first fortnight of the current month, added only seven cases in the past eight days. If the figures of Pathankot (24) and SBS Nagar (19), the districts with fourth and fifth positions are also added, the tally of the five districts reaches 224, nearly 75% of the total cases in the state.Notably, 18 patients in SBS Nagar have already been cured of coronavirus while one person had died in the district. The SBS Nagar has no active case now.Of the 22 districts in Punjab, three districts – Bathinda, Tarn Taran and Fazilka -- have not witnessed any Covid-19 positive case.Apart from SBS Nagar, there are no active cases of the virus in Moga, Fatehgarh Sahib, Gurdaspur, Barnala and Rupnagar as all patients in these five districts have been cured.Five districts of Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, Muktsar, Sangrur and Ferozepur districts have now one each active case.“The fast addition of cases in Jalandhar and Patiala is a cause of concern. But it’s also a fact that because of strong mapping of the positive cases and containment of areas, we have been able to stop the spread of cases in more than half of the districts now. It’s a positive sign before the start of the deliberations for opening the lockdown in certain areas, post-May 3,” said health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu.HIGHEST EVER TESTING IN A DAYMeanwhile, Punjab on Friday ramped up its testing by taking 1,854 samples across the state, the highest in a day so far.“We have decided to expand the testing further in the coming days,” said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, health department spokesperson for COVID-19.The department also started pool testing in some districts on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jalandhar-mohali-and-patiala-account-for-60-cases-in-punjab/story-sZ2zt9dv2Q2kSicmWrXrAO.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||Sweating in their plastic suits, cops labour on in red zones||Head constable Anil Kumar Dhaka begins perspiring within five minutes of wearing a personal protective equipment (PPE) kit. Over the next few minutes, his hair gets drenched in sweat, his eyebrows turn moist and his uniform is stained. Soon, the sweat begins dripping down his legs, into his shoes.“In those moments I feel a strong urge to have a bath. It feels like the biggest luxury of life,” says Dhaka.Since Tuesday, Dhaka has been deployed outside a Covid-19 containment zone in South Delhi’s Deoli Extension, which is one of the 92 sealed areas in Delhi. His job requires him to don a PPE multiple times a day — four on Thursday, for instance.With the number of cases among police personnel rising over the last week, at 28 on Thursday, is imperative that Dhaka wears the PPE kit to protect himself and his family.Dhaka is deployed about 200 metres from a containment zone, where residents can’t step out of their homes and authorities have to ensure essentials are supplied to their doorsteps. While he isn’t required to wear the PPE while standing guard at the barricades, he needs to don it each time he enters the zone. “If a doctor or an officer needs to go into the containment zone, I have to accompany them. If a resident requires anything, I have to go in wearing the PPE,” the 43-year-old says.Dhaka’s PPE includes a single piece zipper gown, face shield, face mask, hair cover, hand gloves and shoe cover. It takes him about five minutes to kit up.As soon as wearing it, he fights a strong urge to take it apart immediately. “I want to rip apart the plastic. It just doesn’t allow air to pass through,” says Dhaka.The policeman’s shift timings, between 8am and 4pm, doesn’t help either. “The second half of the shift is the hottest in the day. So, I have let the residents know that if there is anything they need from me, they must place a request early in the day,” he says.Last week, the maximum temperature in Delhi had soared to nearly 40 degree Celsius. While Thursday was cooler in comparison, the maximum temperature in Delhi has been around 36 degree Celsius for the last few days and is expected to rise to 40 degrees by the time the lockdown ends, on May 3.Dhaka says that responding to the calls of the residents usually take just a few minutes, but up to two hours if he is accompanying a doctor or an official who is tracing contacts. He is afraid to even drink water inside the containment zone. “It is anyway a task to have water while being decked in a PPE,” he says.Covered from head to toe in the kit, speaking on his phone seems a Herculean task. He has asked his family members not to call him during his work hours. “In any case, my voice turns feeble when I wear the PPE. I don’t feel like talking,” he says.Upon returning to the barricade, he immediately pulls off the PPE, unbuttons his shirt and takes in a lungful of fresh air. “Since taking a bath is not possible (during duty), I use a towel to wipe myself clean. If the wind blows at that time, it gives a feeling of a shower,” he says.By the time he returns home on his motorcycle, his uniform has dried, but the white stains are a reminder of the important duty he has performed, albeit in uncomfortable circumstances.For the safety of his family as well as to ensure they don’t see what he has been through, he removes his uniform on the ground floor of his house and walks to the first floor in a towel. “I immediately dip my uniform in hot water. No one at my home sees what state it is in,” says the policeman, who is attached to the Tigri police station.The police say that they are doing all that is possible to limit the entry of their personnel into containment zones so that they don’t have to spend long periods in PPEs.“We are not deploying our policemen inside containment zones unless it is essential. Instead, we are using drones for surveillance inside the zones,” says Sudhanshu Dhama, assistant commissioner of police (Sangam Vihar).Dhama himself has to enter the containment zones in his jurisdiction. “I end up making several rounds in a day and each time, I have to wear a PPE. The PPEs are uncomfortable for all our officers, but it is something we can’t do away with,” says ACP Dhama.Head constable Dhaka, meanwhile, says he is more concerned about how he would deal with the PPEs when the humidity increases. “We’ll feel itchy and may get rashes. If zones continue to be contained for a long period, I’ll continue doing my job here. I just pray that someone comes up with a better PPE soon,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sweating-in-their-plastic-suits-cops-labour-on-in-red-zones/story-ID6PgXlfJsiobOyavCkGeK.html
24-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra to soon start clinical trials for plasma therapy, pool testing||With a nod from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the Maharashtra government is all set to start clinical trials of plasma therapy at Sassoon Hospital in Pune in the coming days. The state is yet to get permissions to try out the therapy at three hospitals in Mumbai, Nagpur and Solapur. The state has got permission for pool testing for Covid-19.Last week, the state had sought permission from the Centre to start clinical trials of plasma therapy and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine for treatment of Covid-19 patients. The process requires permissions from multiple central agencies such as ICMR, Central Drugs Safety Organisation (CDSO) and Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), among others. BCG is given to newborns and children to prevent childhood tuberculosis. It is said that mild and moderate cases of coronavirus got cured and severe cases got mild with BCG therapy. “We have got permission from the Centre to conduct clinical trials of plasma therapy and pool testing as well. Union minister for health and family welfare Dr Harsh Vardhan gave the nod in an interaction with the health ministers and secretaries in a video conference meeting on Friday,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those infected. The therapy can also be used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contracts. Pool testing involves checking up to five samples in a single test. So far, one sample is tested at a time. The pool testing algorithm involves the Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) screening of a specimen pool, comprising multiple samples. In case a pool test comes positive, each sample is tested individually. “Once cleared by the ethics committee of the state, it will start at Sassoon Hospital, Pune in the next three-four days. It will also start at JJ Hospital in Mumbai, Indira Gandhi Medical College in Nagpur and Solapur Medical College in Solapur once the permissions are in place,” said Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). “We have also sought permission for clinical trials of BCG vaccine, which will be carried out at JJ Hospital, Mumbai,” he said.Once the clinical trials are successful, the state can start plasma therapy and BCG vaccine treatment. Kerala and Delhi have already got permission to conduct the trials. Maharashtra is the most affected state with the maximum cases of coronavirus in the country. In his interaction with the Union health minister, Tope also suggested use of portable pulse oximeter and chest X-ray for early detection of coronavirus, which will ultimately help in reducing the mortality rate. Oximeters are crucial because Covid-19 patients can have pneumonia for days before they develop shortness of breath. Low oxygen levels are a way to detect such cases earlier without Covid-19 tests, the officials said.To deal with the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, Tope also suggested their re-use after getting them disinfected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-maharashtra-to-soon-start-clinical-trials-for-plasma-therapy-pool-testing/story-SUGZnu4HjPAJKfzReR6VqJ.html
24-04-2020||Lucknow||UP liquor sellers to get 7 days to clear stocks post lockdown||The UP excise department, which is staring at a loss of nearly Rs 3,200 crore due to closure of liquor shops since the lockdown began, has decided to grant shopkeepers seven days to clear stocks after the lockdown ends.The stock of those shopkeepers unable to clear leftover quota of last fiscal (the validity of licences was till March 31) would be destroyed, the excise department order says.Meanwhile, liquor sellers said in order to clear their leftover stock in seven days after the lockdown ends, some shop keepers could sell liquor at lower prices. As many as 3,711 country-made liquor shops did not take the required minimum guarantee quota (MGQ) of stock in March due to lockdown, forcing the excise department to provide relaxation to such shopkeepers who had approached the department, saying that the closure of liquor shops for over a month has impacted their businesses.Under the liquor policy, all country-made liquor shops have to necessarily buy minimum quota of stock from the government each month.Another 1,857 shops (country-made and IMFL sellers), whose renewal had been done and were required to pick two per cent stock above what they had bought from the government last year, cited helplessness in meeting the requirement due to lockdown.The government has relaxed the norms for them as well.The excise department is among the highest revenue earners for the state government, raking in Rs 78 crore per day for the state round the year, say officials. In Uttar Pradesh, more than four lakh people are directly associated with liquor business. “We have been hit due to no sales for over a month. What’s worse is the growing number of thefts that have been reported at liquor shops across the state,” said Kanhailal Maurya, a liquor seller and functionary of liquor sellers’ association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-liquor-sellers-to-get-7-days-to-clear-stocks-post-lockdown/story-v4DTaj2YQeDfC1uQV5NdbJ.html
24-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: BMC says 92,112 are in home quarantine in city||In the past 10 days, the number of people who have been home quarantined by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has doubled. As of April 15, around 43,249 citizens were home quarantined for 14 days; this number increased to around 92,112 as of Thursday, according to data released by the civic body.Further, the number of those under institutional quarantine was 3,271, as of April 15, and rose to around 6,000, by Thursday.On Friday, 242 new positive cases and 11 deaths due to the coronavirus were reported, according to state health department data. The number of cases rose to 4,447 on Friday with the death toll reaching 178.According to the BMC’s data, the number of citizens under home quarantine was 10,968 on April 6; 43,249 on April 15; 57,700 on April 17, and 92,112 on April 23. High- and low-risk contacts of positive patients, those having travel history, and people identified from fever clinics are typically home quarantined.The spike in the number of people home quarantined and institutionally quarantined has been attributed to the BMC’s focus on identifying maximum possible close contacts of Covid-19 patients. “We are identifying more citizens for home quarantine due to which the number has increased,” said Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer.The Central government’s team that had visited Dharavi earlier this week has also asked the BMC to increase quarantine facilities for the slum area.To increase the capacity at institutional quarantine facilities, BMC officials said they are not looking at any particular area considering the patients can also be shifted. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Every ward will have its limitations, so we are planning to have quarantine facilities spread across the city. Till now we have identified around 44,000 rooms for institutional quarantining.”The BMC anticipates that in a worst-case scenario, Mumbai will have around 70,000 positive cases by the end of May. As of Thursday, of around 4,200 positive cases, 1,647 were identified through fever clinics, contact tracing, and from containment zones. The number of citizens screened at fever clinics has increased from 1,906 as of April 10, to around 5,836 till April 22.Several wards that have the highest cases also have a higher number of containment zones. According to the BMC, six wards have around 2,179 of the city’s total 4,232 Covid-19 cases as of Thursday. These wards include G/South (Worli, Prabhadevi) with 534 cases; E (Byculla, Mumbai Central, Mazgaon) with 421 cases; L (Kurla, Powai) having 312 cases; K West (Andheri West, Oshiwara) having 311 cases; FN (Matunga, Sion, Wadala) having 305 cases, and G/North (Dharavi, Dadar, Mahim) with 296 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-bmc-says-92-112-are-in-home-quarantine-in-city/story-G6QONPJwp0pTrvTWtHPV6J.html
24-04-2020||Lucknow||Bareilly seals borders with Moradabad and Rampur||The district administration of Bareilly, which was declared corona-free by the state government on April 17, on Thursday night sealed its border with Moradabad and Rampur after 26 fresh cases were detected in the two neighbouring cities on Wednesday, said a top administrative official.While 21 people had tested positive in Moradabad five were confirmed Covid-19 positive in Rampur.“Our district has been declared Covid-19 free but we are still taking all measures to ensure that the infection does not re-enter here,” said Bareilly district magistrate Nitish Kumar.He said “Policemen manning the five entry points of Bareilly have been given thermal scanners, gloves and N-95 masks to ensure that while keeping themselves protected they don’t let any corona infected person slip into the district. They will scan all people associated with essential services coming from outside,” Kumar said.According to Kumar, no new Covid-19 positive case has been detected in the district after six Subhash Nagar residents recovered from the infection and were discharged from hospital on April 17. In this context, some relaxation might be given in the coming days.“However, this will be possible only if precautionary measures are strictly enforced,” he said. He said the policemen will scan all visitors and inform the health department if they find any suspected case. Kumar said pool sampling has also started and for the purpose 30 mobile labs have been pressed into service in the district. “Each mobile lab has the capacity to collect 100 samples and will cover at least two villages per day,” he said.Random samples of vegetable vendors, medicine shop owners and people connected with essential services are being taken for tests, the DM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bareilly-seals-borders-with-moradabad-and-rampur/story-g7Y1dF1nz6ucMnwHdNfv0N.html
24-04-2020||City||During the Covid-19 pandemic focused distribution is key, say HT Chandigarh readers||PUT EXPENSIVE PROJECTS ON HOLD TO GENERATE FUNDS FOR POORThe Indian government should come up with a scheme to put adequate funds in the accounts of the poor. The requisite data is already available with the authorities as it has been collected when people applied for gas connections etc. More funds should be allocated for rural development projects and more benefits given to small and large scale businesses to prevent retrenchments in the near future. The government can generate funds by putting on hold expensive projects such as the new Parliament building proposed to cost Rs 776 crore. Around 90% to 95% money collected by all political parties in the last two to three years in electoral bonds should be transferred to the PM Cares fund. Similarly, foreign tours of officials and ministers should be totally curtailed and all unnecessary expenditure by various ministries must end to help the needy.Suresh Verma, ChandigarhPEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHERE MONEY IS BEING SPENTThe government and NGOs are asking for donations from the public and government employees. It’s a good step but many people don’t know where this money is being utilised. Spendings should be done transparently. Also, people can make donations at the macro level to the administration of their cities to actually find out how their money is being spent.Avinash Goyal, via emailDONATE ACCORDING TO PEOPLE’S NEEDSA collective streamlined effort for welfare work is needed. For this, the administration must form a body to demarcate areas where food and funds are to be distributed. Local resident welfare associations and self-help groups can also identify the areas to be reached. Those who have stoves and fuel for cooking can be given ration and others who do not can be given cooked food. Wastage should be avoided. The administration should also create a ration bank. People should be encouraged to donate food at the local level.Karan Pundir, ChandigarhIDENTIFY GENUINE CASESCharitable organisations are doing their best to feed the hungry and give them essential items, but it has become challenging for them to identify people who are genuinely without any means of sustenance. However, in the times of a pandemic it is also not safe to visit people’s homes to verify their bona fides. Therefore, by seeking the help of public representatives of the area their status as real beneficiaries can be ascertained for effective distribution.Surinder Paul Wadhwa, MohaliDC SHOULD HANDLE CHARITY DISTRIBUTIONAll charity distribution work should be handled at district level by a committee headed by deputy commissioner or collector of the district. Members should include police commissioner or senior superintendent of police, municipal corporation commissioner; executive officer and civil surgeon and representatives of local NGOs. This committee should sanction and distribute goods through a chain of government officials, including sub-divisional magistrates and block development officers to different wards in the urban areas and panchayats in the rural areas. Naresh Johar, AmritsarPUNJABIS AT THE FOREFRONTWe people can proudly say that Punjabis are always at the forefront of charitable initiatives. Sikh organisations in particular are known worldwide for serving ‘langars’ whenever the situation demands. Now during the Covid-19 pandemic we have witnessed hundreds of such organisations serving community meals or distributing ration to the needy. I am a member of one such organisation in Amritsar which is going from village to village to distribute ration to the needy and also serving langar. We have put up handmade posters around the city with contact numbers of our organisation for people who need help. Food and ration will be provided to the needy. This is only for people staying close to Amritsar. All gurdwaras in Punjab are preparing langar. No one in this state can say he or she has slept hungry unless there are restrictions in their area, such as Jagatpura village in Mohali. Gurpreet Singh Malhotra, Kansal villageCHECKS AND BALANCES REQUIREDDonations can reach targeted populations when these are deposited in PM’s/CM’s relief funds though these don’t go directly to the public exchequer where expenditure is duly budgeted and passed by the legislature. Private or religious institutions are dutifully and rightfully doing altruistic service routinely or during some calamity, though there have been instances galore when scams involving charity-funds were exposed. All donations should reach the targeted groups and be subjected to checks and balances as government income for public welfare. Need of the hour, besides charity in cash and kind, is volunteer service by individuals, NGOs and citizens’ welfare associations.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaSAFETY MATERIAL FIRSTCharity can be done in phases. First the poor should be given masks and gloves to protect themselves. They should be provided with handwash, hand sanitisers and clean clothes. Then they should be given food, including breakfast and dinner. They should also be adequately compensated for the money they would have earned in this period.Ishita Nara, PanchkulaLOCAL COUNCILLORS SHOULD BE ROPED INKudos to the organisations involved in distributing langar. However, if local councillors are involved in distributing food and other material then it would help the administration cover all colonies and slums of the city and no one will go unfed. As and when the industries open, such identified poor can be offered employment through these charitable organisations. At this stage, the government must also refrain from transferring the meagre amount of Rs.500 into the accounts of beneficiaries, as they tend to make a beeline for the banks and don’t follow social distancing norms.Arvinder Kaur, MohaliDONATE TO NGOs OR PM CARES FUNDFunds or materials should only be donated to reputed NGOs or the PM Cares fund. Proper schedules should be drawn up when relief material is distributed and it should be ensured that nobody is left out.Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhMAKE RED CROSS SOCIETIES COLLECTION CENTRESEveryone from the middle class upwards should donate for the poor. The Red Cross Society can be made a collection centre for government relief material and all NGOs, political parties, social workers can donate dry rations, medicines, clothing and perishable items such as vegetables, cooked food, milk, bread etc. Municipal corporation employees can help. It should be supervised by the additional deputy commissioner or the senior superintendent of police. The city should be divided into five to 10 zones depending on the population density with each zone under the supervision of sub-divisional magistrates or deputy superintendent of police. NCC, NSS Bharat Scouts and Guides can be entrusted with the task of delivering relief materials. District transport organisation can supervise and arrange vehicles for distribution.Anil Vinayak, AmritsarIDENTIFYING NEEDY FAMILIES MOST IMPORTANTNGOs of repute should be involved in the distribution of charity. Sub-divisional magistrates should act as nodal officers assisted by their staff armed with data on locals requiring help obtained from field studies. They should draw up a comprehensive plan for distribution of charity among targeted populations involving their representatives in decision-making. It would be effective if volunteers from within such groups can give feedback on the success of such measures. As it appears from reports in newspapers and TV Channels, a fairly large number of the deserving populace remains unidentified because of typical bureaucratic handling planned in the comfort zone of AC board-rooms.SS Bhatti, ChandigarhCOUNCILLORS, SARPANCHES CAN IDENTIFY NEEDY FAMILIESLocal councillors and sarpanches who are familiar with families in their areas should be involved in welfare initiatives in order to ensure equal distribution of essentials.Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhGOVT SHOULD RELEASE NGOs LISTThe government should release a list of authorised NGOs to help the needy and donations and funds can be provided to them to distribute relief material to people. A layout plan should be made of city areas where relief material is required urgently and NGOs should be given different responsibilities or food distribution or cleaning up areas. All those involved in these initiatives should be equipped with safety kits such as sanitisers, protective suits, masks and gloves so that they don’t get infected.MuskanMAP ALL AREAS IN DETAIL FOR RELIEFFor streamlining distribution system, the selected areas should be mapped after consulting local residents so that each and every person is covered when food or other materials are distributed.Amanpreet Tangri, GharuanDO GOOD, BUT NOT AT THE COST OF SOCIAL DISTANCINGFor charitable endeavors to be streamlined and reach the targeted populations, we need efficient planning that minimises the virus spread. The government is required to create a city map, highlighting the spots and areas where food and other material have to be delivered. Since a number of people need help, the officials concerned can be assisted by people from the community who were previously doing the charity work. We can introduce new functionality in the Aarogya Setu app, to enable the needy to send requests for basic supplies, thus making it easier for the Central and state governments to track them. However, it is mandatory during lockdown that social distancing norms be followed.Raghu Mahendru, LudhianaA GOOD DEED SHOULD NOT BE PUBLICISEDWhen it comes to distribution of charity there should be checks to ensure that rations are not being stockpiled in a few households and are instead reaching the needy. Dial up as many people you know to find out how they are doing as a sign of togetherness and moral support as charity is not just about money. Those who are capable of sustaining themselves should donate but not flaunt how much they have given.Inderpal SinghDON’T FORGET ABOUT JOB CREATIONEffective streamlining of funds such as PM Cares has to be done with the support of local government. The focus should be helping poor at first while finding out opportunities to create work opportunities in future.Pawan Kumar, LudhianaDON’T LET OTHERS MAKE ILLEGAL PROFITSIt is imperative that the government provide the needy with essential utilities free of cost. One way is to streamline the process with a system of checks and balances to ensure middlemen do not make illegal profits from the same. Another solution is to identify the underprivileged to ensure only they get the benefits and no one else. Also, special care must be taken that social distancing is strictly followed when relief material is distributed.Sehaj Inder SinghUSE TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY POOR FAMILIESThe best possible way to avoid wastage is to ensure that every NGO has access to real time information on the areas where cooked meals are required and in what quantity. However, this is easier said than done. Smart technology can prove very beneficial here. An app can be created for needy families to send requests for food and this will help NGOs route supplies to areas needing it the most. NGOs and local authorities can create such platforms.Sachin Jain, LudhianaDISTRIBUTE FOOD, RATIONS AT PEOPLE’S DOORSTEPSThe government should distribute rations at the doorsteps of the needy through vehicles and take their signatures as proof. Also, volunteers should be sent to slums and colonies for random checks to ensure distributions systems are streamlined.Neha Chaurasia, Ludhiana||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/during-the-covid-19-pandemic-focused-distribution-is-key-say-ht-chandigarh-readers/story-aGTtkbzqVhstUVFO4DiI1O.html
24-04-2020||Mumbai||TB detecting app to be repurposed for Covid-19 pre-screening||A mobile app, which screened if an individual needed to get tested for tuberculosis (TB), based on the sound of the cough, is set to be repurposed as a pre-screening technology for Covid-19. The mobile application developed by Hyderabad-based start-ups Docturnal and Salcit are among seven deep science technologies identified by the Bengaluru-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms (C-CAMP) Covid-19 Innovations Deployment Accelerator (C-CIDA).“As the pandemic expands beyond local transmission, it is essential to step on the testing pedal. This pre-screening technology can help identify asymptomatic individuals, those quarantined in a sealed apartment and even in rural areas where there is a shortage of healthcare workers,” said Taslimarif Saiyed, director and chief executive officer, C-CAMP.C-CIDA’s third list of innovations for near-ready deployment in areas of screening, monitoring, diagnostics and novel approaches in therapeutics employs artificial intelligence/machine learning for stem cell therapeutics, ultrafast molecular assays for rapid diagnostics, cloud-based mobility for telemedicine support.Since its launch on March 26, C-CIDA received more than 900 applications, and have so far chosen 23 innovations that can play a role in containing the spread of the pandemic. “We have appointed a nodal officer to handhold each start-up and help them connect with funding opportunities including grants and investments, navigate regulatory pathways, and provide government and industry links to scale-up their innovative products,” said Saiyed.Similar to Docturnal and Salcit, Bengaluru-based Predible and Analytek are radiology-based (CT scans and X-rays) that offer real-time analysis for the initial prognosis of individuals suspected with Covid-19.With research throwing up Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a potential novel therapeutic approach for critically ill Covid-19 patients, MSC-based therapy is currently undergoing clinical trials in Europe. Bengaluru-based Stempeutics is the only Indian/Asian stem-cell therapy solution being tested alongside companies from Israel, USA and Europe. Huwel Lifesciences Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad, is an indigenous ICMR-approved NARI validated real-time qualitative PCR kit for quick diagnostics. “With all molecular reagents and diagnostic consumables made in-house, their ultrafast and sensitive chip-based PCR can handle large volumes making rapid and confirmatory diagnosis accessible,” said C-CIDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tb-detecting-app-to-be-repurposed-for-covid-19-pre-screening/story-ETbLeq15aG9C5jv5iUc3SN.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||Dates do a disappearing act from markets during Ramzan||Dates, one of the most sought after dry fruit during the holy month of Ramzan, which starts this week, is likely to missing from the plates this year — courtesy a supply chain that has been both broken and overwhelmed by the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown. According to traders, the lack of transport and labourers amid the lockdown has hit the business by about 60%. Wholesale traders are not being able to transport the dry fruit while retailers are failing to procure available stocks from the mandi, making the Ramzan staple literally disappear from the local markets.Dates are used by the devotees (rozedaars) to break their daylong fast during Ramzan. In India, dates are imported majorly to Mumbai and Gujarat from countries like Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Algeria, Malaysia and Israel. They are then brought to the city’s Azadpur agricultural produce market, from where they are supplied to different markets in Delhi and other states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.According to traders, this year due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the supply of the fruit has been severely hit. They said that dates could not reach the city markets in sufficient quantities, even though due to Ramzan the demand was high.A wholesale trader of dates at Azadpur Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Azadpur, Pankaj Chawla said that due to the lockdown, transportation of dates is very tough. The scarcity of labourers was also adversely affecting business. He explained that wholesalers purchase dates nearly two months in advance for Ramzan ,which are then kept in cold storages in nearby towns of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Dates are transported to Azadpur Mandi as and when required from these godowns.“Ramzan is the only month when we do brisk business due to high demand for dates. But this year, business has gone down by more than 60%. Dates are kept in godowns but we are not able to transport it to the mandi in required quantities. Since dates are not essential fruit, so we require special permission to transport them during the lockdown. Sometimes we get permission, but do not get the labour to load and unload vehicles as most of them have returned to their hometowns,” Chawla said.From Azadpur Mandi, dates are majorly transported to markets in areas such as Jama Masjid, Seelampur, Chandni Chowk, Okhla, Jamia and Mehrauli, which is further distributed in local areas. Dates are sold at a wholesale price ranging between Rs 100 to Rs 250 per kilo depending upon the quality. Traders said that dates imported from Iran and Iraq are heavy in demand by consumers in Delhi.Another trader at Azadpur mandi, Anil Dua said that during Ramzan over 600-tonne of dates are sold easily. But this year the supply chain is broken due to transportation problems and scarcity of labourers. So sales have plummeted.“Not only the supply is affected but buyers are also not able to reach the mandi to purchase dates. The stock, which we have at shops already, is yet to be cleared because retailers are not able to enter the wholesale market due to stringent regulations. Things have turned worse after a vegetable trader died of coronavirus,” Dua said.Ajit Ramneeklal Joshi, a member of Dates and Dry fruits Traders Association in Mumbai, said that many wholesalers in Delhi purchase dates from different importers in Mumbai and Gujarat but this year they were not able to supply due to the ongoing lockdown.“Goods (dates) are either stuck at ports or at godowns. Local supply is okay but due to the lockdown, we are neither getting labourers not the permit to transport dates to cities like Delhi, Lucknow, Jaipur. Business has gone down by about 60%-65%,” Joshi, who supplies dates to Delhi traders, said.Due to the lockdown, both dedicated and makeshift shops in many localities have not been set up this year, so dates are scarcely available in the retail markets.“Mandi authorities are not allowing buyers to enter the market, so we are unable to purchase dates. Labour shortage is another issue of concern. Hence this Ramzan. dates will not be easily available in retail markets across the city,” Yamin Khan, a retailer at Jama Masjid market said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dates-do-a-disappearing-act-from-markets-during-ramzan/story-kFY37LxH8VdE8yxluk16kL.html

Over 100 samples have been taken and more such samples will be taken in the coming days,” he added.Agrawal said to date, 1,378 samples have been taken, of which the reports of 1,201 samples have been received and 1,181 samples were found negative. “Of the 20 samples that were found positive, 17 were from Ludhiana and the rest were from other districts. Unfortunately, five patients have lost their lives and four patients (three from Ludhiana and one from Jalandhar) have been discharged after treatment,” he said, adding that 11 active patients are left in the district.‘SENIOR GOVT EMPLOYEE IN DISTRICT FOUND COVID POSITIVE’On Friday, a senior government employee in district was found Covid positive and her treatment has been started, the DC said.“To help the migrant labourers from Bihar who are stuck in Ludhiana, the Bihar government has launched a website–www.aapda.bih.nic.in–through which the migrants can get financial assistance (of ₹1,000 per person) from the Bihar government by filling up their details,” Agrawal said.“I appeal to the residents to stay at their homes for the benefit of the society and to follow all directions of the Punjab government,” he added.Besides, an interactive live session on the issue of opening of factories was held by the district administration on the Facebook page of the Ludhiana Police. It was attended by the DC, police commissioner Rakesh Kumar Agrawal and senior officials from the industries department, labour department, Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC).Participants were told that in view of the lockdown and as per the directions of the Punjab government, relaxations have been given to all industries to start their operations in district. The interested industrialists can apply at www.pbindustries.gov.in.“Once the operations of any industry begin and a worker is found Covid positive, then a proper inquiry will be conducted. If it is found that the industrialist failed to provide the necessary facilities to the workers, then action will be taken against the industrialist concerned. I appeal to the industrialists to follow all directions issued by the Punjab government,” the DC said during the session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maximum-samples-of-suspected-patients-are-being-sent-for-testing/story-ZL2lwu1A6LFefXihZgSFRN.html

Anupam has made two paintings on the walls of the jail campus that portray how people may checkmate Covid-19 by resorting to minor lifestyle changes.A commerce graduate, Anupam, 41, was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years by the district and session’s court on November 10, 2016, after he was convicted for killing his wife, Sandhya, for dowry.Anoop Singh, the superintendent of the district jail, said, “Anupam’s artistic skill was first seen by the jail authorities when he sketched a picture of Lord Shiva on a jail wall with a pencil. We then started showing him YouTube videos on painting techniques to embellish his skills. These efforts have transformed Anupam into a refined painter.”The inmate is now using his painting skills to spread awareness among prisoners about essential safety measures needed to prevent getting infected by coronavirus.Officials said that Anupam plans to make some more paintings to depict the importance of social distancing and the moral duty of the masses to honour frontline corona fighters, as a token of gratitude to them for their struggle to protect the people from the pandemic.He also plans to spread the message through his art that attacks on doctors and police personnel are an ‘act of devilry’. The paint, brush and other material are being arranged by the jail officials.A few days ago, Anupam had also composed a poem to inspire prisoners to collectively fight the virus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/jail-inmate-s-wall-portraits-teach-how-to-fight-against-corona/story-MrPPhzCUpztJL5ERy0c5yI.html
24-04-2020||Mumbai||Monsoon preparedness: BMC may allow work at construction sites amid lockdown||With monsoon approaching, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) may allow controlled construction activities for incomplete constructions to make them monsoon-ready and avoid damage during rains. However, this will not be allowed in containment zones. With this move, BMC wants to eliminate possibility of flooding, subsequent landslide, and creation of mosquito breeding grounds, which may lead to additional health hazards during the Covid-19 pandemic.The allowed constructions include completion of foundation or basement of buildings, retaining wall which separates the site from adjoining buildings. A senior civic official associated with the development said, “Sites where construction began but abruptly stopped due to lockdown, need to be brought to a safe level. During monsoon, construction sites pose many hazards; especially those of mosquito breeding grounds, landslides or damage to existing structure due to flooding at half-completed construction sites.”Another senior civic official said, “Malaria and dengue have some symptoms that are similar to early signs of Covid-19, such as weakness and fatigue. There will be large scale panic if these vector-borne diseases are on the rise during the outbreak.” BMC may also allow structural stability work in buildings where it had already begun as well as water proofing work.However, the allowed construction sites will have to follow rules including camping of labour at the site, ensuring labourers wear masks during work, disinfecting common areas such as toilets and pantries twice a week, isolation facility in case workers fall sick, weekly visits by doctors to examine the workers as well as conducting rapid test on workers.Dr Niranjan Hiranandani, president of National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco) said, “Naredco welcomes the permission to carry out ‘urgent pre-monsoon work for safety purpose’, as it will ensure no damage happens to on-going projects as a result of water-logging during monsoon. It has already brought out a set of norms to be followed in such situations, and these will ensure that all necessary precautions are taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monsoon-preparedness-bmc-may-allow-work-at-construction-sites-amid-lockdown/story-a6d5WdwtSLNmwQdVh4jVIL.html

Principal Jacob Thomas, 58, took up the initiative to stitch masks in the school’s activity area after he failed to procure masks. “When the lockdown began, the first things I tried to acquire were masks and sanitiser. I found there was a shortage of these, and hence I decided to make masks and sanitiser for myself and others. I learned the process from a tutorial by World Health Organization,” said Thomas.Along with stitching masks and making sanitiser, the school canteen is being used to cook food for 200 needy people.“When there was a direction to shut the school, some of the contract labourers working inside the school agreed to stay and help me make masks. I also hired seven professional tailors to stitch the two-layered cloth masks. We managed to provide 2,000 masks to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC),” said Thomas. Thomas along with his wife, two children and two other teachers of the school make the masks alongside the tailors and workers. “Preparing sanitiser was difficult as there were no alcohol available. However, I managed to get 400 litres of alcohol and prepared it by myself. I found people to help me pack the same in bottles,” the principal said. Around 6,000 masks were delivered to railway employees and workers while the remaining masks along with sanitiser were distributed to needy community in Kalyan and nearby areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-railway-school-distributes-20-5k-masks-600l-sanitiser/story-ycEt7eOs6JHZ3pfVsJuIGN.html

The women volunteers are working with non-governmental organisations like Apnalaya (which works with urban poor), Coro India (which works with marginalised communities) and Sneha (which works in the field of public health). The masks are intended for relief workers.With a little help from Coro India, which pays ₹5 per mask and supplies the material, 75 women from 10 Mumbai-based women’s self-help groups have made 350 washable, reusable masks. These women worked as domestic help or were employed in local industries until the lockdown was enforced, said Rahul Garware of Coro India, adding that they currently have no source of income. “I stitch 30 masks a day. My family helps me cut, wash and iron the cloth,” said Kiran Shaha, a Chembur resident.In the slum area of Shivaji Nagar, 15 women, who are part of Apnalaya’s project Svavalamban, have stitched 900 masks till date. “They [the women] used to stitch bags and accessories before. However, they have no business since the lockdown so they came up with this idea,” said Malathy M of Apnalaya.Both Coro and Apnalaya shared a manual issued by the Centre on making re-usable masks with the volunteers.Garware said, “Close to 30 women working with us have made 6,500 masks. It was one of the rural self-help groups that came up with the idea since many of the women own machines. In Mumbai too, we are aiming to make 5,000 masks.” Sushma Shende of Sneha said volunteers have made and distributed close to 250 masks. Dhaaga, a micro-enterprise initiative supported by Tata Power, has made over 1,20,000 masks in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/women-join-hands-with-ngos-to-stitch-masks-for-relief-staff/story-eKkZsSL5WklHwc5K03iJzM.html
24-04-2020||City||Panchayati Raj Diwas: Ludhiana administration hails villagers’ efforts to fight Covid-19||On the occasion of Panchayati Raj Diwas, the district administration on Friday lauded the efforts of panchayats that have blocked the entry points of their villages for the safety of residents.The administration’s remarks came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a video conference with different gram panchayats across the country, said that coronavirus crisis has taught the citizens to be self-sufficient.‘AWARENESS ACTIVITIES IN 60% VILLAGES’As per the district officials, most of the villages have banned the entry of outsiders by installing checkposts at the entry points and villagers are guarding the same day and night. Awareness activities are also being conducted in 60% villages. Further, efforts are on to provide ration to the needy at village-level only.In-line with the efforts of panchayats, the district administration urged the city residents to follow the footsteps of the former and stay inside their homes during the ongoing lockdown. “Panchayati Raj Diwas is observed to make the gram panchayats aware about their rights and other responsibilities, but this time, the villagers are leading the way in the fight against coronavirus,” the attendees said.At Baddowal village, the youth can be seen guarding the entry/exit points ever since the lockdown was imposed. Visitors are being stopped at the checkpoints and provided hand sanitisers by the volunteers. Village panch, who is leading the youth, said, “People vote for the panchayats for the benefit and development of their villages, that is why, it becomes the duty of the panchayats to work for the betterment of residents.” He also said that checkpoints are set up from early morning till late evening everyday and villagers are deployed there in shifts, adding that registration numbers and details of all vehicles crossing the checkpoints are also noted down. “No outsider is allowed to enter the village and only the outer roads can be used to move ahead to the neighbouring villages,” the panch said.‘RATION DISTRIBUTION BY GURDWARA’Similar arrangements have been made at the checkpoints established at the entry points of Gill village. Sarpanch Harpreet Singh Mika Gill said the outsiders are allowed to enter the village only for purchasing medicines from a medical store located in the area and for visiting banks. “If the residents need any essential item such as milk, they call up the supplier and collect the supply at the entry point only,” he said. Besides, five dairy units of the village have been facilitated to sell milk. They supply their produce to the outsiders only at the entry points by maintaining optimum distance, the village head said, adding that ration is also distributed among the needy by the panchayat and gurdwara management committee of the village. The people’s representative also said that sanitisers and protective gear have been provided to the residents guarding the checkposts.Deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal appreciated the efforts of the gram panchayats and appealed to the residents of other villages to enforce self-lockdown in interest of the society. He also urged the city residents to stay indoors and follow the guidelines given by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchayati-raj-diwas-ludhiana-administration-hails-villagers-efforts-to-fight-covid-19/story-tt0eUElqAy1iUVxswAq7jK.html

Men in khaki were the only ones on the guest list, who arrived in a patrol jeep blowing siren and carrying a vanilla cake to celebrate the occasion.Almost over a month ago, Dr Varmani and his wife Geeta had planned to throw a lavish party on their 50th wedding anniversary but the plan was foiled as their son and daughter, who live in the United States, could not come to Lucknow due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Relatives and friends also could not come. So the cops decided to step in.The couple was sitting alone when a team led by additional deputy commissioner of police (additional DCP) crime, Dinesh Puri along with inspector of Gomti Nagar police station Dheeraj Kumar surprised them. The police officials brought a cake to convey good wishes on their wedding anniversary.“We came to know about the elderly couple from one of his neighbours, who informed us about their wedding anniversary and their loneliness in the absence of their children. We decided to gift them a cake so that they could celebrate the anniversary together but things unfolded differently when we reached their doorstep,” said the additional DCP.He said the couple was so happy and emotional that they invited the team inside their house and cut the cake. “On their request, the siren of the police patrol jeep was also played for a few minutes to make neighbours realise that they were celebrating their anniversary,” he said.Puri said the couple’s celebration for 10 minutes also made the police personnel emotional when they shared the 50-year–old moments of their marriage with them. S-I AWARDEDA sub-inspector of Gomti Nagar police station Amar Nath Yadav was awarded cash prize of ₹10,000 by Lucknow commissioner of police (CP) Sujeet Pandey for his humanitarian act when he jumped into a 10-feet drain to pull out the body of an unidentified youth floating in it.The body was found inside the drain near Ram Bhawan intersection in Viram Khand-2 of Gomti Nagar on Thursday. The S-I single handedly pulled out the body in the absence of sanitary workers as some passers-by kept watching instead of helping him. The body has been sent for post-mortem examination and efforts are on to ascertain its identity.

The group of villagers returned home on April 22.”After the labourers returned to the village, the sarpanch asked them to go in quarantine at a school outside of the village till the medical examination was done.He said, “Since the labourers didn’t inform the administration before or after returning home, the sarpanch of the village informed the district administration about them and asked them to stay in a school outside the village till their medical examination was supposed to be conducted. The labourers were to be medically examined and quarantined on Thursday. Rajbhan was found hanging from the branch of a tree in jungles outside the village on Thursday morning.”The SP said the man perhaps got emotionally hurt after being asked by the sarpanch and others to stay outside the village. There was no complaint from the family members of the deceased to the police about any foul play behind the death. However, the body was sent for a post-mortem examination and police are investigating the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/tribal-labourer-about-to-be-quarantined-commits-suicide/story-drPKMueqJfrsYa9nYwqXcK.html
24-04-2020||City||Amid coronavirus outbreak, Ludhiana residents battle water woes||Amid the ongoing coronavirus lockdown, around 450 families of Hero Suman Nagar and Satguru Nagar in Lohara are dependent on tankers for the supply of water. As the water in tankers lasts for about one hour, people gather around the vehicles, not caring two hoots for social distancing norms. At times, residents even indulge in verbal spats to collect the water first. Locals say the supply of water tankers is also not regular due to which people try to store as much water as they can, often resulting into spats. On Friday, no one from the two colonies got water and no tanker came during the day, the residents said.Akashdeep of Satguru Nagar said, “Fifteen days before the lockdown, the lone tubewell that supplies water to both the areas had stopped functioning. Municipal corporation workers took away its motor for repair, but never returned. Since then, we are dependent on tankers, but they are also not regular.” Romi Raj, a Hero Suman Colony resident, said clashes between people is a common sight in the localities. KL Sachdeva of Satguru Nagar appealed to the authorities to intervene in the matter, saying that people don’t follow social distancing norms, increasing the chances of Covid-19 infection. According to women, they do not wash clothes daily, their family members take bath on alternate days amid the scarcity of water and fear that their problems might rise with an increase in temperature in the coming days.‘AUTHORITIES TO BE BLAMED IF CASES RISE’Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Sandeep Shukla said the locals are suffering a lot. “They (locals) have made several complaints, but to no avail,” he said, adding that in case of Covid-19 outbreak in the area, the authorities would be responsible. SAD councillor from ward number 29, Prabhjot Kaur, said she has raised the issue before the MC officials several times, adding that she is supplying water to the colonies in tankers, but it is not adequate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-coronavirus-outbreak-ludhiana-residents-battle-water-woes/story-hP2Byyk30zPlsqUhpyCIaP.html

24-04-2020||City||Migrants, labourers, slum dwellers of Mohali want change in menu, demand rotis instead of rice||More than a month into curfew now, the migrants, labourers and slum dwellers who are being supplied cooked food daily by the district administration, say they are bored of eating rice daily and want a change in the menu.In Mohali district, as many as 18 community kitchens operate daily to provide cooked food to around 30,000 people. Each kitchen caters to a particular area.In Kharar, these community kitchens were operational till April 20, but were later discontinued amid fears of spread of coronavirus. Dry ration is now supplied instead.The menu of the community kitchens depends entirely on the donations received in terms of raw material. Considering the inability of the administration to engage huge manpower, the kitchens resort to making food that requires less cooks. As a result, making rotis is not viable and the needy are provided with rice and cooked vegetables or pulses instead.SPECIAL DESSERT REQUESTS A DAILY OCCURRENCE “We regularly get requests to bring something sweet along with the food. Special requests for paneer and soya chunks are received, too. Interestingly, most of the people making requests for rotis are from states where rice is a staple,” said a senior administrative official, not wishing to be named.“We received bulk donations of potatoes and cauliflower once, so we repeated the same dish for a few days. The residents called up complaining that the menu was repetitive,” said another official. “A few days ago, potatoes and rice were being served in a market in Dera Bassi, but many refused to eat. Apparently, word had spread soya chunks had been served in another part of the sub-division. It took a lot of effort to convince them that those were rumours,” he added.“We have to change the menu daily and introduce varieties like chhole-puri, roti-sabzi, kadi-chawal,” said JP Singh, president of Phase 4 gurdwara that supplies cooked food in different areas of Mohali.Rajinder Singh, manager of Amb Sahib gurdwara in Phase 8, said, “We stopped going out to distribute community meals after the administration asked us to restrict movement. But, we are feeding those who come to the gurdwara premises on a daily basis.” DEMAND FOR DRY RATION GROWINGBeneficiaries demand for dry ration is also growing by the day. “Kichdi se kya banta hai, roti sabzi ho too zada acha hai (Rice and lentils are not enough; if we are served vegetables, that would be better),” said Nirmala of Sukhna Colony, adding, “Ration de dete to hum khud hi ghar mein bana le khana. Sabzi aaram se mil jati hai. Roz line mein khada hone se bach jayenge. (If we are provided with dry ration instead, we can cook the food ourselves. Vegetables are available anyway. This way we wouldn’t have to stand in queues.)” Sakuntala, while standing in a queue for cooked food in a Zirakpur market, said, “Only one packet of food is provided for two persons, which is not enough for the whole family. Administration should instead supply dry ration, so that we can eat well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-labourers-slum-dwellers-of-mohali-want-change-in-menu-demand-rotis-instead-of-rice/story-LcoMGgcBWhTivA9EV43u6N.html
24-04-2020||Mumbai||Friday was the cleanest air day so far this year: SAFAR||Two days after the city recorded its lowest air quality for the year, the pollutant-measuring indicator further plummeted on Friday. The air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 42 for PM2.5 pollutant, falling in the ‘good’ category, making Friday the cleanest air day so far this year, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). It was 56 (satisfactory) on Thursday and 46 (good) on Wednesday. SAFAR researchers said a drop in temperatures from Monday’s 37.8 degrees Celsius to 34.9 degrees Celsius on Friday combined with the setting in of sea breeze at the right time helped the decline in pollution levels. Mazgaon had the cleanest air in the city with an AQI of 14 while BKC had comparatively higher AQI at 61 (satisfactory). Meanwhile the weather bureau said respite from hot and humid conditions was expected over the weekend as the maximum temperature is expected to drop a degree Celsius below normal due to the western disturbance of north India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/friday-was-the-cleanest-air-day-so-far-this-year-safar/story-4hjQX3xKHiLpjdewxklpxK.html

Police is questioning him to establish his antecedents,” Akil added.The police were keeping a close watch on him, when they received a tip-off about the suspect. When a crime investigation unit team accosted him and asked him to produce his passports, he allegedly tried to mislead the police by claiming that he was not carrying his documents on him and tried to escape. He was, however, nabbed, said police.Police said the man’s passport had expired on April 17 this year and his visa had expired in November, 2015.During the course of the interrogation, Ahmed claimed that his visa and other travel-related documents had already expired and he had submitted a copy of these documents to Foreigners Registration Officer (FRO) in Pune during his stay there in 2016 for renewal.Akil said that in order to mislead the police, the man also told police that he had also applied at UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) but his application was under consideration.Police has written to FRO, Pune to verify his statement, said police.Ahmed has been sent to 14-day judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/22-year-old-yemeni-national-nabbed-for-staying-illegally-in-gurugram/story-kTxquEGaSKphx1YPCJqNeO.html
24-04-2020||City||IIT-Ropar develops Covid screening device||The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, has developed an infrared vision system for identification and easy screening of suspected Covid-19 patients.The team comprising associate professor of department of electrical engineering from the institute Ravibabu Mulaveesala, post-doctoral researcher Vanita Arora, and MS Suresh from SS Automation Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, has developed a prototype remote temperature mapping device for monitoring the infrared radiation emanating over the human face and is looking for clinical tests by medical industry experts.The system detects the suspects based on the relative temperature measurement over selected features of the face with self-reference, which makes the screening process easy and risk-free as compared to the limited range hand-held thermal imaging devices widely used at various crowded places, Mulaveesala said.The portable, remote-controlled system measures wide range of temperatures with a pixel resolution of 160 x 120 and sensitivity of 70mK. Further, the thermal images, captured within two seconds, are exported to the processing unit wirelessly and the decision — saying infected, suspected or healthy — will be displayed on the connected desktop computer almost in no time.Mulaveesala said the prototype was ready and the medical industry experts had been invited for clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/iit-ropar-develops-risk-free-covid-screening-device/story-EP1gp5E7oCgiXdXpYafpcK.html

The abnormality is associated with severe physical and mental handicap and is not compatible with normal life, the board had stated, adding that the termination of pregnancy is possible without endangering the life of the mother.The couple had approached the high court on April 22, with a plea seeking termination of pregnancy. Acting on the plea, the high court had sought opinion of the board. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, does not permit termination of pregnancy beyond 20 weeks. The court, however, took note of the recommendation, which it said is based upon internationally recognized medical guidelines, according to which, termination of pregnancy beyond 22 weeks can also be safely done.The high court directed the PGIMER to admit the woman after taking all necessary precautions required in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic and perform the procedure at the earliest. On the request of the woman’s counsel, the court also asked PGIMER to treat the case as one of a poor patient and give all assistance available for such patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-allows-termination-of-24-week-pregnancy-of-sangrur-woman/story-FXzgvXMlNhlCMpvS20H4vM.html
24-04-2020||City||Stage 2 of National Talent Search Examination postponed, students disappointed||The postponement of stage 2 of the National Talent Search Examination (NTSE) in the wake of coronavirus outbreak has left many Class 10 students disappointed as they were preparing for the exam after they cleared the stage1 exam in February this year.The exam, which was earlier scheduled to be held on May 10, is conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). The new date will be soon intimated by the NCERT.​From Ludhiana, 25 students (including two government school students) have cleared stage 1 of the NTSE exam. “The lockdown has been extended by the government till May 3 and we don’t know about when the authorities will conduct the exams. In fact, the lockdown can even be extended further,” the two students said.Ektapreet Kaur, 15, a student of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Bharat Nagar, said, “I have been preparing for both (board and competitive) exams for the last two months. I get a lot of time for preparation as the school is closed. I feel dejected as the competitive exam has also been postponed. Nevertheless, health should be given the top priority and so staying at home is the right step to combat the virus.”​“I have been spending three hours daily to revise the concepts of Class 10 board exams. I devote two hours during the evenings to prepare for the competitive exam”, she added. However, Parneet Kaur ,15, a student of Government Senior Secondary School, Hargobindpura, said, “Despite the school being closed and board exams having been postponed, I am in contact with my schoolteachers and prepare for the competitive exam.”“Though I am upset that the competitive exam has been postponed, I am glad that I have now got more time to prepare for this exam and become eligible for the scholarship,” added Kaur, who belongs to Dully village.​Yuval Goyal, a student of Sacred Heart Convent School, Sarabha Nagar, scored 185 out of 200 (the highest marks in the district) in the stage 1 exam. He said, “I have opted for the non-medical stream and online classes have been started by the school authorities. I was expecting to get free after appearing for the stage 2 exam on May 10. Now, if the council will conduct the exam in June, I will be burdened with studies as the syllabus of Class 11 is already vast.”​Last year, 5,322 students from Ludhiana appeared for the NTSE held on November 3.​Students who will clear the stage 2 of NTSE will become eligible for an annual scholarship of ₹15,000 (₹1,250 per month) for two years (classes 11 and 12) and ₹2,000 per month at the undergraduate level.​||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stage-2-of-national-talent-search-examination-postponed-students-disappointed/story-LSPG48ymh0sQkoqNikjzYP.html

An official at Sunaria prison privy to the development said Ram Rahim’s mother Naseeb Kaur had applied for his three-week parole on April 13 to attend to her, citing her poor health condition.“The jail authorities rejected the parole plea on the basis of Sirsa deputy commissioner’s report. The DC had formed a board of doctors to examine Naseeb Kaur’s health. The doctors concluded that she was stable and did not face any major health issue. The second reason mentioned in the DC’s report was fear of deteriorating law and order situation in Sirsa district amid the extended lockdown,” the official, who sought to remain anonymous, added. He said they have received five applications to grant parole to Ram Rahim ever since he was moved to the Sunaria jail. Sunaria jail superintendent Sunil Sangwan, regarding rejection of dera chief’s parole, said that he was not authorised to speak on the matter. However, jail minister Ranjeet Singh Chautala confirmed that Ram Rahim’s parole was rejected on the recommendation of Sirsa DC.

The move comes after cabinet minister and MLA (west) Bharat Bhushan Ashu held a meeting with the councillors at mayor Balkar Sandhu’s camp office here on Friday.Ensuring the councillors that no pick and choose policy is being adopted by the administration and the Congress leadership, Ashu assured them that the ration would be supplied to their respective wards without any discrepancy.The councillors of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) attended the meeting. They were led by leader of opposition in the general house, Harbhajan Singh Dang. MC commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar and SDM Amarjit Bains were also present in the meeting. Dang and SAD councillor Jaspal Giaspura said that the decision to call off the move to stage a protest was made after the cabinet minister assured them that the ration will reach to all the wards in two days. We will continue to fight if the administration fails to provide ration to the needy, said Dang.Earlier alleging anomalies in the ration distribution, the councillors on Thursday had gathered at Zone-D office and had announced to stage a protest outside the DC’s house on Monday. The councillors had alleged that the administration in connivance with the Congress was providing ration only to the Congress leaders, who were further providing essentials to their family and friends only, while the general people were starving.Meanwhile, SAD district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon wrote an open letter to DC Agrawal asking the administration not to adopt pick and choose policy in ration distribution.

24-04-2020||Lucknow||10 UP cities fight Covid-19 war ‘smartly’, and how!||Covid-19 pandemic is no less than a war. And what’s coming in handy in the fight against the deadly virus is the ‘war room’ set up in each UP district to manage different tasks on a real-time basis.While all the districts are handling the crisis in a best possible manner, 10 UP cities are managing the pandemic smartly — all thanks to paraphernalia, including the Integrated Command & Control Centre (ICCC), they got under the Smart City project.“The infrastructure was there. Only it was used for a different purpose. When the Covid-19 challenge was thrown upon us, we tweaked the functioning of the ICCC into processes needed for pandemic management and the results are for all to see,” said Deepak Kumar, principal secretary, department of urban development, UP.The day the government announced the nationwide lockdown, the ten municipal bodies with Smart City project —Lucknow, Agra, Varanasi, Saharanpur, Moradabad, Bareilly, Prayagraj, Jhansi, Aligarh, and Kanpur —turned their respective ICCC into war rooms for Covid-19.“These war rooms with their robust integrated technology support are serving well to the entire gamut of Covid-19 activities,” said Kumar while listing the functions which the district administration is managing through the ICCC.“Hotspot management, grocery-vegetable helplines, security and surveillance, including home isolation and institutional quarantine of Covid-19 positive cases and suspects, traffic monitoring, lockdown monitoring, sanitization, cleaning, water supply, sewer — all are being managed from here,” said Kumar. Additionally, the tweaked version of the ICCC also network about telemedicine, black marketing response system, food for the needy scheduling-monitoring, community kitchen management, and animal welfare. They also relay live telecast of advisories through VMS (variable message signs) systems and public address systems, and aid video conferencing with Lucknow.“In Agra, a 25-member team works round the clock at the war room much like the teams in nine other Smart City war rooms. The Varanasi centre has its ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) with 25 terminals and an additional helpdesk. Just the way Varanasi centre is networked with 404 surveillance camera for monitoring and 49 public address system, same is the network in the other Smart Cities,” said Dr Kajal, director, local bodies, Uttar Pradesh.These war rooms do have helpline integrated into them and they do realtime data crunching, information and response sharing back and forth between the stakeholders.“Incidentally, most of the ten Smart Cities also happen to be among the high Covid-19 incidence districts in the state and they have a significant edge in management over other cities that lack such integrated system. Such tech networked management system proves all the more relevant in crisis management,” said an official.When asked, why cases are rising drastically in cities like Agra or Lucknow if the smart city set ups are aiding the fight against Covid-19, Dr Kajal said: “Smart City is the tech support for information, logistics, movement etc. It cannot do anything to the transmission or pathogenesis (the manner of development of a disease ) of Covid-19. Smart City is an integrated administrative tool and not a medical set up in itself and cannot do anything to the medical aspect of the disease. It is helping in a big way in managing non-medical aspects and interventions. For instance, if someone with symptoms is hiding, the technology in itself cannot do anything.”Caption 1: Agra Smart City’s Integrated Command & Control Centre (ICCC) converted to Covid-19 War Room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/10-up-cities-fight-covid-19-war-smartly-and-how/story-Ci5zysN41kFQvP2nRBqvwO.html

24-04-2020||Mumbai||IATA estimates 47% drop in passenger numbers in India in ’20||International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents major world airlines, has estimated that India’s domestic and international passenger traffic will decline by 47% in 2020 as compared to 2019. IATA said that Indian aviation and related sectors like tourism will suffer 2.93 million job losses, with the number of annual passengers falling to 89.7 million.The latest estimates from IATA indicate a worsening of the country’s impact from the Covid-19 crisis in the Asia Pacific region. Airlines in the Asia Pacific region will see the largest revenue drop of US$113 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, and a 50% fall in passenger demand in 2020 compared to 2019.Conrad Clifford, IATA’s regional vice president (Asia-Pacific) identified India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, and Thailand as priority countries that need to take action. “The situation is deteriorating and airlines are in survival mode. There will be more casualties if governments do not step in urgently to ensure airlines have sufficient cash flow to tide them over this period,” he said.“Providing support for airlines has a broader economic implication. Jobs across many sectors will be impacted if airlines do not survive the Covid-19 crisis. In Asia-Pacific, 11.2 million jobs are at risk, including those that are dependent on the aviation industry, such as travel and tourism,” Clifford added.While airlines continue to transport essential goods, after the Covid-19 pandemic is contained, governments will need to look to them for help with economic recovery, to connect manufacturing hubs and support tourism. Keeping this in mind, governments need to act urgently now, IATA stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iata-estimates-47-drop-in-passenger-numbers-in-india-in-20/story-L4uoMHqjWy89uv826I1njN.html

I am worried,” said Veronica, a student from Himachal Pradesh who stayed at girls’ hostel number 10.Sreshtha Rajput, who is from Uttar Pradesh, and stayed at girls’ hostel number 10, said, “The university administration has no plan and we are being told to collect our belongings.

These channels are GDI, GDII, GDIII and GDIV. All these channels are free of cost and are aided by ministry of human resource development, information and broadcasting ministry and Prasar Bharti, an official said. “Doordarshan channels must be used extensively because students in remote and backward areas may not have access to Internet. We are continuously guiding students and providing them information that can help them prepare for their examinations,” said principal secretary higher education, Monika S Garg. These channels are specially designed to impart education to the students in every nook and corner of the state. Students need only to switch on their television sets and study in their homes without having to install any device for Internet or downloading any data, she said.The schedule about the teaching is also displayed on TV sets. Not only this, students preparing for competitive exams are also being provided online study material to help them learn and solve problems analytically, Garg said.The department has also hinted at yet another breakthrough, i.e. DTH channels for the benefit of students of degree colleges. There are very useful for students who do not have access to the Internet or may not be having devices that carry data services, an official said. In addition, government has also launched Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), which is a course of study, made available on the internet free of cost to a large number of users. MOOC is a platform owned by SWAYAM Bharat which provides study material for the fields of engineering, law, management, human resources, social sciences and business studies, she said. In the series of these efforts, an important tool is that of virtual labs that are designed to help students understand the practical application of theoretical concepts as to how to conduct practicals, collect necessary data, develop an understanding and how to simulate online in order to visualise results of these practicals.National Digital LibraryHigher education department also mentioned about National Digital Library of India, which is providing all necessary course material that can be downloaded and read online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/take-advantage-of-dd-channels-higher-education-department-tells-students/story-k1OJy1KH2TrdFa9aYG0tSL.html

24-04-2020||Delhi||With hospitals out of bounds, home health care providers step in to help||Thirty-four-year-old Shikha, whose mother is a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy, was in Catch-22 situation when the lockdown was first announced. She knew that taking her mother to the hospital for chemotherapy sessions was going to put her mother at risk of contracting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and not having her treatment would mean her cancer would grow.Out of sheer desperation, Shikha searched high and low for options and got to know about a home health care service provider that was offering chemotherapy at home. After undergoing two sessions of the chemotherapy at home, her mother now believes that such services are essential in times of crisis.“Initially, I was a little apprehensive about chemo at home because at hospitals, one tends to get personal attention and care. This is extremely significant for a cancer patient. But, after availing of the sessions from home health care service Portea Medical, I got to know that their process was indeed beneficial,” she said.Home health care services is supportive care which is generally provided by licensed health care professionals and include both medical treatment and daily assistance to patients and the elderly.The service is seeing many takers during the lockdown. Home health care service providers say there has been an increase in calls seeking nursing services, care for ailments such as diabetes, and even flu for which patients would have otherwise visited a hospital.Dr Vishal Sehgal, medical director of Portea Medical, said the he has been receiving more calls seeking care for illnesses for which the patients would have, on a normal day, visited the out-patient department of any hospital.“We try to sanitise our staff and conduct regular checks with all necessary precautions to give the best services to our clients,” he said.Prateek of Elders Home Care Services said while the number calls to his office has not increased as such, a majority of calls these days seek 24-hour services, rather than the 12-hour services, as clients fear that if the health service provider leaves, (s)he might contract the Covid-19 infection.“We are only entertaining clients for 24-hour services because along with transport issues, there is a safety issue as well. Even attendants are not comfortable moving in and out,” he said.Aarti Sharma, a nursing staff at Life Circle Health Services, says calls have dipped because everyone is working from home, so they can look after their near and dear ones. Only those who do not have a care provider are calling for their services.“We are getting more calls from the elderly people. Since helps have stopped coming, and relatives are unable to do such work, we have major calls from the elderly seeking our assistance. Other patients who are bedridden, semi-mobile or paralysed also seek our help,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-hospitals-out-of-bounds-home-health-care-providers-step-in-to-help/story-6q7y3liswO93oBxD8FceWO.html

The state claimed that as per the apex court’s directions, 4,060 out of 11,000 prisoners had been released on interim bail or parole. It also assured the bench that no prisoner in jails across Maharashtra was affected by Covid-19.

Ten buses carrying 300 pilgrims started from Nanded on Thursday night and are expected to reach Punjab, Haryana and Delhi by Saturday evening. Nearly 2,400 pilgrims are stuck at Nanded, according to the local authorities. “We have started the process of sending them back,” said Bhushan Gagarani, the principal secretary in the Maharashtra chief minister’s office.Public works department minister Ashok Chavan said the Union cabinet secretary had informed the state government about the nod for the inter-state passage of the pilgrims.Bhupinder Singh Manhas, the president of the shrine’s management board, said: “Around 400 pilgrims were stranded at the gurdwara after the Covid-19 lockdown announced by the Maharashtra and central governments last month. The gurdwara management has taken care of their stay, food and now transportation.”He said that the permission was given after Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh took up the matter with his counterpart in Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray and Union home minister Amit Shah.“We are sending them in batches of 300 each in 10 buses every day. The gurdwara board has organised around 150 buses that will be run over the next few days.

24-04-2020||Delhi||70% class 12 govt school students register for DoE online classes||Over 70% of the 150,000 Class 12 students in government schools have registered for its online classes during the ongoing Covide-19 lockdown, said officials from the education department.These were launched two weeks ago so that students in their final year of schooling do not suffer much during the lockdown in place to contain the spread of the disease. Certain government schools have launched their own online classes and the students have the option of choosing either or both.Shailendra Sharma, advisor to director of education, said, “Nearly 112,000 students have registered for the online preparatory classes in 11 subjects. Around 44% of science students login regularly compared to 35% of commerce students. All students have been sent the registration details by now.” While online classes for science and commerce students had commenced on April 6, those for humanities students started this week. The department expects more students to attend the classes in the coming weeks. “The number of students joining the online classes depends on different subjects. For subjects like English, the lecture videos have had up to 30,000 views in a single day since it covers all streams. However, due to technical limitations of the platform we are using, it would be difficult to assess how many students attended the class for the entire 90 minute session,” said a senior official from the department of education (DoE).However, not all among the registered students are attending these classes. In addition to the accessibility and connectivity issues, another reason is that many government schools had already started their own online classes.“It [DoE classes] has become a college-like set-up. Students now have a choice to attend classes or not. They can choose to miss one class because they may have studied that particular chapter before,” the official added. Ashish Jha, a Class 12 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV) Shalimar Bagh, is one such student. “The education department conducts two classes per day for science students. Since we have limited internet, I prefer attending the classes organised by my school because we know the teachers and have a rapport with them,” he said.Another Class 12 student, Tisha Phukan, who studies at the School of Excellence in Kalkaji, however, had a different opinion. “Since students in these (DoE) classes belong to different categories, the teachers, who are very experienced, make sure they cater to all and simplify the chapters. The teachers engage students with a new way of teaching, which is why I like to attend it,” she said. A new teaching-learning processThe Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown has propelled the education sector towards online learning almost overnight. As a result of this, teachers and students are now figuring out the new teaching-learning process on the go.Talking about the challenges that are cropping up, RPVV Shalimar Bagh’s Asha Seth, who teaches business studies for the DoE, said, “These students are growing up in the internet age. So sometimes, they start asking each other personal question like when they would meet on the group chat during the class. When this happens, we try to bring focus back to the class. This is not the time to scold them since all of us are trying something new.”She also said that the teachers have taken into account the mixed pool of government school students who attend these classes. “Teachers are studying Hindi terminologies before conducting classes so that they can teach even those who are not very fluent in English,” Seth added.Arun Sethi, a member of the education department’s core academic unit who is working on these online classes, said, “We do conduct quizzes for students and ask them to answer different types of questions. Some students respond in the chat boxes and that is looked at by the teachers in the session. We are also thinking of creating a Google Form for assessment of all students who attend these classes. However, these would not be counted as internals and would remain for learning purpose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/70-class-12-govt-school-students-register-for-doe-online-classes/story-0X3wHYYHudaKRfTu8SSs7K.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||Virtual learning medium fails to connect with children with special needs||With private and government schools in the city having moved to e-learning during the Covid-19 lockdown, children with special needs and their parents are finding it difficult to cope with the sudden change in the medium of education. Parents of children with hearing, speech and intellectual disabilities are having a hard time helping their kids with assignments and activities at home, in the absence of special educators. Officials in many schools said they were unprepared to deal with the needs of children with disabilities when the medium of learning changed during the lockdown that was put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.The mother of a 15-year-old speech impaired child, enrolled in a South Delhi private school, said they were not receiving “age appropriate” study material. “Either the school doesn’t send us anything or it sends us random videos and worksheets without a systematic approach. Every child with some disability have an individualised education plan (IEP), based on their ability and learning levels, and the study material should also be provided accordingly,” she said, not wishing to be identified.Parents of a hearing impaired student of a private school in West Delhi said they are struggling to help their son, a class 7 student, in finishing his assignments. “We don’t know sign language properly and it becomes difficult to make him understand his worksheets and assignments. On normal days, he finishes all his work at school with the help of special educators. We are really worried about him lagging behind in studies,” Lalit Kumar, the father of the 14-year-old, said.While both private and government schools are sending videos, worksheets and audios to children with special needs amid the lockdown, some are also holding online classes for them. However, schools feel that there is a need for “inclusive” e-learning modes for children with disabilities.Seema Tuli, principal of Amar Jyoti School, said they are sending videos in sign language for students with hearing disabilities and audios of the lessons for visually challenged students based on their IEPs. ”Although we are trying our best to provide uninterrupted learning to all students with special needs, the pandemic has made us realise that online education tools are not inclusive and equally accessible to all. Many of us are struggling to find modes to cover different kinds of disabilities under the ambit of online education,” she said. Directorate of Education’s (DoE) inclusive branch, earlier this month, issued guidelines to all government school directing them to develop a home-based intervention plan for children with disabilities. The schools were asked to send daily activities to these students, including daily life activities, domestic skills, art and craft, among others. Schools were also asked to take feedback from their parents every three days. Special educators working in government schools said they were not ready for a sudden shift in the medium of education. Dharmendar Kumar, a special educator, said they are sending only basic activities to students. “We are only focussing on daily life activities. We are asking to learn to do their own work such as brushing their teeth, bathing, eating, dressing and cleaning,” he said, adding that he fears that his students may lag in their learning by the time the lockdown ends.“For instance, it’s not possible to make students with visual disability learn Braille virtually. We send them audios of lessons and new words so that they can hear and learn. Also, not all of these students have access to the internet,” he said.Shyam Nath, father of an intellectually challenged student at a school in East Delhi’s Patparganj, said, “It is difficult to make my daughter understand several things. Now, the teacher calls her every alternate day and gives her some activity. We are not being able to help her as much as we want to. The teacher has asked us to join a WhatsApp group for parents like us, but we don’t have a smartphone at home.” Experts said all stakeholders will have to join hands to come up with a pedagogy that will these children in situations like the current one. “Instead of each school trying on its own, there should be uniform guidelines on how to handle children with specific disability in a virtual learning setting. The Do) needs to come up with a format,” disability rights activist Satendra Singh said.A senior DoE official said they have recently received a letter from the state commissioner asking them to ensure a smooth learning process for children with special needs. “We have already issued guidelines for government schools. We may also approach private schools with these,” the official, not authorised to speak to the media, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/virtual-learning-medium-fails-to-connect-with-children-with-special-needs/story-kXdHQ36DFEt2FSTHR1UjEO.html

24-04-2020||Delhi||The ‘catwomen’ of Daryaganj : Two women walked 10 km in the heat to save a stray cat||Fatima and Sultana, two sisters who live in Darya Ganj used to feed and play with a stray cat in their locality. They suspected that the cat was pregnant, as she had become becoming very sluggish. One day, to their horror, they found the cat unconscious, and figured out that she had fallen from the second floor of a building.As the city had gone into lockdown, the two sisters didn’t know what to do. They could not find a single veterinary doctor in their neighbourhood who could attend to the cat whose condition was extremely critical. Someone suggested that Fatima and Sultana take the cat to Freindicoes in Jangpura, an NGO that runs a shelter for stray, abandoned and bused animals, along with a veterinary clinic.  But there was no way the sisters could reach Jangpura without any conveyance. All the roads were shut and there were policemen deployed everywhere to stop people from stepping out of their homes. But the compassionate women could not bear to see the cat in such a terrible state. So they decided to walk all the way to Jangpura holding the pregnant cat in a basket! The distance was about 10 km and the heat only made the journey worse. “We pleaded to so many people on our way to give us a lift, but no one stopped. So we kept on walking, as every minute was crucial,” says Fatima. It took them about 2 hours to reach the clinic with the cat.As soon as they arrived, a team of doctors headed by Dr Banajit Majumdar attended to the cat. “The cat had fainted due to the trauma. I removed the four unborn kittens that were inside her, but we could not save them. She survived the complicated one hour surgery,” says Dr Majumdar. The doctor says that it’s really sad that no one agreed to help the woman. “The police and even citiziens should come ahead to help in such cases. It is tragic that no one agreed.” Geeta Sheshamani, founder, Friendicoes, says, “It’s touching to see the compassion in the lesser privileged…the poor do have a big heart. We have rickshawallas and daily wagers coming in with injured animals, asking us to help.”The cat was sent back with Fatima and Sultana in an ambulance by the NGO, and she is healing under the care of her human friends who love her unconditionally, and would always go the extra mile for her, literally! Friendicoes shared this beautiful tale of kindness and compassion on its page, and the sisters were dubbed as the ‘catwomen’ of Daryaganj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/the-catwoman-of-daryaganj-two-women-walked-10-km-in-the-heat-to-save-a-stray-cat/story-Vr73aH6eaaClaR1bV9rAZL.html

We must protect ourselves and others. Collective action is what we need,” said Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Sanjay Kumar, in a tweet.Two people from Biharsharif, a 24 year-old male and 70-year-old female in Biharsharif of Nalanda district turned positive late Wednesday evening. The septuagenarian woman is the oldest Covid-19 positive case reported in the state so far.All the 10 cases reported on Thursday had come in contact with Covid-19 positive patients, said an official of the health department. Further tracing of their contacts were on, said the official.Among the 10 cases reported Thursday, four were senior citizens. The gradual increase in the average age of Covid-19 patients was adding to the worries of the health department as immunity of elderly people and children below 10 years of age was believed to be compromised, especially if they had co-morbid conditions.Jamalpur has accounted for over a dozen cases in the past one week, and most of these have been linked to a 60- year-old vegetable seller who had travelled on foot to and from Bihar Sharif in Nalanda district last month to attend a Tablighi Jamaat congregation.Around 13,785 samples had been sent for tests.Around 2,254 people with influenza like illness and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which were identical to Covid-19 symptoms, had been found during the house-to-house survey. Samples of 1,804 had already been taken, said health officials. Of Bihar’s total 153 cases, Nalanda and Munger accounted for 31 cases each, followed by Siwan (29), Patna (16), Begusarai (9), Buxar (8), Rohtas (7), Gaya, Bhagalpur (5 each), Gopalganj, Nawada (3 each), Saran, Lakhisarai, Vaishali, Bhojpur, East Champaran, Banka (1 each).With 44 patients having recovered, the health department claimed 30% patients had been cured, while two deaths were reported to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/masks-made-mandatory-covid-19-cases-up-to-153-in-bihar/story-WaQrqAkLpSpxyTzufBRkhK.html

24-04-2020||Mumbai||Run special trains for migrants in Maharashtra after Covid-19 lockdown: Ajit Pawar||Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has urged Railway Minister Piyush Goyal to run special train services from Mumbai and Pune to ferry migrant workers stuck in Maharashtra to their native states after the lockdown ends on May 3. According to an official statement, in a letter to Goyal, Pawar said that the migrant workers, stranded in different parts of Maharashtra, may step out in big numbers to return to their states when the train services resume after the lockdown is lifted.This can lead to law and order problem (with workers coming out in big numbers), he added.To avoid this, the Railway Ministry should run special trains, he demanded.The Maharashtra Finance Minister said that the state government has arranged accommodation and food for the migrant workers, who hail from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other states.He said six-and-half lakh workers are currently staying across the shelters provided by the state government.Pawar also referred to the scores of migrant workers gathering outside Bandra Railway Station here on April 14 -- when the nationwide lockdown was to end, but was extended till May 3 -- and said the incident marked how desperate the labourers were to return to their home states.“The law and order problem can be avoided and workers can return to their respective home states safely if the Railway Ministry runs special trains for them after the lockdown period is over,” the statement quoted Pawar as saying in the letter.

24-04-2020||Chandigarh||650 symptomatic cases identified in Chandigarh’s house-to-house survey, 546 being tracked||Even as no one is being tested as part of a house-to-house survey to track Covid-19 cases, about 650 persons exhibiting likely symptoms have been identified by the Chandigarh health department, which aims to cover the city’s entire population of around 12 lakh. About 586 cases are being monitored daily by the medical officer, it has been learnt, as the administration puts the onus of responsibility on the citizens to be forthcoming with their health details.Till date, a population of 9.92 lakh from 2.53 lakh households has been covered by 1,291 teams. “It’s a survey, not a screening,” said Dr Sangeeta, who goes by one name, from the department. “The intention is to give people locked down in their homes a sense of comfort that the health department is there for them. Health workers are approaching them at the doorsteps. It’s the social responsibility of the residents to reveal details,” she said.“No samples are being taken,” she said.The survey is being conducted on the pattern of pulse polio campaign with the city divided into four zones. Hotspots are covered first, followed by colonies and then sectors.“About 150 auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) are deployed in the field, with one ANM and one beldar (local worker) in each team. They have been given a set of questions to ask and it’s the responsibility of the people to come forward and share details if there’s any symptomatic case,” Dr Sangeeta added.About 650 symptomatic cases have been traced and follow-up of 586 is being done daily by the medical officer of the area. Of the remaining 67, she said either they were not at home or their houses were locked so they were not being tracked.On the ANMs, Dr G Dewan, director, health services, said, “They are doing a wonderful job and it should be appreciated by city residents. They are not doctors as we cannot employ doctors for field survey. The ANMs are going from house to house to save time and are filling forms only for symptomatic cases. We are following these cases daily.”The survey is likely to be completed by the weekend. “It’s on the pattern suggested by the Union ministry and we will be putting it forth to see if it can be used in other parts as well,” said Dr Shivani Gupta, World Health Organization consultant, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/650-symptomatic-cases-identified-in-chandigarh-s-house-to-house-survey-546-being-tracked/story-srjkfzsFja6UtK8cFAAzJL.html
24-04-2020||Lucknow||UP: MSMEs awaiting relaxation in guidelines||Even after four days of the government’s initiative for a staggered lift of the lockdown for industries and resumption of partial production, there has been no response from industries across the state. Stringent guidelines of the government for running an industrial unit have proved to be a deterrent for industrialists.On Thursday evening, however, there was some assurance from the Centre to India Inc to roll back the FIR clause in the guidelines. Industry associations are opposing the guidelines, including lodging of an FIR against the factory owner if any of his employee tests positive for coronavirus. HighlightsMSMEs are the lifeblood of the Indian economy. They employ a workforce of around 120 million, contributing 33.4 per cent of India’s manufacturing output and making up 45 per cent of India’s exports.In Uttar Pradesh, MSMEs contribute to around 45 percent of total export from the state.“If the government is able to address major concerns of the industry, then from coming Monday onwards we can see resumption of some industrial activity in Uttar Pradesh. The government has assured to roll back the FIR clause in the guideline,” said Pankaj Kumar, national president, Indian Industries Association (IIA). After directives from the Centre, the Yogi government had permitted industries to resume production from April 20 onwards. For this, the government had made following of guidelines in all industrial units mandatory to check spread of coronavirus. Barring industrial units in ‘essential goods’ category, all are shut across the state. Out of an estimated nine lakh micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) registered with the Indian Industries Association (IIA), an industry lobby body of MSMEs, only a handful of around 7000 were operational across the state on Thursday.Even these were working on half the capacity and facing problems in continuing production. “No MSME has resumed production across the state. Only those listed in ‘essential goods’ category are operational. We have come across three cases in which FIR has been lodged against factory owners,” said Manmohan Agarwal, general secretary, IIA.“One case is of Kasna industrial area, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh and the other two are of Thana district, Maharashtra,” added Agarwal.Ministry sources in the state government said that they were also looking at ways to address problems of the MSMEs but could do little as the guidelines had been framed by the Centre and they were in no position to dilute them.“Any relaxation in guidelines has to come from the Centre. The union MSME ministry has to take a decision in this regard,” said a state government official. The biggest challenge for small business owners is dwindling operating capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-msmes-awaiting-relaxation-in-guidelines/story-W4vsNWiFiZTGKDdb6BptJJ.html
24-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration rejects relaxation in curfew for commercial activity||After city-based industry and business representatives on Thursday sought curfew relaxations for opening of some commercial establishments, the UT administration has decided against making any such provisions.In a video conference with UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida and UT finance secretary Ajoy Kumar Sinha on Thursday, the local business community had sought a range of economic concessions amid the curfew.“We requested the administration to allow opening of some shops for a few hours daily, and allowing movement of stranded trucks laden with goods,” said Neeraj Bajaj, president, Chandigarh Business Council.Other curfew relaxation demands included allowing two to three property registrations in a day, back-end office work, and some small-scale industry operations where nine or fewer people are employed.“It was also urged that Chandigarh must be given relaxation to open up borders along with adjoining states. Our supply chain is linked with them,” said Naveen Manglani, president, Chandigarh Chambers of Industries.In the daily review meeting chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, Parida said, “The central government is monitoring the Covid management arrangements in the city and no further relaxation can be allowed under the present curfew.”DEMANDS UNDER CONSIDERATIONThe business community requested the administration to waive fixed charges for electricity, adding that bills should only be based on actual consumption. Bills should also be deferred to at least a month after the lockdown, they demanded.Even as the administration deferred payment of MC property tax, it was requested that it be waived for six months. Water bills should be deferred for at least one month after the lockdown ends, the community demanded.Representatives of automobile companies requested for extension for sale and registration of BS4-compliant vehicles. The last date for BS4 vehicle registration was March 25. No excise duty should be charged from liquor vendors, bars, pubs and hotels during the entire period of lockdown, demanded the hospitality industry representatives.Parida said, “Many of these demands relate to the central government and as such, these will be forwarded with favourable recommendations. Demands pertaining to the administration are under examination.”Industrialists asked the administration to chalk out a plan for post-lockdown operation of industries. “Besides finances, supply chain and availability of labour will be a big challenge for the industry. Ministry of home affairs suggesting penal action and criminal charge against businessmen if a worker gets infected, makes it risky for business owners to operate,” said Pankaj Khanna, president, Chandigarh Industries Association.CELEBRATE RECOVERY OF COVID PATIENTS: BADNOREIn the meeting, Badnore directed the heads of all medical institutions to focus on critical non-Covid cases, too. He said stories of patients who had been cured should be publicised and society should celebrate their recovery.The administrator also appealed to the Muslim brethren to observe and celebrate Ramadan indoors and conduct the prayers while practising social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-rejects-relaxation-in-curfew-for-commercial-activity/story-s1GvtJnk4VXAX9FxDq8hpJ.html
24-04-2020||Lucknow||For the love of reading: Online fora mark World Book Day||The World Book and Copyright Day was marked by online activities, as the power of reading was promoted despite the Covid-19 contagion scare and the lockdown, on Thursday.Urdu poet Sanjay Mishra ‘Shauq’, who has penned several books, said in an online session organised by Bharat Vimarsh Foundation, “Without books, life is not possible. Without a doubt, books are our best friends. They are the best guides, they are the best teachers. There is no doubt, anyone who connects to books, becomes a better human being. Today, books share our pain and prepare us for the future with confidence.”He added, “Through books, we come to know about places which we have not visited. They create a feeling which we cannot imagine if we don’t go through them.”He said, “In normal times, there would have been a number of literary functions but because of this epidemic, the day is being celebrated through online sessions.”Lucknow Sahityik Manch also organised an online session. Lucknow Sahityik Manch convenor Chandrashekhar Varma, said, “Around 60 writers participated in the online session to popularise book-reading among everyone. Due to the time people spend online, they are deprived of books from many great writers like Jay Shankar Prasad, Sumitranandan Pant, Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, Maithili Sharan Gupt, Bhagwati Charan Varma. Through such book-reading sessions we wish to generate interest in people about book reading.”Poet Mukul Mahan said, “In 1995, Unesco’s general conference decided to make April 23 the World Book and Copyright Day to acknowledge books and authors and encourage everyone, young people in particular, to discover the pleasure of reading.”Sarvesh Asthana, another poet, said, “Book Day celebrations are aimed at developing the book-reading habit and development of the book industry. Today, digitisation of books is important as many are into online reading, and online platforms like Kindle are doing good business. By promoting online book-reading habits we can target the youth, especially college-going youngsters.”Manoj Chandel, who organises the Lucknow Book Fair every year, said, “Lucknowites love books and after the Covid-19 threat is over the book fair will surely be back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/for-the-love-of-reading-online-fora-mark-world-book-day/story-IbWvO0PZ29kV1Ta58K6AUM.html
24-04-2020||City||Punjab sees eight-fold increase in domestic violence cases amid lockdown||Last week, the Punjab State Commission for Women (PSCW) received a frantic call from the mother of a three-month-old girl that her in-laws and husband were taking the infant away. A team from the commission, along with cops, was immediately sent to Ajnala, a town in Amritsar, from where the complaint was received. It was only after hours of counselling that the matter was resolved and the infant was in the mother’s care again. This is just one of the several such calls that the commission receives everyday. Since March 24, when the curfew was imposed, the commission got 800 distress calls and has recorded an eight-fold increase in the number of domestic violence cases. “Earlier if we received 25 calls a day, only three to four calls pertained to domestic violence out of the total. Ever since the curfew has been imposed, all the 25 to 30 calls are related to domestic violence only,” says Manisha Gulati, chairperson, PSCW.According to officials dealing with the cases, the maximum cases are pouring in from Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Mohali and Ropar districts in the state. A majority of these are from the educated class where working women, who are ordinarily at work, are finding themselves on the receiving end of harassment and approaching the commission for help.Gulati adds, “Another reason is that women aren’t approaching the police directly as they fear that presence of cops may give an impression that it is a Covid case. Majority of the complainants are in the age group of 30 to 35 and are working women now confined to homes.” She added that there is also a significant number of complaints from rural areas in the state but majority of those are from housewives above the age of 40.Recalling another such complaint that the commission received from Mohali, Gulati says the woman called to say that her in laws have pushed her out of the house. Gulati added that most of the complaints are received directly on their helpline number (7814103253).Ludhiana assistant commissioner of police Prabhjot Kaur says their first response is to provide help to the victim. “Due to social distancing norms, we are not able to counsel couples fighting dispute these days. Women who are harassed cannot leave their homes which adds to the problems.”Gulati adds that stereotypical ideologies exist in many parts of the state. “There are some highly modern literate families who may be fighting over trivial issues. On the other hand, there are uneducated people in rural areas who may be very progressive,” she says.The commission is also receiving a lot more complaints from women who are suffering from depression in the lockdown. “An elderly woman from Ludhiana called our helpline number and said she was very lonely. Her two sons in Mohali and Jalandhar are settled with their families and do not have time for her. She told us that she locks herself up and bites herself,” narrated Gulati. The woman was told that she is suffering from an illness which needs immediate treatment and we provided her help.According to inspector general of police, Jalandhar Range, Naunihal Singh, the cases of domestic violence will further spike when the lockdown ends. “Police are doing the best they can. But since its a lockdown, many of the complainants are forced to remain at homes. The number is expected to further rise when things return to normal,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-sees-eight-fold-increase-in-domestic-violence-cases-amid-lockdown/story-llwh2mYHDzrxhGyqbOUZRN.html
24-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus outbreak: At 51%, Chandigarh’s recovery rate is more than double the national average||The recovery rate of Covid-19 patients in Chandigarh at 51% is more than double the national average of 21%, and also highest among Mohali and Panchkula in the tricity area. Out of the total 27 cases reported in Chandigarh, 14 patients have recovered, while there has been no fatality. In Mohali, 14 of the 63 patients have been discharged (22%). Panchkula has reported recovery of three of the 18 positive patients, a recovery rate of 16%. Among the three cities, only Panchkula has a recovery figure lower than the national average. However, tricity’s overall recovery rate is 28%, with 31 cured patients, 7% more than the country average.Nearly 30 lakh people reside in the three cities.As per www.covid19india.org, which maintains the national Covid-19 data, till Thursday evening, a total of 21,774 cases had been confirmed, of which 4,595 have recovered (21%). There have been 691 deaths nationwide, among them two in the tricity – both in Mohali.Chandigarh reported its first case on March 18. Till April 1, Chandigarh had 16 cases, Mohali 10 and Panchkula only two, a tricity count of 28. Thereon, there was a sudden spike in cases, especially in Mohali and Panchkula, and the number has since swollen to 108.A total of 1,104 people have been tested in Mohali, while the number is 1,236 in Panchkula. Chandigarh has the lowest number of tests at 599.Both Mohali and Chandigarh have been under curfew since March 23, while Panchkula is under lockdown. Public transport is shut and essential items are either being delivered door-to-door or through neighbourhood shops. PGIMER director Jagat Ram said the patients in the tricity were mostly young. “This is one of the reasons that they are recovering at a better rate than the national average. As per our assessment, more patients will recover soon. Also, comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes are not common among the tricity patients,” he added.The premier medical institute has been designated as the Covid-19 Centre of Chandigarh. It currently has 13 coronavirus patients from Chandigarh and seven from other states.“The level of awareness in the tricity is better. Residents are adhering to the advisories. Social distancing norms have also been largely followed, which has helped contain the outbreak here,” said Dr JS Thakur, chairman, Covid-19 Prevention and IEC Committee at PGIMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-outbreak-at-51-chandigarh-s-recovery-rate-is-more-than-double-the-national-average/story-o5XWFfUOvuIvWtSajyQfJJ.html
24-04-2020||Lucknow||TB diagnostic machines to be used for Covid||Diagnostic machines, which are used for samples of suspected tuberculosis patients, can now be engaged for Covid-19 testing as Indian Council of Medical Research gave its nod in this regard earlier this month.This means at least a dozen more centres in Uttar Pradesh can test coronavirus samples apart from the 14 laboratories that are already examining coronavirus samples on other machines (RTPCR),Uttar Pradesh has 14 laboratories for coronavirus testing in different cities with a cumulative capacity to examine over 3500 samples every day. ICMR guidelines say, “Specimen collection and transfer of sample for CBNAAT (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test machines that test TB samples) must be performed using appropriate PPE and following all applicable biosafety requirements. ICMR recommends that any testing is carried under BSL-2 (biosafety level two) conditions and with appropriate biosafety precautions.”“BSL-2 (biosafety 2) level has to be ensured in the lab where these samples will be tested. Also, required training to staff members,” said Prof Sheetal Verma, senior faculty, microbiology, at King George’s Medical University.Covid-19 testing in UP is being carried out at King George’s Medical University, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Central Command Hospital, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Science (all in Lucknow), Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College at Aligarh Muslim University in Aligarh, Moti Lal Nehru Medical College, Prayagraj and seven other medical institutes in the state.“An evaluation will now be done to see which centre can be added to the list and then training will be arranged for the staff to conduct tests under BSL-2,” said a senior health official. He said biosafety levels of these labs will be increased to BSL-2 before samples are given for testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/tb-diagnostic-machines-to-be-used-for-covid/story-BJzxgogLJSQU24SsAYx5sN.html
24-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s child rights body without chairman for over a month||Amid the epidemic, the city’s only child rights body, the Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR), has had no one to head the organisation for more than a month. The previous chairperson retired on March 17, after which no one has been appointed by UT’s department of social welfare to fill the position.Meanwhile, Yashpal Garg, who is also the secretary of Chandigarh‘s social welfare department, said he was the acting chairperson of the commission.However, a former member of the commission, Pramod Sharma, stressing that the commission needed co-ordination at all levels to prevent the health crisis from becoming a child rights crisis, has written to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on the matter. Requesting him to appoint someone to head the CCPCR office, Pramod wrote, “The appointment of a chairperson to make CCPCR ‘fully operational’ is long overdue.”Pramod said with all requisite resources and manpower, a closed office of CCPCR served no purpose when it could have been fully utilised in the times of the epidemic.“With schools, offices, commercial establishments closed, family distress level is all-time high. And joblessness will force poor families to cut back on essential health and food expenditures, particularly affecting the well-being of children,” he said. He also said very soon, children will drop out from Chandigarh’s schools, an action spurred by the present crisis and reverse migration. “Noting that children are both victims and witnesses of domestic violence and abuse, with schools closed, an important early warning mechanism is missing,” he added.He also said whenever schools re-open, thousands of children cannot simply come back. “A post-pandemic school plan is essential and has to be prepared in advance in consultation with all stakeholders,” Sharma said. Harjinder Kaur, former chairperson of CCPCR, said the child rights body had the same roles and responsibilities as the UT administration. “Amid the pandemic when every other office in the city is overburdened with work, CCPCR could have taken a lead in child rights in the city, especially when we just lost a girl child to coronavirus. I wish CCPCR was working with the same spirit,” she said.Yashpal Garg refused to comment on the contents of the letter, but said the CCPCR was operational with him as acting chairperson and Navjot Kaur, the director of social welfare, as the secretary. He said, “It is the selection committee that takes a call on the appointment of the chairperson with the approval of the administrator.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-child-rights-body-without-chairman-for-over-a-month/story-akgGPe9LeB9Cck9nBKH61M.html

The woman alleged that on Wednesday when she took up the matter with the accused, he threatened her of dire consequences and harassed her.Based on the complaint, a case was registered under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 354-C (voyeurism) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at Chandimandir police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-man-held-for-harassing-52-yr-old-neighbour-by-dumping-garbage/story-iqJajYdspRhUTQzzf15bsN.html
24-04-2020||City||Tough to test 12 lakh people, but we’re identifying people with flu symptoms, says Chandigarh health director||With Chandigarh declared a containment zone, recording 27 Covid-19 cases, of which 14 have been treated and discharged, Dr Gajinder Dewan, director, health services, Chandigarh, speaks to Amanjeet Singh Salyal about the challenges faced, future plans and level of preparedness to tackle the pandemic. What is the health department’s assessment of the present and future situation?Compared to other countries we are in a better position. We have to keep our fingers crossed for what will come. Which way the virus will go is unpredictable, but the situation is under control. We have our projections and counter plans in place. Healthcare workers are ready to deal with any kind of situation. It is difficult to say anything beyond this. Is Chandigarh in the community transmission phase as source of infection in three cases is not known?I completely disagree with that. Mapping of cases in which the source of information is not known shows a scattered pattern, but in a majority of cases it (source) has been identified. Though we have stray cases, these are not on a large scale. A majority of cases are linked with persons who have travel history to foreign countries and those have been mapped successfully. Tests for unknown sources are underway. We haven’t aggressively tested people. Do you agree?We are not running short of kits. That depends on the protocol and the wisdom of physician who needs to be tested. We can carry out tests of people who come under the protocols set by the Central government. We have also directed that all persons with flu-like symptoms in the city be tested and they are being tested in turns. Rapid kit testing has stopped and we are awaiting directions on how to go about it. We are testing wherever required. How efficient has the house-to-house survey been?You cannot test 12 lakh people in the city at this stage, but we are on the job when it comes to identifying people who might have got infected. Moreover, the survey is a confidence-building exercise. The residents are terrified with what is happening around the globe we are reaching out to them to find out whether they have any Covid-19 symptoms. People are being identified and will be examined further. This is also to rule out apprehensions of community transmission. What challenges is the health department likely to face after the post Covid-19 lockdown period?We need to educate people about the precautionary steps they have to take and safety measures for that scenario have to be in place.

Two people, including a doctor, were injured in the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/many-tablighi-jamaat-members-among-295-shifted-to-temporary-jails-in-up/story-XcnlcZ2JcClGGlK6yWFoYP.html
24-04-2020||Lucknow||Govt-run school begins online teaching in Kaushambi village||A government-run Prathmik Uchtar Madhyamik Vidyalay in neighbouring Kaushambi district has set an example for other rural government schools by starting online teaching during the lockdown.Remotely located in Laudhana gram sabha of Sarsawan development block, the school has started online classes through WhatsApp by making a group of 127 students, out of the school’s total strength of 455 students.The school principal Pankaj Singh, who had taken the initiative to start online teaching, said that availability of smart phones in every house in a remote village was something impossible but now it was picking up.The principal said, “I started with just 6 students in the first week of this month. Today, the strength of students has swelled up to 127. Children, not having smart phones in their homes, are gradually getting connected to the school group through phones of relatives or neighbours.” “Every day, I receive calls from my students to add phone numbers of their relatives or neighbours, having smart phones. It is encouraging,” he added.According to the school principal, online teaching is being done in four subjects-English, Hindi, Mathematics and Science- besides tasks in Arts subjects were also being given to students.“Students first receive videos of lecture by teachers and subsequently they are asked questions and they have to write answers in their respective subject note books. Once the school opens, notebooks would be corrected by teachers concerned. Presently there are four teachers in the school,” he added.Assistant basic shiksha adhikari, Sarsawa block, Kauskambi Mithilesh Kumar said the initiative had set an example for other primary and upper primary schools to follow as in present time of lockdown, online teaching was the only mode and slowly the rural population would also have to turn to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/govt-run-school-begins-online-teaching-in-kaushambi-village/story-kRCOVCsdCf0eUXq9r3DqbN.html
24-04-2020||Mumbai||778 Covid-19 cases in a day take Maha tally to 6,427||Maharashtra on Thursday recorded its highest single-day jump in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases with 778 new infections, taking India’s worst-hit state’s tally to 6,427. Of these cases, 522 were in Mumbai, taking the country’s most battered city’s case count up to 4,205.Maharashtra also recorded 14 deaths, making the toll 283. On Thursday, Mumbai recorded six deaths, taking its toll to 167, while five were reported in Pune, and one each in Navi Mumbai, Nandurbar and Dhule.A total of 122 fresh Covid-19 cases were from the other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) — Thane, Mira-Bhayander, Kalyan-Dombivli, Palghar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Panvel, among others.Thane city reported 48 new cases, taking its tally to 214, as Thane rural recorded an additional 10 cases. Mira-Bhayander recorded 35 new Covid-19 cases; 27 new cases were recorded in Kalyan-Dombivli. Malegaon, in Nashik district, which is one of the five hotspots in Maharashtra, recorded 15 fresh cases as its tally rose to 109.In the past 24 hours, the state has carried out 6,136 coronavirus tests and 778 people have tested positive for the virus, which is 12.67% of the total people tested.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with two inter-ministerial central teams (IMCTs), who are visiting Mumbai and Pune to see the measures taken by the state government to tackle the spread of coronavirus, and has assured to implement the measures suggested by the Central teams.The Central teams, during their video conference with Thackeray and key officials from the state, have pressed for more institutional quarantine facilities in slums like Dharavi; shifting of people from Dharavi into quarantine facilities; ramping up testing; operationalise private clinics and hospitals for non-Covid-19 patients, among others. The state government has also been told to focus on the hotspots in Mumbai owing to the spiralling of cases over the past few days. The teams have advised the state government to carry out more “focussed” testing in the two cities as they expected the rate of doubling of cases to be improved to at least 10 days from the existing rate of 7.01. The teams also reviewed the steps taken by the state government in terms of implementation of lockdown and social distancing.They looked at the supply of essential commodities, preparedness of health facilities, and the arrangements for migrant workers.The Central team, which visited parts of Mumbai over the past three days, is headed by Manoj Joshi, additional secretary, ministry of food processing industries, while the five-member team visiting Pune is headed by Sanjay Malhotra, additional secretary, ministry of power.The teams were apprised that the highest number of tests were being performed in Maharashtra, among other states. Chief secretary Ajoy Mehta told the teams that the tests being conducted in Maharashtra are six times more than that in Kerala, which is being praised for containing Covid-19 speedily. Of the 90,000-plus tests conducted in Maharashtra, 55,000 are in Mumbai alone, with a rate of 4,270 tests per million.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner Praveen Pardeshi informed in the meeting that the containment zones in non-slum areas in Mumbai are rapidly reducing. Mumbai has 930 containment zones, including 447 in non-slum areas. Pardeshi said that the tests in Dharavi have been increased and they conducted 1,180 tests on Thursday in the area.CM Thackeray reiterated the need of more personal protection equipment (PPE) kits from the entre. The state government has also expressed for the need for clarity on usage of PPE kits and their manufacturing in domestic market. The state government assured the Central teams of the rigorous implementation of their instructions in terms of facilities at hospitals, quarantine facilities, tests in Pune and Mumbai.Following the instructions by the teams, CM Thackeray directed the state authorities to look into the complaints of hardships faced by the non Covid patients. “Private clinics and hospitals should be directed to operate for non-Covid patients. The general public should be made aware about non-Covid hospitals and fever clinics,” he said.State health minister Rajesh Tope, too, said that PPE kits will be provided to doctors as and when they are made available by the Centre, but they should be open for the patients facing other ailments.Meanwhile, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar wrote to railway minister Piyush Goyal, seeking special trains to take migrant workers home as it may become a law-and-order problem.In the letter, the deputy CM said that the migrant workers who have been staying at shelter camps will likely take to the streets on May 3, when the second phase of the lockdown ends. “This could lead to a law-and-order problem, like it happened in Bandra in Mumbai on the last day of the first lockdown,” read the letter.On April 14, nearly 1,000 out-of-work migrant labourers gathered outside a railway station in Mumbai’s Bandra, hours after Prime Minister extended the lockdown to May 3 to check the spread of the coronavirus infections, demanding for trains to take them home. “The Railway ministry should plan well in advance for special trains for these workers to various parts of the country. The trains should be operated from Pune and Mumbai,” the minister wrote.Earlier in the week, Thackeray assured migrant labourers in the state that his government would ensure that they are sent home once the lockdown is lifted. “I give you my word that the Maharashtra government will take you to your homes the day this crisis ends. I believe that when you go back to your homes, you should go back happily and not out of fear,” said the CM.Manoj Josh, who headed the Central team, told HT, “After our visit to various parts of Mumbai, we had a meeting with Maharashtra CM and the officials. We will submit our report on the assessment to the Central government.”When asked about the report purportedly submitted by his team projecting an exponential rise in cases in Mumbai by May 15, Joshi said that no such report was submitted by them and the team was not on a state visit for any such projection.The team reportedly expressed their concerns on the hardships being faced by non-Covid-19 patients, owing to the closure of private dispensaries, clinics and hospitals. “The elders, facing other ailments, including heart diseases, diabetes, blood pressure, are suffering as private hospitals are not operational. The state government should ensure that they go operational at the earliest,” the team reportedly told the state government.Health minister Rajesh Tope said that private practitioners have been demanding PPE kits, expressing reservations over their safety when treating patients. CM Thackeray expressed unhappiness over the short supply of PPE kits by the Centre. “Around 40,000 PPE kits are required per week in Mumbai alone. In absence of their supply from the Centre, the civic body has been managing from domestic manufacturers, but the Centre needs to bring clarity on permissions for the kits and their usage for the private practitioners,” he said. Two days after reversing the relaxation of lockdown in the MMR and Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), the state government on Thursday allowed pre-monsoon work to be carried out, along with construction of Metro lines in the two regions. Besides that, the state allowed food processing units, such as bread factories, milk-processing centres, flour and dal mills, shops of electric fans. The order issued on Thursday also allowed bedside attendants and caregivers to senior citizens residing in their homes and allowed facilities of export /import such as pack houses, treatment facilities for seed and horticulture produce, and research establishment dealing with agriculture and horticulture activities. Forestry plantation and related activities are also allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/778-covid-19-cases-in-a-day-take-maha-tally-to-6-427/story-J5BvHbWkP7u3dpgksReNxL.html

24-04-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown perspective: With no balconies in Mumbai’s new constructions, is it time to save the space?||Even though Covid-19 brings to mind scenes of empty streets, there is one space that has come into prominence for the way it connects the private realm with public spaces — the balcony. The Italians have made music on their balconies to entertain neighbours. In Spain, a neighbourhood organised a game of community bingo, which again saw residents step out onto their balconies. In France, residents hung banners from their balconies from to thank caregivers. Across the world, the balcony has allowed people to feel a sense of community even while they practice physical distancing. Unfortunately, in Mumbai’s newer constructions, the balcony is a rare feature. In old Bombay, whether in the picturesque art deco buildings or chawls, the balcony has long been a way to connect with the neighbourhood, celebrate festivals together and even hold political talks. “People would read their newspaper, talk to neighbours, dry spices, watch Ganesh Chaturthi processions from their balconies in the olden days. It was an integral part of the neighbourhood and the wider city,” said Manjiri Kamat, history professor and assistant dean, faculty of humanities, Mumbai University. Kamat added verandahs in chawls were also used by mill workers to discuss politics.In Mumbai’s newer constructions, balconies are hard to come by. “It would have helped citizens to connect socially,” said Kamat.An increasing population, unaffordable property rates, policy interventions and smaller tenement sizes has led to Mumbai losing out on this architectural feature. “Balconies almost vanished by the 1990s. It is the right time for the planners to introspect if we need to bring back these spaces,” said conservation architect Rahul Chemburkar.In most present-day apartments, balconies are brought into a room in the apartment or used as a dry area (for the washing machine, for instance). Some who have balconies use them as storage area.“Balconies are no longer affordable for Mumbaikars,” said architect Vilas Nagalkar. “Today, anyone would prefer a 2BHK [bedroom, hall, kitchen] admeasuring 600 square feet (sqft) to a 550 sqft [living area] + 50 sqft balcony,” he said.Changing regulations for floor space index (FSI) are also responsible for the disappearance of balconies since FSI determines how high a building may be. In 2012, balconies were brought into the ambit of fungibility of FSI. “Earlier, balconies were free of FSI, so everyone opted for it,” said Nagalkar. “The present rules include balconies in FSI again, but its concept has changed socially over the years, so only the affluent, buying bigger than 2BHK, opt for it now,” he added.At a time when people are seen walking or doing yoga on their building terraces, the balcony could have been a transition space, Nagalkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-perspective-with-no-balconies-in-mumbai-s-new-constructions-is-it-time-to-save-the-space/story-6CnCLln84LlNUwqD47WxnJ.html
24-04-2020||City||Lack of transportation, storage facilities irks farmers||Amid restrictions imposed in the wake of Covid-19, with a fewer number of farmers allowed to enter mandis, they are finding it difficult to store their produce.Lack of storage space and transportation has become a cause for concern for them.As the wheat harvesting is picking pace in the state, most farmers are facing trouble to store wheat and take it to the mandis.“This is a race against time as we cannot afford to delay the harvesting. But we cannot sell our produce until we receive a call from the mandi”, said Madan Numberdar, a farmer from Dhanokheri village of Karnal district, who is waiting to sell his produce of four acres.“Not only space storage, but we are also facing problem to take our produce to mandis due to lack of transportation as we don’t have a tractor-trailer,” said another farmer Balbir Singh of Indri. Since the ahrtiyas or the commission agents have all the rights to decide the farmers who could bring their produce to the mandi, the farmers alleged that the commission agents give importance to the big farmers only as they ignore small farmers in the list provided to the market committee.Officials of the state agriculture marketing board said, “We have already prepared the list of farmers registered under the Meri Fasal Meri Mera Byora portal and it is up to the commission agents to decide.”As per the reports collected from the different grain markets in the region, the mandi secretaries have fixed the numbers of farmers as per the procurement record of the commission agents and the commission agents are allowed to procure the wheat of their farmers as per their capacity.“Small farmers should be given priority as they don’t have space and transportation facilities but as per the norms, we allow six farmers of big ahrtiyas and three farmers of small ahrtiyas on a daily basis to maintain the balance. The commission agents give importance to big farmers,” said a mandi secretary of Kurukshetra district.On the other hand, some big farmers, who have not taken advance from the commission agents are also selling their produce directly to the seed companies even above the Minimum Support Price.“I have already sold around 350 quintals of wheat at ₹205,5 per quintal ₹130 per quintal above the MSP of ₹1,925 to a seed company in Naharpur,” said Surender Singh, a farmer from Radaur of Yamunanagar district. Rain pours trouble for farmers in Hisar Light to moderate shower in the Hisar region added trouble for the farmers who have reached the grain market and waiting for the purchasing agency to procure wheat and mustard.However, the Meteorological department located at the Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University (CCSHAU) had already predicted light to moderate shower in the entire state and had issued a special advisory for the farmers that they must cover the reaped crop properly.Head of the department of meteorology and agriculture department of CCSHAU said, “The farmers must strictly follow the advisory of the meteorology department to keep their produce safe at home or at the grain market. The same condition will prevail until April 25.”In Sirsa, the local administration has increased the number of purchasing centres from 60 to 186. The farmers also claimed that they are getting many facilities such as drinking water and food on time. However, they said that there are no shed facilities in these centres which is a matter of concern.(With inputs from Bhaskar Mukhejee)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-irked-over-poor-transportation-procurement-arrangements-in-mandis/story-cJ8VOTkgHbuwNSbpp3AKCN.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||58, including 45-day-old, test Covid positive in 2 clusters in Delhi||New Delhi: Fifty-eight people, including a 45-day-old child -- nearly half of the 128 Covid-19 cases reported in Delhi on Thursday -- were from two clusters in Jahangirpuri and Jama Masjid, according to the latest Delhi government data. The contagious disease has so far infected 2,376 people in Delhi; 50 of them have died and 808 have recovered.Officials said 46 of the new cases were members of different families in Jahangirpuri, and 12 from Chooriwalan in Jama Masjid. Different places in both the areas have already been demarcated as containment, or red, zones. With three new containment zones announced on Thursday, the total number of such areas in the city -- where there is a hard lockdown in place with a ban on movement and home-delivery of essential supplies by the administration -- has reached 92. According to district administration officials, in the Jama Masjid case, the positive cases belonged to two families, including the 45-day-old child, from Chooriwalan. The infant, and three people who have underlying health issues such as diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, were admitted to the dedicated Covid-19 Lok Nayak hospital. The rest of the people have been admitted to Covid Care Centres, which look after patients with mild to moderate symptoms.“From what we have learnt, these are members of two different families, but their address is the same. They might be living on two different floors of the same building. We came to know of the case after the families got tested at a private clinic. We are currently assessing the area,” said Nidhi Shrivastava, district magistrate of Central Delhi.District officials in Jahangirpuri said the 46 people come from about 10 families in H-block and all of them have been shifted to the quarantine facility in Narela. They also said that contract tracing exercise has begun and other members of the positive people have been asked to remain in home quarantine. Officials who are tracing contacts for positive people from Jama Masjid said one of them has a history of travel to Russia, before India imposed a complete ban on international travel on March 22. Russia has so far reported 62,773 cases and 555 deaths linked to Covid-19. “We are still investigating the source of the infection,” said Shrivastava. “This lane is already within a containment zone but we will declare it a micro-containment zone, and carry out all the measures aggressively.”District officials in Jahangirpuri also suggested micro-containment of the area since three lanes of the H-block (H1, H2 and H3) were declared as containment zones on April 14 after a Covid-19 positive case was reported there. “Samples of residents of these areas were collected earlier this week after a house-to-house survey. The test report of residents was released on Wednesday evening in which 46 were found Covid-19 positive,” Jahangirpuri councillor Poonam Bagri said.An official of the district administration, requesting anonymity, said that with more cluster cases emerging, vigilance and preventive measures in the area have been stepped up. “The area will now be monitored on micro level. Intensive sanitisation activities have been started in the area,” the official said.JC Passey, director, Lok Nayak hospital, said: “Only one the family members apart from the baby needed to be admitted here, but we admitted two others who had some co-morbid conditions. The others have been referred to Covid Care Centres.” He played down reports of the family having an altercation with the doctors when they reached there for admission on Wednesday night. “The government has now decided that only the category III patients – who either have severe symptoms or are a at a high risk of developing such symptoms – will be admitted to the hospital. There are five levels (four excluding the dedicated hospitals) of facilities right now – the Covid testing centres where samples are collected; the isolation centres are there for those waiting for their results; Covid Care Centres in government flats etc. admit those with mild symptoms; and the Covid health centres admit those with moderate symptoms,” said Passey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/58-including-45-day-old-test-positive-in-2-clusters-in-delhi/story-QDMXnlIofJNWoGxTBZPtBN.html
24-04-2020||City||Coronavirus cases in Maharashtra up, mortality rate down to 4.4% from 7.41% in 12 days||The mortality rate for Covid-19 in Maharashtra has dipped to 4.4% from 7.41% in the past 12 days, after the protocol for testing was changed. The health officials are looking to bring down the state’s mortality rate, which is still higher than the national rate (3.18%), further.According to health officials, earlier detection of Covid-19 patients with comorbidities from April 12 has ensured timely treatment to them, which is increasing the chances of recovery. Since April 12, the testing protocol for asymptomatic high-risk people in the state, too, has changed. People with no symptoms are tested only in case of 34-week or more pregnancy or if they are on dialysis or chemotherapy. Other asymptomatic patients are home quarantined. They can be tested only after five days of getting exposed to the virus. On April 12, of the 1,996 patients, 148 succumbed to the infection. Till Thursday night, Maharashtra recorded 6,427 cases with 283 deaths. The data from the state health ministry showed that till Friday night, Maharashtra has tested 89,561 samples. The focus is on patients in the age group of 61-80, which has seen the highest number of deaths. People between 61-70 years have a 16.90% death rate,followed by patients between 71-80 years with 15.48%. “At least 78% of the deceased had comorbid health issues such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiac ailments. We are testing more number of people above the age of 60 and high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients, which is why the detection rate has gone up,” said Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner (family welfare) and Director National Health Mission, Maharashtra.Mumbai too has seen a similar trend. With the narrowing down of targets in containment zones, the detection has increased to 4,205 on April 23 from 1,399 on April 12. The death rate has dropped to 3.9% from 7.07% in the same period. Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC, said due to the change in policy, they are being able to focus more on symptomatic patients, whose chance of spreading the infection is higher than asymptomatic ones. “Every day, we are increasing the number of containment zones, so we can test more people who are at a higher risk. Once we are successful in bringing down the graphs in these areas, we can relax the current testing rules,” he said. As HT had reported earlier, delay in treatment is one of the reasons for high mortality rate in the state. Patients are often being referred from one hospital to another.However, the Opposition has accused the state and BMC of hiding the mortality rate. Kirit Somaiya, a politician highlighting a case in Sion Hospital, said, “On April 21, a Covid patient died at the hospital, but in the death certificate, the doctor wrote the cause of death as ‘natural’. The death certificate mentions ‘lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)’ as the immediate cause of death with Covid-19.” HT has a copy of the letter.Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of King Edward Memorial Hospital, who heads the seven-member task force, refuted the allegation. “We analyse the reasons for the death of Covid-19 patients. If the patient has any comorbid health issues, we study it and put it in our records which help the experts in formulating their policies for Covid-19,” he said.Shift in trendAccording to data provided by the state health ministry, more young people in the 21-31 age group are reporting the highest number of cases. Till April 12, patients between 41-51 reported highest cases. “In the containment zones, most of the asymptomatic patients are young working professionals. As there is a rising awareness about susceptibility of the virus among older people, they have stopped stepping out, but the youths are still not following it,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-cases-in-maharashtra-up-mortality-rate-down-to-4-4-from-7-41-in-12-days/story-YNJX8CztzRVZNo2TZZf7ZL.html
24-04-2020||Chandigarh||Spike in domestic violence cases in Punjab amid curfew||The domestic violence cases have seen a sharp spike across Punjab after the imposition of curfew/lockdown last month to check the spread of Covid-19 in the state.There has been a 21% increase, from 4,709 to 5,695, in cases of crimes against women between February 1 and April 20 this year, and a similar percentage of increase in cases of domestic violence against women (from 3,287 to 3,993) in the same period, police said in a statement. On the other hand, there has been a substantial decrease in registration of cases relating to dowry harassment, rape and eve-teasing cases during the same period.Director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said the average number of calls received on ‘DIAL 112’ per day went up to 133 – a whopping 34%, for domestic violence cases during March 20-April 20, from the previous 3 months’ average of 99.33. The per-day increase in total crime against women cases in this period is 30%.The DGP on Thursday held a video conference with all DSPs of crime against women cell and women helpdesk officials to take stock of the situation and discuss measures to tackle this increase. As per the detailed strategy, presented during the video conference by Gurpreet Deo, ADGP community affairs division, SOPs have been put in place to devise the police’s response mechanism, according to an official release.The meeting decided that DSP, crime against women cell, will send a daily report in a defined format to track all such complaints and monitor the action taken. The police will coordinate, as needed, with one-stop centres, which are manned by counsellors nominated by the department of social security, women and child development. The services of these counsellors will be utilised, wherever needed, to counsel the victims, perpetrators, and provide necessary protection in case of children. The DGP also issued a stern warning that such cases will not be tolerated and strict action will be taken.The Punjab State Commission for Women is also receiving 25 to 30 complaints of domestic violence per day ever since March 22 when the curfew was imposed in the state. The commission has received around 800 complaints on its helpline number in a month. “Earlier, if we received 25 calls a day, only three to four calls pertained to domestic violence. But after the curfew was clamped in the state, all the 25 to 30 calls are related to domestic,” said Punjab State Commission for Women chairperson Manisha Gulati.According to officials dealing with the cases, the maximum cases are pouring in from Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Mohali and Rupnagar districts. A majority of these are from the educated class where working women, who are ordinarily at work, are finding themselves harassed at home and are approaching the commission for help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/spike-in-domestic-violence-cases-in-punjab-amid-curfew/story-viOyCy2nZRPph3xelhQSJK.html
24-04-2020||Chandigarh||Gambling, hookah parties turn Rajpura into Punjab’s new Covid-19 hotspot||Illegal gambling activities and hookah parties organised by well-knit groups amid the ongoing lockdown, not giving two hoots for the social-distancing norms, have emerged as the key reasons behind turning Rajpura into Punjab’s new Covid-19 hotspot. As many as 18 residents tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday alone.The town, located 26km from the Patiala district headquarters, has reported 30 positive cases so far, with the health department on Thursday collecting 35 more samples from the ‘containment zones’.“Most of the 18 persons found positive yesterday are contacts of each other. Many of the men are believed to have met at gambling parties recently,” an official said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicPatiala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mandeep Singh Sidhu said, “It came to the fore during investigation that they held frequent get-togethers on a vacant plot near Anaj Mandi. Many residents of the locality confirmed that a group of men would remain there for hours.”The infection spread after a group of 5-6 men involved in illegal activities like gambling continued to hold get-togethers and arranged liquor and hookah parties on multiple occasions even after the lockdown came into force, another official said.Police have booked Krishan Kumar and Balraj, who tested positive for the coronavirus a day before, for allegedly endangering the life of fellow residents by violating curfew restrictions. The two travelled outstation before contracting the infection early this week, the SSP added.A case was registered against them under Sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease endangering life), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) and 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Disaster Management Act.With this, the district’s tally has risen to 49 cases, of which 47 have been reported in the past one week only.Town declared a buffer zone In a tweet, Punjab special chief secretary KBS Sidhu said Rajpura town was notified as a ‘buffer zone’ by the district administration.“Movement from Rajpura to Patiala has been restricted. The result of 40 samples taken from the town on Thursday will come on Friday,” Sidhu tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gambling-hookah-parties-turn-rajpura-into-punjab-s-new-covid-hotspot/story-BRB2Y2vkiO2JMfVwPcvF3L.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt orders landlords not to force students to pay rent for a month||Weeks after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged property owners in the city not to force tenants, especially migrant workers to pay their monthly rent during the lockdown, the Delhi government has issued a fresh order that covers students living in the city.The first order on migrant workers was issued on March 29 after Delhi witnessed a mass exodus of labourers in violation of lockdown rules and social distancing norms, despite appeals by the government urging them to stay back.In the days that followed, several student groups wrote to the chief minister seeking help on similar grounds, officials familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The fresh order issued on Wednesday -- HT has reviewed it -- calls for a waiver of at least one month’s rent and makes forceful eviction a punishable offence under the Disaster Management Act. It also directs district magistrates to spread awareness on this issue and advice people to call the police in case of a dispute. The order mandates that deputy commissioners of police in the city’s districts submit a weekly report to the district magistrate on such instances, starting April 27.Both orders — the one issued on March 29 and the other issued on Wednesday — invoked Section 22 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which particularly deals with the power of the state executive committee. In Delhi, for Covid-19 outbreak and the related lockdown, chief secretary Vijay Dev is the head of the committee and is the officer who signed both orders.“Instances of landlords forcing students for immediate payment of rent or forcefully evicting them have been brought to the knowledge of the government,” Dev said.The order said: “The district magistrates shall undertake awareness campaign on this issue particularly in areas with a higher density of migrant workers, labourers and students, to advice people to lodge complaints to police control room dialling 100…”The order comes as a big relief for hundreds of students who are stuck in Delhi due to the ongoing lockdown. The Delhi University’s Kerala Students’ Association last week wrote to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal stating that landlords were pressuring many students to pay rent.Amal K Simon, president of the association, said: “This will be a big relief. Many students from Kerala are stuck in Delhi. We are really happy that the government has brought this matter under the ambit of the Disaster Management Act.”A majority of the students enrolled in Delhi University colleges live in rented flats and paying guest accommodation in the absence of adequate hostel facilities. Many of those studying in Jawaharlal Nehru University also live in rented rooms in the Ber Sarai, Munirka and Kishangarh areas.Saket Moon, vice president of JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU), said that the government order will help many students who are unable to pay rents due to the delay in the release of their fellowship amounts because of the lockdown. BS Vohra, president of a residents’ welfare association (RWA) collective, however, said, “The government should also think about people whose only source of income is house rent. There are many such retired people, widows, disabled and elderly people in the city. They should be compensated.”A senior official in the chief minister’s office said the government is open to this and may come up with a scheme by next week.Office bearers of several other RWAs too raised the issue and said the fresh order would affect their livelihood, which is a constitutional right.Sanjay Hegde, a senior advocate in the Supreme Court, said: “This is a state executive committee’s response to a different form of disaster and such a committee has the power to specify measures to be taken for prevention or mitigation. A waiver of a month’s rent is arguably a measure of mitigation and is likely to be upheld, as such, if ever challenged in a court of law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-orders-landlords-not-to-force-students-to-pay-rent-for-a-month/story-4952qGoiMq6tAI7KSC7afO.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||2 days after Delhi’s Azadpur trader’s death, 300 shops shut||Nearly 300 registered shops in Azadpur agriculture produce market in Delhi remained closed on Thursday with the traders demanding authorities to scale up coronavirus tests in the market premises, amid concerns over the death of a vegetable dealer this week who tested Covid-19 positive.All closed shops were located in the D block of the market – the one where the dead trader’s fruits and vegetables shop is located. While two new cases had surfaced in the market on Wednesday, the daughter of a trader associated with the Mandi tested positive on Thursday. “The daughter of a trader tested positive. The entire family and other contacts will soon be traced and tested,” said Deepak Shinde, district magistrate (north).Senior officials of the health department said that they have no evidence to explore if the cases are interlinked but they did not dismiss the possibility either so far. The cases have sparked concerns among the traders, with some demanding that portions of the huge market be temporarily shifted to nearby areas. Meanwhile, the business partner of the dead trader has tested negative. HT has seen his test report. “I appeal to the authorities that all traders and workers in the market should be tested. It is not possible to maintain social distancing in such a busy market,” he said over the phone.The test results of the 15 employees at the shop are still awaited, Shinde said.FEAR AMONG TRADERSAnil Malhotra, a trader in D-Block and an elected member of the committee that manages the Azadpur market, said: “The D block of the market was closed today. It has 292 shops. Traders are scared. All of them have demanded that the government should scale up testing of people in the market. Groups have also demanded Rs 1 crore ex-gratia for the family the traders, if they die of Covid-19.” The Azadpur agriculture market is considered the food supply lifeline of the national capital. Spread over an area of around 101 acres, the market has around 2,800 registered dealers and employs around 12,000 people in a wide range of jobs -- porters, helpers, loaders, and accountants. On any normal day, it witnesses a footfall of more than 100,000 and the arrival of at least 3,000 trucks of fruits and vegetables.Adil Khan, chairperson of the Azadpur agriculture market committee, said: “Yes, several shops were closed but a larger part of the market continues to operate 24x7 and trade has increased manifold compared to the average of the previous week.” The decision to operate the market round-the-clock was announced by cabinet minister Gopal Rai, who also heads Delhi’s agriculture department, earlier this week in the light of farmer distress and supply crunch which had led to increase in retail prices of several fruits and vegetables last week amid the nationwide lockdown. Till last week, the market was operating on an odd-even basis, with traders in odd and even-numbered sheds opening their shops on alternate days. Khan further said: “Currently, the government is not in a position to test every trader and employee in the market. It is impractical. People must understand the basics. They should maintain hygiene, adhere to social distancing norms, look out for symptoms and quarantine themselves, if needed. Tests are for symptomatic individuals. There are clear guidelines on that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-days-after-azadpur-trader-s-death-300-shops-shut/story-QPWlhJHNuGTW0ZqTE3ksQJ.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||Tihar prisoners to make sanitisers, supply to police in Delhi||The prisoners of Tihar have, their own way, answered that age-old question: who watches the watchmen? Their answer: “We do”. And so, they are producing sanitisers exclusively for the use of policemen on duty across the city. A senior Delhi police officer said that the departments need for sanitisers and masks is very high because policemen are on the front line of efforts to combat the disease — managing containment zones, conducting checks, ensuring social distancing, even feeding the hungry. While there is no problem in getting masks, the demand for sanitisers across police stations is rising, the officer added on condition of anonymity. There was a discussion on manufacturing sanitisers, but the department realised it needed a licence.Deputy commissioner of police (licensing and welfare), Asif Mohd Ali, “We approached Tihar jail authorities. The prison department already produces its own sanitisers for internal use. They do it based on government guidelines and as per approved composition. From the fund of the Police Families Welfare Society(PFWS), we will supply the raw materials to the prisoners. The prisoners will help us by making the sanitisers. It will have the logo of the PFWS with the words ‘Prepared under specific licence inside Tihar’ written. We will get 200ml bottles and distribute it among our staff. This must be the first time in history that prisoners are directly helping the people (police) who put them there.”Of the 18,000 prisoners in Tihar when the lockdown began (around 3,000 have subsequently been released to reduce congestion), almost 95% were arrested by Delhi police. The remaining are those who were arrested by other agencies — such as the Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency, Enforcement Directorate, Department of Revenue Intelligence and Narcotics Control Bureau. The prisoners inside Tihar work in different units such as carpentry, bakery and bag-making. The furniture made inside the factory is supplied to government schools. About four months ago, the prison department obtained a drug licence to manufacture sanitisers inside prison. The in-house sanitisers were being used by the 18,000 prisoners.The director general of prisons, Sandeep Goel, confirmed that prisoners will be making sanitisers for the police.“Through this arrangement, our prisoners will be helping the police in the fight against Covid-19. As a front line force, the police personnel put themselves at great risk. Together, we will win this fight against Covid-19,” he said.Delhi police officers say the demand for sanitisers among the force is very high. Over 500 police personnel are in quarantine. A police station in Central Delhi has already been sealed. At least 28 police personnel have tested positive for the virus so far. Many police personnel who tested positive were posted in containment zones such as Chandni Mahal, Nabi Karim, Jahangirpuri. Around 30% of the police personnel at every station have been sent on leave but been told to join duty within an hour.Delhi police’s spokesperson, Mandeep Singh Randhawa, said the department has been ensuring adequate supply of masks and sanitisers. “Our force is fully prepared to deal with this pandemic. We have arranged for masks and sanitisers for everyone on the road. We will ensure that our men and women on the ground are fully equipped. We thank prisoners and jail authorities for helping us with the sanitisers. We have a common enemy today and we need to fight it together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tihar-prisoners-to-make-sanitisers-supply-to-police-in-delhi/story-WCEmSaJvseZm1re4x9PCEP.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||IIT-D develops cheaper RT-PCR test, gets ICMR nod||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, have developed a more economic real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for Covid-19. This will say will reduce the cost of a test by at least ₹700, they said.The government has capped the price for an RT-PCR test at private labs at ₹4,500.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved the kit on Thursday, making it the first kit by a research institute to get the approval. So far, RT-PCR kits of at least eight Indian companies have been approved by the ICMR.It will bring down the cost of the basic assay to ₹400 per test, from around ₹1,100 per assay at present.This is the first “probe-less” test that has been approved by the apex research body, which will help in not only making the tests cheaper, but also scalable. “All the tests that are currently available in India use a fluorescent probe for the readout from the assay. We have removed that step in our test kit. This does two things — one, the fluorescent probe is an expensive component and two, the manufacturers around the world are currently backed up and it is taking a while to get these, making it difficult to scale up tests,” said Prof Vivekananda Perumal, who heads the team that developed the kit, at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences in IIT Delhi.The team received the ICMR nod on Thursday evening and plans to apply for an approval from the drug regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation next week.“A few companies have shown interest and have been in touch with IIT. We will soon choose a manufacturing partner,” said Perumal.The kit had been submitted for an evaluation to ICMR’s National Institute of Virology in Pune in March, but had not been approved as the specificity was found to be 10%. The sensitivity was found to be 98%.Now, both the values are at 100%, a requirement for approval by ICMR.The specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease (or true negatives) and the sensitivity of a test is its ability to correctly identify those with the disease (or true positives).The team, which was initially working with the DNA sequence of the virus, said the efficiency of the test increased with the use of the viral RNA. The DNA encodes the genetic information in humans and the RNA copy of this genetic information is needed to build different proteins in the body.Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, encodes its genetic information in an RNA. The IIT Delhi team identified unique regions (short stretches of RNA sequences) in the Sars-Cov-2 genome, which are not present in other human coronaviruses, to make the test efficient.“I have not used a test kit without the fluorescent probe, so my confidence in the test is not high. This is not to say that there is anything wrong with the test. I will prefer conventional technology that I am comfortable with instead of trying out a new test at this time, even if it is cheaper,” said Dr Navin Dang, founder, Dr Dang’s Lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/iit-d-develops-cheaper-rt-pcr-test-gets-icmr-nod/story-6A20OO4vRdoTre9VgYfamK.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||36 ‘addicts’ fled from Delhi govt school shelters last month||Thirty-two persons managed to escape from a shelter home operating in a government school in Mukherjee Nagar between March 17 and March 21. Another four escaped from a shelter home in nearby Model Town around the same time.According to shelter home staffers as well as the police, most of those who escaped are drug addicts who were brought here from North Delhi areas like Kashmere Gate and Yamuna Bazar. Their “desperation for drugs” is causing them to flee, they said. At the Mukherjee Nagar centre, the escapees took advantage of an unguarded secondary gate of the school to flee on four separate nights. The presence of two unoccupied schools beyond the walls of this shelter home further helped them, said Mahesh Kumar, the school principal. In fact, on Saturday night, as many as 18 people escaped from here. “We carry out a headcount during breakfast every day. We found that people had escaped during the headcount,” Kumar said. There were 135 people at this shelter home. On Thursday, only 103 remained. “None of the 21 migrants staying here since April 1 has tried to escape,” he said. “I feel suffocated here,” a shabbily dressed masked man said, rolling up his sleeve to show injection marks on his arm. On Monday, the 25-year-old man, who worked as a daily wage labourer in North Delhi’s Yamuna Bazar, had made a failed attempt to scale the walls of the shelter home.He is being treated by doctors for drug withdrawal symptoms.Kumar said that most homeless persons brought here were displaying withdrawal symptoms, forcing the staffers to seek help from the Institute of Human Behavior and Sciences (IHBAS). “Some of them beg the school staff to arrange drugs and beedis for them. One day, they turned aggressive with us for repeatedly serving rice instead of rotis,” Kumar said.Amit Pal, another labourer from Yamuna Bazar said that the escapees used to talk about arranging tobacco products and drugs. “They didn’t talk about escaping, but they got away night after night while the rest of us slept,” Pal said. Now, school staff and civil defence volunteers have been deployed at the points of escape at night. “We have arranged rotis for the inmates and are also holding happiness classes and yoga sessions for them,” Kumar said.They have also piled up desks along the stretches leading to the escape points. While the desks are clearly not enough to prevent an escape, the school staff said that they hoped that an escape attempt would create noise and alert the people on duty. Deepak Shinde, the district magistrate of North Delhi, said that the two centres have seen additional deployment since the escapes, and the police have been asked to take legal action. The police said that an FIR has been registered at Mukherjee Nagar and Model Town police stations. “We have booked the escaped people under a section pertaining to disobedience to an order by a public servant. Our teams are looking for them,” deputy commissioner of police (north-west), Vijayanta Arya, said. But tracing them won’t be an easy task. “We have only their names and approximate addresses that they mentioned while being brought to the shelters. They submitted neither the copies of their identity proofs nor their photographs,” another investigator said.None of the 36 escapees has been traced so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/36-escape-from-two-north-delhi-shelter-homes-school-staff-pile-up-benches-to-keep-others-from-escaping/story-64iyPfJqnaCZk3lfhZUYhP.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi feels the sting as Covid work made priority||Breeding of drain-borne Culex mosquito is a cause for concern as the municipal staff is mostly engaged in activities, such as spraying disinfectants, to contain coronavirus. April is the start of the breeding season for this genus of mosquito and officials have started receiving complaints of mosquito menace from residents.Usually, around this time of the year, field workers (FWs) of civic agencies undertake drives to kill mosquito larvae in drains and ponds. Equipped with backpacks and 6,000-litre tanks, workers spray chemicals — BTI (bacillus israelensis), temephos emulsifier and diflubenzuron — to contain the mosquito growth.At present, besides undertaking sanitisation drives and tracing Covid-19 patients, the sanitation staff is working at 10% below its total capacity. Many field workers and domestic breeding checkers (DBC), who primarily destroy larvae in coolers and water tanks in households, are unable to reach their work stations due to the lockdown.“Many of our workers come from far off places like Sonepat and Ballabhgarh in Haryana, and Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh, via trains. But with the train service shut, they are unable to reach Delhi,” said Devanand Sharma of the Anti-Malaria Ekta Karamchari Union.“Some of us have been promised health insurance, but not everybody wants to risk contracting Covid-19 and worse, spreading it to their families at home,” Sharma said.The three municipal corporations of Delhi employ around 5,000 FWs and DBCs, who are the front-line workers to contain the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria and chikungunya. These two posts — FWs and DBCs — were created after a massive dengue outbreak in Delhi in 1996, which affected 10,252 people and caused 423 deaths.“The silver lining here is that Culex in Delhi is not known to cause any disease, unlike the malaria-causing Anopheles or dengue-causing Aedes Aegypti. Both Anopheles and Aedes breed in freshwater, such as in puddles formed during monsoon, and not in drains. Culex is infamous for its nuisance value only,” said Dr Lallan Verma, public health officer, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).“However, Culex is definitely responsible for causing several hundred cases of Japanese encephalitis and filariasis in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Migrants from these areas are always coming to Delhi for work opportunities and there is always a chance of these diseases arriving in Delhi too with them, via the Culex,” he said.Municipal health officer (MHO) with the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), Dr Somashekhar, said even the DBCs who are undertaking drives to check mosquito breeding are facing problems.“People are not opening the gates. They are obviously scared that our workers, who are out in the public, may be carrying the virus. So our FWs are passing on instructions to residents at the gates. We (the authorities in headquarters) have also shot letters to group housing societies today that in such paralysing conditions, they will have to ensure that water doesn’t collect anywhere on their premises, in coolers or puddles,” he said.Meanwhile, the north municipal corporation’s mayor, Avtar Singh, wrote to the Lieutenant Governor, Anil Baijal, on Monday requesting that his employees be “exempted from participating in a COVID warriors team ordered for by the Chief Secretary.”“We are already constrained with the anti-larvae work we have to carry out. We request you to please excuse us from this work,” he wrote.The north municipality commissioner, Varsha Joshi, said, “It is true that a lot of mosquito-related complaints are coming and we are doing our best to contain larvae proliferation, including raising the larvae-eating Gambusia fish at designated spots like PUSA Institute.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mosquito-menace-starts-as-covid-activities-take-precedence/story-mmoxaoUI1CWvF6mCKHcw4L.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s Mehrauli on alert after vegetable vendor tests positive||A contact tracing nightmare is staring at district officials in south Delhi’s Mehrauli who were sent into a tizzy on Thursday evening after a vegetable vendor who used to roam around from one block to another with his cart tested positive for Covid-19. Vegetables are listed as essentials and the vendor operated across Mehrauli amid the ongoing lockdown. As on Thursday evening, 2376 people have tested positive for the contagious disease in Delhi. While 50 people have died so far, 808 have recovered, as per the latest Delhi government data.Soon after the test report came out, officials from the sub divisional magistrate’s office and civil volunteers were roped in to patrol localities in Mehrauli zone and make announcements on loudspeakers to alert the residents about the situation and ask them to remain indoors, a senior government official said.“The vendor is admitted in a hospital now. His wife and children have been quarantined and they will be tested at the earliest. Contact tracing will be the biggest challenge in this case because he regularly procured vegetables from the Okhla market, frequented the Mehrauli market and used his cart to travel from block to block selling vegetables. Public announcement is underway in the entire zone,” said BM Mishra, district magistrate (south).He said the vegetable seller lives in a slum in Mehrauli and contact tracing in the next few hours would help the government decide if that has to be sealed and declared a containment zone. “The whole of Mehrauli will now be under stricter surveillance. Any decision on more containment zones will depend on out assessment,” Mishra added. Earlier on Thursday, the area around A3 Lake View apartment in Mehrauli was notified as a containment zone after a nurse working with a south Delhi government hospital – with no dedicated Covid ward – tested positive the previous day. On Thursday, her father-in-law tested positive too, said a senior government official.The official said, “They are a family of nine members of which two have tested positive and five are symptomatic. The other two are children below 10 years age. They all have been quarantined and they will be tested at the earliest.”More than 200 people live in the apartment but there are clusters around it with high population density, another official in the health department said.Other than Lake View apartment in South Delhi’s Mehrauli, two more containment zones were notified in the Capital on Thursday - one in Raj Nagar II in Dwarka and Shahdara’s Dayanand Vihar – taking the total number of such “red zones” to 92. These are entirely sealed lanes and blocks subjected to strict surveillance, health checks, sanitisation, tests and and doorstep delivery of essentials so that residents do not have to venture out. Earlier, a pizza delivery person associated with an outlet in Malviya Nagar had tested Covid positive, following which 72 families were directed to go for home quarantine. The test results of the 72 have come negative. The delivery person is a resident of Savitri Vihar in South Delhi’s Malviya Nagar. The area round his residence was cordoned off as a containment zone last week.A senior official said, tracing contacts for the pizza person was easier because orders he had delivered were recorded with the food outlet. He was part of mobile application-based food delivery aggregator services too. “But there are no records when it comes to a vegetable vendor who operates freely in an area,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mehrauli-on-alert-after-vegetable-vendor-tests-positive/story-UVEFWRzepSHCpqnpG9oIVO.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi Covid-19 death toll hits 50, as 128 more test positive||With two more deaths recorded on Thursday, the Covid-19 toll of the city reached 50. More than half of these deaths were among people aged than 60 years or older, while 84% had other comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, heart and kidney disease.On Thursday, the number of cases in Delhi increased by 128, taking the total number of Covid-19 cases to 2,376, as per the daily health bulletin of the Delhi government. For the last three days, Delhi had recorded a higher number of recoveries than infections. However, on Thursday, only 84 people recovered from Covid-19 in Delhi, as per the data. So far, 808 people have recovered. Of the 1,518 people in the city with the infection, 422, with moderate to severe symptoms, are admitted to nine designated hospitals. Of these, 23 people are in the intensive care units, with eight on ventilators. As many as 822 people with very mild or no symptoms are admitted to eight Covid Care Centres. Besides, 59 people with moderate symptoms are admitted to two Ayurvedic Hospitals, which have been converted into Covid Health Centres. “The government has now decided that only the category III patients — who either have severe symptoms or are at a high risk of developing such symptoms — will be admitted to the hospital. There are five levels of facilities right now — the Covid testing centres, where samples are collected, isolation centres, for those awaiting their results, Covid Care Centres in government flats, etc, to admit those with mild symptoms, Covid Health Centres, to admit those with moderate symptoms,” said Dr JC Passey, medical director of Lok Nayak hospital, the biggest Covid-19 centre in the city.Hospitals constitute the fifth level of the facilities.On Thursday, 2,251 test samples were collected, with reports of 3,068 pending. So far, 5,691 samples have been collected from the community.The government on Thursday set up a state-level media cell to monitor the social media and news for issues related to Covid-19, misinformation, complaints, and requests for medical intervention. A committee of nursing and paramedical staff has also been set up to monitor the quality, quantity and timing of food distribution and accommodation in the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-death-toll-hits-50-as-128-more-test-positive/story-K6VvK2Fy1ZK55TICr28KJJ.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||Are hospitals becoming high-risk zones for Covid infections?||City hospitals might have become the new “high-risk” areas, with more and more doctors and patients testing positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The district authorities had raised the issue with the lieutenant governor this week. Fifty-seven healthcare workers—including 21 doctors at the Delhi-government run Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini—are being tested for Covid-19 after coming in contact with a suspected patient in the emergency department last week. The 40-year-old woman from Jahangirpuri was admitted to the hospital’s medical emergency ward in isolation, where she later died. There was a similar scare in Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital last week, where 68 members of the staff had to be quarantined. However, they returned to duty a day later when the suspected patient tested negative.In Jahangirpuri’s Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital, staff members started testing positive for Covid-19 over the weekend. Till Thursday evening, 10 healthcare workers—some asymptomatic—tested positive for the infection. Around 191 hospital staff had to be quarantined. “We do not know where they got the infection from; however, this area is a hot spot. Many of our staff members live around the area and patients from the area also come here. We do screen them for symptoms before allowing them in, but if they are asymptomatic carriers, what can we do?” said a doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity. To prevent infection within the hospitals located in hot spots, the union health ministry on Monday had advised a clear demarcation between the out-patient clinics and the wards where patients are tested for Covid-19 and admitted. This, however, is not the norm in Delhi. All of the 11 districts in Delhi are hot spots.All hospitals have set up flu clinics that are separate from the main building to screen patients for fever and cough and any history to suggest contact with a positive person. Only those that the doctors suspect are asked to get tested. Looking for an infection, however, is not enough as even Indian Council of Medical Research—the country’s apex health research body—says that 80% of the people either have nil or very mild symptoms.“Hospitals are likely to become high-risk areas. This is because the doctors are not testing everyone—that is not possible. What we are doing is running flu clinics—if you have fever, cough and cold you go there. So, if a large number of the population has no symptom, then if they will infect doctors and nurses once they get to the hospital, who will then pass it on to others—colleagues, families and patients. This is going to happen unless in the future there are cheap testing kits, and everybody coming to the hospital is tested before they come in,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS). He is the chairperson of the five-member committee that advises the chief minister on Covid-19.Delhi hospitals have started scaling up services, including routine surgeries, Monday onwards as per the guidelines of the union home ministry.Hospital hotspotsThe paediatric intensive care unit of Lady Hardinge Medical College in central Delhi emerged as a hotbed for infections last week, with 12 healthcare workers from the ward testing positive for Covid-19. Two children in the ward —a 45-day-old and a 10-month-old—were also infected, with the 45-day-old baby succumbing to the infection on Saturday morning. The baby is the youngest person to die of Covid-19 in the country so far. The father of the 45-day-old baby has also tested positive for the infection.The authorities are yet to trace the source of the infection. Before that, the Delhi State Cancer Institute had come under the scanner, where 25 healthcare workers had tested positive. Four cancer patients admitted to the hospital and the relative of one of the patients also contracted Covid-19. Two of the patients died. The 2-year-old child of one of the nurses in the hospital also tested positive. This Tuesday, the hospital reopened its out-patient clinics after putting a screening mechanism in place.Not just healthcare professionals, but a lot of patients, with no history of foreign travel, who have visited some hospitals have also tested positive, said a senior Delhi government official.“The increase in the number of healthcare workers, and those posted at hospitals and their contacts testing positive is a cause for concern. It might be that adequate measures for protection from the infection are not being taken by hospital authorities, including those not treating Covid-19 cases. There is an urgent need to fix these lapses,” said a district magistrate, requesting anonymity.Infections at homeBut it is not just the hospital, doctors and the patients visiting the hospitals also take the infection back home. For instance, a house in northeast Delhi’s Shastri Park was declared a containment zone after a cancer patient and her daughter tested positive. Their family members were placed under home quarantine.Similarly, a few days ago, two lanes in Mahavir Enclave in the south-west district were declared containment zones after a nurse, her two family members, her neighbour and his 20-month-old son tested positive. A senior northeast Delhi district official said, “A constable posted at Bara Hindu Rao Hospital had tested positive a few days ago. His wife and daughter are also positive.”In the last two days, the south-west district has reported five cases of healthcare professionals and paramedic staff testing positive, while the south district has close to eight such cases. “There are several patients who go to hospitals for treatment. Hospitals have to ensure a high standard of hygiene and sanitisation. They should also provide Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) to all the staff,” said another district magistrate.Currently, only the healthcare workers in Covid-19 wards wear the full PPE kits, as per the recommendations of the union health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/are-hospitals-becoming-high-risk-zones-for-covid-infections/story-OcDYNhdcXvlnsUxdnYwolN.html
24-04-2020||Gurugram||Senior citizens a high priority for Rail Vihar residents||To help senior citizens, particularly those living alone, procure daily essentials residents of Rail Vihar in Sector 47 have set up a dedicated team. The team of volunteers delivers their daily requirements to their doorsteps.Senior citizens can call up any of the volunteers for help to procure not only consumables, such as dairy products and groceries, but also medicines, at any time of the day. The team of 10, mostly members of the residents’ welfare association (RWA), also call up seniors from time to time to check their requirements.“They have been informed that they can reach out to any of us for help in getting essential items. We have advised them against stepping out, as they are the most vulnerable to the disease,” said RK Sharma, the president of the RWA.Sharma said that neighbours of senior citizens, when they step out to stock up, are also helping in the procurement of essential items.Girish Bhatnagar, 70, who lives with his wife, said, “The society is providing assistance to seniors who are living alone. There must be around six such residents like us. When we have deliveries at the gate, the society deputes someone to drop the supply to our apartment so that we don’t need to step out. Also, when they buy gloves and masks, some are given to us. Sometimes, we place our orders on WhatsApp at the shop inside the complex and pay through PayTM. The owner drops off the items after he closes his shop, at the end of the day.”He adds that since the lockdown happened, the couple have caught up on indoor exercises, including ‘pranayama’ (breathing exercises).The society, which has 300 families, has cut down the number of staff on the premises to four, responsible for cleaning, maintenance and housekeeping. Sanitisation drives have been carried out twice in the complex, with the help of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram.At the gate, the society has placed sanitisers and provided masks to all employees. Unable to procure an infrared thermometer, the society has placed a digital thermometer with the guards to measure temperatures of those suspected to have a fever. “We were unable to get a thermal gun due to stocks running low. So, we have given the guards a digital thermometer, to be used on those suspected of running a high temperature,” said Sharma.The residency has restricted all deliveries to the entry gate, from where residents pick them up. Residents receive alerts about the same on a shared app. The RWA has also placed three to four tables outside its gate for delivery executives to drop off their packages.Entry of visitors has also been suspended since the lockdown was imposed. Household helps have also been directed to suspend work, except for those helping senior citizens and those needing constant assistance. “In some cases, we have allowed the helpers to stay with the seniors, if it is a necessary support for them,” said Amrish Kumar, secretary of the RWA.The society decided to close its clubhouse and park even before the lockdown, to prevent large gatherings. The RWA, through a circular, also asked residents to stop taking walks. However, a few residents have resumed taking walks, albeit in different time slots, said Sharma. “The park was closed about the time the MCG sealed the others,” said Alok Goel, who has been residing here for 11 years.The society has one grocery shop on its premises complex. Residents can place their orders in advance through WhatsApp and collect the same after payment. “We have one shop that caters to our essential needs. When shopping, we ensure social distancing and use of masks by everyone,” said Kumar.When the lockdown began, the society decided to contribute food packets to be distributed by third parties in slums. Families were directed to provide two packets, each, on Wednesday and Saturday. However, over time, the initiative has dwindled, said Sharma.“We had informed residents that the food packets would be collected from 10-11 am. Tables were set up for residents to place their food packets. At its peak, we collected 80-150 packets. After the lockdown extension, we saw little interest in the initiative and so, we stopped it last Saturday,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/senior-citizens-a-high-priority-for-rail-vihar-residents/story-qW9q7EtVafLPWgkW9DuCgN.html
24-04-2020||Mumbai||4.2K Covid-19 cases reported in Mumbai, 930 containment zones||The number of containment zones in Mumbai shot up by 117 between Tuesday and Wednesday, taking the total to 930 as of Wednesday evening, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The total number of Covid-19 positive cases in the city also increased by 522 on Thursday, taking the total to 4,205. Mumbai has seen a total of 167 deaths, with six new deaths recorded on Thursday.However, a presentation made by municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi and chief secretary Ajoy Mehta to the Centre said there are 771 containment zones in Mumbai. Explaining the difference, Pardeshi told Hindustan Times, “The number of containment zones increases every day, and fluctuates as some zones finish their 14-day quarantine period, and show no patients with symptoms.” Pardeshi confirmed that as of Wednesday evening, there were 930 recorded containment zones in the city. The G-South ward in Worli crossed the 500 Covid-19 positive cases mark, and recorded 507 cases as of Wednesday. The same data revealed that 62.8% (2,360) of the total cases in Mumbai fall in seven wards –G-South, E ward of Byculla, L ward of Kurla, K-West ward of Andheri West, F-North ward of Wadala, G-North ward of Dadar and Dharavi, D ward of Tardeo and Malabar Hill, and K-East ward of Andheri East.However, the silver lining is that most new cases are among people already quarantined by the BMC. “It is a good thing because it means we have been able to contain the spread to the area which is already a containment zone. In containment zones, there is rigorous contact tracing, testing, fever clinics, and strict lockdown,” said Pardeshi.Also, the BMC removed 187 containment zones from its list until Wednesday, as these are areas have finished their 14-day quarantine period and showed no new cases.The solution for BMC going forward is quarantining more people, who are contacts of Covid-19 positive cases. Another method of containing the outbreak in these areas is monitoring human movement with drone images. “We are flying drones every day, all the time, and carefully inspecting feed from them for any crowding. Police or ward staff is immediately intimated, and these people are moved indoors. Food packets are delivered on time.”Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G-North ward, said, “We are increasing our quarantine facilities and ensuring that our hotspots and containment zones have a regular supply of food and medicines.”Dharavi recorded 25 new cases and one death on Thursday taking the total count to 214 cases, and total 13 deaths. K-WEST WARD SEES 41 cases in 24 HRSSagar PillaiMUMBAIThe K-West ward, which covers Andheri West, Irla, Juhu, Oshiwara and parts of Jogeshwari, has reported 41 cases within 24 hours, taking the tally to 264, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s data on Wednesday. There were 123 positive patients on April 17. So far, 32 patients have been cured and discharged. Anand Nagar and Gandhi Nagar are among the seven hotspots.Ranjeet Dhakane, deputy municipal commissioner of K-West ward, said, “A majority of the hotpsots are in slum areas. We are setting up more fever clinics. A door-to-door survey is being carried out to identify people at high risk and quarantine them within three hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-2k-covid-19-cases-reported-in-mumbai-930-containment-zones/story-dbfG406prLijWH7j5JsstN.html

24-04-2020||Chandigarh||Screen, test all patients for Covid-19, demand PGIMER doctors||The faculty members at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) have demanded that all patients visiting the tertiary care institute be tested to rule out the possibility of coronavirus infection spread.The faculty association raised the issue after a six-month-old baby admitted to the institute with a cardiac problem tested positive for the coronavirus disease in a pre-operative test, following which 54 health workers were quarantined and tested negative. The association has highlighted that the infection among healthcare workers ranges between 10-20% all over the world and has been reported from medical Institutes in India as well. “PGIMER should take only referred patients at least from district/state hospitals and there should be no direct registration. The issue may be taken up with chief secretaries of adjoining states,” a press release from the association said.“Patients should also get tested in their local designated state and medical college lab in order to avoid delays at the PGIMER,” said Dr JS Thakur, president of the association.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said the demand was under active consideration of the administration and a decision in this regard was expected shortly. “We will not go with haphazard testing, but also feel that all incoming patients should be screened and tested for Covid-19,” Ram said.OTHER ISSUES FLAGGEDThakur said the PGIMER administration was putting efforts for provision of mask and personal protection equipment as per the institute guidelines, but there were still issues related to equitable distribution which needed to be addressed.“The protocol which the institute has, has been refined four times, but we need to ensure that what is on paper is being followed on the ground too,” Thakur said.General secretary of the association, Dr Arun Bansal, said, “The main focus of the administration is the screening of Covid-19 and the Nehru Extension Block where the patients concerned are. However, doctors from other areas, where some surgery or procedure are to be conducted, should be provided better safety gear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/screen-test-all-patients-for-covid-19-pgimer-docs-demand/story-xryqgJYojBkhOt8DMcs1iP.html
24-04-2020||Delhi||2 more Delhi cops test Covid-positive, 28 personnel now infected in Capital||Two more Delhi Police officers tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Thursday, taking the total number of infected personnel in the city to 28. Both the personnel are assistant sub-inspectors (ASI) in different wings of the Delhi police force, and were asymptomatic. They have now been sent to separate quarantine centres in the city. The rising number of cases among police officers in the city highlights the dangers frontline workers are exposed to, in the fight against the contagious disease.One of the officers is posted with the police’s crime branch at its office in north Delhi’s Kotwali. The other is attached with the anti-terror special cell office in Lodhi Colony, where a head constable had tested positive for the disease on Sunday. As many as 72 personnel of the office were sent to self quarantine on Tuesday, and all personnel at the office were also asked to get themselves tested.The head constable had been admitted to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital on April 11 after displaying flu-like symptoms. Of the 28 Delhi Police personnel infected with Covid-19, 12 are from Nabi Karim and Chandni Mahal police stations in central Delhi, and six from the Jahangirpuri police station, who tested positive on Tuesday. All three police stations are among the 89 neighbourhoods in the city that have been declared “containment”or red zones. Residents of these zones are not allowed to step out of their houses, and authorities deliver essential items to doorsteps. Entries and exits to and from these neighbourhood are restricted as well, and pickets are continuously guarded by police personnel.A senior special cell officer said their ASI was not among the 72 who are in self-quarantine, as he had not been visiting the office regularly. “The ASI informed us that he has tested positive for the virus. He has now been shifted to a quarantine centre. His family members, who live in northeast Delhi’s Babarpur, are now in home quarantine. His contacts are being traced to ascertain whom he contracted the infection from,” the special cell officer said. In the other case, deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rajan Bhagat said the ASI lives in a Shahdara neighbourhood that has already been designated a containment zone. “The ASI was off duty, since his residential area was declared a containment zone. His family members are in home quarantine, and he has been shifted to a quarantine centre. Three personnel who worked with him in the Kotwali office have been screened, and have tested negative,” Bhagat said.Of the 28 Delhi Police personnel found positive so far in the city, an assistant sub-inspector in the traffic police, who was the first to be diagnosed, was discharged from hospital last Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-more-delhi-police-officers-test-covid-ve-number-of-cases-in-force-up-to-28/story-qOpIuGWNUxV2VCmVgM5pAP.html
24-04-2020||Pune||33,000 vehicles seized in a month during lockdown in Pune||In a month during the lockdown to curb the spread of Sars-cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection, the Pune police have seized over 33,000 vehicles.According to police between March 23 and April 22, 10,843 cases were registered under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC), 33,141 vehicles including two and four-wheelers were seized, and 36,689 warning notices were issued.In the first few days of the lockdown, the police were issuing warning notices and confiscating keys of vehicles of lockdown violators. However, as the spread of the Sars-Cov2 virus increased, the lockdown was also intensified.With the number of vehicle seizures going up, the places used for storage of seized vehicles are filling up fast. For example, the Shivajinagar police station, where multiple vehicles are already languishing, the newly seized vehicles are piling up. However, there is open ground around the police station which can be used if the police choose to, said police officials.At Kondhwa police station, a patch of land near the police station is generally used for vehicles seized from vehicle thieves, traffic rule violators, or accident spots. However, the already filled-up space is now used to park vehicles which are being seized from lockdown violators.Senior police inspector Vinayak Gaikwad of Kondhwa police station, said, “There is a ground near the traffic division. Right now that is being used.”“We are seizing vehicles of violators for a day whenever possible and then returning them by evening, but if the vehicle is seized under a case (under Section 188 of IPC), then it has to be confiscated,” said Gaikwad.While most of the seized vehicles are two-wheelers, there are cars also getting seized for plying on the streets without reason, said officials.Action taken between March 23 and April 22 10,843 : cases under Section 188 of IPC33,141: vehicles seized36,689: notices issuedCases reported on WednesdayCases under Section 188 of IPC- 510Vehicle seized- 1073Crpc notices issued -970Morning walkers detained -207Mask rule violations- 47||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/33-000-vehicles-seized-in-a-month-during-lockdown-in-pune/story-KyxbAoCFpERhcXisomk10K.html
24-04-2020||Chandigarh||Police stations run out of space for parking impounded vehicles of curfew violators||The issue of police stations in Ludhiana running out of space to park the impounded vehicles of curfew violators has left the police officials scratching their heads.Since the lockdown, the police have to date, impounded 4,500 vehicles (mostly two-wheelers) which are parked outside police station buildings.Cops said the vehicles impounded in various other cases are already occupying the entire parking space in police station compounds. “With no space left in police stations to park the impounded vehicles of curfew violators, we have parked these vehicles around police station buildings,” they said.To solve the problem, the police personnel, who are already overburdened due to curfew duties, have requested the senior officials to release the vehicles after checking the documents. However, the documents will be released after the vehicle owner will pay the fine.An SHO, requesting anonymity, said, “The police station yard is already full with case properties. Now, we have to accommodate the impounded vehicles of curfew violators also. At least 20 vehicles are being impounded every day.”The impounded vehicles of curfew violators will be released after the curfew will be lifted.606 CURFEW VIOLATORS HELDPolice commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said the Ludhiana Police have registered 344 FIRs of curfew violations in city and 606 residents have been arrested. “Over 13,000 curfew violators were rounded up and sent to open jails. But they were let off after they pleaded guilty and their records were verified,” the police chief said.”I appeal to the people to follow the norms in view of the curfew for their own benefit. If people stay indoors, they will keep themselves and their family members safe from Covid-19. We do not want to be strict with anyone,” Agrawal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-stations-run-out-of-space-for-parking-impounded-vehicles-of-curfew-violators/story-pPsXfwZSUeK1Gn4M2eecwN.html
24-04-2020||Noida||Temporary jail in Ghaziabad for suspects of coronavirus-related cases||On directions of the Uttar Pradesh home department, Ghaziabad district will soon set up a temporary jail where those who attacked police personnel and healthcare workers, those linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi who had hid their association history, and foreign nationals apprehended during the lockdown will be lodged. The state director general (prisons) said the temporary jails have started to come up in 34 districts across the state.In Ghaziabad, it will be set up at Adhyatmik Nagar near Dasna, where district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey and senior superintendent of police Kalanidhi Naithani went for inspection on Thursday afternoon.“A facility at Adhyatmik Nagar has been identified and inspection was done to assess facilities. A final decision for a temporary jail will soon be made. The facility should be able to house those -- about 282 so far -- who attended various religious congregations or foreign nationals apprehended in Ghaziabad,” Pandey added.Earlier in April, the Ghaziabad police had picked up several persons from the Sahibabad area, including some citizens of Nepal and Indonesia.UP’s Director General (DG – prisons) Anand Kumar said: “The district magistrate is empowered to make temporary jails and decide the location as well. The idea behind this is to keep the usual inmates lodged in regular jails away from the people linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event, the foreign nationals or those arrested for attacking police and healthcare staff, due to the coronavirus threat,” Kumar said.“Many of these persons are in isolation or quarantine and will be shifted to the temporary jails once they complete their isolation/quarantine period. Here, they will be under judicial custody,” he added.According to official records, 11 districts in the state have so far set up temporary jails where a total of 132 Indian nationals and 156 foreign nationals are lodged. The rest of the 23 districts where temporary jails are going to be set up include Ghaziabad, Meerut, Baghpat, Agra and Mathura.“There is a provision in the jail manual where the district magistrate is empowered to create such jails in times of emergency situations like an epidemic, etc. With the creation of these temporary jails we do not wish to bring into contact any of our regular inmates with people who have Covid-19 disease,” Kumar added.According to official records, there are 71 regular prisons in the state which house about 90,000 inmates at present. Ghaziabad has a regular prison at Dasna.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said people who attended religious congregations and even foreign nationals nabbed in Ghaziabad have almost “saturated.”“We have a figure of about 282 such persons and our area is now saturated. We don’t expect more people to be found further. However, the Ghaziabad police are keeping a watch with the help of surveillance activities,” DM Pandey said.After the inspection of the proposed temporary jail at Adhyatmik Nagar, the DM on Thursday evening gave directions to different departments, including the police, to make arrangements for barricading, CCTVs, deployment of police force, electricity connections and proper cleaning and sanitisation of the premises.Under the electronic surveillance measures, the police obtain CDRs of suspects and can track their contacts and also their locations with the help of data obtained from the cellular operators.Police said they have so far tracked or assisted in more 1,000 cases linked to the Covid-19 disease and have so far tracked about 200 Covid-19 positive patients or their close contacts in Ghaziabad.“The surveillance activities are regularly going on and are being taken up on requests of the health department. We have taken care of hundreds of requests which have come from police of other states and also from various districts in UP. The electronic surveillance is taken up in order to find the movement of suspects or their close contacts. In Ghaziabad alone we have tracked about 200 persons who are either positive cases or their close contacts,” said Prakash Kumar, superintendent of police (crime).He added that most of the cases tracked by the district police were linked to people who had attended religious congregations and even related to Ceasefire, the Noida-based company from which a large number of cases – 45 in Gautam Budh Nagar and over 17 in other districts -- had come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/temporary-jail-in-ghaziabad-to-keep-suspects-who-had-a-brush-with-covid-19/story-SaTHyyvm2jr64024J03ISI.html
24-04-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad told to set up 500-bed L1 category Covid-19 facility||A four-member team sent by the Union health ministry which visited Ghaziabad on Wednesday has directed the district administration to come up with a 500-bed L1 category Covid-19 facility in the city to treat non-critical positive cases.The officials of the district health department said they have launched a search for a building where the facility can be set up.“The health ministry team visited Ghaziabad, and expressed satisfaction about the arrangements we have put in place to deal with Covid-19 cases. However, they have asked us to come up with a 500-bed facility where Covid-19 positive patients can be kept. Our officials have started a search. The building need not be a 500-bed hospital as such, it can be a banquet hall, college or any other similar building where the facility can come up,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said.At present, Ghaziabad has one L1 category Covid-19 hospital at Muradnagar which can host up to 30 patients at a time. The officials said the Muradnagar facility will not cater to coronavirus cases, once the 500-bed facility is set up. They added that positive patients from other nearby districts can also be accommodated at the new facility once it starts operating.Under the three-tier dedicated health care facilities to deal with Covid-19 cases, the Uttar Pradesh government has identified different health centres under L1, L2 and L3 levels with L1 catering to non-critical Covid-19 patients, while L2 and L3 will deal with more complicated and critical cases. The L1 attached is a sub-category under L1, for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients.Health officials said most of the Covid-19 patients in Ghaziabad are either at Covid-19 facility in Muradnagar or at the ESI Hospital in Sahibabad. Till Thursday evening, no patient was admitted to the L2 facility at Sanjay Nagar.“In Ghaziabad, we have a 76-bed L1 attached facility at ESI Hospital, Sahibabad. We have an L2 hospital in Sanjay Nagar which is now a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. At present, we have no patient at the Sanjay Nagar district combined hospital. Once we start with a 500-bed L1 category facility, health centre at Muradnagar will not cater to Covid-19 cases,” Dr Gupta added.The CMO said that only two patients—residents of Indirapuram, both suffering from cancer, have been referred to L3 hospitals at Meerut and Delhi, respectively.In another related development, the state government on Thursday decided to send two senior state officials to each district which has reported 20 or more Covid-19 positive cases.“We have about 15 officials from state and districts’ administration, and another officer from the state health department, and these officials will be sent to these districts with 20 or more cases in a pair of two to monitor the lockdown and healthcare-related efforts. They will camp in these districts for a week,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).“The chief minister has given directions for strict enforcement of the lockdown across the state. We have directed officials to keep a close watch on border areas and seize any commercial vehicles if they are found carrying more than two persons other than the driver and the helper. People who will violate lockdown norms will be nabbed and sent to quarantine centres, and their vehicle will also be seized,” he added.The Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts have already sealed their borders with Delhi to keep the number of positive Covid-19 cases from rising.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-told-to-set-up-500-bed-l1-category-covid-19-facility/story-WoTIQIRcnTDcjuYyfNgG7K.html

Around 16 students, some foreigners, have started vacating their rooms in the hostels for shifting to the girls’ hostels on the Sector 14 campus.The decision came on Thursday in a virtual meeting of a committee under the chairmanship of dean university instructions (DUI) Shankar Ji Jha. International hostel warden Harveen Kaur said, “The students are vacating the hostels. If they cannot come, there is no compulsion to take their belongings.”The university will store the belongings of the hostellers in such cases. In case students have any valuable items in the hostel, they have to inform the wardens concerned.“The university will pack up the belongings of the students and store them with labels in a single room. The process will be carried under video surveillance,” said a member of the committee.The university has decided that time will be given to the students to collect their belongings or they can authorise any person to collect these on their behalf. The varsity has also requested the Chandigarh deputy commissioner to issue curfew passes to facilitate collection of belongings by outsiders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-contingency-plan-pu-starts-vacating-4-hostels-for-chandigarh-admn/story-pxLkeORBKKgZ3rDes9UgSN.html

He said good leadership, public participation and awareness was much better in these wards than in other parts of the city. “People have been responding well to social distancing. Even the slightest mismanagement or anyone found breaking the rules is being reported by the people themselves which is like a social policing on the people by the people which is helping keep down the figures,” Gaikwad said.Dr Ganesh Damale, ward medical officer at Aundh-Baner ward, is responsible for the home surveillance in Aundh-Baner ward said, “We kept a strict watch on not just foreign travellers but domestic travellers by including society chairmen and local leaders who keep us informed. Any person found with any flu like symptoms is immediately referred to the nearby flu clinic and from thereon to the hospital if required for swab testing. Also we ensure that home quarantine is strictly being followed not just for 14 days but for 28 days by calling the person daily and also cross checking with the society chairman.”Ram Sonawane, ward medical officer and responsible for home surveillance at Kothrud said, “We ensured separate disposal vehicles for waste from quarantine centres. At slums we ensured that we sprayed over 1,000 toilets seats at public toilets with one percent sodium hypochlorite atleast three times a day. We asked our staff coming from Bhawani peth or Kashiwadi, both which are red zones to take leave to contain the spread. All society chairpersons were added in a common groups to inform about any new person entering their societies be it a vegetable vendor too. Every shopkeeper made sure that social distancing was being followed.Each ward has been appointed with a civic doctor who will look into the house-to-house survey. Sandip Shankarrao Kadam, assistant ward officer at Kothrud ward said, “We found only one positive and that patient too has been discharged. We kept a strict surveillance on the people who came from foreign travel or from the Tabligi event at Delhi. We disinfected all public places for seven days continuously which contained the spread of the virus.

Officials in the know said the process had begun at the Sector 6 civil hospital in the district.As per information, the hospital administration has finalised a space near the psychiatric ward on the fourth floor of Block C, and a team will be checking the premises to install the machine, which will test 80 samples at a time.Currently, the district health department is dependent on Chandigarh’s PGIMER and the Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College in Karnal, where samples are sent for tests.On this, Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said the health department was working to set up the project and aimed to open the lab at the civil hospital in the next week. “Installation is underway. Some parts are awaited. It is being calibrated and staff is being trained for it,” said Dr Kaur. She said this will streamline the process of collecting samples and cut down the waiting period of reports, as other labs were deluged with the increasing number of samples coming in every day. Officials said when the lab opens next week, they will first hold a trial. 750 RAPID KITS, BUT STAY ON THEIR USETo collect more samples in Panchkula, the district’s health department has also got around 750 rapid test kits. Officials said till now, only those with travel history, their contacts and suspected patients, who visited the hospital, were being tested. But with several confirmed cases which were asymptomatic, more people will need to be tested.Meanwhile, these rapid test kits cannot be used for the time being in absence of permission from higher authorities. Dr Kaur said, “We have got more than 750 testing kits, but currently their utilisation has been stayed, as we are following the directions of the Indian Council of Medical Research.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/soon-panchkula-s-new-lab-to-accelerate-testing-for-covid/story-Yrg8xdcrka4zlRSjOGBRiP.html

24-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: We receive calls daily requesting for help, says president of Vande Mataram Sanghatana||Vaibhav Wagh is the state president of the Vande Mataram Sanghatana, which is a city-based youth organisation currently working to provide help to all those in need during the times of the Covid-19 pandemic. The organisation is involved in the distribution of food packets across the city during the lockdown to the urban poor.What exactly is your role in this crisis?We are a youth group called Vande Mataram Sanghatana and since the lockdown began, we have been distributing food packets in coordination with other youth organisations. We have base kitchens in different parts of the city from where our volunteers collect the cooked food and then distribute it to students, beggars, workers and whoever need it. It is distributed in the morning and evening and necessary police permissions are taken for it. How does your day begin and roll out?My day starts with phone calls, which we get from various parts of the city requesting for help. We have also started giving raw food material in a kit to the labour camps, poor people and those who are stuck in the city because of the lockdown. Throughout the day, I receive hundreds of calls, then, I coordinate with our volunteers and go out on the field for distribution work. At night, we plan what areas we could target the next day. What precautions are you taking?All our volunteers are taking precautions prescribed by the government like using face masks, regularly washing hands, using hand sanitizer and maintaining social distance during the distribution work. What is your assessment of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune? How is it unfolding?The restrictions will help the city contain the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 disease. We are seeing a lot of good work during the times of crisis, with people coming forward with donations and help. If all the precautionary measures given by the government are strictly followed by residents, then, I think we will definitely win this battle soon. What gaps do you see in healthcare and relief work?There are no gaps as such, but I think there is a need to improve the relief work. In some of the areas, help is given twice and there is no verification. We have seen that people who have already received help (food/other items), still demand for more help to stock up on the items. However, due to this, those who have been left out, do not receive any help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-receive-calls-daily-asking-for-help-distribute-food-with-necessary-police-permissions/story-2IjIawog14ehmXQ7ScVwcJ.html

It is a wait-and-watch game, says PDCA||With all sports in the country hit hard by the coronavirus lockdown, cricket lovers and players, all following stay-at-home norms, are missing action at the local level. Their only question: when will cricket action resume in the city? Many would have been busy at summer camps and playing tournaments across the city if the pandemic restrictions were not in place.Pune District Cricket Association (PDCA) was all set for Sadhu Shinde T20 league for women and entries had started coming before the office faced lockdown from March 15. The popular women cricket tournament in the city that saw 16 teams last year stands suspended.“Before the lockdown, 10 teams had already registered for the tournament and we were expecting more teams this time,” said Bhushan Deshpande, chairman, PDCA.“We are waiting for directions from the government bodies as the league has to be rescheduled,” added Deshpande.After Sadhu Shinde T20 league, PDCA conducts the summer league which is a T20 tournament for open category (men).“Even if we assume that cricket action resumes in June, many factors have to be considered because of the monsoon season,” said Arvind Shivale, president, PDCA.“We cannot comment on anything now. When the restrictions will ease, we will have meeting and the sports calendar will be rescheduled. Most of the clubs in the city will have to bear the loss as two busy months have gone by without any activity,” Shivale said.Online fitness trainingFor Vengsarkar Cricket Academy, players are doing fitness drills at home.

24-04-2020||Pune||Pune’s Covid-19 battle focused on pockets within five wards||The 21-day national lockdown which began on March 25 and was further extended till May 3 by the Union government, has clearly helped in identifying and narrowing down of the localities that have been worst-hit by the Sars-Cov-2 virus in Pune.An analysis of 729 positive cases in Pune over the last 15 days has shown that the Covid-19 cases have been rising in specific pockets located within five wards in the central parts of the city.The remaining 10 wards, notably the western localities of Aundh, Baner, Kothrud, Bavdhan, Warje-Karvenagar and Sinhgad road, have not shown any significant rise in the number of cases. While the data was provided by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) which is among the few civic bodies releasing ward-level on a daily basis, the analysis was done by city-based analyst Sahil Deo who has been interacting closely with elected representatives and officials. Deo said in an interview that greater success could be achieved if public awareness is created about the specific pockets within the wards from where the positive cases were emerging.“If public awareness is created about these pockets by the Pune Municipal Corporation, the people in the affected areas would become alert and feel empowered to participate in the battle against the disease,” he said. Simultaneously, it would also bring relief in the unaffected areas in these wards and the rest of the city, he said. While Pune has seen 57 deaths of Covid-19 patients as of April 22, Bhavani peth continued to be the worst-affected ward with 171 positive cases as of April 22. It was followed by Kasba-Vishrambagwada with 111 positive cases and Dhole Patil road with 110.   As was the case last week, the “medium band” was occupied by Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori with 82 positive cases and Shivajinagar-Ghole road with 77. Underprivileged and low income areas with higher population density were the common features of the high positive areas. “Data clearly indicates that the cases are not rising in 10 wards of the city. There is a clear differentiation between these 10 wards and the five wards where the cases are rising. Those five wards will have hotspots within them. It wold help if the civic administration creates public awareness about these hotspots,” he said.More granular data would mean identification of the hotspots within the wards, Deo said. “If the civic authorities decide to become more vocal about these micro-narratives, it would help people rationalise the situation and people would be more willing to help and cooperate,” he said.He pointed out that it would be unfair to say that the entire Shivajinagar-Ghole road area was facing a problem. “Most areas in that ward are not affected. It’s only three or four areas within that ward,” he noted. As we go forward, more granular data could help in dealing with the challenge, he said. The Pune strategy to bring Covid-19 under controlAbhay Khairnar According to Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, “The first step we took was to declare areas with high positive cases as “containment zones”. The police then brought in heavy restrictions to prevent the unnecessary movement of people. We launched mobile clinics and check-up vans in these areas and we have been getting good response.” The health department has intensified house-to-house surveys in the containment zones and contact-tracing has been going on in these areas.All of this has been helping us identify many positive cases. Testing has also been increased to step up detection of positive cases in the early stages itself, added Gaikwad.Top 5 wards with positive cases* Bhavani peth: 171* Kasba-Vishrambaugwada: 111* Dhole Patil road: 110* Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori: 82* Shivajinagar-Ghole road: 77Wards with least cases * Kothrud-Bavdhan: 01* Aundh-Baner: 02* Warje-Karvenagar: 09* Sinhgad road: 09* Kondhwa-Yewlewadi: 12||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-s-covid-19-battle-focused-on-pockets-within-five-wards/story-EXjYRxBlrQ03XhLV844V5L.html
24-04-2020||Mumbai||MCOCA can be invoked against gambling gangs: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court on Tuesday upheld invocation of stringent provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), 1999, against a gang run by a local from Kolhapur.On April 8, 2019, a team of police personnel from Kolhapur’s Karvir police station raided the gambling den of Salim Mulla. When the police party was seizing the material and cash found at the den, Mulla’s wife Shama reached the den with some gang members and all of them assaulted the policemen.Police initially booked the accused persons under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, Maharashtra Gambling Act, Maharashtra Police Act and Maharashtra Prohibition Act. Two days later police invoked stringent provisions of MCOCA against the gang, involving more than 40 members.Fourteen of them had moved high court challenging invocation of MCOCA against them. They argued that they were not present at the den when it was raided, and they did not have any association with Mulla or his alleged organised crime syndicate. They further argued that on the basis of the material collected by police, they can, at the most, be said to have committed the offences under the gambling act, and since maximum punishment for these offences is two years imprisonment, MCOCA could not have been invoked against them.A division bench of chief justice BP Dharmadhikari and justice NR Borkar, however, rejected the argument after noticing that the petitioners provided risk cover to the main accused Mulla and thus helped him run the gambling den.“If the case of the prosecution is accepted, the organised crime syndicate of the accused [Mulla] would not have succeeded in gambling activity or business in absence of the helping hand of the petitioners,” said the bench rejecting their argument.Gambling by itself may not be organised crime, but an organised crime syndicate may take recourse to it as one of its profit-making ventures. The bench added, “If the existence of an organised crime syndicate comes to the knowledge of the state for the first time while conducting the raid on a gambling establishment and the investigation shows previous two or more charge-sheets for cognisable offences punishable with imprisonment of three or more years, the police may take recourse to the MCOCA .”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mcoca-can-be-invoked-against-gambling-gangs-bombay-hc/story-hHACnQJTDL4IDdn4Sz0lAO.html

24-04-2020||Chandigarh||Valley varsity develops low-cost frugal ventilator to tackle Covid-19||Amid a presumed shortage of ventilators, the innovators at Design Innovation Centre (DIC) of Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST), Awantipora, have developed a prototype for a low-cost frugal ventilator.The prototype named ‘Ruhdaar’ is expected to be handed over to the medical experts in the SKIMS for evaluation purpose once the innovators are satisfied with its functioning in the laboratory.DIC coordinator Shahkar Ahmad Nehvi said, “We have been working on the project for the last three weeks and now we have successfully demonstrated the prototype of the ventilator in the laboratory. We will be soon handing it over to the medical experts for the evaluation purposes.”The prototype has three settings which include title volume, breath per minute, inspiration and expiration, Nehvi said.He said pressure monitoring is an important part and should be tracked continuously. “We have to keep a check on the pressure so that it does not exceed beyond the selected degrees and now we are also able to get its readings done,” said Nehvi who is also the faculty at the electronics and engineering department of the university.“The idea originally came from three former students to tackle the shortage of ventilators,” he said.Peerzada Shoaib, a faculty at the electronics and communication department of the university, who was also part of the project, said it was developed from the locally available components in the laboratory. “We have used stepper motor, actuator, Atmel microcontroller, bag-valve mask (BVM), switches and potentiometers, pressure sensor, and an LCD screen to display information to the user,” he said.“The ventilator will be priced at ₹15,000 only while those installed in the valley hospitals cost more than ₹70, 000,” he said.Kashmir with a population of around 8 million has merely 95 ventilators in different valley hospitals, with many of them lying defunct.Earlier this month, the DIC had developed a multi-channel splitter for ventilators at the Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) Soura so that multiple patients with different lung capacities can avail the lifesaving support, especially during the Covid-19 crisis.The university’s vice-chancellor Prof Mushtaq A Siddiqi said, “It is a proud moment that the team has achieved such task in a short span of time. Now, it depends on the medical experts to take a call.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/valley-varsity-develops-low-cost-frugal-ventilator-to-tackle-covid-19/story-kbhZadUoaCh04Mbezq6JRJ.html

Wheat, rice allocation under NFSA doubled Meanwhile, after the Centre doubled allocation of wheat/rice under National Food Security Act (NFSA) on imposition of the countrywide lockdown in March, the Punjab government has stated distributing grain to 1.41 crore beneficiaries.Each beneficiary under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) was given 5 kg wheat/rice at subsidised rates of Rs 2 to Rs 3 per kg a month. For three months in advance, they will also get the same amount of grain free of cost. “Over and above the Centre’s allocation, the state government has allocated Rs 69 crore for free ration to 10 lakh people who don’t fall in the ambit of foodgrain under NFSA,” said KAP Sinha, principal secretary, food and civil supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-hiring-under-mnrega-for-3-months-numbers-stagnant-at-5-05-lakh/story-HIltD51HeZoJz0mbaL0lGO.html
24-04-2020||Pune||It’s pray at home for Pune’s Muslims during Ramzan in lockdown||Ramzan, or Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting from dawn to dusk, will begin on April 25.The observance is also a time of great interaction for the community, especially the breaking of the fast at sunset called the iftar, which happens after the evening prayer.However, the Covid-19 lockdown has left Muslims in the city facing a Ramzan like few have experienced before.For the Mulla family, the special namaaz held during the Ramzan is very important.“Every year there is a congregation of people praying at the mosque, there is a special namaaz (taravik), for the whole month, where people pray together; but, because of the lockdown, people will have to pray in their houses with the family,” said Irshad Mulla, who has two sons.The other aspect worrying her is the breaking of the fast. “Earlier, we used to have all kinds of fruits, snacks, milk and dates which are important to break the fast, but this year the availability of these items may not be easy. There will be limitations, within that, we have to control; which is also the purpose of Ramzan, to control oneself. Dates are very important for Ramzan and to get them is not easy this year during the lockdown,” says Mulla, who lives in Kondhwa. Mohsin Sheikh is a graphic artist living in Somwar peth. “During Ramzan, we try to restrict going out, as we are fasting. The only difference is that we won’t be able to pray five times at the mosque. We will be praying in the house, and follow prophetic tradition where the Prophet said “As Salaatu Fi Buyootikum” (pray in your homes).”He also added that he is very happy that this year, he along with his family will learn the actual wisdom behind the fasting, which teaches you self-control.In Nasir Dafdar’s home, his wife is trying to stock up on the groceries and necessary ingredients needed for Ramzan. “We went to the shops, but didn’t find a lot of items needed for the fast. Hence, we are going to make do with whatever is available, after all, sehri (last meal before dawn) and iftar are also important to follow. We will keep it simple this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/it-s-pray-at-home-for-pune-s-muslims-during-ramzan-in-lockdown/story-Y5Ve6CX4u6pdHsGIQNNCTL.html

Due to his condition, he finds it difficult even to pick up the milk packet from the main gate of his building.Since the lockdown was announced, people with disabilities have been facing an array of problems, as their helpers and caregivers stopped attending to them. While some are finding it difficult to manage the day-to-day chores, others are struggling to get the basic groceries from the store.Annica, who lives independently in east Delhi, says he has been facing problems even to get essential items from the market, a task, which, his help would have done. Due to scoliosis, Annica finds it difficult to carry heavy things and walk with them.Varun Khullar, a resident of Dwarka, who is disabled from the waist down due to a spinal cord injury, was suffering from bed sores and could not be taken care of for at least a day, till help from a clinic in the vicinity for a few days. He says that currently, the physiotherapist from the clinic has also stopped visiting while his mother is taking care of him.“I have been told by my doctor to take physiotherapy sessions every day, failing which my legs would become numb. However, due to the lockdown, he could not come. Even though we got a pass for him, he could not visit due to lack of public transport. Finally, I managed to get help from a local clinic,” Khullar, a DJ and music producer, said.Nipun Malhotra, a disability activist who stays in Gurugram, who suffers from arthrogryposis, said he is facing similar problems as his caretaker has stopped work due to the lockdown. Malhotra says that he had applied for a curfew pass twice, but his request was rejected both times.It was only after he wrote to the higher authorities that a curfew pass was allowed. The Delhi government had revised its initial list, on April 6, to include caretakers for issuing curfew passes. Malhotra says that he wrote to several authorities including the ministry of social justice and empowerment stating that how both his attendants, who live in Delhi, are not being able to travel to Gurgaon to his residence due to the curfew.“I had applied for passes at two instances but both the time it was rejected. I live in Gurugram and my caretaker lives in Delhi. It was only after I wrote a letter to the commissioner of Delhi Police and the Delhi government, did I get passes. Initially, the disabled category was not even included in the category for issuing passes,” he said.A senior government official said that at the onset of the lockdown, they were receiving 50-60 calls from persons with disabilities per day. However, after the caretakers were added to the list of allowed workers, the calls have become negligible. “Most of the calls that we got was for the caretakers and attendants. However, then on the directions of the authorities, the passes for caretakers was also added to the list, “ the official said, adding that they have been regularly addressing the concerns with the help of the Delhi Police and NGOs.After the initial hardships an initiative — #ProjectDelhi — was started in south Delhi by Malhotra and other volunteers, who are now helping the disabled procure essential items.“Through the initiative, the volunteers sign up online and deliver it to any disabled person in need of groceries at the MRP. We have had similar projects in other cities also, but in Delhi, we have started only in the south. We intend to start it in other parts of the city too,” Malhotra said.Annica says that this period is not just physically straining but also mentally exhausting for people with disabilities, as they try to juggle work and health. Malhotra says that the government should have thought about the persons with disabilities before imposing the lockdown.Khullar has now signed a petition on Change.org, a private initiative, demanding that the government make provisions for the disabled, if the lockdown is extended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/people-with-disabilities-suffer-hardships/story-4tvpCPZmsLMrf4nJGHVwSN.html

24-04-2020||World||Trump’s disinfectant idea shocking and dangerous, doctors say||Doctors and health experts urged people not to drink or inject disinfectant on Friday after US President Donald Trump suggested scientists should investigate inserting the cleaning agent into the body as a way to cure Covid-19.“This is one of the most dangerous and idiotic suggestions made so far in how one might actually treat Covid-19,” said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia. He said injecting disinfectants would likely kill anyone who tried it.“It is hugely irresponsible because, sadly, there are people around the world who might believe this sort of nonsense and try it out for themselves,” he told Reuters.Trump said at his daily media briefing on Thursday that scientists should explore whether inserting light or disinfectant into the bodies of people infected with the new coronavirus might help them clear the disease. “Is there a way we can do something like that by injection, inside, or almost a cleaning?” he said. “It would be interesting to check that.” The White House said on Friday that Trump had been taken out of context and had urged people to seek coronavirus treatment only after conferring with their doctors.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement: “President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing.”The emailed statement did not directly mention cleaners or ultraviolet (UV) light as coronavirus treatments, but its subject was “White House on disinfectant.” While UV light is known to kill viruses contained in droplets in the air, doctors say there is no way it could be introduced into the human body to target cells infected with Covid-19.“Neither sitting in the sun, nor heating will kill a virus replicating in an individual patient’s internal organs,” said Penny Ward, a professor in pharmaceutical medicine at Kings College London and chair of the Education and Standards Committee of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine.“Drinking bleach kills. Injecting bleach kills faster. Don’t do either!” she added.Reckitt Benckiser, which manufactures household disinfectants Dettol and Lysol, issued a statement also warning people not to ingest or inject its products. Parastou Donyai, director of pharmacy practice and a professor of social and cognitive pharmacy at the University of Reading, said Trump’s comments were shocking and unscientific. Donyai said people worried about the new coronavirus and the Covid-19 disease it causes should seek help from a qualified doctor or pharmacist, and “not take unfounded and off-the-cuff comments as actual advice”.Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former US labour secretary, added on Twitter: “Trump’s briefings are actively endangering the public’s health. Please don’t drink disinfectant”.Reading’s Donyai said previous comments by Trump had already been linked to people self-administering medicines or other products in ways that make them poisonous.“We have already seen people mistakenly poisoning themselves by taking chloroquine when their hopes were raised by unscientific comments,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-disinfectant-idea-shocking-and-dangerous-doctors-say/story-Nzlvzchd3XWOU5IBOhdJaJ.html
24-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: Don’t inject disinfectants, Lysol warns as Donald Trump raises idea||The parent company of Lysol disinfectant warned Friday that its products should not be used internally to treat COVID-19 after President Donald Trump wondered about the prospect during a White House briefing.Trump noted Thursday that researchers were looking at the effects of disinfectants on the virus and wondered aloud if they could be injected into people, saying the virus “does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.”That prompted a strong warning from the maker of disinfectants Lysol and Dettol, which said it was issuing a statement to combat “recent speculation.”“As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),” said the statement from Reckitt Benckiser.The White House accused the media of misrepresenting Trump’s comment.“President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement Friday. “Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines.”Researchers are testing the effect of disinfectants on virus-laden saliva and respiratory fluids in the laboratory, said William Bryan, who leads the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security. They kill the virus very quickly, he said.“And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning,” Trump said. “Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you’re going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds -- it sounds interesting to me.”Bryan said injections weren’t part of that disinfectant research.The president has often talked up prospects for new therapies and offered rosy timelines for the development of a vaccine as he encourages states to move to reopen their economies.On Thursday, the White House also pitched “emerging” research on the benefits of sunlight and humidity in diminishing the threat of the coronavirus.Past studies have not found good evidence that the warmer temperatures and higher humidity of spring and summer will help tamp down the spread of the virus.But Bryan said at a White House briefing Thursday that there are “emerging results” from new research that suggest solar light has a powerful effect in killing the virus on surfaces and in the air. He said scientists have seen a similar effect from higher temperatures and humidity. A biocontainment lab in Maryland has been conducting testing on the virus since February, Bryan said.“The virus is dying at a much more rapid pace just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity,” Bryan said.Trump was asked if it was dangerous to make people think they would be safe by going outside in the heat, considering that so many people have died in Florida.“I hope people enjoy the sun. And if it has an impact, that’s great,” Trump replied, adding, “It’s just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very, very smart, perhaps brilliant man.”“I’m here to present ideas, because we want ideas to get rid of this thing. And if heat is good, and if sunlight is good, that’s a great thing as far as I’m concerned,” the president said.Bryan stressed that the emerging results of the light and heat studies do not replace social distancing recommendations.Earlier in the month, scientific advisers told the White House there’s no good evidence yet that the heat and humidity of summer will rein in the virus without continued public health measures.Researchers convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine analyzed studies done so far to test virus survival under different laboratory conditions as well as tracking where and how COVID-19 has spread so far.“Given that countries currently in ‘summer’ climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,” the researchers wrote earlier in April in response to questions from the White House Office of Science and Technology.In addition, the report cited the global lack of immunity to the new virus and concluded, “if there is an effect of temperature and humidity on transmission, it may not be as apparent as with other respiratory viruses for which there is at least some preexisting partial immunity.”They noted that during 10 previous flu pandemics, regardless of what season they started, all had a peak second wave about six months after the virus first emerged.In March, Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief. said, “We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it’s a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-don-t-inject-disinfectants-lysol-warns-as-donald-trump-raises-idea/story-nKUsHOpZitqv671vcc7FEI.html
24-04-2020||World||Canada shooter’s rampage began with assault on girlfriend: Police||The worst mass shooting in Canada’s history started with the suspect assaulting his girlfriend, and this may have been the “catalyst” for the 22 grisly slayings that followed, police said Friday.Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Superintendant Darren Campbell, at a news conference describing the 13-hour manhunt for the shooter, said his motives are still under investigation.But the suspect’s beating of his girlfriend, who managed to escape and hide in nearby woods and later informed police that her attacker wore a patrolman’s uniform and drove a mock squad car, “could very well have been the catalyst to start the chain of events.”“It was a significant assault,” Campbell noted, suggesting also that her escape may have enraged the shooter, identified as 51-year-old denturist Gabriel Wortman.Police previously described the girlfriend simply as “a key witness” who helped them identify the armed suspect after she emerged from hiding Sunday morning, about nine hours into the shooting and arson spree.Thirteen victims had been identified by then in the quiet and sparsely populated Nova Scotia seaside community of Portapique where police set up a four-square kilometre (1.5 square mile) perimeter to try to contain the suspect.Overnight, the shooter may have fled the area by driving through a field or, disguised as an RCMP officer, slipped past barricades, Campbell said.“I can’t imagine any more horrific set of circumstances when you’re trying to search for someone that looks like you,” Campbell said.This “obviously complicated things” and gave the suspect an “advantage” over police, the public and “every person that he encountered through the course of his rampage.”Authorities noted also that they learned of three “plated” Ford Taurus cars owned by the suspect -- the same make and model as RCMP squad cars -- but were not initially aware of a fourth made to look like a squad car and driven in the attacks.Their investigation has so far uncovered where Wortman purchased the lightbar for the vehicle and may have sourced decals. His guns, police said, were purchased in Canada and the United States.He also took the sidearm and magazines off a veteran policewoman after killing her in a confrontation shortly before he was gunned down by a tactical officer who caught up with him at a gas station near Halifax.“While he was at the gas pumps, one of our tactical resources came to the gas station to refuel their vehicle,” he said.“When the officer exited the vehicle, there was an encounter and the gunman was shot and killed by police at 11:26 in the morning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-shooter-s-rampage-began-with-assault-on-girlfriend-police/story-zMwVabExtSu6unqufUj3sK.html
24-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: Donald Trump now touts shots of disinfectant, sunlight; slammed||President Donald Trump on Thursday shockingly sought more more research into injecting disinfectants into the body to kill the deadly coronavirus, or the use of UV rays, as the United States inched closer to the 50,000 mark with more than 3,300 fatalities in the last 24 hours.By Friday morning, the US toll had gone up to be 49,963 with 3,332 new fatalities and the number of confirmed cases was 869,172, with 28,819 more.Trump’s suggestions came at the daily briefing of the US coronavirus task force after a presentation of new research that shows the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity, direct sunlight kills it the quickest and some readily available disinfectants finish it off in 5 minutes or much less.“So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous -- whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light -- and I think you said that that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it,” the president asked the presenter, a senior official of the Department of Homeland Security’s science and technology directorate.“Then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning,” he continued, and added, “So it would be interesting to check that.”Disinfectants can be poisonous. And physicians and medical experts were aghast at the president’s suggestions. Deborah birx, coordinator of the president’s task force, wanted no part of the president’s suggestions when he turned to her for affirmation.“Deborah, have you ever heard of that?” the president asked Birx while responding to questions from reporters. “The heat and the light, relative to– certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus?”“Not as a treatment,” Birx said. “I mean, certainly fever is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But not as, I’ve not seen heat …”Trump cut her off: “I think it’s a great thing to look at.”President Trump has previously touted the use of the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus without any proof, arguing there is nothing to lose by trying it.And now this, something that the medical community denounced as dangerous. “My concern is that people will die. People will think this is a good idea,” Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, told The Washington Post. “This is not willy-nilly, off-the-cuff, maybe-this-will-work advice. This is dangerous”.Stanford University’s Eugene Chu wrote on twitter: “Clorox, Tide Pods, and Lysol (disinfectants) will kill the coronavirus. No question about it. But if you are infected, then the coronavirus is inside your cells. If you use any of those disinfectants to kill the coronavirus within your own cells, then you’ll die right along with the coronavirus.”Even the disinfectant makers were troubled by the president suggestions. “As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),” a spokesperson for Reckitt Benckiser, the United Kingdom-based owner of Lysol, told NBC News.As the president continued to be excoriated for the suggestions, the White House said in a statement Friday morning, “President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing.

24-04-2020||World||Covid-19 in UK: India-origin doctors launch legal challenge on PPE||Two Indian-origin doctors exposed to coronavirus patients have launched a legal challenge to the Boris Johnson government on the allegedly inadequate provision and guidance on personal protection equipment in hospitals; including advise to use plastic aprons if gowns run out .Over 80 medical professionals have passed away in the UK after being infected by the virus in recent days.The challenge has been launched by Meenal Viz, a clinical fellow in medicine, and Joshi, a trainee general practitioner employed by the National Health Service (NHS). Bindmans, the legal firm representing them, said they are married and Viz is pregnant.They are challenging the official guidance on the bases that it is not in line with the international standards set by the World Health Organisation or domestic legislation regarding health and safety at work.Besides, it is claimed that the guidance exposes healthcare workers to a greater risk of contracting Covid-19 and fails to address the greater risks faced by non-white healthcare workers; and it is allegedly unclear and has resulted in inconsistent practices.Joshi and Viz said in a statement: “We are incredibly concerned at the ever-growing numbers of healthcare workers who are becoming seriously unwell and dying due to Covid-19. It is the government’s duty to protect its healthcare workers, and there is great anxiety amongst staff with regards to safety protocols that seem to change without rhyme or reason”.“All we ask for is accountability from decision-makers, and that all evidence leading to these decisions should be published and transparent. We are doctors, we are nurses and we are healthcare workers - we will be there for you in your time of need. We will be there for your family. The government needs to protect us, so that we can protect you”, they added.Basmah Sahib of the law firm said a formal letter before action has been sent to Public Health England and the Department of Health and Social Care, seeking a response by Monday. The challenge is against guidance of April 17 that permitted medical staff to wear plastic aprons with coveralls when full-length gowns run out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-in-uk-india-origin-doctors-launch-legal-challenge-on-ppe/story-gFhKsH2dS0qqHOw7Vws94M.html
24-04-2020||World||To kill coronavirus, Trump suggests injecting disinfectants, bringing UV light ‘inside the body’||President Donald Trump has suggested the possibility of studying injecting disinfectants into COVID-19 patients or bringing UV light “inside” their bodies to kill the deadly virus, drawing immediate flak from health experts while a leading disinfectant producer urged people not to listen to such dangerous speculation.Launching a new scientific study conducted by his department, Homeland Security for Science and Technology Under Secretary Bill Bryan on Thursday said the coronavirus dies at a much more rapid pace when exposed to sunlight and humidity. “The virus dies the quickest in direct sunlight. Isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds,” he told White House reporters in the presence of President Trump at his daily briefing on the COVID-19 situation in the country.Bryan’s remarks left Trump wondering if there was a possibility of injecting the chemical into a person infected with COVID-19 as a deterrent to the virus.“I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute...And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets inside the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that,” the US president told reporters at the press briefing. Trump also raised the possibility of using light to combat the deadly viral infection. “So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous (force), whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light - and I think you said that hasn’t been checked but you’re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you’re going to test that, too. Sounds interesting,” Trump said to Bryan. Trump’s incredulous remarks prompted sharp criticism from health experts who warned people against injecting or ingesting disinfectants, which are highly toxic.“My concern is that people will die. People will think this is a good idea...This is not willy-nilly, off-the-cuff, maybe-this-will-work advice. This is dangerous,” Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, told The Washington Post. Reckitt Benckiser, which owns Lysol and Dettol, said that as a global leader in health and hygiene products, “we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).” “As with all products, our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines. Please read the label and safety information,” the company said in a statement on Friday.Lysol, which is one of the America’s best known cleaning brands, has been named in tweets at least 125,000 times since the White House news conference.US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn, who is also a member of the White House coronavirus task force, warned against ingesting any disinfectants to kill the coronavirus.“I certainly wouldn’t recommend the internal ingestion of a disinfectant,” Hahn was quoted as saying by the CNN. Dara Kass, associate professor of emergency medicine at Columbia University Medical Centre, also asked people to refrain from doing such things.“Please don’t drink bleach or isopropyl alcohol to remove #COVID19 from your saliva,” she tweeted. “It’s horrific,” Kass told the Post.People who consume such chemicals often die. Those who survive usually end up with feeding tubes, a result of their mouth and esophagus being eroded by the cleaning agents, she said.Even as experts from the medical community came forward to challenge Trump’s latest remarks, Deborah Birx, one of the top American public health experts, did not respond to the comments about the light therapy or disinfectant injections.Her lips pressed in a tight line, Brix, who serves as the response coordinator for the White House’s coronavirus task force, was silently listening to Trump’s comments from the sidelines, the Post reported.The US has reported over 869,170 COVID-19 cases and nearly 50,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-suggests-injecting-disinfectants-bringing-uv-light-inside-the-body-to-kill-covid-19/story-Yv0unDcfp3jNvYkninmsjP.html

24-04-2020||World||With Covid-19 fears looming this Ramadan, Asia’s Muslims keep faith and distance||Governments of Asian nations with large Muslim populations urged people to keep their distance while observing their faith as Islam’s fasting month of Ramadan began on Friday, shrouded in fear over the coronavirus.Early outbreaks in Asia, home to the bulk of the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims, were traced in many cases to pilgrims returning from Iran and Saudi Arabia, as in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or gatherings of Islamic groups, as in India and Malaysia.During Ramadan, set to begin on Friday or Saturday, depending on the sighting of the new moon, Muslims join their families to break the fast at sunset, go to mosques to pray and look to spend time with relatives.But the risk of full-blown epidemics has changed priorities, with curbs imposed on large gatherings for prayers and public iftars, or meals to break the fast. “Just like when we fast, we must struggle and fight against our desires,” Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said in a televised address to his country, one of the hardest hit by the virus in Southeast Asia.“It doesn’t matter that we cannot pray together at the mosque. Perhaps this is a God-given opportunity for us to pray with our families at home instead.”On Thursday, his government extended curbs on movement until May 12, cancelled popular evening bazaars and banned attendance at mosque prayers as well as travel back to people’s hometowns. In neighbouring Indonesia, which has the world’s biggest Muslim population, President Joko Widodo repeated a call for people to work and pray at home during a national address. Indonesia has identified 7,775 infections, and 647 deaths, for Asia’s highest toll outside China, where the disease emerged.On the island of Java, Tatan Agustustani, 52, and his family were busy clearing furniture from their lounge room to make way for prayer mats.“It’s the same in the mosque or at home,” said Agustustani, who lives in Bogor, on the outskirts of Jakarta, the capital. “For me, no matter where we are, prayers must go on, even though we cannot pray in the mosque.”But that message appeared lost in Aceh, the sharia-ruled province at the far western tip of the archipelago nation, as worshippers crowded into a mosque for tarawih prayers on the eve of Ramadan.Some said their fate was not in their hands, although many wore masks as they lined up shoulder-to-shoulder to pray.“In our belief, it is God who decides when we will die,” said one devotee, Taufik Kelana. “But we will stay alert, like wearing a mask.”In Brunei, the tiny oil rich sultanate that shares the island of Borneo with Malaysia and Indonesia, mosques have been temporarily closed and people urged to pray at home. Brunei has reported 138 infections.NO IFTARIn South Asia, Ramadan is expected to start on Saturday. Leaders of India’s 160 million-strong Muslims have urged people to heed the nationwide lockdown throughout the month. The lockdown in India, which has recorded 23,076 infections, including 718 deaths, is set to end on May 3.“If the lockdown does not end on May 3 or soon after, it will be a Ramadan unlike any in my 55 years,” said Salim Mohammed, a property agent in the western city of Ahmedabad.Muslims, who form 12 percent of India’s population of 1.3 billion, faced renewed pressure from Hindu hardline groups tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling alliance and vigilante groups after a large number of infections were linked to a religious gathering of a Sunni missionary group.The Tablighi Jamaat event in mid-March drew participants from across India, neighbouring Bangladesh and even Indonesia and Malaysia.The reputed All India Islamic Centre of religious teaching will livestream recitation of two chapters of the Koran, the Muslim holy book, from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. each day.“This is the best way to pray to Allah and keep everyone safe,” said its chairman, Khalid Rashid Firangi Mahali.“There should be no Roza Iftaar parties at all. Instead that money should be used for food and rations for the poor.”Bangladesh has ordered mosques to restrict Ramadan evening prayers to 12 people and banned iftar gatherings, while Sri Lanka has closed mosques to the public.Doctors in Pakistan are worried by the government’s decision to lift curbs on mosque congregations for Ramadan.Pakistan has 11,155 virus infections with 237 deaths, but doctors, and the government, say the outbreak has yet to peak.Heeding doctors’ advice, the government of the southern province of Sindh ordered tarawih prayers performed at home, limiting Friday mosque gatherings to three to five people.“All I can say is it is another test by Allah,” said Nur Alam, 65, a refugee in Bangladesh, whose son was shot dead during the Myanmar military crackdown of 2017, in which hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled into the neighbouring country.“I’ll fast and will keep praying to Allah. The virus would go away. May Allah keep everyone safe out there and everywhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-covid-19-fears-looming-this-ramadan-asia-s-muslims-keep-faith-and-distance/story-wdLUJ8v56uvI1Yv3LOBLII.html
24-04-2020||World||Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trial on humans begins with caution||The first two volunteers in the human trial for a vaccine against Covid-19 were innoculated at the University of Oxford on Thursday evening, with experts expressing cautious optimism and much of the world anticipating its success.Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the university, is hopeful of developing the vaccine by September, with initial results expected by mid-May. The Oxford project is one of nearly 80 such initiatives across the globe to develop a vaccine for Covid-19.One of the two innoculated on Thursday was named as Elisa Granato, a microbiologist.As the trial was rolled out on Friday on more volunteers, the university sounded a note of caution: “A high proportion of vaccines are found not to be promising even before clinical trials. Moreover, a significant proportion of vaccines that are tested in clinical trials don’t work”.“If we are unable to show that the vaccine is protective against the virus, we would review progress, examine alternative approaches, such as using different numbers of doses, and would potentially stop the programme”, it said.The two volunteers are among over 1,100 between the ages of 18 and 55 recruited for the trial in Oxford, Bristol, Southampton and London. Half of them receive the vaccine and the other half (the control group) receive a widely available meningitis vaccine.The vaccine produced in the university is based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, intended to test against Covid-19 in healthy volunteers. It aims to assess whether healthy people can be protected from COVID-19 with the vaccine called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is made from a virus (ChAdOx1), which is a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees, that has been genetically changed so that it is impossible for it to grow in humans.The volunteers are given an E-diary to record symptoms for a week after receiving the vaccine and attend a series of follow-up visits, when a blood sample will be taken and the E-diary reviewed. The blood samples will be used to assess the immune response to the vaccine.“If participants develop COVID-19 symptoms during the study, they can contact a member of the clinical team, and we will assess them to check whether they have become infected with the virus. If a participant was very unwell, we would call our colleagues in the hospital and ask them to review the volunteer if appropriate”, the university added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-trial-on-humans-begins-with-caution/story-01gSRHNcB6BQMuE6MtRugI.html
24-04-2020||World||France to test nicotine substitutes as treatment for Covid-19||Researchers in France will test whether nicotine could be used to treat Covid-19.“It’s an interesting possibility,” Health Minister Olivier Veran on France Inter radio. “We’ll know more soon.”Doctors at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris observed that few Covid-19 patients hospitalized were smokers. They also speculated that the new virus may involve receptors in the body that respond to nicotine. To investigate whether nicotine might have some protective mechanism, they will conduct clinical tests using patches, including one on health-care workers.The French scientists’ approach runs counter to mainstream thinking on nicotine: The World Health Organization has said smoking probably increases the risk of complications from Covid-19.The idea isn’t to get more people addicted to nicotine or smoking, which kills about 70,000 people each year in France.“There are substitutes to nicotine that can be developed in laboratories that would enable to avoid its addictive effects,” Veran said.Separately, Veran pointed to a French study of 170 patients with Covid-19 that suggests people develop enough antibodies to have immunity to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-test-nicotine-substitutes-as-treatment-for-covid-19/story-UtKOKCOfhvOOFhECPVvcuN.html
24-04-2020||World||US House approves $500 billion coronavirus bill in relief package||The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a $484 billion coronavirus relief bill on Thursday, funding small businesses and hospitals and pushing the total spending response to the crisis to an unprecedented near $3 trillion.The measure passed the Democratic-led House by a vote of 388-5, with one member voting present. House members were meeting for the first time in weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Lawmakers, many wearing masks, approved the bill during an extended period of voting intended to allow them to remain at a distance from one another in line with public health recommendations.The House action sent the latest of four relief bills to the White House. Republican President Donald Trump, who backs the measure, said he would probably sign it into law on Thursday evening.The Republican-led Senate had passed the legislation on a voice vote on Tuesday. But threats of opposition by some members of both parties prompted congressional leaders to call the full chamber back to Washington for the House vote despite state stay-at-home orders meant to control the spread of the virus.The House also approved a select committee, with subpoena power, to probe the U.S. response to the coronavirus. It will have broad powers to investigate how federal dollars are being spent, U.S. preparedness and Trump administration deliberations.Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the panel was essential to ensure funds go to those who need them and to prevent scams. Republicans said the committee was not needed, citing existing oversight bodies, and called the panel’s creation another expensive Democratic slap at Trump. The committee was approved on a vote of 212-182, along party lines.The $484 billion aid bill was the fourth passed to address the coronavirus crisis. It provides funds to small businesses and hospitals struggling with the economic toll of a pandemic that has killed almost 50,000 people in the United States and thrown 26 million out of work, wiping out all the jobs created during the longest employment boom in U.S. history.A handful of lawmakers opposed the legislation, including Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents a severely affected area of New York and believes Congress should do even more - and Republican Thomas Massie, known as “Mr. No” for his frequent opposition to spending bills.“This is really a very, very, very sad day. We come to the floor with nearly 50,000 dead, a huge number of people, and the uncertainty of it all,” Pelosi said during debate on the bill.Congress passed the last coronavirus relief measure, worth more than $2 trillion, in March, also with overwhelming support from both parties. It was the largest such funding bill ever passed.TROUBLE AHEADThe next step will be harder. The two parties have set the stage for a fight over additional funding for state and local governments reeling from the impact of lost revenue after Republicans refused to include such funds in the current relief bill.Trump has said he supports more funding for states, and has promised to back it in future legislation.Congressional Republicans have resisted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested in a radio interview on Wednesday that states could go bankrupt, but said later he did not want states to use federal funds for anything unrelated to the coronavirus.Democrats castigated McConnell for the remark. “Leader McConnell said to our cities and states, to our cops and firemen and teachers, he told them to drop dead,” said Representative Max Rose, who represents a district of New York City.Thursday’s voting took place under safety protocols that considerably dragged out proceedings. Lawmakers came to the House in alphabetical order in small groups and were told to stand in line, 6 feet (1.8 m) apart, before entering the chamber.There was also a half-hour break scheduled to clean the chamber between the two votes. But more than a dozen cleaners descended on the chamber with cloths and spray bottles and wiped it down in less than 10 minutes.Echoing Trump, many Republicans also want the country - including Congress - to reopen quickly. Republican Representative Ralph Norman of South Carolina said lawmakers should “get our businesses to open the doors and do what Americans have always been allowed to do, which is go to work.”House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said the latest aid package should have been passed at least two weeks ago after the Trump administration requested it. “Some people unfortunately got laid off because of this delay,” McCarthy said.Democrats rejected the charge, saying lawmakers had improved on Trump’s request by adding billions of dollars more for small businesses, hospitals and coronavirus testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-passes-500-billion-coronavirus-bill-in-latest-relief-package/story-mADfRVploZTSt6drtT9TpO.html

24-04-2020||World||Covid-19: New York City to provide 500,000 free halal meals during Ramzan||New York City will provide 500,000 free halal meals for Ramzan, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio.Announcing the programme, de Blasio said on Thursday: “One of Ramzan’s most noble calling is to feed the hungry, it is a crucial part of how the holiday is celebrated, to remember to be there for those in need.”Since mosques that provide meals for the poor to break their Ramzan fast are not able to function because of the COVID-19 restrictions, the city will ensure they will get halal meals, he said.The halal meals will be a part of a wider free meals programme run by the city to help all those impoverished by the massive loss of jobs due to the COVID-19 crisis.De Blasio said that although the halal meals will be available through the 435 distribution sites, 32 of them in areas with large Muslim communities will be the focus of the programme.He said that 400,000 halal meals will be distributed directly by the city at its distribution centres known as “grab-and-go” sites because the people receiving the meal packages have to leave immediately and cannot eat there.Another 100,000 meals will be distributed through community organisations, he said.Those who cannot leave their homes can request home delivery.The city has already been distributing kosher meals that conform to Jewish dietary regulations.De Blasio said that he estimates that about 2 million people in the city’s population of 8.6 million are “food insecure” and could go hungry.“That’s a horrifying number,” he said.The city expects to distribute 10 million free meals in April and 15 million in May, the Mayor said.Besides running the “grab-and-go” centres, the city is also delivering meals to the homebound by employing thousands of taxi and online hail service drivers who have become unemployed because of the coronavirus shutdown.The federal government is giving $1,200 to all adults and $500 to children, but illegal immigrants, who are a sizable number in the city, are not eligible for them.Many of them work in the unorganised sector and do not qualify for unemployment insurance, either.The poorer citizens and legal immigrants who do not have to pay income taxes will have their payments delayed because they have to go through a process to apply for them.Many New Yorkers will find it difficult to make ends meet even with federal aid and unemployment insurance because of the city’s high cost of living.The state has banned evictions of tenants for 90 days to ensure that those unable to pay rent will not be out a home.De Blasio estimated that 500,000 New Yorkers have lost their jobs.“Think about folks who just weeks ago couldn’t have imagined not having enough food to eat and now they’re struggling to find it,” he said.US censuses are prohibited from asking questions about religion, but an organisation, Muslims for American Progress, estimated that there were 768,767 Muslims in the city making up nearly 9 per cent of the city’s population of 8.6 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-york-city-to-provide-500-000-free-halal-meals-during-ramzan/story-Mh4b4GPbG5ZFqvZLr9GxfI.html

But the Taliban’s spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted late Thursday to lambaste the government’s offer, citing ongoing disagreements over a potential peace process and a delayed prisoner exchange as reasons to keep fighting.“Asking for ceasefire is not rational and convincing,” wrote Shaheen as he accused the government of putting prisoners’ lives at risk during the outbreak.Under a landmark US-Taliban deal signed earlier this year, the Afghan government and the insurgents were by now supposed to have concluded a prisoner swap and started talks aimed at bringing about a comprehensive ceasefire.The latest round of bickering comes after dozens of Afghan security forces personnel were killed in a fresh wave of violence launched by the insurgents this week.The attacks have mostly been limited to rural areas and small towns. Under the US-Taliban deal, the insurgents have agreed not to attack cities.American and other foreign forces have pledged to quit Afghanistan by July 2021 provided the Taliban stick to several security guarantees and hold talks with the government.Ghani has been calling for a lasting ceasefire with the Taliban for years, only to be ignored by the increasingly emboldened insurgents.The Taliban instead have mocked Ghani’s government, referring to them as “puppets” controlled by foreign powers, and have roundly refused to engage in peace talks as they intensify attacks on Afghan forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-reject-afghanistan-govt-ceasefire-offer-during-ramzan-as-country-battles-covid-19/story-Ogrt0GsxoPUnV9iPuJxsML.html
24-04-2020||World||Gulf’s migrant workers lying sick, hungry as cases rise||When all nine men in his dormitory caught coronavirus, 27-year-old Nurudhin was bused to a remote quarantine camp -- becoming one of many migrant workers Gulf states are struggling to accomodate adequately.The oil-rich Gulf is reliant on the cheap labour of millions of foreigners -- mostly from India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka -- many of whom live in squalid camps far from the region’s showy skyscrapers and malls.But the spread of coronavirus, alongside shrinking oil-driven economies, has left many workers sick and countless others unemployed, unpaid and at the mercy of unscrupulous employers.“There is nothing in my room except a small bed. I have to share a bathroom with 20 to 30 people,” said Nurudhin, a draftsman from India who was hospitalised before being taken to a remote isolation facility for blue-collar workers in the United Arab Emirates.“There is no WiFi. Not even a television. But the situation in my room was even worse,” he said of his crowded quarters in Abu Dhabi, which proved a fertile ground for the disease.Despite strict curfews in force for weeks, the Gulf states with the biggest populations of foreign workers -- Saudi, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar -- are still reporting rising numbers of coronavirus cases.Riyadh says foreigners account for 70 to 80 percent of recently discovered cases.To try to reduce transmission, Gulf authorities have moved workers from camps into temporary lodgings, while establishing mass screening centres and using drones in some neighbourhoods to warn people against congregating.‘Worried about our brothers’The UAE has been the most vocal among Gulf countries in demanding governments repatriate workers, many of whom have been laid off or gone unpaid as business halts and oil prices plummet.As of April 20, some 22,900 foreigners had been repatriated on 127 flights from otherwise closed airports, officials said.But India, which has 3.2 million citizens in the UAE alone, has refused to cooperate, saying that repatriating and quarantining millions of returning citizens would be a logistical and safety nightmare.Bangladesh has reluctantly agreed to take back thousands of its citizens to avoid punishment from Gulf states in the future, its Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen said.“If we don’t bring them home... they won’t recruit people from us once their situation improves,” he told AFP, adding that thousands of undocumented workers and hundreds of prisoners are being flown back, including a planeload from Saudi Arabia last week.Pakistan has allowed repatriations to proceed but warned it is hindered by the lack of testing and quarantine facilities at its airports. Its diplomats in Dubai appealed to Pakistanis not to go to the consulate, after a large number -- desperate to return home -- gathered to demand seats on limited special flights.“We are worried about our brothers in the Gulf. The lockdown and closure of daily business in the Gulf have rendered many overseas Pakistanis without a livelihood,” Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said last week.A UAE spokesman said it owed migrant workers a “debt of gratitude” and that it was providing healthcare, food and accommodation, and relaxing immigration rules for those with expiring visas. Hungry and isolatedThe pandemic has highlighted the problem of migrant workers living and working in conditions that leave them vulnerable to disease, said Rothna Begum, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.Attempts by Gulf states to curb the virus were inflicting more hardship, with lockdowns that left workers short of food and water, she told AFP, adding that charities stepping in were overwhelmed.“Workers who are still required to work are being put on buses where they cannot socially distance, and sent to sites where social distancing is not being practised or protective equipment and sanitation is not adequately provided,” she said.Millions of migrant workers face future uncertainty as the now unwanted workforce is haggled over by their governments and host countries.“I want to go back to my country... I don’t have any money and I don’t want to spend more time here,” said an Egyptian man in Kuwait City who is being held at a camp for immigration offences.Javed Paresh, a construction worker in the emirate of Sharjah, is among the tens of thousands of Pakistanis who have registered to fly home.“I have not been paid for the last six months. I just want to go home and see my family. My family will die of hunger as I am unable to send them money for many months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gulf-s-migrant-workers-lying-sick-hungry-as-cases-rise/story-6s4pVfQV9sahmAnm9Wf64M.html

The masks, which preceded promised cash payments some households urgently need, have been the subject of derision online even before their distribution, from their small size to the two-a-household limit.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAnd now reports of dirty or otherwise defective masks from people who have received them have forced the Health Ministry to order improvements in quality inspection. Itochu Corp. and Kowa Co., the companies that manufactured most of the cloth masks, have said they will recall those that haven’t been delivered.The masks have become known as “Abenomask,” a riff on the prime minister’s flagpole “Abenomics” policy that also means “Abe’s Mask,” and the well-meaning but shambolic roll-out has become symbolic of Abe’s stop-start management of the coronavirus crisis.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Friday that there are no plans to halt the distribution, which he said was “a necessary step” amid the national mask shortage.There may be a delay in the distribution due to the recall, Suga said, and that the government plans to continue the delivery to help give the people “peace of mind.”The initial plan to distribute the masks had already met with disapproval, with 68% of those surveyed in a Mainichi poll conducted April 18 and 19 saying they didn’t back the plan.Abe’s support rate has been dropping amid dissatisfaction both in his tackling of the virus and his moves to limit the economic fallout. He has expanded the state of emergency order from initial seven prefectures to the entire country, while ordering cash handouts of 100,000 yen to all residents, backtracking on a previous plan for larger handouts for those most in need.The government is slated to make a decision on whether to extend the emergency status during the upcoming Golden Week holiday season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abenomask-abenomics-unmasks-abe-s-inability-to-contain-pandemic-in-japan/story-mSwXmMSdVAMx80drxVgsdP.html

It’s not like Indians are physically immune to Covid-19, they are mentally immune,” Zhang Wenhong told Chinese students in India during an online video interaction arranged by the Chinese embassy on Wednesday.“The Indians have their peaceful mind,” said Zhang, a leading figure in China’s Covid-19 strategy. He is the director of Huashan Hospital’s Department of Infectious Disease in Shanghai.Zhang also said that though the number of infections is increasing in India, it is far below the level in the United States.Also Watch l PM Modi explains the biggest lesson COVID-19 has taught India “We are seeing an increase in terms of number of confirmed cases in India. Right now, the number of confirmed cases in India is increasing, but India has a larger population than the United States so the infection rate is actually lower than India,” said Zhang.Zhang also said that infection in India will not increase more than 10 per cent. “So, 90 per cent of people around you are clean from the virus,” he assured Chinese students.More than 23,000 people have been infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus, and 718 have died in India, according to the Union health ministry data on Friday morning.With 17,610 active cases, 4,749 people cured or migrated and 718 deaths, India’s Covid-19 tally reached 23,077, according to the health ministry’s dashboard at 8 am.The figures have come on the 31st day of a national lockdown to halt the spread of the disease, which has infected 2,708,470 people and killed 1,90,788 across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indians-mentally-immune-to-covid-19-chinese-expert-tells-students/story-s75blUpROgHByypteZMLXM.html
24-04-2020||World||Experimental virus drug remdesivir failed in human trial||The experimental coronavirus treatment remdesivir has failed in its first randomized clinical trial, inadvertently released results showed Thursday, dampening expectations for the closely watched drug. A draft summary went online briefly on the website of the World Health Organization (WHO) and was first reported by the Financial Times and Stat, which posted a screenshot.But Gilead Sciences, the company behind the medicine, disputed how the now-deleted post had characterized the findings, saying the data showed a “potential benefit.” The summary said the Chinese trial involved 237 patients, with 158 on the drug and 79 in a control group. Remdesivir was stopped early in 18 patients because of side effects.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe authors said remdesivir was “not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement” compared to the control.After a month, 13.9 percent of the patients on remdesivir had died compared to 12.8 percent of those in the control group. The difference is not statistically significant.The WHO told the Financial Times that the draft is undergoing peer review and was published early in error.Trials continueA spokesman for Gilead told AFP: “We believe the post included inappropriate characterizations of the study,” saying it was terminated early due to low enrollment and was therefore not statistically meaningful.“As such, the study results are inconclusive, though trends in the data suggest a potential benefit for remdesivir, particularly among patients treated early in disease,” the spokesman added.The study does not represent the final word on the matter, and there are several large-scale trials in advanced stages that should soon provide a clearer picture.Remdesivir, which is administered intravenously, was among the first drugs suggested as a treatment for the novel coronavirus and as such has great hopes riding on it. Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the research, said “the trial was too small in numbers recruited” to detect either benefit or risk.But he added: “If the drug only works well when given very early after infection, it may be much less useful in practice.”Last week, Stat reported it had shown significant efficacy at a Chicago hospital where patients who are part of one of the major trials are being treated.The US National Institutes for Health also reported it had proven effective in a small experiment on monkeys. Remdesivir, which previously failed in trials against Ebola, belongs to a class of drugs that act on the virus directly -- as opposed to controlling the abnormal and often lethal autoimmune response it causes.It mimics one of the four building blocks of RNA and DNA and gets absorbed into the virus’s genome, which in turn stops the pathogen from replicating.The antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are also being widely used on COVID-19 on a so-called “compassionate basis” pending results from large trials, with early studies decidedly mixed.Other therapies that are being studied include collecting antibodies from COVID-19 survivors and injecting them in patients, or harvesting antibodies from genetically-engineered mice that were deliberately infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experimental-virus-drug-remdesivir-failed-in-human-trial/story-20DaQtwARfgH9yQG3w0InL.html
24-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: France testing if nicotine can protect people from contracting Covid-19||Nicotine could protect people from contracting the coronavirus, according to new research in France, where further trials are planned to test whether the substance could be used to prevent or treat the deadly illness. The findings come after researchers at a top Paris hospital examined 343 coronavirus patients along with 139 people infected with the illness with milder symptoms. They found that a low number of them smoked, compared to smoking rates of around 35 percent in France’s general population.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “Among these patients, only five percent were smokers,” said Zahir Amoura, the study’s co-author and a professor of internal medicine. The research echoed similar findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine last month that suggested that 12.6 percent of 1,000 people infected in China were smokers. That was a much lower figure than the number of regular smokers in China’s general population, about 26%, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The theory is that nicotine could adhere to cell receptors, therefore blocking the virus from entering cells and spreading in the body, according to renown neurobiologist Jean-Pierre Changeux from France’s Pasteur Institut who also co-authored the study.The researchers are awaiting approval from health authorities in France to carry out further clinical trials. They plan to use nicotine patches on health workers at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris -- where the initial research was conducted -- to see if it protects them against contracting the virus. They have also applied to use the patches on hospitalised patients to see whether it helps reduce symptoms and also on more serious intensive care patients, Amoura said. The researchers are looking into whether nicotine could help to prevent “cytokine storms”, a rapid overreaction of the immune system that scientists think could play a key role in fatal Covid-19 cases. But with further research needed, experts are not encouraging people to pick up smoking or use nicotine patches as a protective measure against the virus. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “We must not forget the harmful effects of nicotine,” said Jerome Salomon, France’s top health official. “Those who do not smoke should absolutely not use nicotine substitutes”, which cause side effects and addiction, he warned.Tobacco is the number one killer in France, with an estimated 75,000 deaths per year linked to smoking. France is one of the hardest hit countries by the coronavirus in Europe, with more than 21,000 deaths and over 155,000 reported infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-france-testing-if-nicotine-can-protect-people-from-contracting-covid-19/story-umqQ0ryLHN4i89XvSFdTpN.html

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested COVID-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others. The overall death toll in the country remained at 4,632, with no death reported on Thursday. As of Thursday, the total confirmed COVID-19 cases in China reached 82,804, the NHC said.Hubei province and its capital Wuhan -- the epicentre of the coronavirus -- reported no new COVID-19 case or death in the last few days. China lifted the lockdown in Wuhan on April 8, allowing people to travel both inside and outside the city.Meanwhile, Chinese Internet and e-commerce giants Alibaba Group, JD dot com and Tencent have launched booking services for COVID-19. The services have been launched as China accelerates COVID-19 nucleic acid testing to promote epidemic prevention and control and speed up the resumption of production, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Ali Health, Alibaba’s health care subsidiary, has offered testing appointments in 10 cities, including Shanghai and Beijing, starting from April 21. It will extend the service to 28 more cities this week, it said.JD Health, JD.com’s health care subsidiary, and WeChat, Tencent’s social media platform, also launched similar booking platforms for COVID-19 tests in Beijing, Guangzhou and other cities.Guangzhou, capital of southern China’s Guangdong province, has started novel coronavirus tests on 208,000 teachers, staff and students in their final year of junior and senior high schools ahead of their reopening.As of Thursday noon, the city has completed nucleic acid tests on 193,000 teachers and students in graduating classes in high schools. As many as 38,000 people have received the results, all of which were negative.Grade three students in Guangzhou will return to school on April 27.

24-04-2020||World||Oxford University pushing science to the limit in Covid-19 vaccine hunt||Oxford University is launching a human trial of a potential coronavirus vaccine, with the daunting aim of making a successful jab available to the public later this year.Of the more than 100 research projects around the world to find a vaccine -- described by the United Nations as the only route back to “normality” -- seven are currently in clinical trials, according to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Such trials are already underway in China and the United States and are due to begin at the end of this month in Germany, where the federal vaccine authority gave the green light on Wednesday.The British government strongly supports Oxford University’s work, and the first human trials were to start on Thursday, Health Minister Matt Hancock said.He hailed the “promising development”, pointing out that it would normally take “years” to reach such a stage of vaccine development.In its first phase, half of 1,112 volunteers will receive the potential vaccine against COVID-19, the other half a control vaccine to test its safety and efficacy.The volunteers are aged between 18 and 55, are in good health, have not tested positive for COVID-19 and are not pregnant or breastfeeding.Ten participants will receive two doses of the experimental vaccine, four weeks apart.Professor Sarah Gilbert’s team hopes for an 80 per cent success rate, and plans to produce one million doses by September, with the aim of making it widely available by the autumn if successful.But the teams carrying out this research say on their website that this timetable is “highly ambitious” and could change.The government’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty acknowledged on Wednesday that the likelihood of getting a vaccine within the year was “incredibly small”.“If people are hoping it’s suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly into everything is gone, that is a wholly unrealistic expectation,” he warned.The strategy of not waiting for each step to be completed before launching production is a financial “gamble”, according to Nicola Stonehouse, professor of molecular virology at the University of Leeds.But the current crisis makes it a necessary gamble, she told AFP.The Oxford vaccine is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus, which is modified to produce proteins in human cells that are also produced by Covid-19.It is hoped the vaccine will teach the body’s immune system to then recognise the protein and help stop the coronavirus from entering human cells.The adenovirus vaccine is known to develop a strong immune response with a single dose and is not a replicating virus, so cannot cause infection, making it safer for children, the elderly and patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes.The government, under fire in the media over its handling of the crisis, set up a task force last weekend to coordinate research efforts and to develop capability to mass-produce a vaccine as soon as it is available, wherever it comes from.It is also supporting research at Imperial College London, which hopes to start clinical trials in June.Their research focuses on a vaccine exploiting a different principle, using RNA, the messenger molecules that build proteins in the cells, to stimulate the immune system.Finding a vaccine is the only possible way to bring the world back to “normality”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week, calling for an acceleration of projects.The UN on Monday adopted a resolution calling for “equitable, effective and rapid” access to a possible vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-university-pushing-science-to-the-limit-in-covid-19-vaccine-hunt/story-KQ6L5rp1Sd47NTp5GdFbDL.html

Johnson is facing criticism from opposition politicians and some epidemiologists for reacting too slowly to the virus outbreak.Britain is at or near the peak of a health crisis with the number of deaths related to coronavirus hitting 18,738 — the fifth highest national death toll from the pandemic linked to at least 184,900 deaths worldwide.Ministers have been struggling to explain high death rates, limited testing and shortages of protective kits.Johnson has told aides to schedule meetings with cabinet ministers next week to get up to speed, the Telegraph reported on Thursday. Ministers are working to roll out a mass testing and tracking programme to try to reduce the rate of transmission and possibly ease stringent measures that have all but shut the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-recovering-from-covid-19-plans-return-to-work-as-early-as-monday-report/story-QPUa4rHeomFXbG0eAjnjLN.html
24-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: ‘US very close to testing Covid-19 vaccine’, says president Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump has favoured safe and phased reopening of the American economy, which has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 50,000 people and infected over eight lakh in a matter of few months. More than 95 per cent of the country’s 330 million people are under stay-at-home order as a result of the social mitigation measures including social distancing being enforced till May 1. Trump on Thursday indicated that this might be extended beyond May 1, but forcefully advocated the need to gradually open up the economy that is safe. In the past few weeks, more than 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits and the figure is soon likely to cross 40 million, as per some estimates. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have projected a negative growth in the US in 2020.Also read: Sunlight, heat and humidity weakens coronavirus, says US official “To keep America gaining momentum, every citizen needs to maintain the vigilance, and we all understand that very well we’ve gone over it many, many times this includes practising good hygiene, maintaining social distance, and the voluntary use of face covering,” he said. “Safe and phased reopening of our economy it’s very exciting, but it does not mean that we are letting down our guard at all in any way; on the contrary, continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy to get our country back to work to take our country back,” Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on coronavirus. The data and facts on the ground suggest that the US is making great progress, he said. In 23 states, new cases have declined. In the peak week 40 per cent of American counties have also seen a rapid decline in new cases. As many as 46 states report a drop in patients showing coronavirus-like symptoms, he said. Trump said that the US is very close to a finding a vaccine for Covid-19. “We are very close to testing... when testing starts it takes a period of time but we will get it done,” he said. According to Vice President Mike Pence, data continues to show promising signs of progress in the New York Metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans all appear to be passed their peak and “we are seeing consistent declines” in hospitalisation and cases in regions across the country. Pence heads the White House Task Force on Coronavirus. “Our task force actually believes that if we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead including phased reopening... by early summer, we can be in a much better place as a nation with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us,” he said. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Pence said that 16 states have released formal reopening plans. “States are beginning to make those plans and we were encouraged to see so many states embracing the phased approach to reopening their economies that’s contemplated in our guidelines for opening America again,” he said. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced that restaurants and retail outlets would be allowed to reopen. “We want to have the majority of businesses open before May 1,” Lee said. “We are working around the clock to get Tennesseans safely back to work in 89 of our counties with the majority of businesses in a position to begin opening their doors next week,” he said at separate news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-us-very-close-to-testing-covid-19-vaccine-says-president-donald-trump/story-AdnnAifF8Y9asbEFmwXyIP.html
24-04-2020||World||Sunlight, heat and humidity weaken coronavirus: US official||The coronavirus appears to weaken more quickly when exposed to sunlight, heat and humidity, a U.S. official said on Thursday in a potential sign that the pandemic could become less contagious in summer months.U.S. government researchers have determined that the virus survives best indoors and in dry conditions, and loses potency when temperatures and humidity rise - and especially when it is exposed to sunlight, said William Bryan, acting head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate.“The virus dies quickest in the presence of direct sunlight,” he told a White House news briefing.The findings could bolster hopes that the coronavirus will mimic the behavior of other respiratory diseases like influenza, which typically are less contagious in warm weather.But the coronavirus has also proven lethal in warm-weather places like Singapore, raising broader questions about the impact of environmental factors.President Donald Trump said the findings should be interpreted cautiously, but also claimed vindication for previously suggesting that the coronavirus might recede in summer.“I once mentioned that maybe it does go away with heat and light. And people didn’t like that statement that much,” he said at the briefing.Also Read: Oxford University pushing science to the limit in Covid-19 vaccine huntSixteen U.S. states are laying plans to restart their economies and ease regulations designed to slow the spread of the pandemic. Georgia and South Carolina are allowing some businesses to reopen this week - a move that health authorities say could lead to more deaths because they do not have enough tests to assess how many people are infected.Trump’s administration says states should wait until they have proof that infection rates have dropped steadily for two weeks.Vice President Mike Pence said states should allow hospitals and other medical facilities to resume elective surgeries, an important source of revenue that some governors have banned in order to keep hospitals clear for coronavirus patients.Trump said Americans might need to maintain social distancing into early summer, even though some states were showing signs of progress.Trump has encouraged protests against social-distancing restrictions in some states. But he criticized Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican, for moving too quickly.“I want the people in Georgia to be safe, and I don’t want this thing to flare up because you’re deciding to do something that is not in the guidelines,” he said.More than 874,000 people in the United States are known to have been infected and over 49,600 have died of COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, according to a Reuters tally.Also Read: ‘US very close to testing Covid-19 vaccine’, says president Donald Trump18 hours versus two minutesOn nonporous surfaces like stainless steel, the new coronavirus takes 18 hours to lose half its strength in a dark, low-humidity environment, Bryan said.In a high-humidity environment, that half-life dropped to six hours, and when the virus was exposed to high humidity and sunlight, the half-life dropped to two minutes, he said.Researchers found a similar effect with the coronavirus that was suspended in the air - simulating the coughing or sneezing that often spreads the disease. In a dark room, the virus maintained half its strength for an hour. But when exposed to sunlight, it lost half its strength in 90 seconds, Bryan said.Researchers also found that isopropyl alcohol was a more effective disinfectant than bleach, he said.Trump said researchers should try to apply their findings to coronavirus patients by inserting light or disinfectant into their bodies.“Is there a way we can do something like that by injection, inside, or almost a cleaning?” he said. “It would be interesting to check that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sunlight-heat-and-humidity-weakens-coronavirus-us-official/story-0xiDf5xDx2SajETzNC8cOP.html
24-04-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak pushes US unemployment toward highest since Great Depression||Unemployment in the US is swelling to levels last seen during the Great Depression of the 1930s, with 1 in 6 American workers thrown out of a job by the coronavirus, according to new data released Thursday. In response to the deepening economic crisis, the House passed a nearly $500 billion spending package to help buckled businesses and hospitals.More than 4.4 million laid-off Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, the government reported. In all, roughly 26 million people — the population of the 10 biggest U.S. cities combined — have now filed for jobless aid in five weeks, an epic collapse that has raised the stakes in the debate over how and when to ease the shutdowns of factories and other businesses.In the hardest-hit corner of the U.S., evidence emerged that perhaps 2.7 million New York state residents have been infected by the virus — 10 times the number confirmed by lab tests.A small, preliminary statewide survey of around 3,000 people found that nearly 14% had antibodies showing they had been infected, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Just in New York City, with a population of 8.6 million, Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot said as many as 1 million may have been infected.In Washington, many House lawmakers wore face masks and bandannas — and some sat in the otherwise vacant visitors gallery to stay away from others — as they debated the latest spending package. A near-unanimous vote sent it to President Donald Trump in the evening.Anchoring the bill is the administration’s $250 billion request to replenish a fund to help small- and medium-size businesses with payroll, rent and other expenses. Trump said the bill “will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll.”Abroad, there was mixed news about the epidemic. Some countries, including Greece, Bangladesh and Malaysia, announced extensions of their lockdowns. Vietnam, New Zealand and Croatia were among those moving to end or ease such measures.In Africa, COVID-19 cases surged 43% in the past week to 26,000, according to John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The figures underscored a recent warning from the World Health Organization that the virus could kill more than 300,000 people in Africa and push 30 million into desperate poverty.Brazil’s health ministry confirmed 407 deaths due to the outbreak in the last 24 hours, a daily high for the country.Huge lines have formed at food banks from El Paso, Texas, to the Paris suburbs, and food shortages are hitting Africa especially hard.At a virtual summit, European Union leaders agreed to set up a massive recovery fund to help rebuild the 27-nation bloc’s ravaged economies. While no figure was put on the plan, officials said 1-1.5 trillion euros ($1.1-1.6 trillion) would be needed.The coronavirus has killed nearly 190,000 people worldwide, including more than 100,000 in Europe and about 47,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from official government figures. The true numbers are almost certainly far higher.In the U.S., the economic consequences of the shutdowns have sparked angry rallies in state capitals by protesters demanding that businesses reopen, and Trump has expressed impatience over the restrictions.Some governors have begun easing up despite warnings from health authorities that it may be too soon to do so without sparking a second wave of infections. In Georgia, gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys can reopen Friday. Texas has reopened its state parks.Few Americans count on Trump as a reliable source of information on the outbreak, according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About 23% said they have high levels of trust in what he tells the public, while 21% said they trust him a moderate amount.On the economic front, few experts foresee a downturn as severe as the Depression, when unemployment remained above 14% from 1931 to 1940, peaking at 25%. But unemployment is considered likely to remain elevated well into next year and probably beyond, and will surely top the 10% peak of the 2008-09 recession.Janet Simon, laid off as a waitress at an IHOP restaurant in Miami, said she has just $200 in her name and is getting panic attacks because of uncertainty over how she will care for her three children. Simon, 33, filed for unemployment a month ago, and her application is still listed as “pending.”“I’m doing everything to keep my family safe, my children safe, but everything else around me is falling apart,” Simon said. “But they see it, no matter how much I try to hide my despair.”Corey Williams, 31, was laid off from his warehouse job in Michigan a month ago and saw his rent, insurance and other bills pile up while he anxiously awaited his unemployment benefits. That finally happened on Wednesday, and he quickly paid $1,700 in bills.“It was getting pretty tight, pretty tight,” he said. “It was definitely stressful for the last few days.”While the health crisis has eased in places like Italy, Spain and France, experts say it is far from over, and the threat of new outbreaks looms large.“The question is not whether there will be a second wave,” said Dr. Hans Kluge, the head of the WHO’s Europe office. “The question is whether we will take into account the biggest lessons so far.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized some German states for moving too briskly in trying to reopen their economies. Germany has been praised for its approach to the pandemic and has a much lower reported death toll than other large European countries.“We’re not living in the final phase of the pandemic, but still at the beginning,” Merkel warned. “It would be a shame if premature hope ultimately punishes us all.”Governments are bearing that risk in mind with the onset of Ramadan, the holy month of daytime fasting, overnight festivities and communal prayer that begins for the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims with this week’s new moon. Many Muslim leaders have closed mosques or banned collective evening prayer to ward off infections.The virus has already disrupted Christianity’s Holy Week, Passover, the Muslim hajj pilgrimage and other major religious events.Authorities in the capital of Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority nation, extended restrictions to cover all of Ramadan. Turkey banned communal eating during the holiday.Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan bowed to the country’s clerics, refusing to close mosques despite doctors’ warnings that such gatherings could further spread the virus in a country with a fragile health care system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-pushes-us-unemployment-toward-highest-since-great-depression/story-crzCVqhnrc8upgGoD1i28O.html

24-04-2020||World||Trump rejects ‘incorrect’ reports on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s health||US President Donald Trump on Thursday rejected reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was ailing, criticizing his frequent nemesis CNN for running the story.“I think the report was incorrect, let me just put it that way,” Trump told reporters. “I’m hearing they used old documents.”Trump declined to say if he had direct knowledge from North Korea that Kim was fine. He instead attacked cable news network CNN, with which the US leader has an acrimonious relationship.“I think it was a fake report done by CNN,” Trump said at a daily briefing on the coronavirus pandemic, before refusing to take further questions from a journalist of the network.CNN, quoting what it said was an anonymous US official, on Monday reported that Washington was “monitoring intelligence” that Kim was in “grave danger” after undergoing surgery.Daily NK, an online media outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, separately said that Kim underwent a cardiovascular procedure earlier this month and was recovering at a villa in North Pyongan province.It said that Kim, who is in his mid-30s, had needed urgent treatment due to heavy smoking, obesity and fatigue.‘A good relationship’ Trump’s denial of the report came two days after he declined to comment on the matter, saying only that he wished Kim well.South Korea, which is still technically at war with the North, earlier said it had seen no unusual movements in its neighbor.Trump has met Kim three times in historic summitry and has voiced admiration for him, although hopes have dimmed for reaching a comprehensive agreement.“I hope he’s not in medical trouble. I hope he’s not. I have gotten along very well with him,” Trump said Thursday.“Remember you would have been in a war with North Korea if I didn’t get elected president.”Trump declined to state when he was last in touch with Kim, saying: “We have a good relationship with North Korea, as good as you can have.”Shortly before reports emerged on Kim’s health, Trump said he had received a “nice note” from the leader, but North Korea denied sending any message.North Korea has fired off a series of rockets as it demands concessions from the Trump administration, which says that international sanctions should remain until the regime fully denuclearizes.Kim was conspicuously absent on April 15 from celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather Kim Il Sung, the regime’s founder -- the most important day on the North Korean political calendar.The flamboyant basketball star Dennis Rodman -- who until Pompeo and Trump had been the highest-profile American to meet the reclusive Kim -- said that he was “praying for his speedy recovery.” “I hope it’s just a rumor that Marshal Kim Jong-Un is sick,” Rodman told celebrity gossip site TMZ. “Hopefully I will find out more soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rejects-incorrect-reports-on-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-s-health/story-CEgXVwiNl59MtWpPCHbQfJ.html
24-04-2020||India||Trump’s idea to inject disinfectant stuns world||Washington US President Donald Trump’s inquiry over injecting people with disinfectants to guard against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) left medical experts and scientists across the world stunned on Friday, with many issuing warnings to not introduce bleach in the body in an attempt to kill SARS-CoV-2, which causes the infectious disease.Bill Bryan, an undersecretary at the Homeland Security Department, told reporters during the White House’s daily task force briefing on Thursday that research showed bleach could kill the virus in saliva or respiratory fluids in five minutes and isopropyl alcohol could kill it even more quickly. The research also appeared to show that the virus was vulnerable to heat and humidity, with direct sunlight killing it quickly. Speaking after Bryan, Trump said: “So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous – whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light – and I think you said that that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it.”“Then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning,” he continued, and added: “So it would be interesting to check that.”The remarks came on a day the US Food and Drug Administration cautioned against the use of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, touted by Trump, in Covid-19 patients outside of hospitals and clinical trials, citing risks of serious heart rhythm problems.On Friday, death toll from the highly contagious Covid-19 crossed 50,000 in the US, which is now the epicentre of the pandemic. More than 3,300 fatalities were reported across the country over the last 24 hours.Physicians and medical experts were aghast at the US President’s suggestions. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the US President’s taskforce, appeared to distance herself from the suggestion even as the briefing was still on.“Deborah, have you ever heard of that?” the President asked Birx while responding to questions from reporters. “The heat and the light, relative to – certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus?”Birx responded: “Not as a treatment.” “I mean, certainly fever is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But not as, I’ve not seen heat…”Trump cut her off: “I think it’s a great thing to look at.”Soon after the White House briefing, Reckitt Benckiser, parent company of the maker of Lysol and Dettol, said: “As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).”The White House said that Trump’s comments were taken out of context. “President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasised again during yesterday’s briefing,” said White House spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany.The US President has previously touted the use of the anti-malarial Hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 with little proof of its effectiveness.After Trump’s latest remarks, Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, told The Washington Post: “My concern is that people will die. People will think this is a good idea.” “This is not willy-nilly, off-the-cuff, maybe-this-will-work advice. This is dangerous.”Stanford University’s Eugene Chu wrote on Twitter: “Clorox, Tide Pods, and Lysol (disinfectants) will kill the coronavirus. No question about it. But if you are infected, then the coronavirus is inside your cells. If you use any of those disinfectants to kill the coronavirus within your own cells, then you’ll die right along with the coronavirus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-s-idea-to-inject-disinfectant-stuns-world/story-icU2MbqOX9iXSLpcEcfpDK.html
24-04-2020||India||Maharashtra positive cases at 6817, deaths cross 300-mark, three-digit increase in Covid-19 cases for 21 days in a row||After 32 days of lockdown, the number of coronavirus positive cases in Maharashtra reached 6817 cases on Friday with 394 new cases. 5279 of these cases are in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) alone, which saw all the relaxations that came into effect on April 21withdrawn within a day. Friday’s increase was less compared to Thursday that saw 778 cases—the highest in a day since March 9 when the first Covid 19 cases were registered in the state.In Mumbai, the case count went up to 4,447 as 242 new cases were registered in a day.Monday was also the 21st consecutive day when the number of new cases in the state was in three digits. This is the reason why most of the cases -- 6519 -- are registered in April month alone.Maharashtra took 30 days to cross 1000 cases on April 7 but crossed the 2000- mark within six days on April 13. The rise from 2000 to 4000 cases was also completed in six days on April19. The addition of next 2000 cases, taking the tally past 6000, only took four days.Though, the numbers are high, senior officials said the state is yet to reach community transmission stage as there is no exponential growth in Covid 19 cases. “The two 14-day cycles of incubation period of infection were completed on April 20. It had begun from March 22 when international traffic was stopped. We will have to wait for another seven days to assess the rising trend. If the rise continues and if the fresh cases are rising by more than 50% (over the previous day) on daily basis then it can be called exponential growth and only then can we say that the stage of community transmission has arrived,” said Dr T P Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). He clarified that exponential growth is also of two types: one is 50% rise in daily cases and another is doubling of cases, meaning 100% rise in a day. “If exponential growth starts than the state government will also have to extend the lockdown period for another three weeks till May 24 to break the incubation cycle,” Dr Lahane said.The death toll also crossed 300 mark in the state with 18 new deaths registered. Of them, 11 were in Mumbai, five in Pune and two were in Malegaon of Nashik. The total number of casualties in Mumbai increased to 178.Of the 18 deaths, 12 patients had co-morbidity conditions said the health officials.The mortality rate of the state has significantly dropped to 4.40% (283 cases till Thursday) from 7.41% (148 cases) since last Monday (April 13). However, it continues to be higher than the national average of 3.11% till Thursday, as per the state medical education department data.As the cases are rising, the epidemic is also spreading to more areas of the state. Nanded reported its first case on April 22. With this, only three districts - Wardha, Bhandara, Gadchiroli - are left without a single case of Covid 19 as of now.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe state health department has conducted 1,02,189 tests at various public and private facilities till date, 94,485 of these have tested negative. State currently has 512 active containment zones. Around 7,702 survey teams comprising doctors and assisting staff have screened more than 28.88 lakh for the virus. Around 957 patients have been discharged from the hospitals after recovery.It has also kept 8814 suspected patients at government quarantine facilities while 1,19,161 are home quarantined, states the state health officials.The Maharashtra government is also ready to start clinical trials of plasma therapy in the coming days after finally receiving the nod from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). In the beginning, it will be started at Sassoon Hospital in Pune as permissions for other three hospitals in Mumbai, Nagpur and Solapur are still awaited. The state has also got permission for pool testing for Covid 19 that allows for using five samples in a single test. So far, only one sample is being tested at a time.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Once clinical trials are successful, the state can start plasma therapy as a treatment for Covid 19 patients. “We have received permission from the Centre for conducting clinical trials of plasma therapy in the state. Once cleared by the ethics committee of the state, it is going to be started in the next 3-4 days at Sassoon Hospital, Pune. It will also be started at JJ Hospital in Mumbai, Indira Gandhi Medical College in Nagpur and Solapur Medical College in Solapur once permissions are in place,” said Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER).The plasma therapy uses antibodies from the plasma of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those are affected. The concept behind the therapy is that the plasma of a recovered patient contains antibodies with the ability to fight the coronavirus.State health department officials said that with the new form of testing the state’s capacity would increase 10 times. The pool testing could help clusters or hotspots faster, officials added. The testing method involves putting multiple swab samples together and testing them in a single real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. If a batch tests positive, then everyone whose samples were a part of that batch would have to be tested separately. Conversely, if a batch tests negative, then all the samples are negative.Tope said that the state has also suggested use of portable pulse oximeter and chest X-ray test to help diagnose coronavirus patients and to subsequently decrease the mortality rate. A statement from the state health department said that it was suggested that the PPE kits should be disinfected and used again; this suggestion was appreciated in the meeting of union health minister and health ministers of all the states. The minister also said that the Centre is positive about allowing new testing facilities at six medical colleges in Maharashtra.So far, the state government has also done counselling of over 47,000 migrant workers wanting to go back to their native villages. This is being done with the help of psychiatrists and health staff, said the health minister. More than 6 lakh migrant workers are staying in over 944 shelter homes prepared by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-positive-cases-at-6817-deaths-cross-300-mark-three-digit-increase-in-covid-19-cases-for-21-days-in-a-row/story-jk62y8DxAvetWUS7rZaV0K.html

While all members of the family, including a 94-year-old man and his 88-year-old wife, woman had been discharged, this 62-year-old, not related to the family, remained hospitalised.She was first hospitalised on March 10 after she showed symptoms and soon after tested positive for the coronavirus. Later on, while she was free of the symptoms, she tested positive 19 times.In Kozhikkode (north Kerala) a person returned from Dubai on March 18 was turned positive at least 29 days after he was exposed to the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) had prescribed a 14-day quarantine period but the state had extended it to 28 days to make it ensure that an asymptomatic person is disinfected. At least eight such cases where the person tested positive beyond the WHO period were reported from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/62-year-old-kerala-tests-negative-for-covid-19-in-20th-test/story-yGThilsaHfdEZO6OovZqBL.html

IIT Delhi said it has already decided to not hike the fees for its post graduate courses.“There is a view in the HRD ministry that premier institutions can step forward and take decisions which will benefit the student community as a whole, that the IITs should try to not hike fees. There have been discussions on this and the ministry could request the IITs to not implement a fee hike this year,” said a government official who asked not to be named.The decision on the fee for undergraduate courses is taken jointly in the IIT council, which is headed by HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank while individual IITs take a call on the fee structure of other courses they offer.“The matter is at present in the discussion stage,” said a top official in the HRD ministry who asked not to be named.IIT Bombay Director Subhasis Chaudhuri said his institute will go by the decision of the IIT council. The director of another IIT, who asked not to be named, said he understood the logic behind the step but would like to see what the other IITs have to say. “The HRD ministry has already requested private schools not to pressure students into paying fees. It also wants them to not go for big, arbitrary hikes in view of the situation. In this light , the ministry will be seen as walking its talk, if its own institutions took the lead,” said the first official . The official added that apart from the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Information Technology too could be requested to spare the students a fee hike this year||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iits-may-not-increase-fee-this-year-as-hrd-weighs-options/story-3eU5xvDy6dYWM0ScVWSSjK.html
24-04-2020||India||UGC to meet next week to decide if varsities should hold exams online||New Delhi: The University Grants Commission (UGC) has convened a meeting next week to discuss whether universities have the capacity to hold online exams and commence the next academic session, officials aware of the matter said. The higher education regulator will also seek to deliberate on whether it better to start the next academic year and hold exams later at the meeting.Two key committees submitted their reports on the new academic calendar and on promoting online education ahead of the meeting on Friday amid the Covid-19 pandemic that has prompted a national lockdown to check its spread and led to a closure of educational institutes. Vice-chancellors of Central University of Haryana and Indira Gandhi National Open University, R C Kuhad and Nageshwar Rao, headed the panels. “The Kuhad committee has examined the option of holding online exams. But keeping the country’s diversity in mind, a one-size-fits-all approach cannot be adopted. Not every university has the capacity to hold online exams. There may be students who can be at a disadvantage also if there are online exams. An assessment of the capacity to conduct online exams has to be carried out. So we are going to deliberate on all these aspects and then recommend the future course of action,” said an official, who did not want to be named.UGC chairman D P Singh said both reports have been received and will be taken into consideration. “Whatever decision the commission takes, will be conveyed to the universities.”A member of one of the committees cited the diversity of the country and educational institutions and said the latter will have to take a call but a road map can be suggested.A UGC official said the next academic session can commence while exams may be held later. “Another option can be to advance summer vacations. The National Testing Agency could also be involved. However, individual circumstances of universities have to be factored in also,” the official said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ugc-to-meet-next-week-to-decide-if-varsities-should-hold-exams-online/story-5hrA7LPUK3t73VGp4XlaAL.html
24-04-2020||India||Don’t allow adversary to take advantage: Rajnath to forces||New Delhi: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday asked top military commanders to ensure that India’s adversary is not allowed to exploit the Covid-19 situation when the Pakistan army continues to violate the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) to help terrorists sneak into Jammu & Kashmir.Pakistan has violated the ceasefire 247 times this month (up to April 22), taking the count of border violations to 1,391 this year so far. The total number of ceasefire violations stood at 3,168 in 2019 and 1,629 in 2018.The minister, via video conference, asked the commanders from the three services to ensure the operational readiness of their forces while battling the coronavirus disease. The armed forces are an important institutional pillar in the country’s fight against the pandemic and are working on a war footing to deal with Covid-19, including setting up dedicated hospitals, flying medical supplies and operating quarantine facilities.A statement issued by the defence ministry said Singh directed the armed forces to spend financial resources judiciously and avoid wastage in view of the economic burden imposed by Covid-19. Emphasising the need to strengthen jointness in the armed forces, Singh asked the top commanders to identify and prioritise tasks that could be accomplished quickly and would assist in the revival of the economy after the lockdown is lifted.Those who took part in the video conference included chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh, Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, defence secretary Ajay Kumar, secretary (defence finance) Gargi Kaul.The commanders-in-chief briefed the minister on the steps taken to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among the forces as well as assistance being offered to the civilian administrations. The statement said the senior military commanders appreciated the recent devolution of emergency financial powers by the defence ministry to ensure timely procurement of necessary medical supplies and bolstering of the hospital infrastructure. The commanders said they were ready to pitch in to maintain essential services locally if requested by the civilian administration.Singh was to chair the Unified Commanders Conference (UCC) in Delhi on April 22-23 but the conclave was postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The UCC was to be attended by national security adviser Ajit Doval, chief of defence staff, the three service chiefs and a battery of senior officers of the armed forces and the ministry.The army had earlier indefinitely deferred a conference of its top commanders scheduled from April 13 to April 18.Such top conferences cover key issues such as the country’s security dynamics, emerging security scenarios, enhancing operational capability, taking steps to stay prepared for all challenges and budgetary aspects. Issues related to theaterisation would have also been discussed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-allow-adversary-to-take-advantage-rajnath-to-forces/story-F7HnapXFVNV3qihc3IilwI.html
24-04-2020||India||Kerala HC orders US-based firm Sprinklr to maintain data confidentiality||The Kerala High Court in an interim order on Friday restrained US firm Srpinklr from breaching confidentiality of data and directed the state government to get the consent of individuals before sharing their data with the foreign company.Though the court expressed serious reservations over the way the firm was shortlisted and entered into an agreement for wetting data it said it did not want to upset the ongoing coronavirus control measures.Hearing a clutch of petitions filed by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, BJP state president K Surendran and others a division bench of Justices Devan Ramachandran and T R Ravi asked the state government to anonymise the data and directed Sprinklr not to use these for any promotional campaign. In April first week, the state IT department had inked an agreement with the US software firm to process a huge volume of data collected by grassroot health workers of the state. Though no money was involved in the contract, the opposition alleged that it was a breach of privacy and data. Later, it was also found that the cabinet and law department were not consulted before signing the deal and the opposition later moved the court alleging serious lapses. “Sprinklr shall not directly or indirectly deal with the data entrusted to them by the Kerala Government in conflict with the confidentiality clauses in the contract and will return the data as soon as their contractual obligations are over,” the court said in the interim order. The case will be taken up after three weeks.Both the government and opposition claimed their contentions were upheld by the court. “The court did not stay the agreement. The government took such a decision in a peculiar situation and we are duty-bound to protect data of our people,” said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “The court expressed serious reservation over the deal. It also rejected the government contention not to seek the consent of individuals. It is time for the government scrap the deal,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. After the controversy surfaced, state IT secretary M Shivasankar, also the CM’s private secretary, told the media last week that he took the decision personally as the pandemic situation was getting out of control in the state. Later, he also appeared in a promotional video of the deal which was removed from Sprinklr’s website after the controversy cropped up.“We direly needed an entry that could vet a considerable amount of health data to identify infection patterns to streamline the containment strategy. Spirnklr agreed to provide the service without charge. The arrangement did not warrant the prior vetting of the finance or legal departments. It was my decision at a desperate time,” he said justifying the deal. But the opposition said he owned up to the decision to save the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-orders-us-based-firm-sprinklr-to-maintain-data-confidentiality/story-q4WDZR4ioEJolaQn57PPvM.html

Of the fresh positive cases, 21 were reported from Jaipur, 18 from Kota, four from Jhalawar and one from Bharatpur.Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, health, said a 79-year-old man from Jamwa Ramgarh in the Jaipur district died of Covid-19 on April 22. He was admitted at the SMS hospital on April 13 for an emergency surgery. While his first sample tested negative for Covid-19, a second sample taken on April 23, after his death, was found positive for the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen.A 60-year-old man who was suffering from coronary artery disease died on April 23. He was admitted to SMS hospital on April 22 and was found positive on the evening of April 23, said Singh.The developments came even as the central government deployed six teams, including one in Rajasthan’s Jaipur, to assess an alarming rise in the number of cases and present a report on remedial action to control the outbreak.Singh said that data showed that of every 100 people tested in Rajasthan, 2.85 were testing positive, while the national average for infected people was 4.4.The highest number of infected persons per 100 tests was being reported from Delhi, with 7.94 cases, followed by Maharashtra with 6.86 cases. The states ranking lower than Rajasthan were Tamil Nadu, with 2.7 positive cases per 100 tests, Kerala with 2.1 cases, Andhra Pradesh with 1.96 cases, Haryana with 1.7 cases and Karnataka with 1.45 cases.Health minister Raghu Sharma said that while the total count crossed 2,000 in Rajasthan, the rate of infection appeared to be slowing. He said 193 people were so far discharged after recovering from Covid-19.Sharma said that the state was increasing the capacity and the mortality rate in the state was lower than the national average.On Friday, the Rajasthan government allowed the working time in factories to be increased from 8 hours to 12 hours per day with limited workforce.

24-04-2020||India||Kerala shuts its borders with Tamil Nadu||Thiruvananthapuram: Last month when north Kerala district Kasaragod turned a virus hotspot, Karnataka closed its borders with Kerala, forcing the latter to take the inter-state issue to the Supreme Court . Now, Kerala has closed its borders with Tamil Nadu . Many human rights activists and others have criticised the state’s double standards. The issue took a serious turn last week when a patient from Tamil Nadu died after Kerala police turned away the ambulance carrying him. The ambulance driver later said he literally begged officials at the check post to save the life of the patient. It’s easier for many patients in Tamil Nadu’s border areas to go to Kerala’s large cities (which are close-by) for treatment. Thiruvananthapuram district collector K Gopalakrishnan said he was not aware of the case and that usually ambulances and trucks carrying essential supplies do not face any problems at the borders. A senior police officer said many ambulances were smuggling people into the state and this might have forced officials to deny permission to the vehicle carrying the patient.A government sokesperson said Krala was forced to take strict action after people who returned from Tamil Nadu fell ill. He cited the case of a Kulathupuzha resident who tested positive after his trip to Tamil Nadu to attend a function. At least 15 of this person’s primary contacts have been quarantined and a complete lockdown was imposed on three neigboring villages Thenmala, Aryankavu and Kulathupuzha.“Some of the southern districts of Tamil Nadu depend on Kerala for medical needs. There are many instances that serious patients were turned away at the borders. When Karnataka closed its border Kerala made it a big national issue. Sad, now Kerala is resorting to the same tactic. If the situation continues like this we will move the court,” human rights activist P Selvaraj said .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-shuts-its-borders-with-tamil-nadu/story-pxJJ7FCJLtRJXsRIlP8DBK.html
24-04-2020||India||DRDO offers oxygen plants to far-flung hospitals||New Delhi: The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has decided to provide medical-grade oxygen plants to hospitals in far-flung areas to generate their own supplies of the gas that is crucial in treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, two government officials said on Friday.The oxygen-generating system is an offshoot of a critical system on board the homegrown Tejas light combat aircraft and it utilises “the pressure swing adsorption technique and molecular sieve technology” to generate oxygen directly from atmospheric air, the first official cited above said on condition of anonymity.All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria said on Thursday that many of the Covid-19 patients “can be saved by just giving them oxygen”. “If they do not get oxygen, it can trigger various other problems...,” he said about the contagious respiratory disease that has killed at least 195,000 people across the world.The technology has been approved by the Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification, a regulatory body under DRDO.The first official said that “the oxygen plants will help provide medical-grade oxygen supply during the pandemic in hospitals in urban, rural and far-flung areas”. “The installation of these plants will reduce the dependence of hospitals on oxygen cylinders. They will be of great help in high altitude and inaccessible, remote areas,” the official added.The oxygen generator has been developed by Bengaluru-based Defence Bioengineering and Electro-medical Laboratory (DEBEL, a DRDO unit) and the technology has been transferred to a Coimbatore-based private firm.The firm has the capacity to install four plants in two weeks, 20 in five weeks and production can be ramped up if required, the second officer said, asking not to be named. “The benefits include reduced logistics of transporting cylinders to remote areas. The plants will ensure low cost, continuous and reliable oxygen supply round the clock,” he added.The technology is in service with the Indian Army, which has installed oxygen plants at some of its facilities in Ladakh and the North-east. The plants can also be used for filling up oxygen cylinders. Each plant can fill 47 litre (water capacity) cylinders at the rate of 60 per day, he said.DRDO is among the several government agencies that have been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19, having developed several products to combat the pandemic, including ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, large-area sanitisation solutions and sample collection kiosks.Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday unveiled, via video conference, a mobile virology research and diagnostics laboratory (MVRDL) that will speed up Covid-19 screening and other research and development activities. The MVRDL has been developed by the DRDO, Hyderabad-based Employees’ State Insurance Corporation hospital and private industry.DRDO last week shifted a key testing facility for carrying out quality checks on PPE kits from Gwalior to New Delhi to reduce delays and ensure faster delivery of safety gear to health care workers battling Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-offers-oxygen-plants-to-far-flung-hospitals/story-nKkyKO6uuhyYGSLuXzWPMO.html
24-04-2020||India||Australia supports India’s demand for WHO reform after Covid: Envoy-to-be||New Delhi: Australia supports India’s call for the reform of the World Health Organization (WHO) once the world has overcome the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak as part of efforts to shape the post Covid-19 global order, Australian high commissioner-designate Barry O’Farrell said on Friday.O’Farrell acknowledged Covid-19-related lockdowns and travel restrictions across the region had affected the repatriation of Australian citizens stranded in India, but said more than 2,000 of them had already been flown back on five flights, and more would return on four flights next week.In an interview with Hindustan Times, he also spoke of the measures put in place by Australian authorities to help the hundreds of thousands of Indians stranded in that country, especially students who have been provided an emergency grant of Australian $500 each (about Rs 25,000). There are about 600,000 Indians, including some 90,000 students, currently in Australia and as with stranded citizens in other parts of the world, they have been asked to “stay put” in view of travel restrictions, people familiar with developments said.“There have been regular discussions about how best we can shape the post-Covid world order. For instance, Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi’s call at the G20 for reform of the WHO, which is something that our government has also been supportive of,” said O’Farrell, who has so far been unable to present his credentials because of the pandemic.“The Australian government has talked about the need to have an independent review of the way that the [WHO] has handled this pandemic, but only once the worst of Covid has passed. We think that could be a natural area of future collaboration between the two governments.”During a virtual meeting of G20 leaders on March 26, Modi had called for the reform of inter-governmental organisations, such as WHO, saying they were based on the last century’s model and have not adapted to deal with new challenges.Australia, O’Farrell said, has been a long-standing supporter of India “taking a leadership role in the multilateral system, including as a permanent member of the UN Security Council”. He added: “Our belief is that stepping up in that way will also be critically important in the post-Covid world.”Of the 6,500 Australian nationals who registered with the high commission here, more than 2,000 returned in five flights so far and more will be repatriated by four flights next week, O’Farrell said. The evacuation has been complicated by travel restrictions in places such as Singapore, via which flights have to transit.“Has it been easy? No. The people here at the high commission have been working flat out exploring options and…not every company that we’ve approached was either able or willing to provide services,” he said.While praising the “incredible assistance” from the Central and state governments, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and police forces for facilitating the movement of Australian citizens, O’Farrell said not everyone who had registered intended to leave India.“It’s clear to me…that India’s policy settings have averted some of the alarmist predictions and projections made back in February-March,” he said, adding such factors were influencing decisions by Australian citizens whether to return or stay on in India.O’Farrell said he is in close contact with India’s envoy in Canberra, A Gitesh Sarma, to ensure the welfare of Indians stranded in Australia. The Australian government and universities have announced measures to support Indian students, “who are our friends, colleagues, classmates and temporary members of the Australian community to ensure they have the support needed to get through this difficult time”, he said.The Australian federal government put Australian $100 million into the university sector, which in turn put “almost as much into funds and food banks for assisting international students”, he said. This included an emergency grant of Australian $500, fee reductions and food pantries for students, he added.Modi and his Australian counterpart, Scott Morrison, who spoke on phone on April 6, have scheduled a “virtual summit” very soon and the foreign ministers and foreign secretaries of the two sides are also in touch on cooperating in the fight against Covid-19.“We’ve also noted India’s generosity in providing free medical supplies to its friends in need, not just in the immediate region but also in relation to Australia.We look forward to further positive support from India on our request for PPE (personal protective equipment) and other key medical supplies,” O’Farrell said, adding Australia too had recently sought hydroxychloroquine from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-supports-india-s-demand-for-who-reform-after-covid-envoy-to-be/story-3uyqqIqQnMzAIsYQI0PYfJ.html

He sought 10 days’ time to file an affidavit in the court in this regard.Sriram told the court that the government would not make any moves on shifting of administrative capital to Visakhapatnam and judicial capital to Kurnool from the existing capital city of Amaravati, until the legislations were enacted by the state legislature for decentralization of administration and abolishing of Amaravati capital region authority.A division bench comprising chief justice J K Maheshwari and judges A V Sesha Sai and M Satyanarayana Murthy, which was hearing a petition filed by Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi (Amaravati Protection Committee), asked the Advocate General to record his statement or submit an affidavit within 10 days, stating that the capital would not be shifted from Amaravati till the bills were passed.The two bills were originally passed in the state assembly on January 20, but were stalled in the state legislative council two days later. Legislative council chairman M A Shariff referred the two bills to the select committee using his discretionary power, but the legislature secretary refused to constitute the select committee on procedural grounds.Meanwhile, the Jagan Mohan Reddy government adopted a resolution in the assembly abolishing the legislative council and sent the same to the Centre for approval. The council will get abolished if the Centre passes a bill in the Parliament to that effect.Arguing on behalf of Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi, advocate U Muralidhar Rao brought to the notice of the high court that the government was making attempts to shift the capital overnight notwithstanding the present Covid-19 pandemic situation.He submitted to the court the minutes of an internal meeting of executive committee of AP Secretariat Employees Association on shifting of the Secretariat to Visakhapatnam and also media reports about YSRC parliamentary party leader V Vijay Sai Reddy announcing the shifting of administrative capital to Visakhapatnam at the earliest.The high court bench said if the government goes ahead with the capital shift despite the assurance given by the Advocate General, the petitioners could invoke urgency through the high court registry and request an earlier hearing before the bench.For Coronavirus Live Updates||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-move-to-shift-andhra-capital-to-vizag-immediately-jagan-govt-tells-hc/story-5Du9PKu8wabr90fBNIT20K.html

Two other districts with positive cases in three digits include Bhopal (360) and Ujjain (102)..Notably, the state government’s red-flag came just two days after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan made an appeal to people saying, “Those whose samples have been taken need not go anywhere. Now, our testing capacity is 2,000 per day. Madhya Pradesh has 22520 RT PCR and 14200 manual RNA kits.”The state is much behind its neighbouring states like Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat in samples collection and testing.According to the state health bulletin released on Friday, the state has 1,846 Covid-19 positive patients including1029 from Indore alone. State capital Bhopal has 360 patients, while Ujjain’s tally shot up to 102 on Friday from 76 on Thursday. There are at least 12 districts with patients tally in double-digit, which include Khargone with 61 patients, Dhar with 36, Khandwa with 35 and Jabalpur with 31 patients. 92 patients have died so far including 55 in Indore alone. Drawing the attention of union health minister Dr Harshvardhan during a video conference on Friday, newly appointed health minister of the state Narottam Mishra said, “We have enough machines. We can get more machines but we don’t have testing kits. You will have to give more testing kits. Shivraj Singh Chouhan is making efforts to control the situation but if testing kits are made available, this will give relief to us.”As per the report on April 19, the state government had ordered for 116,500 manual extraction kits but only got 14,200 such kits. Similarly, the government had ordered 102,600 RT PCR kits but got 22,520. The state was only left with 200 manual extraction kits and 5,300 RT-PCR testing kits in stock, triggering concern.“We need the kits immediately,” Mishra told Harsh Vardhan on Friday. In Indore, commissioner Akash Tripathi said that the administration was in touch with every vendor. “All of them have said waiting time for kits is about two weeks,” said Tripathi.The officials said that because of the poor availability of kits in the state, samples were sent to other states for testing, leading to delays in getting results. As per health department officials, there is a delay of 7 to 10 days in getting reports since all the labs approved by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) are overburdened.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesOn Friday, Mishra urged the union health minister to intervene for the release of more than 1,700 test reports done by a Noida lab. On Friday itself, the state government sent as many as 1,600 samples--- 600 from Indore and 1,000 from Bhopal to Puducherry—hoping lab there will be able to provide early results.Till Friday, the state had sent 35,076 samples for testing and received reports for 26,233 samples. As many as 8,843 reports were still pending, as per the state government’s report.In Rajasthan, the Congress government has sent 74,400 samples for testing with only 4,343 reports pending. In Maharashtra, the number of samples sent for test stood at 96,369 as on Thursday.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said, “We have been saying right from day one that the government’s approach is wrong. It’s mainly focused on lockdown restrictions and social distancing, whereas the work on creating more and more labs to enhance the testing capacity of the state and getting more and more testing kits was lacking and stuck in a bureaucratic approach.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indore-s-covid-tally-crosses-1-000-mp-raises-alert-over-testing-kits/story-ZL0CZLt2Wv5gyM02lcxzhJ.html
24-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Cabinet secy to meet chief secretaries on Saturday||Two days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets state chief ministers to decide on the road map after the federal lockdown ends on May 3, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba has called a meeting of all chief secretaries and top policemen of the states along with select union secretaries on Saturday. The meeting, scheduled on Saturday morning, will be focused on the concessions given by the Union home ministry to the states during the lockdown period but it will not be a mere stock taking exercise, an official, who will be present during the discussion, said on Friday.The cabinet secretary is expected to point out some loopholes and different interpretations of the central advisory that has led to confusion at the local levels and also take feedback from the senior bureaucracy on the possible measures they would expect to come into force when the lockdown ends on May 3.The presence of director generals of state police forces assume significance as there will be a detailed discussion on the law and order issues faced in different states in implementing the concessions during the lockdown.Select Union secretaries are expected to make presentations and may also provide clear instructions to the states for an effective implementation of the relaxations that are aimed at providing employment and boosting the economy.But the meeting will also lay the foundation for the Prime Minister’s meeting on Monday as the government has now turned its focus into planning for the days and weeks ahead. The official added that the discussions and the outcome of the cabinet secretary’s meeting will be shared with the Prime Minister’s Office.After India completed 21 days in lockdown, the Narendra Modi government had announced a gradual restart of the economy with a sharp focus on the agriculture sector and the ease of services, including e-commerce, for urban India. Most of the measures started from April 20 even as the Covi-19 hot spots, as identified by the states or local authorities, continued to face tough containment measures to contain the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-cabinet-secy-to-meet-chief-secretaries-on-sat/story-lnFxn7TUMjcgEUh1flwNxL.html
24-04-2020||India||Coronavirus outbreak: Maharashtra govt releases over 4,000 prisoners to decongest jails||The Bombay High Court has directed the state government to expedite the process and release on temporary bail or parole those prisoners who are serving sentences of less than seven years as per the directions of the Supreme Court to decongest jails in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The court also directed the high power committee to expedite hearing and deciding on the representation made by two inmates who are accused of crimes under special enactments and were refused interim parole.The single bench of justice G S Kulkarni issued the directions while hearing a suo moto petition which was prompted by the letter from advocate Satish Talekar who claimed that there was little or no effort on the part of the state to implement the SC directions. On its part, the state informed the bench on Thursday that as per the SC directions, 4,060 out of 11,000 prisoners had been released on interim bail or parole. The state also assured the bench that no prisoner in jails across Maharashtra was affected by Covid-19. Public Prosecutor Deepak Thakare submitted a letter dated April 20 by additional director general (prisons) which stated that none of the inmates in prisons across state was affected with coronavirus and so far, 4060 under trials were released on temporary bail. The letter stated that further action to release more prisoners as prescribed by the high-powered committee was underway.After hearing the submissions through video conferencing, justice Kulkarni observed, “I am of the opinion, that as the state is already in process of releasing 11000 prisoners, it is not necessary to issue immediate directions. However, it is clarified that the State Government may expedite such steps which are being taken, so that the SC orders are implemented in letter and spirit.”The court asked the high-powered committee to consider the representation made by inmates who were refused temporary bail or parole as they were booked for crimes under special enactments and decide it at the earliest and posted further hearing on April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-outbreak-maharashtra-govt-releases-over-4-000-prisoners-to-decongest-jails/story-nuYNPYXO3wO3QC6kHWItQJ.html

All legal formalities were completed before the burial, they added.On Wednesday, four militants were killed in a gun battle at Mulhora village in Shopian district. After the skirmish ended, police didn’t reveal the identities of the slain militants and buried their bodies at Sonmarg in Ganderbal district, 110 km from the spot of the gun battle.Asked about the identity of the militants killed in Shopian, inspector general of police Vijay Kumar said three of the four men were identified by their families. “They (families) participated in the burial in the presence of a magistrate,” he said.Kumar acknowledged the militants weren’t buried in their native villages. A senior police officer, who declined to be named, confirmed the militants were buried in Ganderbal.This is the second time since the Covid-19 lockdown began in Kashmir that the bodies of militants have been buried away from their villages.On April 17, two unidentified militants were killed in Shopian and hours later, two families wrote an application to the local deputy commissioner saying the slain men were their kin.Police took the bodies of the two men to north Kashmir’s Baramulla district and buried them there and officials later said no one had approached them regarding the dead men.Later, Shopian’s deputy commissioner permitted two members of the families to travel to Baramulla. The families have now submitted an application to Baramulla’s deputy commissioner, demanding exhumation of the bodies.However, officials said exhumation can be done only after legal formalities are fulfilled as required by the government.On April 8, when a Jaish-e-Mohammed commander was killed in a gun battle in Sopore, his body was handed over to relatives after they gave an assurance to police that they would observe social distancing at the funeral.However, hundreds of people gathered for the funeral and photographs of the event went viral on social media. A day later, police registered a case against several people for violating social distancing norms, and more than 12 people were taken into custody.Similarly, when four militants were killed in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district in the first week of April, a large number of people attended their funeral and didn’t observe social distancing norms.Since the beginning of the lockdown, 17 militants have been killed across Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-avoid-crowding-police-bury-militants-killed-in-j-k-gunfight-away-from-their-villages/story-hvmNipjpIQDQHTQrXHRSeO.html
24-04-2020||India||As PM dials Odisha CM, Jagannath temple says rath yatra decision after May 3||Decision on conducting the annual rath yatra at Puri will be taken only after the nationwide lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic is lifted on May 3, said Jagannath temple authorities on Friday.Earlier this morning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a discussion with chief minister Naveen Patnaik. However, it was not clear what the leaders discussed. With the Covid-19 cases surging to 94 in Odisha, Puri king Gajapati Maharaj Dibyasingh Deb, who heads the management committee of the 12th century Jagannath temple, said it is the responsibility of both the Centre and state government to decide whether the rath yatra, scheduled for June 23, can be held in presence of only servitors and officials or not at all. Any decision in this regard, will be based on the revised guidelines which are expected to come up after the lockdown ends on May 3, said Deb.The temple doors have been shut since March 20 due to the pandemic. Only day-to-day rituals are being done by the temple priests.“As per the present restrictions, no congregation or religious functions can be organised in temples and religious institutions. We have to respect and abide by the guidelines for lockdown. However, the construction of chariots cannot be taken up till May 3,” said Dibyasingha Deb, who chaired a meeting of the temple administration.The Puri king, who is first among equals of all devotee of Lord Jagannath, said most of the rituals including Snan Yatra, Anasara Bidhi, Sri Gundicha Yatra, Bahuda Yatra, Niladri Bije of the Lord will be held in the month of June. “As there is still time, we will wait for the new guidelines after the lockdown ends. The Managing Committee will conduct a meeting after the guidelines are released,” he said.About a million devotees throng Puri for rath yatra every year for the 10-day long festival, the most important one in Odisha.The Puri king said that the chariot construction work that was supposed to start on the auspicious day of Akshay Tritiya and Chandan Yatra on April 26 will also stay suspended till May 3.The Gajapati and officials led by Puri temple chief administrator Dr Krishan Kumar met Shankaracharya Swami Nischalananda Saraswati seeking his guidance on conduct of the temple rituals of the rath yatra like Akshay Tritiya as there will be no public participation during lockdown period.Meanwhile, Nayak Patajoshi Janardhan Mohapatra, who heads Chhatisa Nijog, a body of temple servitors(priests) of Puri temple, suggested that instead of scrapping the festival totally, it should be scaled down and conducted in a controlled environment with the help of police personnel and temple servitors. “The police personnel and the servitors should be identified, tested and kept in isolation well in advance. The government should announce that the festival would be conducted with absolutely no participation by public,” said Mohapatra.If the car festival is not held this year, it would be the first time in the last 284 years when it could not be held. Jagannath temple historian Bhaskar Mishra said in the last 425 years of car festival, the event has been scrapped 32 times, mostly during invasion. “It was scrapped for the first time in 1568 when Kala Pahad alias Kala Chand Roy, a general of Bengal king Suleiman Kirrani attacked the temple and pillaged the deities. For the next 9 years, Rath Yatra could not be held,” said Mishra.The last time the car festival could not be held was between 1733 and 1735 when Mohammed Taqi Khan, deputy governor of Odisha, attacked the Jagannath temple, forcing the shifting of the idols to Ganjam district, said Mishra.The uncertainty over the rath yatra comes at a time when the Naveen Patnaik government is gearing to rebuild Puri as a world heritage city pumping in Rs 3,208 crore in infrastructure development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-pm-dials-odisha-cm-jagannath-temple-says-rath-yatra-decision-after-may-3/story-xt7aCXSAUZIxcPcIpjHq4K.html
24-04-2020||India||‘Ramzan Mubarak!’: Prime Minister Modi’s wish includes victory against coronavirus||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday greeted the Muslim community on the eve of the beginning of the holy month of Ramzan and said that he prayed for everyone’s safety, well being and prosperity while wishing for a decisive victory against coronavirus pandemic for a healthier planet.“Ramzan Mubarak! I pray for everyone’s safety, well-being and prosperity. May this Holy Month bring with it abundance of kindness, harmony and compassion. May we achieve a decisive victory in the ongoing battle against COVID-19 and create a healthier planet,” a tweet by the prime minister said.Prime minister’s message coincided with the sighting of the new moon which marks the beginning of Ramzan fast from Saturday ink most parts of the country.Governments, Muslim clerics and leaders have appealed that prayers during Ramzan be held inside homes and not at mosques or at other places of religious gathering keeping in mind the threat of infections spreading further. Shahi Imam of Delhi’s Jama Masjid Syed Ahmed Bukhari has requested the devotees to not invite neighbours at their homes during Ramzan and also to ensure that not more than three persons offer prayers together in a room.“I appeal to all that do not invite your neighbours to your house to offer prayers during Ramzan. Ensure that there are not more than three people in one room even while offering prayers with your family members. COVID-19 will end only when we will unite,” Bukhari was quoted as saying by ANI.The agency reported that a poster was put up outside the Jama Masjid that said: “Due to coronavirus, it is mandatory to keep the distance from the people. So, offer prayers at your homes instead of mosques.”Ramzan began on Friday in Kerala and in coastal Karnataka districts. The holy month will begin tomorrow morning for the rest of the country including capital Delhi.Delhi Police on Friday said that azan may be carried out in accordance with the National Green Tribunal guidelines and urged people to follow the lockdown norms during the Ramzan.The police’s appeal followed a video put on social media that purportedly had a couple of policemen claiming that azan was not allowed during the lockdown.Delhi government later clarified that there was no restriction on azan (call for prayer). “In lockdown, there is complete ban on gathering of people for prayers in mosques or at any other religious place,” Sisodia said in a tweet on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramzan-mubarak-prime-minister-modi-s-wish-includes-victory-against-coronavirus/story-ZhzEdxE39foxMUBLyiYh4H.html

The spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus in the remaining containment zones is well under control, the official said.The health department had carried out tests between April 19 and 23 to get a sense of the spread of infection in these Covid-19 hotspots.The positive cases shot up from 2 to 51 in Sadar Bazar, rose from 20 to 32 in Nabi Karim, from 3 to 20 in Chandni Mahal zone and from 8 to 13 in Nawabganj.Also read: In key video conference with PM Modi, what could be on states’ wish listIn north Delhi’s Jahangirpuri’s C block that covers people living in 10 lanes, the cases went up from 20 to 32 while in Budh Nagar, Inderpuri containment zone, one additional case was reported taking the total to 3.There was no increase reported from Nizamuddin Markaz and basti (it has 12 cases), Bara Hindu Rao (10), EA block of Inderpuri (2), Jahangirpuri’s B block (8) and Dilshad Garden (6).The test results have prompted Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to order officials to further demarcate the big containment zones into sectors. Or as one official described them, “safe zones”.For instance, four sectors - C-1, C-2, C-3 and C-4 - have been carved out of Chandni Mahal containment zone, home to 5.5 lakh people. And another three - S-1, S-2 and S-3 - in Sadar Bazar.A senior health department official said the government was keen that safe zones within large containment zones be carved out to keep them insulated from the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen. So Chandni Mahal may still be one containment zone but it is divided into four sectors.Also read: In Centre’s Covid-19 lockdown exit plan, 1 principle and 2 crucial worriesThe size of a containment zone is directly proportional to the population density of the cluster in question and the scale of the outbreak.Many of these are small, in some cases as small as a single lane in a residential colony.But there are other areas where the administration had notified an entire locality - home to lakhs of people - as a containment zone.In all, there are 11 containment zones in the city that have a population of more than 10,000.Of these, there are 8 where the population is between 10,000 and 40,000 people.The three mega containment zones are in central Delhi: Sadar Bazar where 3.5 lakh people are under a hard lockdown, Chandni Mahal with a population of 5.5 lakh and Nabi Karim, which has a population of 1.5 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-6-11-score-in-delhi-s-biggest-containment-zones-prompts-tweak-in-tactics/story-am35PsrzLNU0rmvq4neeyJ.html
24-04-2020||India||PM Modi lauds villages for ‘do gaj doori’ mantra in social distancing||Marking out villages for special praise in the fight against coronavirus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday underlined how the ‘do gaj doori (a distance of two yards)’ mantra practised by villages is a useful social distancing example to be followed by everyone.The slogan given by rural India “showed the wisdom of the people”, he said.“With its simple mantra of Do Gaz Ki Doori, rural India has described social distancing in simple words, villages have showcased the best of their principles, traditional values to fight coronavirus,” Modi, who used a ‘gamcha’ as face mask, said.Asking villages to be self-sufficient, the PM told gram panchayats how the coronavirus pandemic has taught valuable lessons that the country should not look for solutions outside the country.“This pandemic has thrown at us new challenges and problems which we have never imagined, but it also taught us a very good lesson with a strong message. It has taught us that we have to be self-reliant and self-sufficient. It has taught us that we should not look for solutions outside the country. This is the biggest lesson we have learnt,” said the PM addressing gram panchayat heads on the occasion of the National Panchayati Raj Day.Panchayats, along with the women-run Self-Help Groups, have provided key support to the government outreach in vast belts of rural India. Many of them have undertaken door-to-door campaigns while others have stitched masks or made hand sanitisers, providing vital help in India’s action against Covid-19 pandemic.“Every Village has to be self-sufficient enough to provide for its basic needs. Similarly every district has to be self-sufficient at its level, every state has to be self-reliant at its level and the whole country has to be self-reliant at its level”, Modi said, as he underlined that “progress of panchayats will ensure the development of the nation and democracy”.The PM’s interaction with panchayats also comes days before his meeting with the CMs to decide the future course of action after the extended, federal lockdown ends on May 3. A series of activities have already been allowed in rural areas including wide-ranging relaxation for agricultural workers. After May 2, there are distinct possibilities of more relaxations in the offing while the government will continue to monitor the containment zones.The PM announced that he will make the panchayats stronger as he wants to provide self-sufficiency to villages. “In the last five years nearly 1.25 Lakh panchayats have been connected through broadband from a mere 100 before. Similarly, the number of Common Service Centres had crossed 3 lakhs”, he said.He also pointed out the mobile manufacturing in India, which has led to reduction in costs but improved connectivity in Indian villages.The PM also launched e-Gram Swarajya App and Swamitva Scheme. While the e-GramSwaraj helps prepare and execute Gram Panchayat Development Plan, the Swamitva scheme helps to map rural inhabited lands using drones and latest survey methods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-lauds-villages-for-do-gaj-doori-mantra-in-social-distancing/story-VRAOnUjbzxL7ohPdJmftSK.html

Even though I am the chief minister, by profession I am an ayurvedic doctor. To support the medical fraternity and the frontline warriors, I have decided to spend half my day at Asilo Hospital to show solidarity. I sat in the ayurvedic OPD and asked Dr Samir that I will handle all the patients who walk in today. I felt nice to sit for the first time in 2008,” Sawant said. Sawat was visiting the government run Asilo Hospital in North Goa District where he had practised as an ayurvedic doctor back in 2008 before actively involving himself in politics full time. He was elected to the Goa Legislative Assembly for the first time in 2012. “If anyone is fighting this 24*7 it is the medical staff and so I am dedicating my birthday for the corona warriors. The message should go that the entire country is behind them and not only the politicians,” Sawant said. Sawant also welcomed the ordinance making attacks on doctors an offence punishable with a jail term of seven years. “The ordinance making attacks on doctors and medical staff punishable with one year to seven years, is a very welcome step. In Goa the situation is very good, medical professionals are respected and supported, But we have to give a message around the country that we all have to support the medical fraternity to make us corona free,” he added. Goa became the first state in the country to have brought down its count of known active Covid19 patients to zero after all the seven people who contracted the disease tested negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-celebrates-birthday-as-ayurvedic-consultant-at-govt-hospital/story-LQCEy6p613kkvjBc8gjHTI.html
24-04-2020||India||Kerala shuts borders with Tamil Nadu after spike in Covid-19 cases, activists cry foul||Last month when north Kerala district Kasaragod turned into a coronavirus hotspot, Karnataka had closed all its border points with Kerala and the latter took the inter-state issue to the Supreme Court, however, now Kerala has closed its borders with Tamil Nadu after Covid-19 cases shot up in the neighbouring state. Many human rights activists and others have criticised what they called Kerala’s “double standards” in trying times. The issue took a serious turn last week when a patient from Tamil Nadu died after the Kerala police turned away the ambulance carrying him. The ambulance driver, later said, he literally begged the officials at the check post to save the life of the patient but he was threatened and forcibly sent back.When asked about this Thiruvananthapuram district collector K Gopalakrishnan said he was not aware of the case and usually ambulances and trucks carrying essential supplies do not pose any problems at the borders. A senior police officer said many ambulances were discreetly taking stranded people to the state and this might have forced officials to deny permission to the vehicle carrying the patient.However, a government spokesperson said the state was forced to take strict action after some people came from the neighbouring state through forest routes turned Covid-19 positive and transmitted the virus to many others. He cited the case of a Kulathupuzha resident (Kollam) who tested Covid-19 positive after his trip to Tamil Nadu to attend a function. At least 15 of his primary contacts have been quarantined and a complete lockdown was imposed on three neighbouring villages Thenmala, Aryankavu and Kulathupuzha.“Some of the southern districts of Tamil Nadu heavily depend on Kerala for medical needs. There are many instances where serious patients were turned away at the borders. When Karnataka closed its border, Kerala made it a big national issue. Sad, now Kerala is resorting to the same tactic. If the situation continues like this we will move the court,” a rights activist in Marthandam P Selvaraj said protesting against Kerala’s attitude.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-shuts-borders-with-tamil-nadu-after-spike-in-covid-19-cases-activists-cry-foul/story-EFEAobORsVK8ZErSEdLgXP.html

It uses comparative sequence analysis to identify unique regions in COVID-19 which are not found in other human coronaviruses, thereby, providing an opportunity to specifically detect Covid-19. It has approved by India’s top medical research body ICMR and is likely to make testing for the virus lot more affordable.The team is targeting large scale deployment of the kit at affordable prices with suitable industrial partners as soon as possible. The development follows a decision to suspend rapid testing for Covid antibodies using China-made kits after several states complaint of massive variations in results.Pokhriyal said that in line with the PM’s vision for the country to develop its own strengths and not be dependent on the world, institutes like IITs were encouraged to step up their research and innovation initiatives with respect to the Covid 19 pandemic.The prime minister on Friday reiterated his emphasis on self-reliance in times of crisis like these.“This Pandemic has thrown at us new challenges and problems which we have never imagined, but it also taught us a very good lesson with a strong message. It has taught us that we have to be self-reliant and self-sufficient. It has taught us that we should not look for solutions outside the country.

The students started their 2,000-kilometre homeward journey from Kota in 17 buses and will reach Assam on Sunday after passing through Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.“Earlier, we’re not planning to bring them back, but we decided against it after UP, MP and Uttarakhand governments brought back their students. Besides, our students are young and are distressed because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Assam’s health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.Kota, a hub for coaching centres catering to engineering and medical aspirants, is a popular destination for thousands of students from across India.The Assam government air-dropped eight police officers to Kota on Thursday who are accompanying the students back home. Each student has to pay Rs 7,000 for the trip back home.“UP government has arranged for a night’s stay for the students at Kosi Kalan town. The students reached Jhansi by Friday afternoon and will reach Assam on Sunday morning. They will be quarantined for two weeks after they reach Assam,” said Sarma.The students, who were in quarantine in Kota, will be kept either at Sreerampur on the West Bengal-Assam border or in the state capital, Guwahati.They will have to undergo a test after five days following which doctors will decide whether their quarantine be extended beyond two weeks.Sarma said that the state government might facilitate a similar return journey for students from Assam, who are stranded in other states.Body brought back from GujaratOn Thursday night, the body of a youth from Assam’s Baksa district, who had died in Ahmedabad on April 19 was brought back by road.The youth, Rahul Barman, who used to work in a private company in Ahmedabad, was found dead in his rented accommodation on April 19.“We thank Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani for providing an ambulance to bring back the body. Our sincere gratitude to the two drivers, Nilesh Chavda and Hiren Dave, who drove for 40 hours to bring the body back,” said Sarma.Inter-district movement of people to begin on SaturdayPeople stranded in one part of Assam due to the ongoing lockdown restrictions, who are interested to return to their homes or their workplaces, will be allowed to do so for three days beginning Saturday based on prior permission from the authorities concerned.The state government will also provide state transport buses to allow over 41,000 people who called on a helpline number to travel to one destination of their choice during these three days, starting Saturday.Home delivery of medicinesThe state government has also decided to start home delivery of medicines for those who are unable to get their prescribed drugs close to their place of residence. Those willing to avail of the service will have to call 104. “If the medicines are available in the same district, it will be delivered within 24 hours. If it have to be procured from another part of the state, delivery will be done within 48 hours, and for medicines, which need to be brought from outside the state, it will be done within a week,” Sarma said. If the medicines cost less than Rs 200, the state government will provide free of cost. For medicines, which cost more, the patients have to bear the cost.Assam Police has done over 4,800 home deliveries of medicines to date.The state has reported 36 Covid-19 positive cases so far, including one death and 19 have recovered. The state government has provided $1,000 each to 49 people from the state stranded abroad, Rs 25,000 each to 829 patients from the state who went for treatment to other states, and Rs 2,000 each to 200,000 people from the state, who work in other parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-facilitates-return-of-391-students-stranded-in-kota/story-TkaoCdo1KbbOGC6Ap23gCK.html

About 107,077.85 MT pulses have so far been issued to the States/UTs,” the agriculture ministry statement said. However, some states have not started distribution yet and drawing up schedules for their distribution. States that have started distributing 1 kg of free pulses to each household include Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Chattisgarh, Daman and Diu, Goa, Gujarat and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. A majority of states, including Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi have only received the partial stock. These states are planning their distribution schedules and will start distribution to eligible beneficiaries in phased manner according to their plan, the ministry said. According to data collected from different states, pulses will be distributed to 190 million household across 36 states and Union territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-stocks-of-free-pulses-shipped-to-some-states/story-r2bFvKh1rXGijiRxfQDTZK.html
24-04-2020||India||Australia backs India’s call for WHO reform post Covid-19 crisis, says envoy-designate||Australia supports India’s call for the reform of the World Health Organization (WHO) once the world has overcome the Coronavirus crisis as part of efforts to shape the post Covid-19 global order, Australian high commissioner-designate Barry O’Farrell said on Friday.O’Farrell acknowledged Covid-19-related lockdowns and travel restrictions across the region had impacted the repatriation of Australian citizens stranded in India, but said more than 2,000 of them had already been flown back on five flights, and more would return on four flights next week.Also read: India is poised for deep structural health reformsIn an interview with Hindustan Times, he also spoke of the measures put in place by Australian authorities to help the hundreds of thousands of Indians stranded in that country, especially students who have been provided an emergency grant of Australian $500 each (about Rs 25,000).“There have been regular discussions about how best we can shape the post-Covid world order. For instance, Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi’s call at the G20 for reform of the WHO, which is something that our government has also been supportive of,” said O’Farrell, who has so far been unable to present his credentials because of the pandemic.“The Australian government has talked about the need to have an independent review of the way that the [WHO] has handled this pandemic, but only once the worst of Covid has passed. We think that could be a natural area of future collaboration between the two governments.”During a virtual meeting of G20 leaders on March 26, Modi had called for the reform of inter-governmental organisations such as WHO, saying they were based on the last century’s model and haven’t adapted to deal with new challenges.Also read: PM Modi asks G20 for an effective global response to coronavirus: ReportsAustralia, O’Farrell said, has been a long-standing supporter of India “taking a leadership role in the multilateral system, including as a permanent member of the UN Security Council”. He added: “Our belief is that stepping up in that way will also be critically important in the post-Covid world.”Of the 6,500 Australian nationals who registered with the high commission here, more than 2,000 returned in five flights so far and more will be repatriated by four flights next week, O’Farrell said. The evacuation has been complicated by travel restrictions in places such as Singapore, via which flights have to transit.“Has it been easy? No. The people here at the high commission have been working flat out exploring options and…not every company that we’ve approached was either able or willing to provide services,” he said.While praising the “incredible assistance” from the Central and state governments, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and police forces for facilitating the movement of Australian citizens, O’Farrell said not everyone who had registered intended to leave India.Also read: Six coronavirus vaccines in human trials bring hope of early success“It’s clear to me…that India’s policy settings have averted some of the alarmist predictions and projections made back in February-March,” he said, adding such factors were influencing decisions by Australian citizens whether to return or stay on in India.O’Farrell said he is in close contact with India’s envoy in Canberra, A Gitesh Sarma, to ensure the welfare of Indians stranded in Australia. The Australian government and universities have announced measures to support Indian students, “who are our friends, colleagues, classmates and temporary members of the Australian community to ensure they have the support needed to get through this difficult time”, he said.The Australian federal government put Australian $100 million into the university sector, which in turn put “almost as much into funds and food banks for assisting international students”, he said. This included an emergency grant of Australian $500, fee reductions and food pantries for students, he added.There are about 600,000 Indians, including some 90,000 students, currently in Australia and as with stranded citizens in other parts of the world, they have been asked to “stay put” in view of travel restrictions, people familiar with developments said.Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison, who spoke on phone on April 6, have scheduled a “virtual summit” very soon and the foreign ministers and foreign secretaries of the two sides are also in touch on cooperating in the fight against Covid-19.“We’ve also noted India’s generosity in providing free medical supplies to its friends in need, not just in the immediate region but also in relation to Australia.We look forward to further positive support from India on our request for PPE (personal protective equipment) and other key medical supplies,” O’Farrell said, adding Australia too had recently sought hydroxychloroquine from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-backs-india-s-call-for-who-reform-post-covid-19-crisis-says-envoy-designate/story-0pEM6lTjG4xVeKDkOEy4TM.html
24-04-2020||India||Covid-19: In key video conference with PM Modi, what could be on states’ wish list||Chief ministers, especially of non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled states, are likely to discuss inter-state transport of migrant labourers, an increase in their borrowing capacity and food for work programmes when Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets them through video-conference on Monday.This will be the third such meeting between the Prime Minister and the chief ministers. While the meeting will deal with the Covid-19 pandemic in general, one of the main items on the agenda is likely to be whether the lockdown imposed to check its spread should continue beyond May 3.Most chief ministers want the lockdown to be lifted in districts not affected by the pandemic, even as differences remain on how the curbs should be enforced in the remaining areas.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa and his Andhra counterpart, YSR Jagan Mohan Reddy, want the lockdown to be restricted to the containment areas and their buffer zones and not entire districts. Others like Maharashtra and Delhi chief ministers, Uddhav Thackeray and Arvind Kejriwal, want no relaxation in norms in entire Covid-19 affected districts. Officials in most BJP-ruled states said they will follow the Centre’s directions on the lockdown.Across multiple states, officials said chief ministers would submit detailed proposals on reviving the economy at the meeting and seek economic stimulus for small and medium scale industries. Reopening of industries is seen as an important step in dealing with the growing concern over joblessness among migrant workers. Distress calls from migrant workers have reduced in states where industries have reopened after the Centre’s conditional permission for reopening them in rural areas outside the Covid-19 zones following the extension of the lockdown until May 3. “In Assam, where industrial activities started from April 20, the calls for bringing back migrants have fallen,” a Bihar government official said on condition of anonymity. Chief ministers of Rajasthan, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar are expected to seek relaxation on interstate transport for allowing stranded migrant labourers to return home. “Whenever the lockdown is lifted, there will have to be a definite plan for the migrants, maybe through special trains so that they can be tracked, screened and quarantined accordingly,” the Bihar official said. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has also sought special trains for bringing back workers to his state.Officials in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Haryana said they will seek additional relaxations for factories including making in-situ lodging for workers voluntary and allowing them to run in multiple shifts.Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu are likely to demand the reopening of automobile sector supply chains as well as showrooms. Officials in West Bengal and Bihar said they are likely to seek full resumption of work in the tobacco industry as it employs around 15 million women. Telangana, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh want the information technology industry to fully function in non-Covid-19 regions with social distancing and hygiene norms in place. The states are expected to raise the issue of their worsening financial condition. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh is likely to seek the release of the state’s Goods and Services Tax arrears worth Rs 4,400 crore for the last four months and also an interim compensation of Rs 3,000 crore for April, said a state government official.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has sought implementation of the Finance Commission’s recommendation of giving 42% of the Central taxes to the states as against 41%. The commission reduced the funding to states citing slower than expected for the current fiscal. Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao on Thursday said the Centre needs to help the state financially. “I will request the PM to take states into confidence while making changes in the monetary policy and defer payment of loans taken by the state governments,” Rao said. He insisted the Centre must relax the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management rules to increase the borrowing limits of the states. An Andhra government official said Reddy too will raise the issue of a cut in central tax devolution for April and seek compensation for the same. He added the state has lost revenue of about Rs 15,000 crore in March and April. Officials said Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh are likely to demand food for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Kerala is expected to seek flights to bring back around two million expatriates, mostly from West Asia. The state will also ask for a special financial package, said a Kerala government spokesperson. Several chief ministers are expected to raise the issue of the shortage of personal protective equipment and testing kits. “Our chief minister [Mamta Banerjee] will raise the issue of not enough testing kits and faulty rapid testing kits...,” said a West Bengal official, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-key-covid-19-video-conference-with-pm-here-s-could-be-on-states-wish-list/story-tpgjXqrlv6BWu24sXKZsaO.html

The installation of these plants will reduce the dependence of hospitals on oxygen cylinders. They will be of great help in high altitude and inaccessible remote areas,” the official said.The technology has been approved by Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification, a regulatory body under DRDO. The oxygen generator system has been developed by Bengaluru-based Defence Bioengineering and Electro-medical Laboratory (DEBEL, a DRDO unit) and the technology has been transferred to a Coimbatore-based private firm.The firm has the capability to install four plants in two weeks, 20 in five weeks and production can be ramped up if required, said the second officer. “The benefits include reduced logistics of transporting cylinders to remote areas. The plants will ensure low cost, continuous and reliable oxygen supply round the clock,” he said.The technology is in service with the army which has installed oxygen plants at some of its facilities in Ladakh and the North-east. The plants can also be used for the filling up oxygen cylinders. Each plant can fill 47 litre (water capacity) cylinders at the rate of 60 per day, he said.The DRDO is among the several government agencies that have been at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus disease, having developed several products to combat the pandemic including ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, large area sanitisation solutions and Covid-19 sample collection kiosks.Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday unveiled, via video conference, a mobile virology research and diagnostics laboratory (MVRDL) that will speed up coronavirus disease screening and other Covid-19 research and development activities. The MVRDL has been developed by the DRDO, Hyderabad-based Employees’ State Insurance Corporation hospital and the private industry.The DRDO last week shifted a key testing facility for carrying out quality checks on PPE kits from Gwalior to New Delhi to cut down delays and ensure faster delivery of the safety gear to healthcare workers battling Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-offers-oxygen-plants-to-hospitals-in-far-flung-areas/story-wZpmIVcTIgJnYKVfMvggxM.html
24-04-2020||India||Insensitive, inhumane: Congress on Centre’s decision to freeze DA||The Congress on Friday criticised as “insensitive and inhumane” the Centre’s decision to freeze the inflation-linked dearness allowance and dearness relief of central government employees and pensioners in an attempt to save money to fund the battle against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The opposition party said the government should have instead suspended the bullet train and the New Delhi central vista beautification projects costing the state exchequer “lakhs of crores of rupees.”“It is an insensitive and inhumane decision of the government to cut DA of central employees, pensioners and jawans who are serving the public while fighting coronavirus, instead of suspending the bullet train project and the central vista beautification project of lakhs of crores (of rupees),” former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted in Hindi. On Thursday, the Centre held back an expected increase in DA by 4 percentage points to 21% of basic pay until July 2021 and asked the states to emulate it. The Centre alone stands to save $37,300 crore by freezing the DA, HT reported on Friday; together, the Centre and the states together would save Rs.1.2 lakh crore. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters through video conferencing that the government should curtail 30% of its own expenditure and shelve the Rs.20,000 crore central vista redevelopment project as well as the Rs.1.10 lakh crore Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project to save money it can use o fight the coronavirus pandemic.“The government, instead of helping people by giving them financial support in this crisis, is hurting them. Instead of curtailing its own wasteful expenditures, the government is cutting the money of the middle class people,” he said.If the government cuts its own expenses by 30%, Surjewala said it could yield around Rs 2.5 lakh crore, which could be used to pay the dearness allowance and dearness relief for employees, pensioners and defence personnel.Accusing the government of “misconceived” priorities and policies, he said that on the one hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was telling the states and the private sector not to cut salaries of employees and on the other, he was himself doing so.“Is this not an indicator to states and private sector? If this mayhem continues how you will put money in the hands of people?” he asked.“Why are you attacking the incomes of the most vulnerable sections and instead not cutting your own waste expenditure?” he asked.Surjewala said the government was adding “insult to injury” by not offering people relief at a time when economic growth and incomes have taken a hit from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insensitive-congress-on-centre-s-decision-on-da-move/story-LGvjTh9lvDPK36FD60sbNI.html
24-04-2020||India||Covid-19 outbreak in India under control, sans lockdown cases would have around 1 lakh by now: Govt||The government said on Friday the nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a timely step, without which there would have been an estimated one lakh COVID-19 cases in India by now.In a press briefing, officials said the virus outbreak is under control in the country and credited a robust surveillance network along with implementation of the lockdown and other containment measures for it.Of the 11 empowered groups formed to suggest measures to ramp up healthcare, put the economy back on track and reduce misery of people once the lockdown is lifted, chairman of Empowered Group One and Niti Ayog member V K Paul said according to their analysis, lockdown has been effective in slowing the rate at which COVID-19 cases is doubling in India, and it now stands at 10 days.“If we go back to March 21, the cases were doubling in around three days. An important turn came on March 23 after the Janata Curfew had happened. The direction changed and the doubling rate increased to five. By then, we had already put in place travel restrictions and had created an environment of social distancing.“There were some disturbances in between and we went back a little. But from April 6, the doubling time started improving,” he said.Paul also said the big decision of imposing the nationwide lockdown taken by the prime minister has “proved to be very timely and beneficial”, as shown by the change in the growth trajectory of India’s COVID-19 cases.“The curve has begun to flatten. Had we not taken the decision of clamping the nationwide lockdown, we would have had around 1 lakh COVID-19 cases by now, as per a reasonable estimate. Now, the outbreak is under control,” the Empowered Group One chairman said. Officials, however, said these projections are based on the growth pattern at a particular time.Director of National Centre for Disease Control S K Singh that surveillance has been the country’s primary weapon in the fight against novel coronavirus. “We started our surveillance mechanism even before the first case was reported in India. This played an important role in helping us contain the spread of the infection,” Singh said.He informed reporters that around 9.45 lakh suspected coronavirus cases are under the surveillance network at present and upon detection of symptoms of the infection, samples are taken from these people for testing.Singh said the surveillance network has been set up at district level as well, so that household survey, quarantine and isolation are done as part of cluster containment plan.Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said in the last 28 days, as many as 15 districts have had no new case, while there are 80 districts in the country that have not reported any new coronavirus case in the last 14 day.He also said in the 24-hour period since Thursday morning, 1,684 COVID 19 positive cases have been reported taking the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 23,077.“A total of 4,748 people, which is 20.57 per cent of the total number of cases, have been cured so far,” Agarwal said.

The officials chairing two out of the 11 empowered groups constituted by the Centre to devise, implement and monitor India’s strategy against the pandemic said that despite expanding the testing net by 24 times, the number of positive coronavirus cases had not risen exponentially. “Our testing strategy has stood the test of time. The volume of testing has been adequate; despite an increase in testing, the proportion of positive cases has not increased. No need to fear of hidden spike in cases, the disease is in control,” said the chairman for the empowered group number 1.Concerns have been raised in the past by experts about India’s strategy of testing symptomatic cases and the threat of a jump in infections through asymptomatic carriers of the disease. The government data shows that a very high percentage of positive people have been found to be asymptomatic, giving rise to such concerns. But the government officials said that their analysis didn’t find any cause for concern.“Since the lockdown, growth in positive cases has not been exponential. During the lockdown period, despite a 24 fold increase in testing, the percentage of positive cases is not rising,” the official quoted above said.He also claimed that surveillance of suspects and clusters and containment zones had played an important role in the containment of the disease. He added that a big behavioural change had been seen in the society which deserved to be credited for the success achieved so far in fighting the disease through social distancing measures.“Besides containing spread, augmenting testing, improving preparedness, the nation has brought about a massive behaviour change through a Jan Andolan,” the chairman for empowered group 1 said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe government has also decided to constitute three more inter-ministerial central teams (IMCT) that will be dispatched to Surat, Ahmedabad in Gujarat, and to Hyderabad and Chennai to evaluate implementation of containment efforts on the ground level.

The total number of ceasefire violations by the neighbouring army stood at 3,168 in 2019 and 1,629 in 2018.The minister, via video conference, asked the commanders from the three services to ensure the operational readiness of their forces while battling the coronavirus disease. The armed forces are an important institutional pillar in the country’s fight against the pandemic and are working on a war footing to deal with Covid-19, including setting up dedicated hospitals, flying medical supplies and operating quarantine facilities.A statement issued by the Defence Ministry said Singh directed the armed forces to spend financial resources judiciously and avoid wastage in view of the economic burden imposed by Covid-19. Stressing on the need to strengthen jointness in the armed forces, Singh asked the top commanders to identify and prioritise tasks that could be accomplished quickly and would assist in revival of the economy after the lockdown is lifted.Those who took part in the video conference included chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, defence secretary Ajay Kumar, secretary (defence finance) Gargi Kaul and commanders-in chief from the three services.The commanders-in-chief briefed the minister on the steps taken by their commands to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among the forces as well as assistance being offered to the local civilian administration to combat the pandemic. The military has taken a string of preventive measures to stop the spread of the disease within its ranks.The statement said that the senior military commanders appreciated the recent devolution of emergency financial powers by the defence ministry to ensure timely procurement of necessary medical supplies and bolster the hospital infrastructure. The commanders said they were ready to pitch in to maintain essential services locally if requested by the civilian administration.Singh was to chair the Unified Commanders Conference (UCC) in Delhi on April 22-23 but the conclave was postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The UCC was to be attended by national security adviser Ajit Doval, chief of defence staff, the three service chiefs and a battery of senior officers of the armed forces and the ministry.The army had earlier indefinitely deferred a conference of its top commanders that was scheduled to take place in Delhi from April 13 to April 18.Such top conferences covers key issues such as the country’s security dynamics, emerging security scenarios, enhancing operational capability, taking steps to stay prepared for all challenges and budgetary aspects. Issues related to theaterisation would have also been discussed but the coronavirus outbreak has put many things on hold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-let-adversary-exploit-covid-19-crisis-rajnath-singh-to-top-military-commanders/story-CWd8I4wCO2pp9wM8Gx4CwK.html
24-04-2020||India||In Centre’s Covid-19 lockdown exit plan, 1 principle and 2 crucial worries||The Centre is leaning towards a calibrated exit from the Covid-19 national lockdown beginning May 3 that would strike a balance between ensuring the pandemic doesn’t flare-up and easing restrictions in order to revive the economy.The government has, from this week, already relaxed restrictions in rural areas to let people harvest crops and work in a select group of industries with access controls and proper protocols.“From May 3, the idea is to expand the list of permitted activities in a way that does not lead to a free-for-all,” a top government official told Hindustan Times. The basic principle is to adopt a step-by-step approach under constant monitoring as the Modi government knows that India is in for a long haul.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“There was a time when the global community including the WHO was worried about how India would be able to control the virus infections and death with experts and armchair strategists predicting a doomsday scenario. We showed the world by pre-empting the virus through strong procedures. We will be able to handle it in future also,”said a senior Union minister of the government.The exit plan is still work in progress and will depend, for one, on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interaction with chief ministers on April 27. In the end, it will be driven by the Centre‘s analysis of how the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen that causes Covid-19 is spreading within states, districts and the thousands of containmenment zones notified across the country closer to May 3.Officials associated with the empowered committees mandated to track the disease and formulate the government’s response said their primary worry at the moment is the spread of the disease in the metro cities, particularly in its slum clusters due to high density of population and lack of social distancing.2 big Covid-19 concernsNearly half of Mumbai’s 930 containment zones are in slum areas such as Mumbai’s Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum cluster.Mumbai ‘s 4,200 cases make up for 18 per cent of the country’s Covid-19 count; 65 percent of Maharashtra’s total of 6,400.In Delhi, officials said, the situation appeared to be largely under control except for some pockets where cases had been reported despite a hard lockdown.There are other emerging hotspots such as Gujarat’s Surat and Ahmedabad, Telangana’s Hyderabad and Tamil Nadu’s Chennai as well that are being tracked closely. On Friday, the government announced that it would send central teams to these four cities to take a closer look at the problem.But the big worry apart from Mumbai is West Bengal’s Kolkata, which, officials insist, was looking at the entire disease control exercise from a political prism. That Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has set up a committee which will decide if a death can be attributed to Covid-19 is being cited as an indicator of its approach.A central team that was in Kolkata to hold discussions with state health officials have also reported non-cooperation from the state authorities, and holes in the claims made by the state. Bengal has reported all of 500 cases.The state government insists that it hadn’t been reporting many cases because it was at the beginning of the Covid-19 curve and had detected its first case only on March 8. But it hasn’t been testing many people. According to data submitted by the state government, Bengal had only conducted 400 tests daily till four days ago which has been raised to 900 tests.Testing CapacityGovernment officials said the Centre’s decision on the lockdown would have to take these facts into account as well as the capacity for testing a larger number of people, particularly given that many people who were asymptomatic had tested positive for the virus.The lockdown exit plan will also take into account the capacity to carry out tests.India’s testing relies at the moment on the RT-PCR process, the most definitive diagnostic test that involves matching the molecular signatures established with the virus.For large-scale testing, particularly as a surveillance tool, the government prefers the antibody rapid tests that give results in minutes, even if it has many imperfections. The government has contracted with Chinese firms to acquire more of these test kits - 6.5 lakh kits had been bought recently - and has decided to buy these kits from South Korean manufacturers too.Exiting Lockdown is complicated Exiting the lockdown has been a tricky part of dealing with Covid-19 for governments across the world.US President Donald Trump, who has been consistently nudging states to reopen as soon as possible, appeared to tweak his stand this week when he disagreed with Georgia’s decision to open movie theatres, nail salons and tattoo parlours.The World Health Organisation has said countries should exit the lockdown in phases. But that isn’t rocket science. Young IAS officers, just a few years in service, had made the same point in a national survey conducted by the government last month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had underscored the same point in his interaction with chief ministers early this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-centre-s-covid-19-lockdown-exit-plan-mumbai-and-kolkata-are-big-worries/story-M5iHWRUmdPWYJpG2yqchsJ.html

24-04-2020||India||Covid-19: In Patna, 25 health workers at multi-specialty hospital sent on home quarantine||At least 25 health workers, including three doctors and 10 nurses, at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), an autonomous multi-specialty hospital in Patna, were sent on 14-day home quarantine on Friday after coming in contact with a multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patient, who had also tested positive for coronavirus.The 30-year-old man from Siwan who was admitted to IGIMS on April 22 evening, tested positive for the virus on Thursday. The hospital authorities immediately referred him to the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), which is a designated Covid-19 special hospital in Patna, hospital officials said.“We are in the process of collecting samples for the Covid-19 test of all our health personnel who came in contact with the patient,” IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said.“The patient, who complained of breathlessness, also had mild fever and cough. Since he was diagnosed with MDR TB, we referred him to the special ward for such patients. Our personnel took the patient’s nasopharyngeal swab sample for a Covid-19 test yesterday and by late evening the patient had tested positive for the virus,” said Dr Mandal.“In keeping with the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), we cleaned, sanitized and sealed our MDR TB ward, which was empty. All doctors, nursing, paramedical and sanitary staff of the MDR ward and those who attended on him in the emergency are being tested for Covid-19 and sent on home quarantine, as per government guidelines,” added Dr Mandal.Earlier, on April 19, a medical officer at the primary health centre (PHC) of Sadar block at Biharsharif in Nalanda district had tested positive for the virus in the first reported case of a doctor being infected in Bihar. The doctor had come in contact with a Covid-19 patient who had returned from the Gulf.“We collected swab samples of over 200 health personnel, including mine, besides sending around 50 PHC personnel on home quarantine, after a doctor there tested positive for the virus,” Nalanda civil surgeon Dr Ram Singh said. None of the samples, taken as part of the doctor’s contact tracing tested positive, he added.Another doctor, pursuing his post graduation (PG) course in medicine at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital (JLNMCH) in Bhagalpur, had tested positive for the virus on April 21. Many junior doctors there are now demanding that they be sent on home quarantine after the hospital authorities collected samples of around 50 medical professionals. JLNMCH superintendent Dr Ram Charitra Mandal did not respond to phone calls.Early this month, six health workers from two private health facilities — three paramedical staff from Sarnam hospital on Bypass Road in Patna, two from Munger’s National Hospital and a private ambulance driver there — had tested positive after coming in contact with Bihar’s first reported fatality to the virus on March 21.Around 83 PG medicos of NMCH had on March 23 sought permission from the medical superintendent for home quarantine, taking the alibi that many among them had developed Covid-19 like symptoms while examining patients at the facility.The demand came a day after Bihar reported its first three cases of the fast-spreading contagion. That was also the period when the state was woefully short of personal protective equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-in-patna-25-health-workers-at-multi-specialty-hospital-sent-on-home-quarantine/story-iw2ADFte3QMJHTwJVLaN0O.html
24-04-2020||India||Govt lists 3 decisions that changed coronavirus’ course in India||The Central government on Friday presented facts and figures to claim that India had succeeded in slowing down the spread of coronavirus to a significant level as seen in the rise of the contagion’s doubling rate--from 3 days at around March 21 to 10 days as of Saturday on April 24-- within a month.The government specifically mentioned three timely decisions—suspension of international flights, implementation of nationwide lockdown and the implementation of testing and quarantining protocol—as landmarks that prevented an exponential growth of coronavirus as seen in the west.The government officials representing two out of 11 empowered groups formed to formulate and monitor the country’s containment efforts said it was important to recognize the success of India’s strategy which was likely to deliver even more positive results which will continue to emerge till mid-May.“On March 21, the total number of positive cases was 300 and the doubling rate was around 3.2 and 3.3 days. After Janta Curfew, around March 23, the direction changed, the doubling rate rose to 5 days. This was perhaps the impact of travel restrictions imposed. Post April 6, the doubling rate consistently went past 5-days and headed towards 10 days. This was the positive impact of the complete lockdown,” said the chairman of empowered group number 1.He said that the lockdown decision has played a major role in saving lives of Indians.“The lockdown decision was a timely decision, it helped us contain the positive cases to around 23,000 as of today, while it could have gone up to 73,000. Curve has begun to flatten. The nation has shown that lockdown has been effective in saving lives, containing the infection and slowing down the doubling rate. We need to build on these gains,” said the chairman. The officials said that apart from blips due to some setbacks, statistics have shown a consistent improvement in the containment of the virus despite the number of increasing infections. Health ministry official Lav Agarwal pointed out that the recovery rate from coronavirus has gone past the 20 per cent mark, marking an important milestone.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19He added that 15 districts in the country have not reported any fresh cases since the last 28 days and three new districts have joined this list, whereas 80 districts in the country have not reported any positive cases in the last 14 days.He said that 1,684 new Covid positive cases were reported since yesterday, taking the total number of positive patients to 23,077. Out of these,17,610 were active cases. The total number of recoveries was at 4,748 including 491 persons who have been declared cured since yesterday.

24-04-2020||India||IATA estimates 47% drop in annual passenger numbers in India in 2020||International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents major world airlines, has estimated that India’s passenger traffic will see negative growth of 47 per cent in 2020 as compared to 2019. IATA said that Indian aviation and related sectors like tourism will suffer 2.93 million job losses, with the number of annual passengers falling to 89.7 million in the country. The latest estimates from IATA indicate a worsening of the country’s impact from the Covid-19 crisis in the Asia Pacific region.Airlines in Asia Pacific will see the largest revenue drop of US $113 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 and a 50% fall in passenger demand in 2020 compared to 2019, IATA estimated.Conrad Clifford, IATA’s ergional vice president (Asia-Pacific) identified India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka and Thailand as priority countries that need to take action. “The situation is deteriorating and airlines are in survival mode. There will be more casualties if governments do not step in urgently to ensure airlines have sufficient cash flow to tide them over this period.,” he said.“Providing support for airlines has a broader economic implication. Jobs across many sectors will be impacted if airlines do not survive the COVID-19 crisis. In Asia-Pacific, 11.2 million jobs are at risk, including those that are dependent on the aviation industry, such as travel and tourism,” Clifford added.While the airlines continue to transport essential goods, after the COVID-19 pandemic is contained, governments will need airlines to support the economic recovery, connect manufacturing hubs and support tourism; due to which the governments need to act urgently now-before it’s too late, IATA stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iata-estimates-47-drop-in-annual-passenger-numbers-in-india-in-2020/story-4j6PL097cbjOGxjnCJQTEK.html
24-04-2020||India||Mystery of India’s lower death rates seems to defy coronavirus trend||Parts of India have recorded dramatic falls in mortality rates after a nationwide lockdown was imposed to fight the new coronavirus, suggesting there has not been an undetected surge in virus-related deaths.All over the world, mortality rates are being scrutinised to determine the true impact of the coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year and is known to have infected more than 2.7 million people globally, with nearly 190,000 deaths.While death rates in some countries have risen sharply in recent weeks, in India the opposite seems to be happening, at least in some places, leaving hospitals, funeral parlours and cremation sites wondering what is going on.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“It’s very surprising for us,” said Shruthi Reddy, chief executive officer of Anthyesti Funeral Services, which operates in of Kolkata and the southern tech hub of Bengaluru.The company handled about five jobs a day in January but has only had about three a day this month.“We’ve declared employee pay cuts if revenue falls below a threshold,” Reddy said.Other numbers tell a similar story.Central Mumbai, home to some 12 million people, saw deaths fall by about 21% in March compared with the same month of 2019, according to municipal data. Overall deaths plummeted 67% in Ahmedabad, the biggest city in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat, over the same period. Data from at least two other cities, along with accounts from state health officials, show a similar pattern. Half a dozen funeral businesses and crematoriums also reported slumps in business, especially in April.“If we’re not seeing an increase in deaths, the suspicion that there may be more COVID-19 fatalities out there is not true,” said Giridhar Babu, professor of epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India.FEWER ACCIDENTSModi imposed a lockdown of India’s 1.3 billion people on March 25 in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected some 23,077 people, killing 718 of them, according to the latest figures.India has tested about 525,000 people, meaning some 4% were positive. In the United Sates, about 18% of tests are positive, according to the COVID Tracking project.India’s apparently lower death rates stands in contrast to what has been seen elsewhere.The Netherlands recorded about 2,000 more deaths than normal in the first week of April, for example, while in Indonesia’s capital of Jakarta the number of funerals rose sharply in March. Some towns in Italy also saw a jump in recorded deaths. Indian doctors, officials and crematorium employees suspect the lower death rate is in large part attributable to fewer road and rail accidents.“Road accident cases, and even patients with alcohol or drug abuse, stroke and heart attacks have been coming in fewer numbers,” said Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma, health minister for Assam.Accidents on India’s chaotic roads killed more than 151,400 people in 2018, according to official data, the world’s highest absolute number. The coronavirus lockdown, which is due to end on May 3, will cut road deaths by at least 15% this year compared with 2018, Paresh Kumar Goel, a director at the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, said. With passenger trains halted, fatalities from all-too-common rail accidents have also plunged. In Mumbai alone, for example, more than half a dozen people typically die every day on the rail network.FEWER MURDERS TOO?Neeraj Kumar, who is in charge of a crematorium on the banks of the holy Ganges river in Uttar Pradesh, said victims of crime were also not being brought in.“We used to get at least 10 accident-related bodies every day and many related to murder cases. But after the lockdown we’re only receiving natural death cases,” Kumar said.The site used to perform up to 30 cremations a day but in the month since March 22, only 43 people had been cremated, Kumar said after leafing through the crematorium’s record book.But the lower rates might also reflect difficulties in reporting deaths during the lockdown, officials said. “There could be an increase when the lockdown ends,” said Dr Bhavin Joshi, a senior health department official with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.Requests for India-wide data from the national registrar went unanswered, while an official at the New Delhi Municipal Council said they could not provide numbers. Reuters was also unable to obtain data for West Bengal, where some doctors have accused the government of understating coronavirus deaths. Only a state-appointed committee is allowed to declare that a patient has died from the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-mystery-of-india-s-lower-death-rates-seems-to-defy-coronavirus-trend/story-cFUg3YGdSk8Cs3gv5dQwQO.html
24-04-2020||India||Telangana hospitals design special menu for Ramadan for fasting Covid-19 patients||With the commencement of the holy month of Ramadan from Saturday, the Telangana government has decided to ensure nutritious meals for hundreds of Muslim patients who have been undergoing treatment for Covid-19 in hospitals, but are keen on observing the fast all through the day.Instructions have been issued to the authorities of Gandhi Hospital, the nodal centre for Covid-19 patients, to see that the Muslim community gets balanced nutritious food for Sehri (the pre-dawn meal) and Iftar (the post-dusk meal), so that they do not face any issues during the course of treatment.According to the tentative menu prepared by the hospital authorities, the fasting Muslims would get roti, plain rice, dal and vegetable curry for Sehri which would be served at around 3.30 am. On alternate days, they would get mutton or chicken curry along with roti, plain rice and vegetable curry for Sehri.After Iftar prayers, the Muslim patients would be served khichdi or flavoured oil rice (bagara rice) or vegetable biryani along with tomato chutney and chicken fry. On alternate days, they would be served chicken biryani, plain rice, vegetable curry, dal and eggs.“The menu has been designed to ensure that the fasting Muslim patients get loads of proteins and carbohydrates to improve immunity and provide energy needed to fight the Covid-19 disease,” a hospital official said.For other Covid-19 patients, too, the hospital authorities have been following a healthy diet chart. Starting with a plate of idli, bread and jam for breakfast, rice, sambar, dal and curd regularly. For non-vegetarians, eggs and chicken curry are also given once a day.All patients are served with a diet that includes a mix of all dry fruits including almonds, cashews and dates. Besides, they are also being given fruits like oranges, sweet lime and bananas for immunity and instant energy.All the patients are provided with only bottled mineral water. Beverages like tea and milk are served twice a day along with Osmania biscuits.Health minister Eatala Rajender said the patients are served with food neatly packed in clean and fresh packets. “We are also providing free WiFi and have allowed our patients to use their mobiles phones so that they can be in touch with their families,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-hospitals-design-special-menu-for-ramadan-for-fasting-covid-19-patients/story-GCG0ncy8hDOoZB1KjkfMrL.html
24-04-2020||India||As Covid-19 count crosses 4k, Mumbai records 1k of them in just 3 days||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases in Mumbai crossed the 4,000-mark on Thursday, as the data shared by the state government’s ministry of health and family welfare showed that 1,100 new cases were added to the tally in only three days.On April 20, Mumbai crossed the 3,000-mark, as the total count climbed to 3,032. The city has recorded 419, 232, and 522 Covid-19 positive cases on April 21, 22, and 23, respectively. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities are facing a big challenge to contain the rapid surge in the number of Covid-19 positive cases. Mumbai breached the 1,000-mark almost a month after an Andheri-based couple became the first to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, from the city. On April 16, Mumbai’s tally crossed 2,000 and since then it has risen to 4,205 as on Thursday evening.Covid-19 related deaths, too, are steadily rising in the city over the past few days. Mumbai recorded 28 fresh deaths over the past three days. The first death related to Covid-19 was reported in the city on March 17 when a 64-year-old man passed away at Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Disease. The toll crossed 100 in 27 days, which has since risen to 167 till Thursday evening. At least 80 people, who have succumbed to Covid-19, are senior citizens.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe civic authorities attributed the rapid surge in the number of Covid-19 positive cases to aggressive testing. “The rate of tests in Mumbai is much higher than Kerala, Karnataka, and Delhi. We’ve also traced around 95,000 contacts of Covid-19 patients and many of them have tested positive,” said Pravin Pardeshi, commissioner, BMC.The civic health department’s data showed that Mumbai has tested 55,000 swab samples, which tops Tamil Nadu (59,000), Gujarat (33,000), Delhi (27,000), and Kerala (21,000).The civic body authorities also screening all senior citizens, especially those who are living in slums. “Senior citizens, who have not tested Covid-19 positive but suffer from co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, are being screened on a door-to-door basis by teams of doctors and accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers. If necessary, doctors will refer some of them to a dispensary in the vicinity for further treatment,” Pardeshi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-count-crosses-4k-mumbai-records-1k-of-them-in-just-3-days/story-1BkUV6O6zxf00ipGaPTYeN.html
24-04-2020||India||Centre’s Covid-19 inspection teams rushed to 3 more states||Central teams to investigate lapses in controlling the coronavirus disease and allegations of coronavirus lockdown violations will be sent to three more states, the government said today amid a bitter row with West Bengal.The three states are Gujarat, Telangana and Tamil Nadu.The ministry of home affairs said the situation is “especially serious” in major hotspot districts or emerging hotspots like Ahmedabad and Surat in Gujarat, Thane in Maharashtra, Hyderabad in Telangana and Chennai in Tamil Nadu.The government said the Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCT) will focus be on a range of issues, including compliance and implementation of lockdown measures as per revised consolidated guidelines, preparedness of health infrastructure, safety of health professionals and conditions of relief camps for labour and poor people.The IMCTs will be headed by additional secretary rank officers and comprise public health and disaster management specialists.Earlier this week, the centre had sent six IMCTs – two each to Maharashtra and West Bengal, and one each to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The Mumbai-Pune central team has been asked to expand its inspection activity to Thane district in Maharashtra as well.Sharing the feedback of the IMCTs sent to Mumbai and Indore this week, MHA official Punya Salila Srivastava said “Indore team has reported that there are 171 containment zones in the city, of which 20 are very critical”.The official added that the team visited the hotspots and they had a detailed discussion with teams involved in contact tracing etc. “The team found that there were adequate testing kits, PPEs, masks and other safety equipment available. Lockdown is being followed properly and safety of Health infrastructure and safety of healthcare workers is being ensured,” Srivastava added.She said that the Indore team also interacted with farmers, disabled, traders, NGOs, medical colleges, migrant labourers in camps, among other stakeholders. The Indore team, Srivastava added, found that government has provided a facility whereby farmers are able to sell their produce at MSP without going to mandis, thereby decongesting them.The Mumbai IMCT went to slums of Dharavi and suggested installation of portable toilets there to augment the number of community toilets as slum-dwellers have to come out to use very few community toilets.Srivastava said that Mumbai team has also suggested to arrange for institutional quarantine for 2,000 - 3,000 people; to increase testing capacity and increase strength of surveillance teams using volunteers. The team also deliberated upon provision of medical facilities for non-Covid patients.In West Bengal, central teams were allowed to visit the containment zones after a warning by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla. The teams had complained to the home ministry that local administration was not cooperating with them. The Trinamool Congress had accused the Centre of targeting states ruled by opposition parties, asking “why no teams were sent to Uttar Pradesh or Gujarat”.Congress leader Ahmed Patel had said a Central team should also be sent to Gujarat and the exercise should not be limited to select states..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-s-covid-19-inspection-teams-rushed-to-3-more-states/story-kvNiOj5CqRZpglwxHcNEiM.html

If we are provided raw material, we can expand our campaign across the state,” said Manu Rawat, a volunteer who is making masks on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-hrd-minister-s-daughter-coordinating-voluntary-facemask-making-drive/story-K8Oz0hxhNHzwZNBo3QpsTK.html
24-04-2020||India||In a first, e-passing out parade held for 42 CRPF officers||New Delhi: The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) conducted an e-passing out parade (e-PoP) for the first time in its history for 42 directly appointed gazetted officers, who joined the ceremony wearing masks and gloves.The newly inducted officers were at the force’s academy at Kadarpur (Gurugram) for the webinar passing out parade held amid the Covid-19 lockdown, and they were addressed by Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy and CRPF director general AP Maheshwari, who were at another location.The directly appointed gazetted officers, including four women, wore face masks and gloves and were administered the oath to serve the country. Later, academy officials pipped the rank of assistant commandant on their shoulders.Maheshwari read out a message from home minister Amit Shah to the officers. In his message, Shah told the officers: “I believe that after your training, you have achieved a certain level of maturity to efficiently deal with the numerous challenges in completing operational tasks and discharging your duties.”He added, “I am confident that the newly appointed officers passing out today will infuse new energy into the CRPF. I would expect that you will provide effective and efficient leadership to the soldiers under your command, by leading from the front.”Shah further said, “I am confident that you will perform your duties with full honesty and devotion, and will be successful in establishing a clean image of yourself. You will enrich the glorious traditions of the force by devoting yourself to maintain the integrity, unity and sovereignty of the country, as per the fame and glory of this force.Assistant commandant is the entry level rank for cadre officers in paramilitary or Central armed police forces, and they head a company of about 100 personnel.These officers, selected by the Union Public Service Commission after an all-India test, have completed a 52-week training course covering field tactics, combat operations, weapons training and legal education.The officers completed their training on March 5. However, their PoP scheduled for March 22 was put on hold due to the pandemic.“Later it was reworked into an e-PoP to enable the young officers to render their valuable service to the people during the ongoing public health crisis,” said the CRPF spokesperson, deputy inspector general Moses Dhinakaran.The officers will stay in the academy during the lockdown until May 3 and will be deployed or posted in units according to necessity arising out of the Coronavirus challenge, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-e-passing-out-parade-held-for-42-crpf-officers/story-MHPOSiwwqFE3b86C8QKtCM.html
24-04-2020||India||These 10 cities are worst hit by Covid-19. Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad among top 5||The number of cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India rose to more than 23,000 on Friday and half of them are in 10 cities of the country.According to the Union health ministry’s dashboard at 8am, India’s Covid-19 tally is now at 23,077 with 17,610 active cases, 4749 people cured or migrated and 718 deaths.The government has classified 170 districts identified as hotspots, or red zones, across the country and most are part of Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad cities.Here is the list of 10 cities with the highest number of Covid-19 cases:MumbaiMaharashtra’s capital remains the worst affected city in the country, which has reported 4205 cases out of the state’s 6427. Mumbai has also recorded 167 out of the state’s 283 deaths.Mumbai’s Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has demarcated 438 neighbourhoods as containment zones, the highest in the country. DelhiThe national capital has the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases in the country with 2376 infected and 50 deaths. The Delhi government has declared 92 areas in the city as containment zones.It is also the second Indian city to record more than 2000 cases. The Union health ministry data shows nearly 63% of the cases in Delhi are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation at Nizammudin held in March.AhmedabadGujarat’s largest city has 1652 Covid-19 cases out of the state’s tally of 2624. The cases are mostly from the congested slums of the old city area, which has left the authorities worried.IndoreThe Madhya Pradesh city has emerged as Covid-19 hotspot with 1029 cases. Two more deaths have been reported in Indore, known as Madhya Pradesh’s commercial capital, taking the tally of deaths to 55. According to the state health department’s bulletin on Thursday evening, Madhya Pradesh has recorded 1687 infections, with smaller districts showing signs of an alarming increase in patients.The numbers are considerably higher given the population of the country’s cleanest at 3.2 million is one-fifth of Delhi’s at 16 million.PunePune is second-worst hit city in Maharashtra after Mumbai with 876 cases and 63 deaths. The first case in the city was recorded when a couple returned from Dubai and tested positive for Covid-19 on March 9.JaipurThe number of confirmed cases in the Rajasthan capital stood at 761 out of the 2008 people infected in the state. Jaipur also accounts for 17 deaths out the 31 fatalities across Rajasthan.Of these, most Covid-19 cases have come from Jaipur’s Ramganj locality. A 45-year-old resident of Ramganj, who returned from Oman on March 12, has been identified as a super spreader. He was asked by health officials to stay in home quarantine but continued to meet people and even offered prayers at a local mosque.He tested positive on March 26 and curfew was imposed in Ramganj, a crowded neighbourhood with a population of nearly 500,000. ThaneIn Thane, 595 people have tested positive for the coronavirus disease or Covid-19.HyderabadThe Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), which includes Hyderabad, has reported 526 out of the 970 confirmed cases in Telangana. Most of the cases detected in Hyderabad are related to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi and located in the old city area, according to the state authorities.ChennaiThe Tamil Nadu capital is the worst hit with 405 Covid-19 cases out of the state’s tally of 1683.AgraAgra has reported 336 cases out of Uttar Pradesh’s 1510 people infected with Sars-Cov-2. The first confirmed cases were reported towards the end of February. The containment measures taken by the district administration were initially lauded but the number of cases has increased in the city of the Taj Mahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-10-cities-are-worst-hit-by-covid-19-mumbai-delhi-ahmedabad-among-top-5/story-QR5ena9FBEoJsFZPRHAjWJ.html

24-04-2020||India||Six coronavirus vaccines in human trials bring hope of early success||Human safety trials of a coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University began on Thursday even as Indian company Serum Institute of India started work on making the vaccine locally so as to be ready in case the trial succeeds.The trial began in Oxford on Thursday, with the first two of 800 healthy volunteers recruited for the study being injected with a new vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 . This is the sixth coronavirus vaccine to enter the first phase of clinical trials, raising hopes of an antidote against the virus that continues to ravage the world.If the trials are a success, scientists hope to have one million doses ready by September, and to dramatically scale up manufacturing after that.Also read: In a first since January, China reports single digit increase in Covid-19 casesPune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has partnered with the Oxford University to manufacture the vaccine in India even as the trial starts. “SII plans to begin manufacturing the ChAdOx1 vaccine in anticipation of the clinical trials in the UK succeeding by September/October. SII will initiate the manufacture at its own risk to jump-start manufacturing and have enough doses available, if the clinical trials work,” said SII CEO Adar Poonawalla.The trial will study whether the new vaccine is safe and can generate strong immune responses against Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and protect healthy people from infection.The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold adenovirus taken from chimps and genetically modified to make it impossible for it to infect humans.To develop the vaccine, researchers added genetic material to ChAdOx1 from the Sars-CoV-2 virus’ surface protein, spike glycoprotein (S), which helps the virus to bind to Ace2 receptors to enter human cells and cause an infection.“This type of vaccine uses recombinant technology where you insert a gene for an important protein of the virus you want to build immunity to, into a weak virus that can safely infect human beings. Here it is the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2 by which it enters cells, into a weak adenovirus. The expectation is that the weak recombinant adenovirus infection will cause antibody development against Sars-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby creating immunity,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology.Also read: Why mystery of India’s lower death rates seems to defy coronavirus trend“The ChAdOx1 vaccine uses a modified adenovirus carrying the coronavirus spike protein like a Trojan horse to enter human cells. The cells start making and releasing spike proteins, and, bingo, the immune system responds,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.The vaccine is safe and well tolerated, but some people may report mild and temporary side effects such as a sore arm at the injection site, headaches or fevers in the first couple of days after vaccination, said researchers. In the study, half of the healthy volunteers, between 18 and 55 years old, will receive the Covid-19 vaccine, and half a control vaccine, which protects against meningitis but not Covid-19.“By vaccinating with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, we are hoping to make the body recognise and develop an immune response to the spike protein that will help stop the Sars-CoV-2 virus from entering human cells and, therefore, prevent infection,” said researchers led by Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group.Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Oxford University, told The Times last week that she was “80% confident” that the vaccine being developed by her team would work.“I think there’s a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine. It’s not just a hunch and as every week goes by we have more data to look at,” she said.The ChAdOx1 vaccine platform has been used to produce vaccine candidates against many viruses, including those causing influenza, chikungunya, and zika. The Oxford group has used it to develop a vaccine against Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) coronavirus, which showed promising results in clinical trials.“Vaccines based on viral vectors offer a high level of protein expression, have long-term stability, and induce strong immune responses in humans, which make them highly effective,” said Dr NK Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research.Vaccine development against Covid-19 has progressed at an unprecedented pace and scale, with 78 projects reaching the active stage of development since China shared the genetic sequence of Sars-CoV-2 with the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020, according to the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), one of the world’s biggest public funders of vaccine development.Like the Oxford Vaccine Group, most developers are leveraging existing work on vaccines against Mers and rapid response platforms with 2019-nCoV genetic sequences inserted to speed up vaccine development. The research focus is on platforms based on nucleotides, which are the building blocks of genetic material, DNA and RNA, because of their potential for speed and flexibility for antigen manipulation.“The Oxford vaccine will be the third CEPI-funded vaccine to enter into phase 1 trials, along with Inovio’s INO-4800 DNA vaccine candidate and Moderna’s mRNA-1273 candidate... Producing a safe, effective, and globally accessible vaccine is our best hope in ending this pandemic. We aim to do this at a speed never before seen in vaccine development,” said Dr Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer, Cepi, in a statement.Cepi has initiated eight Covid-19 vaccine development projects with Curevac, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Moderna, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Queensland, and a consortium led by Institut Pasteur, with a goal of having at least three vaccine candidates submitted to regulatory authorities for licensure for general use.“If an international vaccine trial is successful, its emergency use can be sanctioned globally. If a vaccine trial is well designed and successful anywhere in the world, it can be used as the virus is the same. Some other countries are more suitable for efficacy trials, but no regular trial approval is needed in India following emergency use approval,” said Dr Ganguly.Vaccine development, on an average, takes 10.71 years from the preclinical phase, and has a market entry probability of 6%, according to a study in PLOS One, a peer reviewed scientific journal.Adaptive and parallel vaccine development phases, innovative regulatory processes, and advanced scale up manufacturing capacity have helped fast-track development, which traditionally takes an average of a decade. Even accelerated efforts, such as that for the first Ebola vaccine, took five years.“Our goal is a vaccine before 18 months. Normally, it takes about a decade to develop a vaccine, but global partnerships (between health agencies, academics, donors, industries, nations and philanthropies) have helped hasten development of vaccines against emerging public health threats. A vaccine against Ebola took five years, the one against zika took less than two years. The global effort to develop a Covid-19 vaccine in less than 18 months is unprecedented and would be an amazing achievement,” Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, World Health Organization, told HT on the phone from Geneva.The Oxford scientists are hoping to cut even that optimistic estimate by two-thirds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-coronavirus-vaccines-in-human-trials-bring-hope-of-early-success/story-N3ZcJMi93NeF0puSIAFuvL.html
24-04-2020||India||Bengal IMCT team finds major gaps in state’s Covid-19 preparedness at hospitals||One of the Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) sent to West Bengal to assess the on-ground situation there, after inspection of health care facilities at two hospitals in Kolkata, has found major anomalies like waiting time of five days or more for test results of patients in isolation wards; bodies lying on the beds of the ward for four hours while a death certificate is being prepared and no social distancing maintained at the hospital, increasing the risk of spread of the infection.Apurva Chandra, leader of the IMCT, has written a letter to the West Bengal chief secretary seeking clarification on these observations as well as further details on testing capability of the state government, details of persons who returned to Kolkata from abroad till March 8, etc.Chandra has also sent the team’s observations to the ministry of home affairs.The team visited CNCI (Chitranjan National Cancer Institute) and M R Bangur hospitals in Kolkata, dedicated for Covid-19 patients, on Thursday.In his letter, Chandra has stated that “there were a large number of patients in isolation wards of CNCI as well as Bangur hospital awaiting Covid-19 test results for five days or longer. Specifically at CNCI, there were four patients, since April 16 awaiting test results, two since April 17 and 3 since April 18. Some of the patients have tested negative. It is not clear why the test results should take such a long time and there is a danger of Covid-19 negative patient acquiring the infection in the hospital while awaiting his test result”.The team further observed – “The patient admission at Bangur hospital appears to be chaotic. There was no social distancing in the waiting area. Two patients appear to be in very poor health but there was no medical support available.”About Bangur hospital, it further stated that the patients are referred here from other medical facilities. “However, it seems the patients are left on their own to report to the hospital and are not escorted. This would always leave scope for some patients not turning up or delaying reporting to the hospital.”Subsequently, the team noted that there were only 12 ventilators at Bangur hospital while it caters to 354 serious Covid-19 patients. To this, the hospital authorities informed the team that in case a ventilator is not available and ventilator support is required for a patient, the patient is transferred to some other facilities.On the basis of social media reports that dead bodies were lying on beds in a ward, IMCT enquired about the matter on the spot and found that “it is possible that dead bodies were lying on bed in a ward as it takes at least four hours to issue a death certificate, after which the body is shifted to a mortuary”. The state government has been asked to furnish records in this regard.Based on a presentation given to the IMCT by state’s principal secretary (health) on Thursday, Chandra has asked for details of people who came from abroad to Kolkata till March and whether all those required to be tested have been found negative.On the state government’s claim that number of tests have gone up from around 400 per day to 900 per days in last four days, IMCT has sought details on how many of these are repeat tests and how many are first time patients.West Bengal informed the IMCT that surveillance teams are screening 1.25 lakh to 2 lakh people every day in each district. On this, the central team has sought details of number of screened people actually tested for Covid-19 and found positive. IMCT also observed that from state government’s presentation before it, “it appeared that the state is reaching its peak capacity for testing”. IMCT has suggested that West Bengal should consider having 2,500 to 5,000 tests a day.In a separate letter to the chief secretary West Bengal, IMCT has also asked for details on committee of doctors to declare the cause of death for Covid-19 patients and time taken by the committee in coming to its conclusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-imct-team-finds-major-gaps-in-state-s-covid-19-preparedness-at-hospitals/story-87x2dStccdGz4cyW9zwYhP.html
24-04-2020||India||PM Modi launches Swamitva Yojana to boost rural economy: Here’s all you need to know||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched ‘Swamitva Yojana’ or Ownership Scheme to map residential land ownership in the rural sector using modern technology like the use of drones. The scheme aimed to revolutionise property record maintenance in India was launched on the Panchayati Raj Diwas by the prime minister, who also interacted with members of Gram Panchayats across the country through video conferencing.Here’s everything one needs to know about the ‘Swamitva Yojana’1. Swamitva Yojana is meant to create a record of land ownership in rural areas using modern technology.2. The scheme is piloted by the Panchayati Raj ministry of the Union government and has been launched on April 24 2020, the Panchayati Raj Diwas.3. The need for this Yojana was felt since several villagers in the rural areas don’t have papers proving ownership of their land. In most states, survey and measurement of the populated areas in the villages has not been done for the purpose of attestation/verification of properties.4. Swamitva Yojana is aimed to fill the above gap to provide ownership rights to people in the villages. It is expected to go a long way in settling property rights in rural hinterlands and likely to become a tool for empowerment and entitlement, reducing social strife on account of discord over properties. 5. The residential land in villages will be measured using drones to create a non-disputable record. It is the latest technology for surveying and measuring of land.6. The scheme will be carried out in close coordination with the Central Panchayati Raj ministry, Survey of India, Panchayati Raj departments and Revenue departments of various states.7. Drones will draw a digital map of every property falling within the geographical limits of a village and demarcate the boundaries of every revenue area.8. Property card for every property in the village will be prepared by states using accurate measurements delivered by drone-mapping. These cards will be given to property owners and will be recognised by the land revenue records department.9. The delivery of property rights through an official document will enable villagers to access bank finance using their property as collateral.10. The property records for a village will also be maintained at the Panchayat level, allowing for the collection of associated taxes from the owners. The money generated from these local taxes will be used to build rural infrastructure and facilities.11. Freeing the residential properties including land of title disputes and the creation of an official record is likely to result in appreciation in the market value of the properties.12. The accurate property records can be used for facilitating tax collection, new building and structure plan, issuing of permits and for thwarting attempts at property grabbing||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-swamitva-yojana-launched-by-pm-narendra-modi-all-you-need-to-know/story-UpshkST02eW59ZGsF9jxLK.html
24-04-2020||India||Five migrant workers from Bengal go missing while returning from Odisha||Five migrant workers from three villages in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district have gone missing while they were returning home from Odisha earlier this week.Their families claimed that they talked to the youths for the last time on Tuesday when they were somewhere in Burdwan in Bengal. The police have started a probe.Families of the youths said that around two months ago Rashel Sheikh,18, Bahadur Sheikh,16, Uzir Sheikh, 19, Jiyaur Sheikh,40 and Ashraful Sheikh,42, from Lichutala, Raghunathpur and Hasanpur villages in the Suti police station area went to Odisha.After the lockdown was announced they had no place to live and were not getting any food, the families told the police.Samaun Sheikh, brother of Rashel Sheikh, said “Rashel and the others went to Odisha looking for jobs. They were working as masons and labourers at a construction site. On April 20, they boarded a truck along with 12 others and left for West Bengal.”The truck, said Sheikh, had gone to Odisha to unload potatoes from Burdwan district and the driver agreed to carry the men in exchange for Rs 2000 per head.“At around 10 am on April 21, the driver dropped them off near a bus terminus. My brother said over phone that he and the others were safe. We have not heard from them since then,” said Sheikh.“Rashel and the others had planned to board any vehicle heading for Murshidabad. His phone, as well as those of the other four, are switched off. We are extremely worried.”On Thursday, the families contacted officials at Suti police station.Superintendent of police Jangipur police district, Y Raghuvamshi, said, “We came to know of the incident on Thursday. We are trying to find the missing men.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-migrant-workers-from-bengal-go-missing-while-returning-from-odisha/story-gJP2bRStuHiT749AZUzjIN.html

Modi government must give money in the hands of those dealing with a financial crisis in the times of coronavirus pandemic,” said Surjewala.These remarks come a day after Congress president Sonia Gandhi said that the suggestions she gave to the government on tackling Covid-19 crisis, were only acted upon partially. At a meeting of party’s highest decision-making body, the Congress Working Committee on Thursday, Gandhi said that “large-heartedness and alacrity from the Central Government is conspicuous by its absence”.“I offered our constructive cooperation and suggestions. Unfortunately, they have been acted upon only partially and in a miserly way. The compassion, large-heartedness and alacrity from the central government is conspicuous by its absence,” she added.he also attacked the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for “spreading the virus of communal prejudice and hatred” when the entire nation should be united in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.In a resolution adopted at the meeting, the CWC accused the BJP of seeking to “inflame communal divisions even as the entire nation battles the Covid-19 pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-wasteful-expenditure-like-bullet-trains-focus-on-covid-19-congress-to-centre/story-vo1SvD50YAkdW6v1MbMMIM.html

He also clarified that the kits at the disposal of Indian Council for Medical Research and will be distributed to States, if demanded by them. The court was hearing a petition filed by Nagpur resident CH Sharma over raising concerns about the quality of healthcare provided at four government medical colleges in Vidarbha region. Sharma complained that the four colleges did not have enough medical seats for imparting medical education to students, lacked proper equipment required for taking care of the patients and also for imparting education, the colleges lacked adequate staff, expert teachers and they also suffered from paucity of funds.On March 18, 2020, he moved high court again pointing out that the government medical colleges in Vidarbha were completely ill-equipped to handle Covid-19 patients and create isolation facilities.During the course of hearing on the petition on Thursday, the court was also informed that VRDL laboratories cannot be made operational at Yavatmal and Chandrapur before May 20, for want of infrastructure.Dr. Ajay Kewaliya, Dean of Indira Gandhi Medical College at Nagpur also informed the court that the Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Machines (RT-PCR) required for the laboratories are procured through Haffkine Institute, which in turn imports the machines from Singapore and shipment of the machines is a time consuming process.In this backdrop, justice Sambre directed the authorities concerned that “once the equipment is received and the labs are installed, the operation of the same shall not be withhold for want of testing kits and it shall be the duty of the Competent Authority,o including the State Government,o to make available sufficient number of testing kits for making such labs operational.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-of-rapid-antibody-test-kits-for-covid-19-put-on-hold-centre-tells-hc/story-GWKq6Iz5hN0y8om5g9rkpM.html

Two more deaths have been reported, taking the tally of deaths to 55. However, most of the new cases are either from among those who are already quarantined or hospitalised in Covid-19 care hospitals.”Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Good Governance and Policy Analysis in Bhopal said Madhya Pradesh was in the sixth position on a nationwide tally of Covid-19 patients according to an analysis done on Thursday, and Indore accounted for 58% of all cases in the state.Also, 65% of the dead and 49% of those who recovered were from Indore, the institute said.Jadia said a total of 1,817 teams engaged in surveys and screening have covered about 1.5 million people in Indore so far, and are expected to complete covering the entire city in the “next four days or so”.According to the health department’s bulletin on Thursday evening, Madhya Pradesh has recorded 1,687 infections, with smaller districts showing signs of an alarming increase in patients.There was an increase of 25 patients in Ujjain, talking the tally to 76. Apart from Indore and Ujjain, three districts in the Malwa-Nimad region – Khargone, Khandwa and Dhar – had 51, 35 and 36 patients, respectively, as of Thursday.Other districts where the number of patients is increasing include Jabalpur (30), Raisen (26), Hoshangabad (26), Barwani (24) and Dewas (20).Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said, “The alarming increase in small cities while the state government is not able to control the situation in Indore and Bhopal should set alarm bells ringing in the administration...It needs to undertake measures very fast to control the situation not only in the affected districts but other districts too. As many as 26 districts of the total of 52 have been affected.”In a letter written to secretary of the Union health ministry, a copy of which is available with Hindustan Times, Nidhi and SR Azad, another public health expert, wrote: “Several districts of Madhya Pradesh have shown decreasing number of patients in the past few days, which is not possible until and unless there are inaccurate sample test reports in such cases or there are some administrative issues. This is a serious issue. The Central government must take cognisance of the same.”Additional chief secretary (health) Mohammed Suleman and commissioner (health services) Faiz Ahmad Kidwai couldn’t be reached for comments. Earlier, Suleman had said, “Variations in data come after reconciliation between lab and district data. Repeat samples and rejections need to be factored in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indore-covid-19-cases-cross-1-000-death-toll-at-55/story-dfvXxqycwkVggei9AtPWsN.html

The enquiry began following news reports alleging that the election strategist had been summoned by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee to handle the state government’s response over its tussle with the central government regarding actions taken to tackle coronavirus situation in the state. “We have begun an enquiry and asked the airports to check whether Mr Kishor has in fact defied lockdown orders and attempted to take a flight. Information has been sought from the airports as well,” a senior civil aviation ministry official said requesting anonymity. Denying the allegation, Kishor told Hindustan Times that the reports were false. “I have not been to any airport after March 19. If anyone has any information contrary to this, they must put the details in public domain,” he said. According to sources, Kishor had flown from Kolkata on March 19 after a series of meetings with the state government. The lockdown was announced a few days later. “We have asked airlines who were operating cargo flights to Kolkata and they have denied any involvement,” a senior official at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said.Both International and domestic passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 22 and March 25, respectively. Only cargo flights have been allowed to operate. Thus far, 347 cargo flights have operated since the lockdown.This also comes at a time when the state government and the Centre have been at loggerheads since the extension of the lockdown. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has pulled up the West Bengal government over its handling of the lockdown and the Covid-19 crisis in the state in at least three letters written in the past week. The home ministry had last week shot off a letter to the Bengal government directing it to allow the two interministerial central teams sent to review implementation of lockdown measures in select districts to carry out their duties. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee hired Kishor-led IPAC in June last year after the the Lok Sabha election. The BJP had won 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the states only four less than the TMC’s 22. In July, I-PAC had kicked off its campaign with Mamata Banerjee public outreach campaign – ‘Didi Ke Bolo’ (Tell Didi) with the aim to reach out to at least 80% of the 1.6 crore households in West Bengal over the next 20 months ahead of the 2021 legislative assembly elections in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-prashant-kishor-fly-to-kolkata-during-lockdown-centre-begins-probe/story-yKLYY7LTVHoj7q89zMBi4M.html
24-04-2020||India||Covid-19: HC seeks Centre, Delhi govt response on central air-conditioning||The Delhi high court (HC) on Friday sought the response of the Centre and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government on a plea that urged an alternative arrangement for the use of centrally air-conditioned buildings in the national capital because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.A two-member bench, comprising Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar, issued notices to various authorities, including the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Delhi government among others. The bench said that the concern was vital after advocate KC Mittal, also chairman of the Bar Council of Delhi, moved a plea seeking the constitution of a committee of experts that would examine the problem and suggest technical solutions. The central government’s standing counsel, Ajay Digpaul, who appeared for CPWD, told the HC that guidelines in this regard have been issued on April 22 and the dos and don’ts would be submitted in the court on the next date of hearing.Advocate Sanjoy Ghose, the standing counsel of the Delhi government, submitted an elaborate plan on how the air conditioners could be kept clean. Mittal’s plea said that the centrally air-conditioned buildings inadvertently help the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, or other air/aerosol-borne infections. It sought that directions for adequate precautions be issued for the use of centrally air-conditioned buildings in Delhi to prevent the spread of Covid-19 outbreak.The HC has fixed May 1 as the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-hc-seeks-centre-delhi-govt-response-on-central-acs/story-HukDPxWI5uiXlKSSXXC3XO.html
24-04-2020||India||Good news: These states have zero cases of coronavirus disease Covid-19||Coronavirus disease Covid-19 has wreaked havoc across the globe, and led to thousands of fatalities. In India too, more than 23,000 people are affected by the disease.But, there a still are a few states which are either not affected by the disease, or have cured all the Covid-19 patients. These states are mostly in the Northeast, which has so far successfully managed to tackle the spread pf Sars-CoV-2 virus.Here is the list of those states:Sikkim: Sikkim has not reported any case of Covid-19 so far. The state government has decided to bring back thousands of stranded people, including students and patients, from outside Sikkim once the lockdown is lifted, news agency PTI reported on Thursday. To ensure the state remains free from the infection, the Sikkim government banned on entry of domestic and foreign tourists since the first week of March.Nagaland: The lone Covid-19 patient which surfaced in Nagaland was shifted in Assam, where he is being treated in a hospital. The patient, who is a resident of Dimapur district, will be tested again on April 26. S far, a total of 543 samples out of 607 have tested negative from Nagaland. Results for the remaining 64 are yet to come, news agency PTI reported. All the district headquarter hospitals have been converted to Covid-19 facilities, and the state family welfare department has partnered with the Nagaland Medical Council for providing OPD services at Kohima and Dimapur.Tripura: Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb on Thursday said the state has become free from coronavirus disease Covid-19 after its second patient tested negative. Out of the two Covid-19 patients, the first one - a woman - was released from the isolation ward of a hospital in Agartala on April 16 after she was found negative following consecutive tests. The woman was shifted to a quarantine centre in Gomati district, nearly 50 kilometres away from state capital Agartala.Other notable mentions:There are a few states where the pandemic has not reached at emergency levels. In fact, in these states, the number of infected people is limited to one. These states are Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/good-news-these-states-have-zero-cases-of-coronavirus-disease-covid-19/story-hf0YCHifuEAUgY4hdKTi6K.html
24-04-2020||India||In Bengal Covid-19 crisis, guv Dhankhar and CM Mamata caught in letter wars||Firing another salvo, Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of “abject failure” in dealing with the situation over Covid-19 and appeasing the minority community.This was his second response to Mamata Banerjee’s letter to him on Thursday that accused the governor of violating “constitutional dharma”.“I can figure out that your entire strategy is crafted to deliberately divert people’s attention from your abject failure in combating and containing coronavirus in West Bengal. Your appeasement of the minority community was so explicit and awkward that as regards a question about the Nizamuddin Markaz incident by a journalist, your reaction was “Do not ask communal questions.” This is most unfortunate and cannot be appreciated,” Dhankhar wrote in his letter to the chief minister on Friday.“Ours is the only state where central teams whose only role is affirmative and in aid of the State, are made to face unwholesome scenario. In all other states, it was seamless. Your cover-up “mechanism” would lead to very painful results. Banning of mobile phones inside Isolation Wards is a case in point. Time to reveal the real picture so that our fight against the coronavirus may be enhanced and sharpened,” wrote the governor.The governor was scathing in his appraisal of the chief minister’s actions during the pandemic.“Your communication is part of “alibi strategy”. It emanates from a script that seeks to cover up ‘monumental failures’ in these challenging times by series of ‘blunders’ while people of the state are suffering untold miseries, media is muzzled, health warriors are stressed and there is virtual suspension of human rights of those not belonging to your party. Emasculation of the administration and police has reached pinnacle as a consequence of their politicisation,” he wrote.Banerjee, in her letter, had accused the governor of directly attacking the chief minister and the ministers in her cabinet, holding press conferences against the state government of which he himself is the Constitutional head and alleged that one of Dhankhar’s text messages to her was “unprecedented in tone, tenor and language.”“I firmly disown your accusations,” Dhankhar wrote on Friday, adding that the allegations were “bereft of any factual premise.” Following a series of social media responses from the governor criticising the state government on various grounds, Banerjee had written to Dhankhar, “You appear to have forgotten that I am an elected chief minister of a proud Indian state. You also seem to have forgotten that you are a nominated Governor.” “You may continue to ignore all advice and inputs given by me and my council of ministers (as you appear to have taken upon yourself to do since the day of your appointment), but at least you should not ignore the wise words of Babasaheb Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly,,” Banerjee wrote. Late that night, in his first response to the chief minister, Dhankhar had written, “Your constant refrain of the governor being ‘nominated’ is lamentable and can be ascribed only to elementary ignorance of the Constitution” and that “I need to indicate firmly that there has been total failure at your end all through as regards compliance of constitutional prescriptions.”In his Friday letter, Dhankhar wrote, “There are Constitutional prescriptions for you that mandate discharge of obligations through the Governor. There has been consistency at your end in complete disregard of the same, to my great dismay.”Dhankhar even criticised the way CM Banerjee has been travelling across Kolkata over the past few days and using microphones to urge people to stay indoors.“As an escape route you thought of being in your favourite pastime of being in ‘accusatory mode’ and taking to streets. Let me indicate in times of such gigantic crisis ‘street fighter approach’ is counterproductive and has the potential to spell disaster for the people,” Dhankhar wrote on Friday.“Please ask those who may pick courage to show the mirror- how sagacious is it for CM to take mike and broom day after day in this grim situation. Real time action and effective governance is need of the hour - not theatrics or politicking,” he wrote.This war of words is taking place amid a raging battle between the Centre and the state over the visit of two inter-ministerial central teams. The team for south Bengal is to visit four hotspot districts in the ‘red zone’ and the one for north Bengal is to visit three districts in the ‘orange zone.’The central teams’ arrival in the state initially triggered a controversy with the state government criticising Centre’s decision to send these teams as ‘unilateral’ and ‘undesirable’. However, the state administration started cooperating with the central teams after a strongly worded letter from the Union home ministry. The letter warned the state that obstructing the central team amounted to violation of the Disaster Management Act and orders of the Supreme Court. The teams have started making visits from Wednesday. However, Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, on Thursday too, questioned the Centre’s motive behind sending these teams. He said, “West Bengal stands on 12th position in the country as far as Coronavirus is concerned. Of the 11 states placed above us, Central teams visited only three. I cannot understand the logic behind this. What is the big violation here? We are following all protocols.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bengal-covid-19-crisis-guv-dhankhar-and-cm-mamata-caught-in-letter-wars/story-YFtZzM0VMt2brSif5FpYkK.html

The suspended official identified as Girish Singh Rana, an assistant engineer in irrigation department, was deployed as Covid-19 magistrate by district magistrate (DM) Ashish Chauhan in Chinyalisaur area to ensure home quarantine of the people who return to the district, said officials. Chauhan said the incident happened on April 10 when a family comprising the two children returned to their village from Haryana along with 47 others and were asked to remain in home quarantine as a precautionary measure.“However, it was found that they didn’t follow the home quarantine following which action was directed against them. Covid-19 magistrate concerned Rana was asked to prepare a report of the violators for necessary action,” Chauhan said.Also read: Some poor Uttarakhand students start selling vegetables to help their families financiallyChauhan said Rana inquired about the incident over the phone while making the report on the violators and didn’t visit the villages as per norms. “He didn’t inquire about the age of the violators due to which the names of these two children also came up in the list,” he said. The local revenue police officer booked the 47 people, including the two children, for violating home quarantine and endangering lives of others while four others were booked by regular police for the same offence.Soon, the district administration came to know about it and ordered an inquiry into the incident. “During the inquiry, when the revenue police officer asked Rana about it, he confessed that he had submitted his report after collecting details over phone only and without any ground visit. Considering it as a serious dereliction of duty, I immediately suspended him on April 22 apart from ordering a probe into it,” said Chauhan.Another official privy to the development said on the condition of anonymity, “As the cases against all the 47 people including the two children and their parents were based on that bogus report, the case would be quashed soon.”The district administration has said about 5700 people returned to Uttarkashi during the coronavirus pandemic. They said 2900 of them have completed their surveillance period after home quarantine, 2400 are still under surveillance and about 250 are still under home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-month-old-baby-3-year-old-child-booked-in-uttarakhand-for-not-following-covid-19-quarantine/story-KoCCWEE51ZlDeIGHqruyPK.html
24-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Kejriwal says initial plasma therapy trial outcome promising||Delhi chief minister Arvind Keriwal has urged those who recover from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to donate plasma for those hospitalised with severe infections after the condition of four people treated with the therapy appeared to show an improvement.“The initial results are very promising and I would request those who have recovered from the coronavirus infection to come and donate their plasma. Many of you must have donated blood for dengue – for that too we do not take the blood, only the platelets are taken out and the rest of the blood goes back to your body,” he said.“This is the same thing, we will just take out the plasma. You can save the life of a patient. We will call you for donations, we will arrange transport, and we will ensure you are not harmed in any way,” Kejriwal said.So far, 2,376 people in Delhi have been infected and 50 have died.Last week, Delhi’s biggest facility for treating Covid-19 cases – Lok Nayak Hospital –received permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research and drug regulatory body Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation to conduct a randomised control trial in collaboration with the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.For the treatment, a blood component – plasma – rich in virus fighting antibodies is taken from those who recover from Covid-19 and given to those who have severe infection to help them fight the virus.SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, said: “This therapy is not new, it has been used for several other diseases before. We are conducting a trial for the effectiveness of this treatment in Covid-19 cases.“The trial will include 10 patients who receive the therapy and should be completed within the next 10 or 15 days.”The institute chooses donors and conducts plasmapheresis to derive blood plasma for the treatment.The first patient to receive plasma therapy was a 60-year-old man admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital. He was not on ventilator but had a low oxygen saturation of 85%, a condition that indicates his organs weren’t receiving adequate oxygen. Normal oxygen saturation for healthy individuals is between 95% and 100%.The man’s respiratory rate was high at 30 per minute – meaning he was breathing rapidly. The normal respiratory rate is 12 to 20 breaths a minute in adults.The man was administered plasma therapy on Tuesday. “His respiratory rate has come down to 20 per minute and the oxygen saturation has improved to 98%. The patient is likely to be moved out of the ICU today. And there have been similar improvements in the condition of the other patients who received the therapy. This is promising,” said Kejriwal.Kejriwal said Delhi will apply for wider use of the therapy for all severe patients admitted in the city’s hospitals.“For now, we have permission from the Central government to perform a limited trial only for serious patients in Lok Nayak Hospital. They had asked us for the results of the limited trial to grant permission for the use of the therapy on others. Next week, we will apply for plasma therapy for all serious patients in Delhi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-kejriwal-says-initial-plasma-therapy-results-promising/story-hp9KWFSK6egblF0B3Ynh6O.html

The 62-year-old will be discharged from the hospital after the state medical board gives its permission, said said Pathanamthitta district medical officer (DMO) Dr N Sheeja.“She was tested negative twice. We will discharge her soon,” said the DMO. Doctors treating her heaved a sigh of relief because she was admitted to the hospital 45 days ago. She contracted the disease after she came in contact with a family who returned from Italy.She was admitted to the hospital on March 10 after she came in contact with Italy-returned family which later turned to be super spreaders infecting eight others. Three-member family came to their home in Kerala’s Ranni on February 29 on a three-week leave and attended many functions before testing positive a week later and transmitted the disease to many others.All others, including the 94-year-old grandfather and 88-year-old grandmother of returnees, had left the hospital two weeks back but she remained in the hospital after she testing positive repeatedly.Late onset of the disease like in this case is another worry for overworked health officials. In north Kerala’s Kozhikode a person returned from Dubai on March 18 and turned positive at least 29 days after he was exposed to the virus.The World Health Organization (WHO) had prescribed a 14-day incubation period but Kerala had extended it to 28 days to make it ensure that an asymptomatic person or a concerned patient is disinfected completely. At least eight such cases were reported from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-45-days-in-hospital-and-19-tests-kerala-woman-finally-free-of-covid-19/story-pBdnpiWbWJFaZZEk2U0ucO.html

The group took the train from the national capital to Kolkata on April 13 and reached its destination the next day. Upon arrival, the RPF personnel took a bus to West Bengal’s Kharagpur around 8am. “It is also clarified that these RPF personnel, while undertaking the journey, did not come in contact with any public. There has not been any violation of the guidelines issued for management of Covid-19 by the central government or any state government.“Nonetheless, a fact-finding committee has been constituted to ascertain the circumstances under which some of RPF personnel of the contingent got infected,” the railways ministry said.Derek O’ Brien, a senior leader of West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and a Rajya Sabha member, tweeted: “Getting disturbing news. 9 #RPF personnel test + for #Covid19 in Bengal. 6 in Kharagpur, 1 each Mecheda/Uluberia. They all came to Kolkata from Delhi on 14 April by train. Why were positive patients traveling during #lockdown? WHO SENT THEM ?Screening?How many people did they meet.”The RPF contingent of the South Eastern Railway (SER) first left Kharagpur for Anand Vihar in Delhi on March 19 by train number 12443 with a purpose to collect ammunition, the railways ministry said in a statement on Friday.The contingent arrived at Anand Vihar on March 20.The members stayed at the barracks in Dayabasti, New Delhi, till April 12.“It was decided to run parcel special trains for transportation of essential goods during lockdown. Subsequently, the parcel special trains started from March 31. Since there was scarcity of ammunition with RPF in SER, the ammunition collecting contingent was advised to move by suitable parcel train from Delhi. It is pertinent to note that the on-duty movement of armed forces was exempted from the restrictions imposed during the lockdown,” the railways ministry said. The RPF contingent collected its arms and stock of ammunition on April 12 and proceeded to Howrah Junction from the New Delhi Railway Station on April 13.“Staff posted at en-route stations deboarded from the bus during the road journey. They were quarantined in respective barracks. Rest of the staff with ammunition were taken to Kharagpur. The bus arrived at Kharagpur at 13.30 hrs of 14th April.

Subsequently, he was kept in quarantine in a separate room at an RPF barrack in Balasore, Odisha. He tested positive on April 20, following which the rest of the personnel too were tested, the railways ministry said. Officials aware of the matter said the result of four personnel is still awaited. Railway passenger services have been suspended since March 22 due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.

However, the desert state is on the fourth spot in terms of the number of coronavirus disease cases in the country after Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi.Six districts with more than 100 Covid-19 cases continue to concern and challenge officials of the state health department as they have been classified as hotspots. These are Jaipur with 753 cases, Jodhpur with 310, Kota with 140, Tonk with 115, Bharatpur with 107 and Ajmer with 106 cases. Rajasthan had reported 1000 cases on April 14, taking the Covid-19 tally to 1005, after seeing 520 infections on April 10. It breached the 2000-mark in 10 days but experts say the doubling rate is slowing down, which indicates a flattening of the curve.Out of the 36 new cases, 18 came from Kota, 13 from Jaipur, four from Jhalawar and one from Bharatpur. A person died in the state capital of Jaipur taking the number of fatalities due to Covid-19 to 29 in the state, according to the morning bulletin by the health department.Also read: 2,000 students stranded in Rajasthan amid lockdown plead to Maharashtra govt for helpRohit Kumar Singh, the additional chief secretary with the state’s health department, said the rate of increase in the number of infected has slowed in the state after April 14.Singh said if the Covid-19 cases had increased according to the infection rate in the first phase of the lockdown period then the number of cases would have been 2834. But due to stringent measures taken by the state government, the number of coronavirus disease cases is 2000, he said.The health department and health minister Raghu Sharma have insisted that testing in Rajasthan is being done aggressively and that is the reason the high numbers are being reported. Singh said Rajasthan is among the top states as far as testing is concerned. He said the state is second after Maharashtra in terms of the number of tests done. As of April 24, the state has carried out 69,764 tests.Also read: Rajasthan spends Rs 2,440 on each person in quarantine centresSimultaneously, Singh said, Rajasthan also has one of the lowest mortality rates in the country. The state has a mortality rate of 1.43% with 29 deaths reported so far. Dr Virendra Singh, a member of the Covid-19 advisory board formed by chief minister Ashok Gehlot, said this is a good sign.“If the doubling time is more than seven days then we can say it is an initiation of flattening of the curve.

Earlier this month, Beijing announced setting up two districts to administer islands and reefs of Paracel Islands and the Spratly Islands to strengthen its claim to sovereignty over the area.India tracks South China Sea developmentsThere has been no statement from India on recent developments in the South China Sea. Or Pompeo’s latest statement.But New Delhi has an abiding interest in developments in the region.For one, because about 55 percent of India’s trade passes through the Strait of Malacca, part of the South China Sea.India has, on several occasions, called upon all parties to avoid unilateral action that lead to tensions in the region and called for peaceful resolution of disputes without threat of use of force.Besides, state-run ONGC Videsh is also engaged in oil and gas production in cooperation with Vietnam and is directly impacted by China’s efforts to militarise the South China Sea.Not just PompeoChinese ships have also been accused of intruding in waters near the Japanese-controlled islets last week when four coast guard vessels sailed through the area for about 90 minutes before leaving. China claims the islets and calls them Diaoyu.Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi picked up the phone this Tuesday to lodge a protest for sending government ships into Japanese territorial waters near the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.The Philippines also has filed two diplomatic protests with the Chinese Embassy in Manila over violations of international law and Philippine sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea.Stand-off with MalaysiaThere has been a standoff between Chinese and Malaysian vessels over Kuala Lumpur’s effort to explore energy blocks in its extended continental shelf. Those waters are also claimed by Vietnam and China, which immediately sent ships to shadow the boat.According to news agency Bloomberg, the situation took a turn for the worse on April 16 with the arrival of a Chinese surveyor known as the Haiyang Dizhi 8, which last year was engaged in a standoff with Vietnam over offshore energy blocks.This week, the dispute turned into a five-nation face off involving US and Chinese warships, raising the risk of a direct confrontation as broader tensions grow between the world’s biggest economies, Bloomberg reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-busy-with-covid-19-beijing-pushes-south-china-sea-agenda/story-55XoBGOgPfPHbL6thAmWKM.html

He has been booked under 363, 366, 376, 307 (sections of the Indian Penal Code) and certain sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,” Anil Sharma, the inspector general of police of Sagar zone, said on Thursday evening.Hemant Chauhan, Damoh’s superintendent of police, said, the girl went to a shop in the village to buy some eatables when she was reported missing. Her parents and other family members made a frantic search for the girl whole night and lodged a missing report with Jabera police station on Thursday morning when they could not find her.“The girl was later found in a field outside the village with both her hands tied on her back. There was bleeding from both her eyes…The girl was referred to Bundelkhand Medical College where her condition was stated to be serious,” Chauhan said.“A special investigation team (SIT) has been lodged and an announcement of Rs 10000 made on the arrest of the criminal,” he added.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the rape of the “innocent girl is shameful and unfortunate.”“I have issued instructions for the arrest of the criminal at the earliest.

They were staying at the quarantine centre after the ongoing nationwide lockdown restrictions were initially enforced for 21 days from March 25 and then further extended for another 19 days till May 3 to prevent the spread of Covid-19 outbreak.The drivers’ quarantine period got over on April 14, but they were asked to stay put there, as inter-state transport had stopped because of the ongoing lockdown restrictions.“They were being given food and accommodation. The room had an uninterrupted power supply. However, they escaped late on April 22 night through one of the windows. We came to know the following morning that they broke open a window and beat a hasty retreat,” said Vivek Saravana, superintendent of police (SP), Rayagada district. A case has been filed against the absconding drivers at the district’s Sheskhal police station.The quarantine centre is located close to the railway track on the east coast that goes up to Visakhapatnam in AP. The police suspect that the drivers may have escaped along the railway track.Around 30 migrant labourers, including 15 women and five children, were also found walking along a railway track in Telangana two days ago in a bid to avoid police patrol at an interdistrict check post.The drivers’ escape has come as a fresh headache for the state government, which is planning to quarantine about 7.5 lakh migrant workers who are slated to return home after the lockdown restrictions are lifted on May 3.The government has started a web-based registration facility in which each of the migrants or someone on their behalf would have to register with the necessary details, which will enable them to stay at official quarantine centres that are being set up across over 100 urban local bodies and 7,000 gram panchayats. The government also plans to stamp each of the quarantined people with a spot of indelible ink that is used during elections. Preparations are on to provide adequate food, water, and sanitation facilities at these quarantine facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/19-truck-drivers-escape-quarantine-facility-in-odisha/story-iSBHGuYdtj1svzW6iX2xHK.html

It transferred the FIR in Nagpur to Mumbai where it will be investigated.Watch | Supreme Court grants Arnab Goswami 3-week protection from arrest The bench also ordered Mumbai Police Commissioner to provide security to Goswami and Republic TV office.The FIRs were filed for hate speeches and for defamation of Congress president Sonia Gandhi for remarks made by Goswami during his primetime show on the Hindi language channel of his Republic TV which aired on April 21.Goswami had moved the Supreme Court on Thursday seeking a stay on the FIRs.Goswami hosted a discussion on the Palghar lynching case on his TV channel which, he said in his plea before the Supreme Court, questioned the tardy investigation, inconsistent versions of the authorities and the administration and the state government’s silence on the incident.Three people - two seers and their driver - were killed by mob in Palghar district of Maharashtra on April 16. reportedly in the presence of 10 policemen and forest guards.Goswami accused the Congress, which is part of the government in Maharashtra, of leading a well-coordinated, widespread, vindictive and malicious campaign against him.Goswami claimed that the FIRs registered against him are false and vindictive and have been done by the Congress activists to harass and intimidate him and dissuade him from conducting investigative journalism and bringing the truth before the public“The complaints and FIRs are a part of well-coordinated and malicious campaign by the Congress and its members of instituting false and baseless complaints against the Petitioner before different police stations simultaneously in various parts of the country,” Goswami said in his petition.The complaints and FIRs, Goswami alleged, have been registered with the intention to muzzle free speech under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.The petition, however, does not mention anything about Congress president Sonia Gandhi though some of the FIRs against Goswami are for criminal defamation of Gandhi.Goswami submitted that he has time and again encouraged and used his Republic TV to foster communal harmony, especially in the present critical time of the Covid-19 pandemic.Goswami was attacked on Thursday while he was coming back to his home from office with his wife.

24-04-2020||India||Here are Arnab Goswami’s arguments before the Supreme Court||Arnab Goswami, the editor-in-chief of Republic TV, moved the Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday seeking quashing of the first information reports (FIRs) registered against him in various Congress-ruled states across the country for the offences of hate speech and criminal defamation of party president Sonia Gandhi.Goswami submitted that the FIRs against him are politically motivated and should be quashed. He also prayed that no action should be taken against him on such complaints and FIRs until the case before the SC is decided.He also sought central government security for himself, his family members and his offices in Delhi and Mumbai.A two-member bench of justices, DY Chandrachud and MR Shah, will hear his plea on Friday at 10.30 am.The following are some of the main arguments raised by Goswami in his plea.Republic TV highlighted tardy probe into Palghar lynchingGoswami submitted that the FIRs were filed in connection with a debate aired on R. Bharat -- the Hindi news channel run by Goswami -- highlighting the tardy investigation into the Palghar lynching incident.The lynching occurred on April 16 in Maharashtra’s Palghar district, where three persons, including two Hindu seers, aged 70 and 35 years, were killed by a mob in the presence of 10 policemen and forest guards. Goswami hosted a debate on R. Bharat on the Palghar incident in a news show called ‘Poochta hai Bharat’ on April 21.The thrust of the news show, Goswami submitted, was to question the tardy investigation, inconsistent versions of the authorities and the administration and Maharashtra government’s silence on the incident.Concerted social media campaign and FIRsGoswami claimed that since Maharashtra is ruled by a coalition of the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, there was a well-coordinated, widespread, vindictive and malicious campaign launched by the Congress and its activists against him for telecasting the show on Palghar lynching.“This campaign was carried out online through news reports and tweets. Various members of the Indian National Congress demanded the immediate arrest of the petitioner by using the hashtag trend #ArrestAntiIndiaArnab,” Goswami said.The FIRs were registered against him in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh for offences of hate speech, hurting religious sentiments, promoting enmity between religious groups and criminal defamation. The petition also claimed that Congress members in other states, including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Telangana, have filed complaints against him.FIRs registered at the behest of Congress partyGoswami claimed that the FIRs registered against him are false and vindictive and have been done by the Congress activists to harass and intimidate him and dissuade him from conducting investigative journalism and bringing the truth before the public.“The complaints and FIRs are a part of a well-coordinated and malicious campaign by the Congress and its members of instituting false and baseless complaints against the petitioner before different police stations simultaneously in various parts of the country,” the petition said.However, the petition does not mention anything about Congress president Sonia Gandhi though some of the FIRs against Goswami are for criminal defamation of her.Goswami and wife attackedGoswami claimed that two individuals on a motorcycle waylaid him and his wife on April 23 late evening when they returning home from their office. The attackers claimed to be Congress members when confronted by Goswami’s security officials, the petition said.Goswami filed a complaint at NM Joshi police station in Mumbai shortly after the incident, requesting the authorities to take appropriate action against the attackers.“While the police initially refused to take the petitioner’s complaint, after some persistence, an FIR was registered by the police on April 23 April against unknown persons,” the petition said.Republic TV fosters communal harmonyGoswami submitted that he has time and again encouraged and used Republic TV to foster communal harmony, especially in this critical time of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“In fact, the petitioner has been strongly opposed to any propagation of any communalisation by various other political parties for their own vested interests. It is inconceivable that the broadcast aired on April 21 in relation to the Palghar incident could have incited any communal tension and it is apparent that only one political party is taking offence on the broadcast,” the petition said.Violation of freedom of speech under Article 19The complaints and FIRs, Goswami alleged, have been registered with the intention to muzzle free speech under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.“FIRs ought not to lodged to gag the media and prevent freedom of the press, which is a fundamental right under the Constitution of India,” the petition added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/here-are-arnab-goswami-s-arguments-before-the-supreme-court/story-0D1fuMDfURqtACdX7PANXI.html

24-04-2020||India||Centre must step out of lakshman rekha, announce big-bang stimulus: Amit Mitra||West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra is an economist by both training and practice. A PhD scholar from the Duke University, USA, Mitra is an ardent advocate of developmental economics. In a telephonic interview with Rajeev Jayaswal of Hindustan Times, he says the role of the Centre is to live up to the true spirit of co-operative federalism and take all measures to boost the sagging economy without worrying about breaching the laid-down fiscal deficit glide path in this difficult time of the coronavirus pandemic. Edited excerpts: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slashed India’s economic growth to 1.9% in the current year when the global economy would contract by 3%. What do you suggest to boost the growth?This is an unprecedented situation and the central government should come up with a comprehensive plan to boost the economy — which is a must to check rising unemployment, poverty and hunger. The Centre must announce a package of 6% of GDP as suggested by CM [Mamata Banerjee] to the PM [Narendra Modi]. This is around Rs 10 lakh crore.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Union government and the Reserve Bank of India must come out of their “lakshman rekha” and take bold decisions, not incremental measures. There must be a big-bang announcement. A substantial stimulus is a must, and also possible, because India has headroom to borrow. Compared to many developed countries, India’s debt-to-GDP ratio is less than 70%, while it is 106% for the USA and 240% for Japan. Besides, international oil prices are subdued, which is in favour of a country like India that imports more than 80% of its crude oil requirements. Another source of headroom is India’s large foreign exchange reserves. Also Read: Covid spread, restrictions hit NREGS work allotmentThe Centre must leverage these incidental advantages now and stop worrying about the fiscal deficit at a time when the question is of survival. The government must provide money in the hands of the poor, who are fighting to survive. About Rs 4 lakh crore could be transferred to the states who have the capacity to digitally transfer the requisite money into the bank accounts of the poor. In West Bengal, all disbursements are done digitally, no cheques or cash is used in our treasury. The poor must be provided free ration, as we have done in West Bengal, providing rice and wheat at zero price from ration shops. What about the formal sector?Industry is facing both demand and supply challenges as supply channels have broken down. The stimulus will help in creating demand and provide liquidity in the system. It can even be considered to provide what is internationally done (during such times) — 80% salary of the workers paid (for) by the corporate sector during the lockdown is borne by the government. This will allow the retention of the worker and this human capital can be quickly put on use when the Covid-19 pandemic is over.Also Read: Covid-19 update: BJP calls for new manufacturing policy to revive economyLiquidity crunch is acute, particularly for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). It calls for soft loans for a period of four years with a moratorium on repayments and interest for at least the first year. This will give them the breathing space. Similarly, other formal sectors need calibrated support. Sectors such as aviation, hospitality, tourism, and non-essential retail have been almost crippled due to the lockdown.What is your assessment of the economic growth post Covid-19?It is difficult to predict at this juncture when even developed countries are unable to give any precise answer on when this [Covid-19 pandemic] will end. If the pandemic ends by October...with adequate policy and fiscal stimulations, India could see at best 1% GDP growth (in financial year 2020-21). But if the pandemic continued for longer, it will have a direct impact on GDP, which may even contract, posting a negative growth.Is Centre providing enough financial support to the states, particularly to West Bengal?The Centre is not as responsive as it should have been in an ideal co-operative federalism and at a time when states are fighting against a pandemic. Finance minister [Nirmala Sitharaman] has not replied to any of my letters, though I had one conversation with her. I have written eight letters, highlighting some genuine concerns of states and precarious financial positions they are suffering from. Of course, one or two suggestions have been accepted partially. An ideal co-operative federalism must encourage a culture of dialogue. States are the real implementers of policies and welfare programmes. They must be considered as part and parcel of a united India.Are you referring to the controversy regarding Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) being sent to West Bengal?The Centre’s decision to send two Inter-Ministerial Central Teams to West Bengal was done without consulting the state government. This is a breach of federalist protocol. The Centre’s move was not in the right spirit of co-operative federalism. We are also unable to understand, why particular districts had been chosen. In terms of both number of [Covid-19] cases and the rate of increase, Ahmedabad in Gujarat had far larger numbers of cases and faster rate of increase. But it was not in the Centre’s radar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-must-step-out-of-lakshman-rekha-announce-big-bang-stimulus-amit-mitra/story-3ieJT9nEzGHosJXlF2VGnO.html

This act was a great gesture on your part and I appreciate your exemplary effort,” Thakur said in his appreciation letter.“Your deed is an inspiration to all persons involved in the fight against Covid-19,” the chief minister said.Himachal Pradesh Governor Bandaru Dattatreya, who hails from Hyderabad, also called Reddy and complimented him for his generosity.

After receiving the message, Reddy alerted a police patrolling party which went to Kumar’s house and rushed him to a private hospital in Kukatpally.Doctors told the police that Kumar will have to undergo a surgery immediately, so Reddy paid Rs 20,000 towards the hospital bill and the operation was conducted the next day. Kumar was discharged a day later.Kumar and his family also thanked the inspector for his timely action during a difficult situation.“We won’t forget the help of the inspector in our life.

24-04-2020||India||How Odisha Police is helping people during Covid-19 lockdown||She is eight months into her pregnancy and should have been on maternity leave. Yet, Mamata Mishra, working as assistant sub-inspector in Betnoti police station of Mayurbhanj district of Osidha, has been manning the police station and managing the difficult days alone while her husband, also a sub-inspector, is busy in his duties at a nearby police station.Constable Manorama Satpathy in Sambalpur traffic police station met with an accident two months ago. Despite advised sedentary duty, she has been doing traffic duty on road to ensure enforcement of Covid-19 lockdown.Often vilified for their alleged excesses, policemen in Odisha have turned a new leaf in times of coronavirus pandemic as they go extra mile to help people in the times of their need.Soon after his salary for the month of March was credited, Narendra Kumar Singh, a commandant of the 8th battalion of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) at Maoist-affected Rayagada district called 200 poor villagers living around the camp and gave Rs 500 each. With lockdown stopping all rural livelihood activities in the tribal-dominated district, the people of Kudulima, Jhiliguda, Kukurlima and Sunabandha villages were wondering about their next meal when Singh turned saviour for them.Apart from the cash assistance of Rs 1 lakh, Singh spent another Rs 1 lakh on providing around 6,000 food packets for the villagers in the area. He even got the jawans under him to crowdfund for providing sanitisers, masks and soaps for the tribals.“Since the day lockdown was announced, we have been giving something to the tribal people living in the villages around our camps apart from holding awareness camps on how to remain safe. In the times like these, it is our duty to give back to the society,” said Singh, a native of Palamau district of Jharkhand.In Maoist-affected Bolangir district, the policemen engaged in anti-Maoist activity have taken it upon themselves to feed the poor. Under the supervision of Satyajit Khandelkal, in-charge of the anti-Maoist unit called District Voluntary Force, destitutes, daily wagers and people with disability are being fed in Tureikela block. With contributions by him and other policemen in his team, Khandelkal and other policemen have been giving cooked food to around 400-500 people everyday.“Since last 13 days, we are reaching villages that are normally inaccessible. As we know the areas like back of our hands, it has been relatively easy for us to reach destitutes and old people left alone,” said Khandelkal. Similarly, traffic constable Manjari Biswal in Bolangir town too has been feeding destitutes out of her salary.“I have told my staff that no one should go hungry. These are extraordinary times and the police should do everything that is possible and even spend from their own pocket to help people,” said Bolangir SP Madkar Sandeep Sampad.In Cuttack, police have distributed around 90,000 packets of cooked food and 9,000 packets of dry ration to destitutes, stranded migrant labourers and disabled people through different police stations since the day lockdown was announced. “Our special squad are feeding people without a break for about a month,” said Cuttack deputy commissioner of police Akhileswar Singh.Five days ago, the photo of sub-inspector Barsha Mohanty of Mahila police station in Cuttack feeding a woman on the road had gone viral on social media. In Bhubaneshwar, police allowed a man to transport a dialysis kit to Rourkela relaxing the lockdown norms. Similarly, at Puri railway station, the local unit of Railway Protection Force is giving cooked meals to hundreds of rickshaw pullers, destitutes as well as those who had got stranded due to lockdown since last three week.Though sometimes slammed for their overzealousness in enforcing lockdown, they may have been instrumental in stopping the spread of the Covid-19. The Indian Medical Association (IMA), in a letter to Odisha DGP Abhay last week, said the act of police stopped the spread of the disease. Odisha has one of the lowest ratio of positive cases to samples tested. With 89 positive cases from 15,984 samples, Odisha has a ratio of 0.5, the lowest in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-odisha-police-is-helping-people-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-eQteDvAaA2ZBNnHRAUikjL.html

He was later admitted at GB Pant Hospital here, where he tested negative for the virus on Thursday.State Education Minister and Cabinet Spokesperson, Ratan Lal Nath told a press conference that the patient would undergo another test and he will be released if the report turns out to be negative.Tripura now has 111 coronavirus suspects under surveillance and 227 others have been placed under home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-becomes-coronavirus-free-state-after-2nd-case-tests-negative-cm/story-QVp6NbM4wgxhO6dmGOfwWI.html
24-04-2020||India||Chronic illnesses may put young Indians at higher risk of Covid-19: Study||One in five people globally has a health condition that heightens the risk of severe coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a new working paper has estimated. In India, around 30% of the working age population between 15 and 64 years of age have at least one condition that makes them vulnerable to Covid-19 complications, the paper indicates.In the absence of a vaccine, an option is to shield high-risk people by more intensive physical distancing measures than the rest. “This may be especially important at times and places where health systems risk being overwhelmed by cases,” said the study, which was led by researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and published in Medrxiv, a website for pre-print health research.An estimated 1.7 billion people (22% of the global population) have at least one and 0.4 million have at least two underlying conditions that could increase their risk of severe Covid-19 infections. The prevalence of one or more condition was 10% by age 25 years, 33% by 50 years, and 66% by 70 years, indicating even a large share of younger persons are at risk of co-morbidities. The most prevalent conditions in those more than 50 years old were chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and chronic respiratory disease (CRD).Populations in high income countries are at a greater risk compared to Africa and some other parts of the world, the paper said, with the vulnerable population ranging from 16% in Africa to 28% in North America and 31% in Europe. The highest estimates were in European and other high-income countries with chronic illnesses, according to researchers who used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study and other global studies to arrive at the estimates.Prevalence estimates were extracted by age, sex and country for CVD, CKD, CRD, chronic liver disease, diabetes, cancers, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, chronic neurological disorders, sickle cell disorders, among others.African countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and Island countries Fiji, Guam, Kiribati etc with a high prevalence of diabetes, had a high share (24% with at least one comorbidity that can make Covid-19 severe in Oceania) of the population at increased risk.“Wherever people live longer, the burden of non-communicable disease is higher, which makes them vulnerable to viral infections. In India, there is premature onset of non-communicable diseases, with one in three adults developing hypertension in most cases early and one in 10 have diabetes. So, we have a large number of people who could have severe Covid-19 disease, but what we have seen is 70% to 80% of those who are Covid-19 positive in India have very mild symptoms or are asymptomatic,” said Dr Giridhar R Babu, professor and head, Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.The data in the paper should help create a plan for the elderly and those with early onset comorbidities for the post lockdown period when infections are expected to peak. “They have to be protected, by limiting their movement outdoors, the use of mask, physical distancing etc. They can also get specialised care in hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chronic-illnesses-may-put-young-indians-at-higher-risk-of-covid-19-study/story-3OMRxHwDlDpPfRTGM2bUsJ.html
24-04-2020||India||Delhiwale: The portrait of a successful man||Like most of us, he is staying at home — but he’s away from home at the same time.And this is because he has two homes.“Dilli and Majhiaon are both alike for me,” explains Daya Shankar Singh. In his early 40s, Mr Singh is referring to the city where he came into his own and to the village in Bihar where he was born. And by “Dilli”, he doesn’t mean Delhi but Gurugram, in the National Capital Region, where he has been working as a bookstore assistant since 2005.At the moment, Mr Singh is in his village house, where his family lives. He boarded a train from New Delhi railway station just before the announcement of the nationwide lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “Nobody has the virus in the village,” he says, talking on WhatsApp video. The gentleman’s voice is balmy and hearing him speak plunges one into soothing illusions, as if all wars had ended and the world was at peace. He shows his home through the phone screen that connects him to this reporter. There is his mother, Sukwaro Devi, wife, Lalita Devi, and five children—Anju, Sanju, Raj, Kajal and Usha. Playful Usha is constantly crashing into the screen by rushing behind her father’s back. The walls are decked with posters of gods and goddesses. How can Mr Singh spend most of his time so far from his small children, one might wonder.There is the matter of earning money, of course. “But I have a family in Dilli too.” He is talking of four friends with whom he shares a one-room dwelling in Gurugram’s Chakkarpur village. In fact, Mr Singh says that, to him, the whole of Gurugram looks like his village. “In Gurgaon, I keep bumping into people from my Bihar village or from the neighbouring villages.” Most of these acquaintances, he says, happen to work in the city as security guards, car park attendants and food delivery men. Two of Mr Singh’s roomies also work as guards. He is the only bookstore assistant he knows. “But I also started as a guard”, he says.Years ago, a bookstore owner asked a security guard at duty in the Galleria Market if he could help her find some educated person for her shop. That night, the guard thought for a long time about his own potential. Next morning he went to her shop, still holding on to his lathi (wooden baton), and offered the shop owner his own services. The woman might have been surprised — and unsure. The man was a school drop-out. She took out a book from a shelf and asked him to read the title written in English. “It was Two Lives, by Vikram Seth... I read it immediately,” recalls Mr Singh. He was hired.Now, holed up in his village, Mr Singh feels contended with his life, despite early adversities—“Father died, I couldn’t study beyond class 10th.”He was 26 when he decided to move to Delhi. His wife pleaded him not to leave the village and to stay with her. “I said we have nothing... I have to go.”He took the bus to the nearest railway station in Ara and from there he boarded the Delhi-bound Jan Sadharan Express, a train “that only has general compartment coaches, which are cheap and for which you don’t need previous booking.” It took him 16 hours to reach the Capital. On the way, the only thing he ate was the home-cooked litti that his wife had packed for him in a plastic bag.Over the years, Mr Singh would regularly return home to visit the family “but Delhi too became home.”These days, as the pandemic rages across the world, and as the bookstore in which he works stays closed, Mr Singh is busy growing channa and masoor dal on his little piece of land, which he would rent to other farmers while in Delhi. He has no plans to be a farmer though, he quickly clarifies. “I’m missing the bookshop, missing meeting the customers, talking to them, seeing new things...”He is hopeful that the lockdown will soon be history so that he can return to Delhi. Now he gathers his family to pose for a formal portrait, and he stands among them with the quiet confidence of a successful man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-the-portrait-of-a-successful-man/story-mOct6DN2toSJ1AHAGWIYQO.html

24-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Remittances to India will fall by 23% to $64 billion, the World Bank said on Wednesday, calculating the impact of the coronavirus disease on a vital source of inflow into India and other countries. They grew by 5.5% to $83 billion in 2019. Globally, remittances are expected to decrease 20% in 2020. In low (per capita income less than $1,025) and middle income countries (including both lower middle income countries with per capita incomes between $1,026 and $3,995, and upper middle income countries with per capita incomes between $3,996 and $12,375) they are expected to decline by almost the same proportion, 19.7%.Low and middle income countries (LMICs) receive most of the remittances. In 2019, these stood at around $554 billion of a total of around $710 billion (78%). This year that number will fall to $445 billion (out of a total of $568). The World Bank expects remittances to LMICs to grow 5.6% to around $470 in 2021, but with the trajectory of Covid-19 still unclear, all estimates are just that — estimates. Many countries will tighten their immigration laws in the wake of the pandemic — the US already has — and even those that don’t are unlikely to welcome foreign workers, at least, not until a vaccine is discovered and becomes easily available.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAt 15.16% of all remittances into low and middle income countries (India is a lower middle income country), and almost 12% of all global remittances, India is on top of the list of countries that receive money from workers abroad. At 3.36% of GDP, it’s not as high as it is in some countries, but the $83 billion it received in remittances last year was still higher than the $49 it is estimated to have attracted in foreign direct investment (according to an investment tracker by UNCTAD). According to the World Bank, in 2019, remittances became higher than FDI at an aggregate level for LMICs — highlighting just how important these inflows are.Also Read: US nears 50,000 virus fatalities after 3,176 deaths in 24 hours: Johns HopkinsThe fall in remittances by almost a fourth is more bad news for India, whose economy, like that of most other countries, has been ravaged by the virus as well as by what is universally accepted as the only way to flatten the curve of infections (a lockdown, which significantly impacts economic activity).Is the curve flattening? An optimistic reading of the number of daily cases recorded globally and in the US and the UK (among the worst-affected countries) would seem to suggest so. The number of daily cases in the US on April 22 was 29,973 according to worldometers.info. In the UK, it was 4,451. And across the world, there were 79,956 new cases on April 22. That number is still high, but it is definitely off the peaks seen in the past fortnight. The reason it doesn’t make sense to be optimistic about anything concerning Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is simply this — every time the curve seems to be flattening, the virus finds a new hot spot, or several, which it then proceeds to overrun.Also Read: Chronic illnesses may put young Indians at higher risk of Covid-19: StudyStill, it makes sense to look closely at the numbers. By April 22, the number of Covid-19 infections were 2,639,025. Of this number, 184,263 people have died (which is a lot), and 722,150 have recovered. There are 1,732,612 active cases, but 97% of these (1,674,355) are mild. All data (and the prognosis) are from worldometers.info.Also Read: SVAMITVA, powered by drones in sky, can change lives in rural India | OpinionIn India, the number of cases were 21,367 on April 22. Of this number, 683 people have died and 4,373 have recovered. The number of new cases in the seven days to April 22 (including April 22) were: 1067, 953, 1304, 1598, 1248, 1504, and 1363. All Indian data is from HT’s dashboard. Anecdotally (based on what health ministry officials tell us), very few of the infected people in India are on ventilator support. Most, they add, are asymptomatic, which, along with quarantine, lockdown and pandemic, is an early candidate for 2020’s word of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-4zUYDAt1nBFGo92pCFJEiJ.html
24-04-2020||India||Covid spread, restrictions hit NREGS work allotment||As the Centre prepares to expand the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) to offer a financial cushion to rural India in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, it turns out that the virus is reshaping the distribution of jobs under the flagship jobs programme..Three large states -- Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharasthra -- that account for a large number of Covid-19 patients haven’t yet been able to distribute allot much work under the programme this summer. States such as Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Karnataka that have reported a relatively fewer number of coronavirus cases and have fewer red zones are, meanwhile, off to a roaring start MGNREGS, which offers 100 days of work every year to at least one member of every rural household, is seen as an ideal tool to ease rural distress caused by the coronavirus disease that has forced an exodus of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from the cities back home to the hinterland. Job creation under the programme has been skewed by the burden of disease each state is bearing.Andhra Pradesh alone, according to data updated until Thursday, has accounted for 5.4 million out of 15.6 million persondays of work generated under the programme since April 1. Chhattisgarh has provided 3.3 million  persondays of work and Bihar 1.7 million this month.Karnataka, West Bengal and Odisha have generated 1.4 million, 1.1 million and 800,000 persondays of work, respectively.According to the data, the pandemic has spread to 58.3% of the country’s 731 districts. There are 222 districts with up to 10 cases, 66 with 11-20 cases, 42 with 21-30 cases, and 96 districts with more than 30 cases each.Tougher restrictions and a higher number of containment zones in the three big states -- Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan -- possibly didn’t allow their governments to maximize the MGNREGS opportunities in their states, a government official said on condition of anonymity Rajasthan has generated 480,000 persondays of work while Maharashtra and Gujarat have allocated 260,000 And Gujarat Just 16,859 till date in April, the first month of the financial year.The Centre is confident that once the Covid spread is arrested and the pandemic subsides, these states too will maximise their potential for job creation under the MGNREGS. “We are keeping a daily tab on the work creation and spending of fund in all states. As soon as we see surge in jobs in these three states, we will allot more work,” said a senior official of the rural development ministry.Government data reveals that the average expenditure on an MGNREGS worker has significantly increased in many states in April over last year’s average, indicating that workers are earning more than what they did in the previous year.Experts attributed this to two reasons: higher wages and fewer workers coming to work during the lockdown.Andhra Pradesh has been allotted 10 million additional persondays of work this year than in FY 2019-20. Similarly, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh—home to a large number of migrant workers who have returned—have been given an additional 20 million and 10 million persondays of work, respectively.Kerala, Jharkhand and Telangana have also been allotted an additional 10 million persondays of work each this year, which may be increased depending on demand..Assam has been sanctioned 4.5 million more persondays of work, Odisha 30 million and Tamil Nadu 20 million jobs during FY 2020-21.At the same time, the Centre has possibly factored in the Covid-19 spread in the districts to allot work because tthe three big states—Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat—have not been sanctioned any increase in work allocation under the MGNREGS.Former rural development minister Jugal Kishore Mohapatra maintained that a surge in MGNREGS jobs in the bigger states is just a matter of time. “Gujarat traditionally doesn’t see very high demand for MGNREGS. But in both Rajasthan and Maharashtra, things will pick up. Rajasthan also has very well-laid out work processes and labour standards. The demand will also pick when the harvest season gets over and labourers return to their states,” he said.A rural development ministry official, who requested anonymity, said the situation was still very fluid.“We will allot more money and work as soon as we see states picking up the allocated funds and are able to give more work,” this person said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-spread-restrictionshit-nregs-work-allotment/story-uETvjobPNNbyMle7S5ZKyK.html

The report collating the feedback was submitted on April 10.Gopal Agarwal, the BJP’s spokesman on economic issues who was part of the discussions, said India is poised to take advantage of the global scenario if it works out a new policy to give its manufacturing sector a fillip.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“Many countries across the world are looking for a risk drive divergent strategy. They consider India a good place for their manufacturing companies to shift. What we need now is a new manufacturing policy, because we have already lost some ground to countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam,” he said.Agarwal cited discussions with stakeholders and industry leaders and said the two issues that come up were the need for an immediate fiscal stimulus package and for reviving the manufacturing sector so that global companies find India a ready market.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “There are many bottlenecks that we need to remove. The cost of acquiring land and the legal and procedural delays that come with it is an issue that needs to be resolved. Similarly, we need reforms in the labour sector.

24-04-2020||India||Time will reveal value of India’s lockdown||In early March, my research group projected that by early August, at least 300 million Indians would be infected by the novel coronavirus. That was before there were any lockdowns or domestic travel restrictions. Viruses spread rather predictably – and the scenario we were modeling was rather straightforward, yet terrifying – the spread of a new coronavirus through a completely susceptible population.During the past two decades, our group has published dozens of infectious disease modeling papers in well regarded scientific journals. That did not stop ad hominem attacks by some who did not believe that the infection could spread so widely. What they did not realize was that Covid-19 is unlike influenza, to which there is vaccination available or some degree of population immunity because of past exposure, or HIV/AIDS where it is possible to not get infected by taking personal protection. There was really no easy way to prevent its spread without extreme measures such as lockdowns.We were not alone in projecting a large number of infections. A model published by researchers at the Indian Council of Medical Research predicted that in the absence of a lockdown, 25% of Delhi would be infected. Models from other groups, including Imperial College and the University of Cambridge arrived at similar or even higher estimates. All of these groups were using methods that date back to the earliest compartment models introduced by Daniel Bernoulli in 1776 and that have been remarkably useful at informing public health response, except for diseases like HIV/AIDS where individuals are able to change behaviour and alter the course of a disease in response to its spread.All of these groups were clear that the bulk of infections would be mild or without symptoms. Although the proportion of severe cases would be small, the numbers would be large in India given its large population. The purpose of these projections was to communicate the seriousness of the epidemic both to policymakers and the public and to debunk theories about how Indians were somehow immune to Covid-19.So where are those cases? The hospitals still seem to be relatively empty. Were the projections wrong? This is similar to going to a doctor who tells you that if you keep smoking and don’t exercise you have a high risk of dying young. If you then quit smoking and started going the gym, does that mean that your doctor was wrong?. The lockdown changed the shape of the epidemic significantly not just in India but in every other country. Without enforced distancing measures, Paris, Milan and New York would still be reporting thousands of deaths a day. India was fortunate to have a lockdown early in the epidemic curve so that we never had to witness the kind of trauma that people in these cities had to go through. A recent French study showed that 6% of the population (about 4 million people) had already experienced Covid-19, even though there are only about 120,000 reported cases in that country. In India, unless we are able to test every single patient with Covid-19, a physical impossibility, modelling studies are the only way to study the progress of an epidemic.Fortunately, India has among the lowest reported cases and deaths per capita in the world – the result of early measures to stop flights to China, close borders and impose a lockdown. The lockdown is projected to have pushed the epidemic peak out at least about eight weeks and possibly longer. The peak will also come down by as much as 50% if we diligently practice hand washing, physical distancing, and expanded testing and containment, with periodic restrictive containment measures.Some don’t want lockdowns because of the economic and human costs. But they also don’t want there to be a flood of cases into hospitals. Perhaps they are counting on chloroquine or BCG vaccination to save the day. Unfortunately, Covid-19 cannot be dealt with through wishful thinking.The work of disease modelers, who are generally data scientists and not medical doctors, and generally work far away from the media glare is poorly understood. Models are useful in understanding what would happen without any intervention, but also in anticipating what would happen under various intervention scenarios. They are a validated and systematic way of understanding disease spread using the best of what we know about viruses. Without the benefit of these models, we would not be able to respond effectively. We would not know when to impose restrictions, or how many cases, Intensive Care Unit beds and oxygen cylinders to plan for. Time will reveal the value of India’s lockdown, which was made on the basis of epidemiological projections and science.Ultimately, as Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust recently said – science is the only exit strategy from the Covid-19 pandemic. Now is not the time to replace respect and understanding of scientific expertise with gut feeling, and lessons from WhatsApp University.(Ramanan Laxminarayan is director at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, and a senior research scholar at Princeton University.

24-04-2020||India||SC makes anti-drug law more stringent||A recent Supreme Court ruling has strengthened the ability of the police to tackle the menace of drug peddling across the country.The Court held that henceforth punishment for possession of drugs will not depend on the exact quantity of drug present in a consignment. Rather, traces of an offending drug in the seized mixture will be sufficient to declare the entire quantity to be an offending drug under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act of 1985, the Court said.By this pronouncement, the Court has changed its own ruling delivered 12 years ago. In 2008, a two-judge bench ruled the opposite in the E Michael Raj v Intelligence Bureau, Narcotics Control Bureau case. It said that punishment under NDPS Act will depend on the quantity of offending drug present in a consignment seized by the police. Five grams of heroin would classify as a small quantity while 250 grams of the same contraband would be considered a commercial quantity attracting punishment of up to 20 years in jai. Drug peddlers would sell heroin mixed with caffeine, chalk powder, zinc oxide, to get around the law and escape with minor sentences.Reversing the 2008 decision, the three-judge bench of justices Arun Mishra, Indira Banerjee and MR Shah said, “The problem of drug addicts is international and the [drug] mafia is working throughout the world. It is a crime against society and it has to be dealt with [with] an iron hand. The use of drugs by young people in India has increased. The drugs are being used for weakening the nation.”The Court noted that the NDPS Act was introduced by Parliament with a laudable objective of tackling the drug menace. “The punishment part in drug trafficking is an important one but its preventive part is more important,” ruled the bench. From the Statement of Objects and Reasons and the Preamble of the NDPS, the Court was convinced that the legislature never intended to exclude the quantity of neutral substance.The Court observed that illicit drugs are mostly sold in adulterated form. For instance, caffeine mixed with heroin allows users to take the drug faster. Brown sugar contains 20% heroin, is cheaper but more dangerous. “Therefore, what is harmful or injurious is the entire mixture/tablets with neutral substance and narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Therefore, if it is accepted that it is only the actual content by weight of offending drug which is relevant for the purpose of determining whether it is small quantity or commercial quantity, in that case, the object and purpose of enactment of NDPS Act would be frustrated,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-makes-anti-drug-law-more-stringent/story-URSO4t4hMdwSvPtYndCTXM.html
24-04-2020||India||Spike in demand for NREGS jobs, PDS ration hints at rural distress||Demand for work under the Centre’s rural job guarantee scheme and food from the public distribution system (PDS) has spiked in a signal of economic distress in the Hindi-speaking heartland, where hundreds of thousands of migrant workers have returned since the coronavirus disease lockdown went underway on March 25.In the absence of any real-time data, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and the PDS act as pointers to the state of the rural economy and the living conditions of the marginalised sections. And close to a month after the lockdown was imposed to stop the spread of Covid-19, they present a depressing picture. A grim picture Enrolment for manual work under the MGNREGS, which provides at least 100 days of employment a year to at least one member of every rural household, has risen 10-fold in Rajasthan and Maharashtra, officials said. It has increased up to threefold in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The number of families buying subsidised household rations under the PDS has increased by about 40% in Maharashtra and 20% in Madhya Pradesh, officials in these states said. A clear sign of rural anxiety about what the future holds is the rush of villagers to local panchayat offices for enrolment under the MGNREGS, billed as the world’s biggest job security scheme. “We have not been able to enrol all because there is shortage of staff in panchayat offices,” said a Madhya Pradesh government official, requesting anonymity. In Bihar, an official said the demand for MGNREGS enrolment was not unexpected, given that a large number of migrant workers who have returned from the cities have no money left. “Our government has provided immediate financial relief to all migrant workers as providing work under MGNREGS may not be possible immediately,” said an Odisha government official who requested anonymityThe number of people who have lined up for work across the nation under the job guarantee scheme has increased threefold since April 20, compared to a month ago,said Nikhel Dey, a civil society activist who has been monitoring MGNREGS for more than a decade.Growing enrolments On April 23, MGNREGS had 110.6 million active workers enrolled, compared with 82.3 million a month ago, according to the website of the welfare programme. MGNREGS works resumed only on Monday, and just 1.58 million people have received work under it, or10% of the total people employed in April 2019.Enrolment has surged since migrant workers returning home emerged from a mandatory 14-day quarantine. In Bihar, around 90% of the workers were released over the past one week and in Uttar Pradesh the proportion was about 80%, officials said. Demand for work is set to increase once the harvest is completed by April-end in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. “Considering that there would be huge demand for work, the governments need to enhance capacity fast under MGNREGS to manage demand distress,” Dey said. Rural distressThe higher sales of subsidized foodgrains at rural fair price shops in the states is another proxy for rural distress. In Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the number of households buying PDS rations has risen to 86% and 90%, an increase of 10 to 15 percentage points from March. In poorer states like Jharkhand, governments should ensure that every poor person gets ration irrespective of whether they have a ration card or not, said development economist Jean Dreeze. “Food shortages faced by people, especially families without PDS ration cards, are being reported from across the state. Despite mounting food stocks that are thrice the required amount [77 million tonnes], the central government is yet to universalise the PDS, which is the need of the hour,” he said. Sachin Jain, a member of Right to Food campaign, said: “As the migrant labourers have returned, per-family consumption of food grains has also increased in villages.”A helping handAs many poor have been left out of the National Food Security Act (NFSA), states such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have decided to extend PDS benefits to those who were not enrolled under the PDS. The PDS enrolment was done on the basis of the 2011 socio-economic census and many who became eligible for it after 2011 have not been included, said Dreeze. There are five million such people in Rajasthan and 6.5 million in Madhya Pradesh who have been provided access to rations only now, said Dey.A Central government statement on Thursday said 390.2 million people have received free foodgrains under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana announced last month at a cost of Rs 1.7 trillion.The Centre and state governments have maintained that there is enough food stocks for three months.The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) said on Thursday that the unemployment rate in India had increased to 26.2 % and consumer sentiment had fallen to its lowest level since 2015. A report by the International Labour Organisation said that around 90% or 400 million people working in the informal economy were at risk of falling deeper into poverty during the Covid-19 crisis in India.According to the information provided by the state governments, the problem appears to be more acute in states such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and Jharkhand. In Madhya Pradesh, around 375,000 people have been provided work under MNREGS although over 10 million have enrolled. Additional chief secretary (rural development and panchayati raj) Manoj Shrivastava said, “All panchayats have been asked to immediately start MGNREGS works related to water harvesting and agriculture.” The state has also distributed rations to 11.6 million beneficiaries, including 3.2 million not covered under the PDS.Uttar Pradesh commissioner (rural development) K Ravindra Naik said all districts had been told to provide work under MGNREGS to migrants who had retuned home. “A total 570,000 migrant workers have returned to their homes from various other states following the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown,” he said. Uttar Pradesh has 8.8 million people enrolled under MGNREGS and eight million under PDS. “Our PDS offtake remains equal to the distribution. But in April, it was double since we distributed foodgrains twice and to 323,00 additional beneficiaries that included the MGNREGS job card holders,” commissioner (food and civil supplies) Manish Chauhan said. Chhattisgarh’s panchayat raj minister TS Singhdeo said there has been a sudden rise in enrolment under MGNREGS in last 10 days. “Last year, till April, a similar number of people were enrolled for MGNREGS but this year we expect to provide work to 1.5 million more people under the scheme,” Singhdeo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spike-in-demand-for-nregs-jobs-pds-ration-hints-at-rural-distress/story-kPbdo5FBq64XOSkf4m0Y9L.html
24-04-2020||India||No let-up in ceasefire violations along LoC amid pandemic||Amid the swift spread of the coronavirus disease across the globe, the Pakistan army continues to violate the ceasefire on the Line of Control in an effort to help terrorists sneak into Jammu and Kashmir, two senior officials said on condition of anonymity.Government data reviewed by Hindustan Times shows that the Pakistan army has violated the ceasefire 247 times this month (up to April 22), taking the count of border violations to 1,391 this year so far. Pakistan violated the ceasefire 234 times in April 2019 and 176 times in April 2018.The total number of ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army stood at 3,168 in 2019 and 1,629 in 2018.During a visit to Kashmir last week, Army chief General MM Naravane condemned the relentless ceasefire violations by Pakistan on the LoC, saying the whole world is battling the coronavirus pandemic but the neighbouring country has not stopped stirring trouble at the border.The Indian Army on Monday came out with a fresh set of instructions for soldiers who have completed their leave and temporary duties, and are required to rejoin their units on priority. According to the instructions, soldiers who have been accorded top priority for rejoining duty include all ranks of the operationally-critical Northern Command. The Udhampur-based Northern command is the nerve-centre for counter-insurgency operations in Jammu & Kashmir and is also responsible for guarding the LoC.Pakistan has also violated the ceasefire more times in January-March this year compared to the corresponding periods of the previous two years.Pakistan violated the ceasefire 1,144 times between January and March, with the highest number of violations (411) being recorded last month when Covid-19 cases started peaking globally.Figures show that the Pakistan army violated the cease-fire 685 times in 2019 and 627 times in 2018 in the same period. The army has been dealing with an increase in infiltration attempts by Pakistan-backed terrorists looking to stir trouble in J&K since the Centre’s move revoking the special status of the region on August 5, 2019. Experts said Pakistan was trying its best to reinvigorate the terror machinery in J&K to destabilise the border region.The army on April 10 targeted Pakistani positions across the LoC in Kashmir’s Keran sector with artillery guns and caused severe damage to posts, terror launch pads and an ammunition dump in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The assault was launched in response to an unprovoked ceasefire violation by the Pakistani army days after five commandos belonging to an elite army Special Forces (SF) unit were killed in action along the LoC in the same sector on April 5 during an intense close-quarters battle with an equal number of terrorist infiltrators who were all killed.As reported by Hindustan Times on April 10, Pakistan-based groups have activated their launch pads along the LoC in Kashmir and the International Border (IB) in Jammu in an attempt to send across more than 200 terrorists at a time when the Indian security forces are busy helping the region’s civil administration fight the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-let-up-in-ceasefire-violations-along-loc-amid-pandemic/story-2OiXQwCTxyIzG8t9ItPPkK.html
24-04-2020||India||No meat, no staff: Lucknow’s Tunday Kababi shut in Ramzan||Lucknow’s iconic Tunday Kababi, famous across the world for its melt-in-the-mouth galaouti kababs, will be shut during the holy month of Ramzan starting this week -- perhaps for the first time in the establishment’s 115-year-old history.The non-availability of meat because of the national lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has hit several popular restaurants in the old city; but Tunday Kababi is the most renowned of them all.Click here for live updates on Ramzan“It’s painful for me that I won’t be able to serve the rozedaars (those fasting from sunrise to sunset) and others who are fond of our cuisine during Ramzan. It is for the first time that such a thing has happened in the history of our restaurant,” said Mohammed Usman, the owner of the restaurant that was established in old Lucknow by his grandfather in 1905.The rozedaars have to break their fast at around 7pm, depending on the setting sun, and resume it early the next morning.Usman said that the restaurant has been unable to procure meat because the supply is yet to be restored in the city. “The local sellers are unable to supply us. On regular days, we sell kebabs prepared from around 60kg raw meat, which increases to 100kg during Ramzan. However, there is no availability at the moment,” said Usman.There are two main branches of Tunday. The original one is in Chowk, the second main branch which is own by Mohammed Usman is in Aminabad or Nazirabad, which is the most accessible one in central Lucknow. He own one more branch in Aliganj area. Other than these, the other family members too own branches at Saharaganj Mall, Airport, Gomti Nagar and other areas. Altogether there are around 8 branches in Lucknow. Also Read| Covid-19: Hyderabadis to miss haleem this Ramzan due to ban on iftar partiesOn the secret recipe, Mohammed Usman said it’s a family recipe that has around 116 spices in kababs, which results in its succulent taste. Since the business is divided, so is the recipe.Another problem that Tunday Kababi is facing is the lack of staff, with most going back to their towns and villages in different parts of the state. “The lockdown is concluding on May 3, whereas Ramzan will last till May end. But I don’t think that the meat supply or labour issues will be resolved. So we have just decided to remain shut throughout,” Usman said.District officials were uncertain when the sale of meat sale would be restored, and when restaurants would be allowed to operate. “We haven’t initiated any closures. The meat shops are shut since none of them procured mandatory licenses from FSDA (Food Safety and Drug Administration),” said Mukesh Meshram, Lucknow’s divisional commissioner.Food Safety and Drug Administration (FSDA) is the body that functions under FSSAI to keep checks over the sale of spurious or sub-standard food items. Until 2018, the licensing authority for the meat shops in Lucknow was Municipal Corporation. But in 2018, the power of issuing license was given to FSDA. District officials, however said, none of the shops so far has procured meat selling license from FSDA. “If things improve in the future, restaurants will be allowed to open,” Meshram said.The holy month of Ramzan, which will begin on April 25 or 26 depending on the sighting of the moon, will end on EId-ul-Fitr, which is expected to fall at the end of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-meat-no-staff-tunday-kababi-shut-in-ramzan/story-zuXMW62mpUC7MwLEn1XRuM.html

Read More: No coercive action against Arnab Goswami for 3 weeks, orders Supreme CourtHe has submitted that action against him is an attempt to curb free speech and the Freedom of the Press under Article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution.Earlier on Thursday, Maharashtra Police arrested two people for allegedly attacking Goswami, a day after Congress leaders filed FIRs against the journalist in several states for his comments against party chief Sonia Gandhi on his primetime show. In his complaint, Goswami said his wife and he were attacked by two men on a motorcycle around 12.15 am on Thursday and blamed the Congress. The party, however, has denied all charges.Abhinash Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, said, “Both the accused were arrested immediately with the help of security personnel with Goswami.” In a video, Goswami said he was told by his security guards the attackers were allegedly Youth Congress workers. “Not a single Congressman is involved… this is not our tradition, not our culture,” said party general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal in response to the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arnab-goswami-moves-supreme-court-seeks-stay-on-firs-against-him-in-5-states/story-kRM7LRh6ObWYlTpa4EjG0I.html
24-04-2020||India||Centre, states plan to ban pan masala, spitting at workplaces||In the run up to the partial relaxation of the lockdown enforced to combat Covid-19, so as to allow some key economic activities, especially in non-Covid affected areas, the central and state governments, and various government departments started cracking down on the habit of chewing pan masala and gutka, in public places, but also in the workplace. The focus on this insidious activity -- around 70 million Indians use chewing tobacco , usually mixed with betel nut and other spices, masticating it for hours and spitting out the excess saliva-laden mixture from time to time -- is clearly driven by health concerns. Spit can carry the SARS-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19. In directives to the states or during video conferences, the government has repeatedly advised that a blanket ban be enforced on the use of gutka and pan masala in workplaces. The home ministry went a step further on April 15 when it issued guidelines that said ‘ “spitting in public places shall be punishable with fine” and “there shall be strict ban on sale of liquor, gutka, tobacco, etc and spitting should be strictly prohibited.”Two days later, gutka and pan masala again found a special mention at a video conference with the states to review rural schemes. Chaired by the union rural development secretary, the meeting discussed developing a standard template for each work site that included “no smoking, no tobacco chewing, no spitting” and maintenance of personal hygiene.The repeated mention also drives home the point on the ineffectiveness of state-wide bans on chewing tobacco, announced by some states amost a decade ago (after the Supreme Court issued a directive). Chewable tobacco products, some masquerading as digestive aids or mouth fresheners are available widely, usually in low-priced plastic satchets -- which the users typically discard on the roads. The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh last month banned the production and sale of pan masala and all forms of gutka in India’s most populous state. It also stopped the display and transport of such items.Expertshave hailed the Centre’s directives against gutka and pan masala, and spitting. Dental Council of India president Dr. Dibyendu Mazumdar said, “If swabs are taken from a person’s mouth to test Covid, it gives a clear indication about the presence of virus in one’s mouth and saliva. It is absolutely essential to ensure that people don’t chew pan masala and then spit recklessly making others vulnerable to the virus.”Several papers including a study by the US National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine on April 1 have shown that Covid19 is likely to spread through aerosols.The Parliament secretariat has also emphazised on a no-gutka, no-pan masala policy. An internal circular dated April 17 stated that no officer or employee would be allowed to bring such substances inside the Parliament complex. Officials said that violations could attract severe penalties.According to the National Family Health Survey-2 21% of people over 15 years of age in India consume pan masala or tobacco in any form.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-states-plan-to-ban-pan-masala-spitting-at-workplaces/story-QZ9dAiEHYMxnzqRLOGyHqO.html
24-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Govt considers wage stimulus for MSMEs amid survival battle||The Union government is weighing options for a stimulus to protect wages of workers employed in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as the sector fights a survival battle.As an extended lockdown until May 3 bites industry, smaller businesses are facing an acute shortage of cash. Unsold goods and delayed payments have turned off liquidity taps for the sector, leading to a “complete breakdown”, according to the business lobby Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, or FICCI, which has mooted proposals for support.Labour secretary Heeralal Samariya interacted with business leaders via video-conferencing on Wednesday organized by FICCI, in which he discussed the possibility of a payroll-focused stimulus so that small businesses could retain workers and pay wages. The MSME sector accounts for 28% of India’s gross domestic product and employs 30% of the country’s labour force, making it a significant employer to over 100 million workers.Business leaders told the bureaucrat that the lockdown could deal a crushing blow to a majority of small businesses. According to the All-India Manufacturers’ Association, another business lobby, nearly 70% of small businesses failed to pay wages to workers in March. The government last month allowed small businesses to defer paying Goods and Services Tax from February onwards till June to help improve their cash flows.Disrupted supplies of raw materials, shuttered transport and labour shortages have brought the sector to a standstill and unless the government provided quick relief, many will have to lay off workers, the FICCI said in its proposals for relief measures. Samariya told participants at the videoconference his ministry was looking to also support out-of-work migrant labourers. The labour ministry is collecting data of migrant workers through 20 regional call centres established in coordination with states. Following Wednesday’s consultation, FICCI on Thursday came out with its proposals to support MSMEs. “MSMEs operate on cash and are in need of immediate liquidity to cope in the current circumstances as a majority of these enterprises are micro/small household-run businesses,” the organisation said.“Non-availability of workers, restrictions in the availability of raw materials and transport infrastructure is making matters worse,” it said.FICCI has sought interest- and collateral-free loans for MSME companies with a turnover of less than Rs 500 crore for up to 12 months to enable them to cover fixed costs, salaries and other operational expenses. For non-Good and Services Tax paying companies, an alternate mechanism could be worked out based on income tax filings. Even in usual times, the MSME sector has to negotiate hard business decisions. According to the UK Sinha Expert Committee formed to look into MSMEs, which submitted its report to the Reserve Bank in June last year, unsold inventory and delays in payments were the biggest reason for small businesses defaulting on loans. Small businesses typically take more than 220 days to realise payments, while India’s 30 largest companies take a just a month, according to the committee.MSMEs also have limited access to credit, their share in overall bank credit being just 6.3% compared to 28% of large industries. Softer loans could be given with “pre-conditions that businesses will continue to run and there would be no layoffs of workers and after one year it will be converted into a grant if all conditions are met”, the FICCI said in its proposals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-considers-wage-stimulus-for-msmes/story-Qd7fq2WaA48FLpUSFMauTO.html
24-04-2020||India||House panel backs 30-day salary for retrenched staff||A worker should be entitled to compensation equal to 30-day wages and a reskilling fund if he or she is retrenched but employers should not be liable to pay in case of the closure of an industrial unit, a parliamentary panel has suggested for inclusion in the Industrial Relations Code.The proposed law is one of the four labour reforms aimed at simplifying myriad and archaic labour laws and to make the sector more attractive for investors. Biju Janata Dal lawmaker Bhartruhari Mahtab heads the panel, which has backed the government’s proposal to widen the scope of industrial strikes. The proposal seeks to consider mass casual leaves, which workers worldwide resort to as a form of protest, to be considered as a strike if a majority of the workers take leave on a particular day.“The Committee finds that the words ‘concerted casual leave on a given day be fifty percent or more workers’ have been inserted in the definition of ‘strike’ on the rationale that it not only hampers production but also deteriorates the employer-employee relations. It is a fact that to opt for mass casual leave by the workers is akin to work stoppage and the results are similar to that of a strike,” the panel said in its report. “The definition [of strike] be revisited and suitably reworded so as to give a clear impression that the provision does not intend to infringe the rights of the workers as guaranteed under the Constitution of India.”The panel has circulated its draft report online among its members and sent it to Lok Sabha Speaker’s office via email. It has rejected the demand of the trade unions to insulate general strikes from the mass casual leaves.The panel has supported the plan for a reskilling fund which will be used to train retrenched workers for other disciplines. But it has said that the money for reskilling should not be given directly to workers as it “may defeat the very purpose”.The panel has suggested that instead of the compensation equivalent to 15-day wages, it should be that of a month.“The Committee, however, desires that, as also concurred by the Ministry, the fifteen days wage should be made applicable only in case of retrenchment, as its applicability to closure too would be an unwarranted additional burden on the employer and unfair to him. The Committee further desire that the stipulation of fifteen days wage for retrenchment be enhanced to at least thirty days for the benefit of workers/employees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-backs-30-day-salary-for-retrenched-staff/story-V5cMskPwKYdvduP5GxjKRI.html
24-04-2020||India||Don’t use Covid-19 lockdown rules to harass industry: Centre tells states, UTs||The Union home ministry on Thursday told all states and Union Territories that the revised guidelines related to the extended lockdown period over coronavirus disease (Covid-19) should not be misused to harass the management of any manufacturing or commercial establishment. The government also said that the enforcement of the second phase of the lockdown was “satisfactory” across the country except for a few sporadic incidents and “economic activity had picked up the pace, especially in rural areas”.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said in the letter that there was no clause in April 15’s revised guidelines under which states could take legal action, including the imprisonment of the CEO of a company, or the sealing or closure of a factory for two days in case a Covid-19-positive employee was found. The letter said that these apprehensions were “based on wrong interpretation of the guidelines”.“I would like to clarify that there is no such clause in the consolidated revised guidelines and therefore there is no basis for such misplaced apprehensions,” Bhalla’s letter read.Several companies had raised concerns regarding penal action they were likely to face over restarting activities. They also asked the government if they had to take fresh permissions or licences to begin work.Bhalla clarified that “the consolidated revised guidelines do not curtail the exemptions already provided earlier, unless the exempted activity falls within a containment zone. Therefore no fresh/separate permissions are required from authorities for industries already permitted to operate prior to April 15, 2020, in areas falling outside containment zones”.“Finally, it is emphasized that subject to compliance of standard operating procedure (SOP) on social distancing, no fresh license or statutory approval is required for resumption of permitted activities during the lockdown period. For example, an industry activity, allowed to operate prior to lockdown, needs no fresh approval, once it has been included as a permitted activity under the consolidated revised guidelines, and has complied with the SOP on social distancing,” he added.The home secretary asked states to inform their industrial field establishments and field offices, and that guidelines should not be misused to harass the management of any industry.Earlier in the day, Bhalla and secretary of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Guruprasad Mohapatra, reviewed the measures to “speed up” economic and industrial activities via a video-conference with the industry associations.During the daily news briefing, home ministry joint secretary Punya Salila Srivastava said that the video-conference was held between representatives of the associations and the two secretaries about industrial activities since April 20, when the government announced conditional easing of lockdown restrictions to revive economy activity. Feedback has been sought from industrial units and problems, if any, will be resolved soon, she added.Road construction, brick kilns and cement manufacturing-related works have started in rural areas, Srivastava said. “Till April 22, over 1.5 crore workdays have been achieved under the MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act),” she added. The state governments are working to operationalise industrial units in non-hot spot zones as the central government has given permission for exempting many essential services from April 20, the joint secretary said. Food processing units, milk and bread processing factories, flour, and pulses mills have been exempted, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-use-lockdown-rules-to-harass-industry-centre-tells-states-uts/story-2sVrDbD2lwhv5IR9K3CNKO.html
24-04-2020||India||ICMR to continue restricted use of HCQ amid doubts||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will continue restricted use of the anti-malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), to treat ICU patients as part of its demonstration study even after a US study found it brought no benefit to 368 people with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “We are generating our own data, and will take a decision, according to our own results. The study to check its therapeutic use will take about 2-2.5 months to complete which should provide us the evidence against or for it. It will be too premature to say anything at this stage even though we are closely looking at all the data coming from other countries,” said an official in the ICMR, who did not wish to be identified.In the US study that came on April 16, the researchers analysed medical records of 368 hospitalised patients with confirmed coronavirus infection at Veterans Health Administration medical centres. About 28%, who were given HCQ in addition to the usual care died, versus 11% of those getting routine care alone. The drug made no difference in the need for a breathing machine, either, according to the study.However, Switzerland-based drug maker Novartis announced a few days ago that it had reached an agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration to carry out a Phase III trial assessing HCQ as a treatment for hospitalised Covid-19 patients, for which it will be recruiting about 440 patients in at least a dozen sites in the US.In India, the central drugs controller towards the end of March had approved the use of HCQ under the “restricted use” category, primarily for the studies that ICMR wanted to carry out.The ICMR has said that it is conducting a two-arm study on the prophylactic (prevention) and therapeutic (treatment) effects of HCQ against covid-19.As prophylactic, the drug has been recommended for asymptomatic health care workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19, and, as therapeutic medicine, it is being given to critically ill Covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) to see if their dependency on oxygen support is reduced.The therapeutic study is being done in a cohort of 480 Covid-19 patients.In India, around 2% of Covid-19 cases need critical care in ICUs, according to the health ministry.In prophylactic cases, the drug is recommended to be taken under strict medical supervision, considering all contraindications.The dosage given to people in India is 400mg, twice a day, for one day, and subsequently 400mg once a week. The course is recommended for seven weeks for prophylactics. In case of treatment it, is being given in combination with the antibiotic, azithromycin.“In positive patients, the medicine has shown to reduce the viral load, and our aim is to see whether it will prevent infection or not,” Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar had said earlier.While results from the treatment cohort will take time, the initial data collected from reactions found in health care workers showed two primary complains: abdominal pain in about 10% of those who took the medicine; and nausea in about 6% of them. “If the results aren’t satisfactory, the drug will be withdrawn, like it was previously done with HIV/AIDS antiviral drugs, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, which did not show much benefit,” the ICMR official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-to-continue-restricted-use-of-hcq-amid-doubts/story-6MsYgm3wA2n9MygkjuWpGJ.html
24-04-2020||India||India staring at ‘sombre economic situation’, needs major stimulus: Finance panel||India is staring at a “sombre economic situation”; it needs to lift the lockdown to kick-start economic activities, and it needs a major stimulus, several members of the economic advisory council of the finance commission (FC) argued at a two-day virtual conference on Thursday, according to two officials familiar with the proceedings of the meeting. The meeting, chaired by the head of the 15th FC, NK Singh, was attended by several prominent economists, including Sajid Chinoy, Prachi Mishra, Omkar Goswami and Neelkanth Mishra. The meeting of the FC came in the backdrop of a series of consultations the government is having to assess the economic fallout of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown to contain its spread, and the measures that can be adopted to tackle the distress. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a long brainstorming session with economists, where Niti Ayog’s vice-chairman, Rajiv Kumar, and chief executive officer, Amitabh Kant, made presentations. In the FC meeting on Thursday, experts first pointed to the deep structural crisis confronting the economy. According to the first official present in the meeting, economist Omkar Goswami said that the current crisis was worse than the Great Depression. Goswami, however, refused to officially comment on the closed-door meeting. Two other economists termed the situation “sombre”. A second official said that the economists painted a bleak picture of the impact of the lockdown, and said that it would not only impact the growth trajectory in this financial year (2020-21), but the next one — and a turnaround was only possible by the end of next year partially, and in 2022, more substantially. The crisis facing the medium, micro and small enterprises figured as a key concern in the meeting. Among specific suggestions, Goswami said that small industries with an investment of less than ₹50 lakh must be provided assistance. While this was supported by others, chairman Singh asked what would be the vehicle of this financial assistance, according to the first official quoted above.Singh did not comment on the meeting and his office said that he would be addressing a press conference after the conclusion of the two-day consultation on Friday. The meeting also considered the appropriate size of the stimulus. Critics have pointed out what while countries such as the United States have announced stimulus packages of up to 10% of their GDP, India’s relief package so far — of ₹1.7 lakh crore — is less than a percentage of its GDP. Industry bodies have demanded a stimulus package ranging between ₹14-16 lakh crore, while some economists have even called for a ₹20 lakh crore package. “There are all these figures that industry is suggesting as a stimulus package. Someone says 5% of the GDP and someone says 7%. But the key question is the composition of this package and how you are going to spend that money,’’ said the first official. Deliberations on matters such as these have, according to him, led to a possible delay in the government’s announcement. The timing of the package was also discussed in the meeting. Economist Neelkanth Mishra said that the stimulus package should be given once the lockdown is lifted, since this was when businesses would need it the most to resume activities, according to the second official quoted above. Economists emphasised that the government had to play a major role in jump-starting the economy, with more investment in programmes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. On Friday, economists Arvind Virmani, Indira Rajaraman, M Govinda Rao, Sudipto Mundle, DK Shrivastava and chief economic adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian are expected to attend the meeting and present their views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economy-needs-a-major-stimulus-finance-panel/story-khSCPZRiAEdtiV3cQyUXMP.html
24-04-2020||Editorials||Towards a more insular world | HT Editorial||A combination of pandemic-induced recession globally and travel restrictions, says a World Bank report, will see India’s remittances fall by nearly a quarter next year. Given that the bulk of remittances come from the Persian Gulf — which is also seeing the impact of the crash in oil prices — India will become more vulnerable. The fate of the highly-skilled worker will also be under question if the United States’ (US) temporary block on immigrants is extended to H-1B visas. It is no surprise that a virus — which requires social distancing, has stopped air travel and caused enormous demand destruction — would have a disproportionate impact on migration. This year will also see a large drop in cross-border student movement as the academic calendar gets disrupted. The pandemic has greatly accelerated anti-migration trends already developing thanks to a slowing global economy and nativist politics. The Persian Gulf and the US remained among the few destinations where Indian migration numbers were still growing. That is now unlikely to continue. Overseas migration benefits India in three broad ways: Capital, social release and knowledge. When it comes to the first, the predicted fall in Gulf remittances will partially offset the gains to the balance of payments (BoP) offered by lower oil prices. North America provides another substantial segment of India’s remittances but as immigrants there are more middle-class, these remittances are less likely to fall. Gulf remittances, while remaining an important foreign exchange buffer, have been declining in importance to India’s overall BoP. The region was arguably more useful because it provided badly-needed jobs for working-class Indians, initially from Kerala, but increasingly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. This will be a much-reduced safety valve. The role of the diaspora in the West in funnelling know-how to India is under-appreciated. This should be the least affected as knowledge and its business applications can temporarily be managed online. The flow of students will also resume at some point. But it is now inevitable that migration will be much reduced. New Delhi may have to leverage its geopolitical influence with the Gulf emirates. It should also contemplate including migration in its trade and investment agreements and working out health certification protocols for Indian travellers. A mitigation strategy is in line for one of the world’s largest labour-exporting nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/towards-a-more-insular-world-ht-editorial/story-sDfI9RjTDyPYrXPO5OWcKI.html
