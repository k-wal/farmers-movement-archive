27-04-2020||News||India should enforce media regulation on big tech||Are leading Internet firms such as Facebook, Twitter and Google, as operators of social media platforms, publishers of editorialised content (much like the Hindustan Times is), or are they indiscriminate platforms that offer open access to anything that you might wish to see?The debate sounds nerdy at first — a sort of philosophical enquiry that should only concern professors and legal scholars as a matter of business regulation. But this seemingly narrow intellectual question is increasingly becoming a central matter of urgent concern in the context of Indian democracy — and, indeed, democracy and the free flow of information around the world. Foreign governments are moving to impose new responsibilities on dominant tech firms. Australia, for instance, is forcing Facebook and Google to pay news companies for displaying their stories; French antitrust officials have ordered Google to negotiate with local media firms to pay for displaying their content; and in the United States, a fierce political war rages on between liberals and conservatives on this very issue.Let’s go back to that philosophical question for a moment, though. Publishers have always held a vaunted position in society. Traditional media formats — daily newspapers, broadcast television networks and radio stations — once consumed the public’s attention. My grandfather would comb through newspapers and news magazines every day, while my grandmother listened to the radio all day, every day — not uncommon for those of their generation. The result was that we came to know not only the voices and faces that graced these outlets, but the publishing houses and media personalities behind the businesses. This intense aura about the media ecosystem — a world that could make someone famous — gave news organisations great power. They had the power to convey the news — and with that power, came great responsibility.As with any line of business, news organisations cannot be expected to necessarily and voluntarily demonstrate that responsibility — by, for instance, not spreading political falsehoods, hateful messaging, and other vitriol. To put it differently: Absent meaningful regulation, businesses operating in a free market economy, including media outlets, will do whatever they wish to maximise shareholder returns. Profit displaces social considerations. So to ensure they would act responsibly, the government created a policy framework. In India, the contours of media regulation have become sophisticatedly diverse, with laws such as the Press Council Act, 1978, the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, the Newspaper (Price and Page) Act, 1956, and the Cinematograph Act, 1952. To quote from an example, the last of these — a reform of the Indian film industry enacted 70 years ago — notes that a “film shall not be certified for public exhibition if, in the opinion of the authority competent to grant the certificate, the film or any part of it is against the interests of 1 (the sovereignty and integrity of India) the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or involves defamation or contempt of court or is likely to incite the commission of any offence.” Without the law, the government couldn’t be sure that an intrepid director might just slip offending content into mass-market films every now and then.Some might argue that Facebook and Google should be treated like publishers, too; they now dominate the media sector in India and often facilitate the dissemination of offending content. They have, until now, been regarded as open platforms, which allow any and all speech (different kinds of views/all shades of opinion) but can remove whatever they wish — a conceptualisation originally stemming from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 US law that simultaneously affirms that Internet companies won’t “be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information” and won’t “be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material”. The idea was simple: Let the Internet grow and develop its own commercial standards as necessary.Here is the problem. This benevolent regulatory framework has enabled Facebook to claim it acts as a publisher and reap the censorship rights thereof, but turn around and also claim it is an undiscerning platform to reap the benefits of free speech leniency. A more just regime might, instead of giving the firm a free pass on both ends, hold its feet to the fire on both counts. There can be no doubt the company acts as some novel form of entity in between; even the company’s lawyers have suggested that the company possesses a “quintessential publisher function” over the “protected” practice of determining “what to publish and the decision of what not to publish” — while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also contended the company “should err on the side of greater expression.”So, if it is true that Internet firms have editorial power — and it is, so long as they decide what specific news stories, search results, and social media posts to show us among the billions of possibilities — then let us treat them as such. The responsibility must now lie with the national government to do right by its citizens — many of whom have been targeted, misled, and pilloried, which has been enabled by Internet platforms. The time has come for the imposition of decency in exchange for continued participation in the Indian consumer market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-should-enforce-media-regulation-on-big-tech/story-gJJrXzbhDKWLj70g73gNoL.html
27-04-2020||News||India must stick to its strategic orientation||India has completed one month of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-triggered national lockdown and the scale of the socioeconomic disruption and human deprivation has been considerable. Millions are now destitute. The quantum and quality of the damage and mayhem that will ensue before closure/success can be declared is yet to be estimated. Thus, any reference to a post-Covid-19 world will be more of in the form of an aspiration and one can only hope that the pandemic subsides soon.However, the impact of the pandemic on politics — both domestic and global — has been the subject of animated discussion and various formulations have been advanced. It is akin to the five blind men and the elephant but in this case, the contour of the pachyderm (virus) is insidiously dynamic. One school avers that this is the beginning of the end of globalisation and multilateralism and that the world has entered a period of extended confrontation. Exhibit A to prove this point is the current United States (US)-China tension and the acrimonious exchanges between Washington and Beijing.The extension of this formulation is that cooperation, to the extent it obtained in post-9/11 global geopolitics, is now a thing of the past and bipolarity is back (US-China), and may soon turn into a Sinicised world where China overtakes the US to become the world’s number one in GDP. In the pre-Covid-19 period, this date was assumed to be around 2030. Does this mean Chinese unipolarity is on the anvil? Unlikely. Such binaries are invalid in the current Covid-19-triggered turbulence.In an earlier context (2012), while envisioning global trends in 2030, I had advanced the proposition that the US-led international order was under stress. This was illustrated in the trade dependencies engendered by globalisation and the strategic-security dissonance among the major powers — the more visible manifestations of this were the US-China; China-Japan; and India-China rifts. Thus, it was assumed that the emerging global geopolitical landscape in 2030 would probably be a contra-polar world, wherein managing contradictory policy pursuits and contrarian impulses would be the norm — barring any black swan events.The coronavirus pandemic is that black swan event. The question now is whether polarity itself is a valid referent in the current geopolitical and strategic flux. The direct impact on human security due to the pandemic has been high and there have been over 200,000 deaths globally. Among the major powers, the US, the Eurozone and China, where the virus originated, have witnessed fatalities in the thousands and this number may grow.Consequently, the domestic politics of these nations will see a significant churn driven by emotive nationalism. The shrill focus on this issue in the US election campaign is a case in point. China, the European Union, Russia and Japan will follow a similar trajectory, where the credibility of the current leadership will be on the test.India is no exception and managing the pandemic and its fallout will be the single most complex challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The macroeconomic scene is grim and experts aver the Indian economy will shrink in 2020, before recovering in 2021.However, one macro-economic trend is unlikely to change. In a pre-Covid-19 world, it was the received wisdom that by 2030, the single State global GDP hierarchy would be China, the US and India. Despite the economic downturn that will unfold due to the pandemic, the resultant GDP matrix post-Covid-19 will be the same, all other factors being normal. This means India, notwithstanding current challenges, will be in the top tier of the global economy.Thus, despite the current turbulence and negative sentiment about China in particular, the more prudent strategic orientation for India will be to create the necessary politico-diplomatic and economic space to remain engaged with the major powers and trading blocs, however insular they may become in the short-term.India’s immediate priority is to manage the pandemic and save its more vulnerable citizens. The long-term strategic objective remains the same — the elimination of mass poverty and ensuring a more equitable distribution of its prosperity, while remaining committed to the liberal democratic path.Hence the review and recalibration of India’s strategic orientation must correspond with the realisation of these objectives — the immediate in relation to saving the lives of its citizens affected by the pandemic; and the long-term improvement of human security indicators. This is what Chanakya identified as yogakshema (well-being) for 1.3 billion people.India’s external orientation after the end of the Cold War has been to remain engaged with all the major global nodes but stay unaligned, particularly in the military domain. Pursuing this path would be more prudent in a post-pandemic context, despite domestic opinion being advanced that Delhi ought to join hands with a US-led cluster that will lean on China to atone for its many omissions that range from creating the Covid-19 crisis to Doklam, support to Pakistan, and blocking India’s admission to the nuclear order.The post-Covid-19 recalibration for India is in the domestic arena. It must remain focused on emerging as a credible and equitable socioeconomic power that recognises the principle of power, but adheres to the power of normative principle.C Uday Bhaskar is director, Society for Policy Studies, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-must-stick-to-its-strategic-orientation/story-yGZlfeoUDh7Ex4P0dnCaUO.html
27-04-2020||News||In dealing with Covid-19, the crisis of leadership||We are in the midst of a calamity that the world has rarely seen before. Given the helplessness of ordinary people in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, we can only ask if those in authority are doing enough to deal with the crisis, and if they are capable of dealing with it. Disasters such as the coronavirus pandemic are not confined to specific geographies territories, and thus, dealing with it requires a holistic and global approach. Sadly, there is a dearth of leaders who have an influence on the world today and can provide global direction. In the past, when the world faced a crisis, it was the American leadership that took charge. But, today, the United States (US) appears weak in the face of the onslaught of the virus. In fact, many other countries are doing far better at containing the virus than the US. The problem seems to be a lack of leadership on the part of President Donald Trump. Faced with a situation that requires calm, reasoned science-based responses, Trump has behaved irresponsibly. He did not respond to the crisis in time, and has given mixed signals, and on some occasions, even come up with dangerous prescriptions on how to fight the virus. And he has, for domestic political considerations, consistently blamed China for the crisis. China does deserve blame though, and suspicion and anger against Beijing is widely shared. Many countries believe that Beijing’s tardiness in informing the world of the threat in time has caused irreparable damage. Some organisations and governments are planning to approach international legal bodies, terming China’s lapse as an assault on international human rights. But Beijing is in no mood to blink. It has, in response, stepped up its diplomatic efforts against what it terms are absurd allegations. In order to counter the US onslaught, it has begun to help Latin American and African countries with money and material to counter the spread. As a result, it has won over some of these countries. China is also making substantial inroads in influencing some eastern European countries. It has continued with its belligerent geopolitical activities and increased its naval activities in the South China Sea. China’s biggest asset is, of course, its economic prowess. It holds hundreds of patents — from essential commodities, tech products, even herbal medicines. In order to cash in on China’s cheap labour, western countries have large production bases in the country. And they cannot afford to antagonise China beyond a point, or terminate their operations there. Developing countries such as India are also unhappy with China. But we are dependent on it too. The fact that some of the raw materials for hydroxychloroquine, which we are now exporting to other countries, come from China is just an obvious example of this dependence. There is, therefore, a peculiar mix of both dependence on, and conflict with, China. But this confrontation between the West and China could not have come at a worse time. Irrespective of the substance of the allegations, this war of words and perceptions hampers a global response to the crisis. And it doesn’t help that across the world, there are several ultra-nationalists in power. Could the situation have been different if the world had leaders such as Nelson Mandela or Mahatma Gandhi? Probably, but we will never know. There is, however, some cause for cheer. And this comes from the leadership displayed by women in their own countries. As soon as Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen was informed of a mysterious virus that was spreading in Wuhan, she took stern measures. As a result, the spread of the infection was controlled. Similarly, the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, sealed the borders of her country on March 19. She not only declared a one-month nationwide lockdown, but also demoted a minister who violated the curbs. In Germany, Angela Merkel, who has a background in science, has evolved a coherent policy response and communicated directly and effectively with citizens. In India, Kerala successfully defended itself after the initial shocks, thanks to the efforts of its woman health minister, KK Shailaja.The world should look at the way these women leaders have dealt with the virus. They have shown that actions based on the advice of medical experts, coupled with a humane approach towards people is the way forward. Anger and mud-slinging will get us nowhere.

The constable, attached with the Kurla traffic division, is the third Mumbai police personnel to lose his life in 2 days. Over 50 Mumbai Police personnel have tested positive so far and are undergoing treatment at various hospitals.A police officer confirmed the development to HT. Mumbai Police also confirmed the news in a Twitter post on Monday evening.The head constable tested positive on Friday and was admitted at the intensive care unit (ICU) of KEM Hospital. He had medical history of blood pressure, informed a senior police officer.However, on April 21 he was allegedly denied admission by four civic hospitals despite having symptoms of Covid-19. His 25-year-old son took him to Rajawadi Hospital after he had developed fever, but the doctors allegedly conducted preliminary analysis and recommended home quarantine. “When I asked them to admit him, they claimed there was no bed available and asked me to take him to Kasturba Gandhi Hospital,” the son had told HT earlier. He then took his father to Kasturba Hospital, where doctors supplied oxygen and asked him to take the personnel to BYL Nair Hospital. At Nair Hospital, too, the authorities denied admitting him saying they had no beds and that they do not test patients. “On their recommendation, I took my father to KEM Hospital, where doctors refused to admit him at first. It was only after I contacted the police that my father was admitted at the ICU at 11pm,” the youth said.The deceased personnel’s brother is also a policeman attached with the Mumbai Police’s crime branch. The constable is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters. His elder son works as CCTV operator at Mantralaya for a private firm on a contract basis.A 35-year-old constable, also attached with the Kurla traffic division, has tested positive and is admitted at Thane’s Kaushalya Hospital. It is suspected that he contracted the virus from the head constable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-positive-cop-who-was-turned-away-by-4-civic-hospitals-dies/story-J4xEqs1l4MbDDBV3ib8W0O.html
27-04-2020||City||Truck carrying over 950 cartons of illicit liquor seized amid lockdown||Gurugram: The police on Sunday confiscated a truck carrying 959 cartons of illicit liquor near Sohna-Damdama border area. The truck was on its way to the city to smuggle the liquor amid the ongoing lockdown, the police said, adding that two persons standing next to the truck noticed the police vehicle and managed to escape on foot. The incident was reported around 6pm when the police received a tip-off that two bootleggers were allegedly smuggling liquor in village Khaika, Sohna, officials said. A team of policemen from City Sohna police station rushed to the village and spotted a truck parked on an isolated stretch of the road.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), said that the two people managed to escape after noticing the police vehicle.“The truck was covered with tarpaulin and the cartons of liquor had been covered with at least 12 sacks of onions to evade suspicion. Preliminary probe suggests that the truck was headed to the city to supply liquor to bootleggers and consumers. The details of the supply chain and nexus would be known once the suspects are arrested,” said Sangwan, adding that the bootleggers had been struggling to move liquor in the city due to the lockdown imposed to contain the Covid-19 spread.He said that the seizure, which included 703 cartons of countrymade liquor and 256 cartons of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), was the single highest seizure from one location since the lockdown was imposed in the city, and subsequently, liquor vends across the state were shut down.Excise officials had earlier said that some bootleggers had also cheated several people by offering to sell liquor online during the lockdown. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that the truck’s registration number was of Chhattisgarh and the police had reached out to regional transport authority officials to trace its owner. “It is not certain if the truck had been stolen. It is possible that it managed to infiltrate from a neighbouring state in the garb of transporting essential items as its periphery of boot space was covered with onions,” said the police official.A case was registered against the suspects under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Excise Act at Sohna City police station on Sunday, said the police.In another incident, the crime branch of Sector 39 arrested a man, identified by first name as Bijender, from Ghata village in Sector 56 for allegedly smuggling six cartons of illicit liquor on Sunday night. On Saturday, the police had arrested one Rajesh from Pataudi for allegedly transporting 222 liquor bottles, including 144 bottles of countrymade liquor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/truck-carrying-over-950-cartons-of-illicit-liquor-seized-amid-lockdown/story-FQb6qzzK4qNoltgPw1ySDK.html
27-04-2020||City||IMT industries’ body launches online signature campaign for financial help as workers threaten to start protest||Gurugram: An online signature campaign has been launched by IMT Industrial Association, Manesar, to seek a financial relief package from the state government to be able to pay salaries to their workers who have threatened to start a protest if not paid.Industry owners across the Gurugram district said that their income has taken a hit due to the lockdown and they needed the government’s support to bail them out. Pawan Yadav, president of IMT Industrial Association, Manesar, said, “More than 3,000 owners have signed the petition in three days of launching.”The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) on March 29 issued a notification under the Disaster Management Act 2005, making it mandatory for industry owners to pay the wages to its workers during the lockdown. After the MHA notification, the state government issued directions to all district heads to implement the order in letter and spirit.“There is panic among industry owners. If we do not pay wages to workers in first week of May, the administration will take action as per the MHA notification. Earlier, we gave representations to the local administration and state government, but did not get any response. As our last resort, we decided to launch an online petition, get it signed by at least 5,000 owners and send it to state government by April end. If the government does not respond and we are forced to pay, then we will move court,” said Yadav. He further said that there is a massive resentment among industry owners who paid March salaries to workers.Meanwhile, workers said that they would protest if they do not get salaries of April from their employers. “On April 21, some industry owners met the district administration officials and submitted a memorandum showing their poor financial condition. We condemn such approach of industry owners. We have also written to the administration and state government. Industry owners and workers work like family members, and in this crisis time owners cannot desert workers to die without money,” said a leader of workers’ union in Manesar.There are 10 industrial associations in Gurugram and all of them have been collectively raising their voice with the local administration and state government in this regard. Representatives of the associations had met the deputy commissioner a week ago and submitted a memorandum. The IMT Industrial Association has taken a lead this time with the launching of an online signature campaign for the petition. Rakesh Batra, general secretary of Industrial Development Association Sector 37 Gurugram, said, “We have no money to pay wages to workers. We have signed the online petition. If we do not get relief from government, we will move court.” The petition says that the MHA is passing financial burden on small businesses/MSMEs despite they have been depositing money in social security funds like labour welfare fund, employees state insurance, labour cess, etc for the past many years for their employees and it is high time the government should utilise these funds for industries’ support.When asked about the issue, Kesni Anand Arora, state chief secretary, said, “I have no directions from the government for industry in this regard. However, industries’ grievances are in the knowledge of the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/imt-industries-body-launches-online-signature-campaign-for-financial-help-as-workers-threaten-to-start-protest/story-10lUsoEWeqB9Y9vyKiCHRK.html
27-04-2020||City||Ggm fire department turns to ULB for new equipment||Gurugram: The Gurugram fire department, which has been waiting to augment its infrastructure for several years, has now turned to the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) for new equipment, said officials on Monday. As per IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer, the department last week sent a letter to the ULB, asking for a 101-metre and a 70-metre hydraulic ladders, two 55-metre turntable ladders, and 29 new fire tenders which comprise eight water bowsers, 10 water tenders, one rescue tender, five foam tenders, three water mist tenders, and two quick response fire tender vehicles.The move comes almost a month after the ULB’s letter to the fire department, asking the latter to list the items it requires to upgrade its machinery, fire department officials said, adding that it is for the first time that the ULB has asked it about the procurement of such items. Otherwise, such demands were usually raised with the directorate of fire services Haryana. Kashyap further said that their demands have remained on paper since 2015. “We analysed the existing stock of equipment to combat and initiate rescue operations during a fire, and have accordingly placed our demand with the ULB. The city has expanded and we need to upgrade our machinery to meet its requirements,” said Kashyap.The fire department in the district is quite ill-equipped. It has a solitary 42-metre hydraulic ladder capable of reaching till the 14th floor of a building, even though the city has more than 1,100 high-rises. Besides, the department only has a stock of 20 fire tenders spread across its five fire brigades at different localities that include Sector 29, Udyog Vihar, Bhim Nagar, and Sector 37.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ggm-fire-department-turns-to-ulb-for-new-equipment/story-ZIWy3mGXgWpQDmdVG9jOyN.html
27-04-2020||Gurugram||Well-being of elderly, safety of staff main concerns of Hex-Tax Commune in Sec 43||At Hex-Tax Commune in Sector 43, the well-being of senior citizens and supply of essential items to them have been the priorities during the current lockdown. Located just 100 metres from Sector 42-43 Rapid Metro station, the welfare housing society is a relatively smaller condominium, of roughly 450 residents.“Senior citizens have been told that they can call us any time for delivery of ration, medicine or essential goods. After they give us their requirements, we make sure that those are delivered at their doorstep so that they do not have to step out,” said Raj Jha, estate manager of the property.The society has a grocery store on its premises, which provides residents with all the essentials. Since the lockdown started, strict protocols, such as wearing masks, social distancing and staggered visit timings, are being maintained.“The grocery store is ensuring that residents get a fresh supply of vegetables and fruits. We have set out a few tables outside the store for residents to pick up their order from. They have to wear masks and maintain distance. Because we are a small society, it is easier for us to not have crowds because not everyone comes down at the same time to the shop,” said JS Dhankar, president of the residents’ welfare association (RWA).All doorstep deliveries from the outside have been suspended. Deliveries of newspapers, food and essential items are deposited at the main gate, from where residents are expected to pick up their packages.Support staff and residents entering the society have to compulsorily undergo thermal screening and use sanitisers or wash hands at the newly installed washbasin. The society is currently functioning with reduced staff, most of who reside in the vicinity of the condominium.“We are ensuring that housekeeping staff are screened at the gate. They also work on a no-contact basis,” said Dhankar. He added that many domestic helps are currently residing with families having young children and infants since the lockdown began.The society has a resident electrician and plumber, who are accommodated in dedicated quarters. However, all service requests in apartments have been put on hold currently. “Even before the lockdown, the electrician and plumber were provided with their permanent residences inside the society,” Jha.The society also has a composting pit, where biodegradable waste is turned into manure. Staff who work here have been provided personal protective equipment (PPE), for their safety during the processes involved, including stirring of the mulch.“We made sure that these workers who stir the compost have protection suits so that their safety is ensured. This step was even vetted by a health expert, who declared it a ‘good step’,” said Jha.Jha said that besides weekly fogging exercised by the district administration, they are also conducting fogging daily, with the help of a third party.The society is currently maintaining a no-walk policy. Residents have, instead, turned to exercise at home.“Due to the lockdown, we had to forego our morning and evening walks. So now, I am just doing my yoga, exercises and stretches at home, and maybe take a small stroll in my backyard, but that’s about it,” said MS Hooda, a senior citizen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/well-being-of-elderly-safety-of-staff-main-concerns-of-hex-tax-commune-in-sec-43/story-xmnoQITy0IDbpkOPUJPDLJ.html
27-04-2020||City||Couple gets married in a flat amid lockdown; families join ceremony virtually||28-year-old Mansi Purwar and 29-year old Shubham Gupta had got engaged in November last year and were scheduled to get married on April 25. The couple had elaborate plans for their wedding. Their families had booked a banquet hall for the wedding, hired confectioner for all the marriage functions in their home towns, and sent out invitation cards to their friends and relatives, but with the nationwide lockdown in place, the couples had to put on hold all preparations made for their big day.When the lockdown was extended till May 3, their families consulted a priest for the next auspicious date (shubh muhurat) to conduct the marriage. When the couple was told that if they could not get married on April 25, then they will have to wait till at least till December 25, they decided to drop their grand plans for the wedding and decided to get married at a relative’s flat in Gaur City in Greater Noida (West) on Saturday. With a handful of relatives by their side, the bride and the groom tied the nuptial know without much fanfare and received blessings from their parents through video conference.Shubham works in a private company as a sales manager and lives in Greater Noida West. Purwar works in an IT firm in Gurugram and lives there at PG (paying guest) facility before shifting to her uncle’s flat in Gaur City right before the lockdown came into force. “Our families had started the preparations for the marriage in November itself, but unexpectedly a 15-day lockdown was first enforced in the country. We were hopeful that the lockdown will end before April 25 and the wedding would take place as decided before, but the lockdown was extended till May 3,” he said.“The two families then consulted a priest who informed us that the next ‘shubh muhurat’ would be in December 2020 or in February 2021. Mansi and I then decided to get married in a simple way in Greater Noida, since we both were here,” he said. Gupta’s sister Priyanka and brother-in-law Ashish, who lives in Greater Noida (West) as well accompanied him to Purwar’s flat on the wedding day.Vinay Purwar, Mansi’s cousin, said since all shops, markets, and malls were shut due to the lockdown, the two families could not even shop for the wedding and buy new wedding attire for the couple. “The groom was dressed in a casual blue shirt and grey trousers. Mansi had to wear the wedding dress my wife had worn when we got married. We called a priest from the society who performed the marriage rituals. My father performed the ‘kanyadan’ ceremony on behalf of Mansi’s father” he said.Mansi’s family is based in Jalaun and Gupta’s family is from Etawah. The two families joined the ceremony through video conferencing.Shriprakash Purwar, Mansi’s father, said that the family was happy with the wedding. “The lockdown had stopped all the preparations, and both the families decided to organize the wedding in a simple way. We virtually joined the ceremony from Jalaun for two hours on video conferencing through a mobile app,” he said.“I am happy that we married in a simple way. We have planned to host a reception once the lockdown restrictions are lifted,” Mansi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/couple-gets-married-in-a-flat-amid-lockdown-families-join-ceremony-virtually/story-h2rIuG7smxNZixpcArts0M.html
27-04-2020||Noida||Mercury set to rise from Tuesday||While the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded on Monday were lesser than the season’s average temperatures, the weather department has warned of a rise in mercury levels from Tuesday.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), with western disturbances subsiding—a phenomenon that causes rains and thundery development in the Delhi and NCR—the mercury is set to rise and reach up to 40 degree Celsius by the weekend.Monday’s maximum temperature was recorded at 33.8 degrees Celsius, five notches below the season’s average,similar to that of Sunday. The minimum temperature on Monday was recorded at 18.9 degrees Celsius, five notches below the season’s average, against 23.8 degrees Celsius on Sunday. The Met department also recorded 0.4 mm rainfall over past 24 hours in different regions of the city.On Tuesday, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to increase to 36 degrees Celsius and 20 degrees Celsius, respectively.“The mercury is set to rise from now on. With onset of May, the maximum temperatures may rise to 40 degrees in the first week and 45 degrees by the second week with occasional heatwaves. The weather activities like western disturbances will subside now,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecast agency, Skymet.He added that there is another western disturbance on Thursday (April 30) which could bring a slight relief from the rising heat, however, it would not have much impact on the maximum temperatures the following day.Meanwhile, the weather analysts said due to the back-to-back western disturbances, March and April so far have been cooler by at least a degree compared to the mean temperature of the past 30 days.“Till date, the average mean temperature for April 2020 is 35.3 degrees Celsius, while for the past 30 years mean average was 36.3 degrees. For March 2020 as well, the average maximum was 28.4 degrees Celsius, while the mean temperature for March for past 30 years was 29.6 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperatures have been cooler than a degree and the reason is back-to-back western disturbances. The rains had been patchy, but they helped control the overall temperatures of the entire region,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecast centre, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/mercury-set-to-rise-from-tuesday/story-LH7rPGK50Wc7gzCEgeazNI.html
27-04-2020||Mumbai||Reopen Bandra cemetery for burial of Covid victims: HC to BMC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to remove the locks on the gates of Navpada Kokani Muslim Kabrastan at Bandra (West), and make the cemetery, which was closed by locals opposing burial of bodies of Covid-19 patients at the ground, available for burial.Justice BP Colabawalla on Monday refused to interfere with the April 9 order of BMC that identified the private Muslim burial ground as one of the sites for burial of Covid-19 patients. Four local residents had filed a petition challenging the civic order.The directive came after advocate Pratap Nimbalkar, representing Navpada Masjid and Santacruz Golibar Dargah Trust which manages the cemetery, pointed out some local residents had put up locks on the gate of the cemetery.Nimbalkar pointed out that on April 13 some locals created a ruckus over the civic body’s order when a body of a 63-year-old person, who died due to Covid-19 infection, was brought for burial at the ground. Some police officers tried to intervene, but failed to pacify locals, and eventually the body was required to be buried somewhere else.Nimbalkar added despite the trust had taken all precautions and identified isolated and secluded spots for burial of Covid-19 patients, locals were not allowing burial, and urged the court to direct BMC to reopen the burial ground. Justice Colabawalla accordingly directed the civic body to reopen the cemetery and granted it liberty to take help of local police if necessary.The four petitioners said there are three interconnected Muslim cemeteries at the site and all of them are at the heart of Bandra (West) and are surrounded by thickly populated residential areas.The petitioners said BMC had, on March 30, decided to cremate bodies Covid-19 patients at the nearest crematorium irrespective of their religion. “The said decision was taken as the burial grounds in Mumbai are in highly dense localities with high chances of contamination,” said their petition.They added the April 9 order was in contrary to the March 30 decision and therefore prayed for an order restraining the civic body from burying Covid-19 bodies at the three cemeteries.Justice Colabawalla, however, refused to interfere with the latest civic order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/reopen-bandra-cemetery-for-burial-of-covid-victims-hc-to-bmc/story-Zmg4h0gNMklVmmirqyorQP.html
27-04-2020||Noida||Govt doctor booked for cruelty against pet dog||A female doctor, who works with a government institute in Greater Noida, was booked by the Phase-2 police on Sunday for allegedly mistreating her pet Labrador dog. No arrests have been made and the dog has not been rescued either.The incident was reported from Parsvnath Prestige society in Sector 93A where the doctor resides. The complaint was filed by a woman who lives in the neighbourhood society of ATS Village.“For the last few days, I could see the dog being kept in the balcony in the day time for hours under the hot sun. My balcony faces theirs and the anguish of the dog was quite visible. I asked around and found out that the dog was being mistreated by the family for a while,” said Pearl Verma, the complainant who works as a flight captain with Air India.She said that the dog was often beaten and kept next to the air conditioning unit in the balcony, which when switched on, would throw hot air, exposing the dog to additional heat.“Even the security guards of their society confirmed that the dog is ill-treated and not taken for walks or exercise. She is inadequately fed and kept in a confined space,” said Verma in her complaint.She also said that the suspect’s sister told people that they are keeping the dog away to avoid the transmission of coronavirus, which is nearly impossible.“Members of the RWA and other residents have also intervened but to no avail. The family even threatened my mother to back off from the case and refused to cooperate when we went to rescue the dog,” said Verma.The doctor was booked under Section 428 (mischief by killing or maiming animal) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and relevant sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.“An investigation in the case is underway. We will question the family and take necessary legal action,” said Farmood Ali Pundir, station house officer(SHO), Phase-2 police station.When contacted, the doctor said, “This is harassment. While I was busy attending to cases of Covid-19 and my children were alone at home, these people came to my house and tried to take away my dog. They probably want to take her for breeding. We treat our dog well. She even has her own cooler. When I am at work for hours, it sometimes becomes difficult for my children to handle her on their own. As such, they keep her in the balcony in the evenings , but never during the daytime when it is hotter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/govt-doctor-booked-for-cruelty-against-pet-dog/story-L3py9U9tEnxFbR5uFgSwVM.html
27-04-2020||Mumbai||Seven Hills Hospital carries out plasma transfusion on Covid-19 patient||A day after a coronavirus patient received the first convalescent plasma transfusion at Lilavati Hospital, the Seven Hills Hospital in Marol became the first civic-run to run the clinical trial on its patient on Sunday. The civic-run hospital conducted the convalescent plasma transfusion on an admitted patient after getting the extracted plasma from Nair Hospital. At present, BYL Nair hospital is the only hospital which has got the approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for the extractions of the component from donated blood.“The patient is critical and it is too early to comment on the health of the patient as he needs observation. Depending on the condition of the patient, we will decide if he needs a further dosage of plasma,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, in-charge of Seven Hills Hospital. The therapy involves transfusing plasma – a component of the blood – from a recovered patient into a patient fighting the infection, to act as reinforcement for the latter’s immune system. Antibodies produced in the blood of cured patients can fight infections if injected into infected individuals.Meanwhile, the 53-year-old patient who received the first 200ml of plasma on Saturday at Lilavati Hospital is still critical and on ventilator though his oxygen intake has improved slightly. He has developed a blood infection and is kept on a high dosage of antibiotics. Thus, the hospital had to postpone the other two dosages for a day.“We have held the next two dosages for a day. If his condition improves tomorrow, we will transfuse the remaining 400ml of plasma together,” said an official from Lilavati Hospital.Kerala was the first state to start convalescent plasma therapy with the approval from the ICMR. Meanwhile, to stop any possible spread of Covid-19, Seven Hills Hospital has installed Ozone Disinfection Chamber. “All the people who are coming into the hospital will have to work through the channel. These chambers have disinfectants which spray chemicals that are enough to kill the virus on the cloths and the upper layer of the body,” said Dr Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/seven-hills-hospital-carries-out-plasma-transfusion-on-covid-19-patient/story-FWe2IRY2G5HbLm9WotrtGK.html
27-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Man creates fake profile to seek money in top cop’s name, FIR lodged||An unidentified man on Monday allegedly created a fake profile of superintendent of police (crime), Ghaziabad on a social media platform, and has been asking for money from various people linked to the original social media account of the senior police officer.The police said that they have shut the fake social media account and lodged an FIR into the incident at Sihani Gate police station.“On Monday, I received a number of calls from people who are attached to my profile. All of them asked me whether I needed help and wanted ₹20,000. I was shocked to hear this and denied knowing anything about making such requests. Then I came to know that some unidentified person had created a fake social media account in my name, and was demanding ₹ 20,000 each from different persons in my name and was telling them that I needed money,” said Prakash Kumar, SP (crime).Kumar then directed the police to lodge an FIR. He said he also posted messages on his social media account that a fake person was demanding money in his name, and that none of his contacts should pay heed to the fake request.“We have roped in a cyber cell team to track the suspect and the fake profile has been shut down. So far, there is no information that anyone in my contact list sent him any money. I have also posted about the matter on my social media profile and have asked people not to forward the money to anyone in my name,” he added.At present, Kumar is also entrusted for surveillance of Covid-19 suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-man-creates-fake-profile-to-seek-money-in-top-cop-s-name-fir-lodged/story-No52jtw2iQOvlyWSKWeE0O.html
27-04-2020||City||For the first time, recovered cases outnumber active cases in Ghaziabad||For the first time since the Covid-19 outbreak was reported in the district, Ghaziabad saw recovered cases outnumber the present active cases. According to officials, out of the 58 positive cases in the district, 31 patients, roughly 53%, got discharged till Monday evening.According to health department officials, 14 Covid-19 positive patients were discharged from different hospitals on Monday after two successive test reports confirmed their negative status.“Till Monday evening, we have a total of 31 patients who have been discharged so far from hospitals and the number of active cases is just 27. The list of 31 includes 14 persons who were discharged on Monday. It is further encouraging that the first test reports of 14 other active cases have also turned negative. We have taken their second samples and sent them for testing as per the protocol. If the second sample turns negative, 14 more patients will be discharged. We are expecting these reports by Tuesday evening,” said DR NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).The officials said that the 14 patients discharged on Monday include a couple from Savior Park, Mohan Nagar; a woman from Vasundhara, three people from Ranchi, two each from Muradnagar in Ghaziabad and Kolkata, and one each from Loni, Masuri and Kaila Bhatta and Hyderabad..“Barring the couple and the woman from Vasundhara, all others had either attended religious congregations or had come in contact with someone who had,” Dr Gupta added.According to UP principal secretary, Sudhir Garg, if the trend continues along with a continued enforcement of lockdown, Ghaziabad will be able to move from the red zone to the orange zone within a week.The health department officials said that one more positive case from Khoda was added to the tally of positive patients on Monday. With this, total number of positive cases in Ghaziabad stands at 58, which includes 31 patients who have been discharged so far.“The patient is resident of Khoda and presently under treatment at ESI Hospital in Sahibabad. Since his test was done in Noida but we are taking him in our count. There was one more case of a woman from Noida who was brought to MMG Hospital on Sunday but the staff from Noida also brought along her mother in the same ambulance,” Dr Gupta said.“We have taken up this issue with the Noida health department. The woman is admitted to Sahibabad hospital but will be counted in the tally of Noida and she is a resident there. However, since she and her mother are at our facility, we will be giving them all the required treatment. If her mother turns out to be positive she will be added to the tally of Covid-19 positive patients of Ghaziabad,” he added.Gautam Budh Nagar CMO Dr Deepak Ohri and district magistrate Suhas LY were approached repeatedly over the issue through calls and messages. However, they did not respond till late Monday evening.Lockdown continues in the districtIn the meantime, the district officials, on Monday morning, also sealed Gardenia Glamour in Vasundhara Sector-3. This was after a doctor couple tested positive on Sunday evening and is presently admitted to a hospital in Delhi.“The society has 288 flats. It was sealed on Monday afternoon. There is police deployment at the main gate and residents are now allowed to venture outside,” said Ashok Vardhan, the vice president of the residents’ welfare association (RWA) of Gardenia Glamour. On Monday, a woman doctor who had tested positive, took to Twitter and alleged that there was only one common washroom in Ghaziabad’s Covid hospital at Muradnagar. She also complained of the presence of mice and demanded to be shifted to Delhi. The woman is a resident of a high-rise in Indirapuram.“We have given a separate room to the doctor and some washrooms have been made available for women patients. We have taken up disinfection procedures to ensure that there are no rodents around,” said Dr GP Mathuria, the superintendent of the hospital.The total number of active Covid-19 positive patients in Uttar Pradesh stood at 1,589. Till now, 335 patients have been discharged and 31 have died. According to officials, there were 1,784 persons admitted to isolation centres and 15 of them were on oxygen while others were stable. The figure of persons in quarantine wards stood at 11,363 till Monday afternoon.“The UP chief minister has asked to ramp up the number of beds in quarantine centres in all districts. He has directed that about 15-20 thousand quarantine beds should be created in every district. The CM also took a detailed review of the worst affected districts of Agra, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Kanpur, Lucknow and Varanasi. He also gave directions for a strict enforcement of the lockdown,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-the-first-time-recovered-cases-outnumber-active-cases-in-ghaziabad/story-rZyMILhpUxpUDmxm42KlON.html
27-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt allows plumbers, electricians to resume work||The Delhi government Monday relaxed a few more lockdown restrictions by allowing self-employed persons such as plumbers, electricians and repairers of water purifiers to resume their work from Tuesday. The decision to allow self-employed persons to resume work came hours after an empowered group, constituted by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), to monitor the supply chain and logistics of essential items, recommended that a section of service rendering persons such as electricians and plumbers must be allowed to work even if the lockdown is extended beyond May 3. In a late-night order issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev, the Delhi government also allowed interstate and intrastate movement of all medical and veterinary personnel, scientists, nurses, paramedical staff, lab technicians, midwives, and other hospital support services, including ambulances. The order stated that air travel for such persons will also be allowed. This assumes significance since the Haryana and the Uttar Pradesh governments recently imposed curbs on the movement of people to and from Delhi, including those catering to essential services. After receiving feedback that several private clinics, pathological labs and dispensaries in Delhi have been shut due to confusion over the lockdown rules and also because of a general fear of spreading Covid-19, the Delhi govt’s late-night order also included the opening of all such facilities across the capital.The other additional activities that are now allowed include shops of electric fans, and shops of educational books for students. However, these relaxations will not apply to any of the 99 containment zones in the city, a senior government official clarified.The order also clarified that regular operations in shelter homes for persons with disabilities, children, elderly people, widows, etc., will continue. These homes were already operational during the lockdown, but with the order, they will be able to bring in more people or release those not needing these facilities any more. The order stated that all other restrictions will remain intact. The chief secretary asked the agencies concerned, including the Delhi Police to ensure that “status quo” be maintained across the city with regard to curbs that will continue, until further orders.On Monday, Delhi’s total number of Covid-19 cases touched 3,108, which included 877 recoveries and 54 deaths. A week ago, on April 20, the DDMA had constituted five empowered groups, comprising top bureaucrats and experts, to identify problems in the city’s Covid-19 mitigation activities and suggest solutions ranging from policy interventions to emergency planning. Of the five panels, the empowered group on facilitating supply chain and logistics of essential items submitted its first report to the DDMA on Monday. The panel, headed by Delhi food and civil supplies commissioner Ankita Mishra Bundela, reasoned that after the nationwide lockdown was extended to May 3, many services rendered by self-employed persons have now become essential.“The general public requires the services of electricians, plumbers, drain cleaners, etc, which are sometimes as essential as the supply of daily need items. In case there is an electrical fault in the house, the entire household activities may come to a standstill… Therefore, necessary consideration should be given to this aspect also,” read the report, which HT has seen. Allowing such self-employed persons to work was a part of the Central government’s guidelines on the extended lockdown issued on April 15. Delhi, however, did not allow any relaxation suggested by the Centre back then as each of the 11 districts in the capital was categorised as a ‘high-risk’ or ‘red’ zone. It was only on Saturday, after the Centre issued a revised order, that the Delhi government allowed standalone shops in residential colonies to operate, while still keeping all other restrictions in place. The empowered group also pointed out that if the lockdown is extended, attention will have to be given to items that are dependent on imports. Items such as coffee, diapers, dry fruits, oils and cereals “are expected to face a supply crunch” in the next few weeks, it said. When it comes to medicines, the group found that pharmaceutical companies and distributors are facing problems in the interstate movement of products as warehouses, which stock medicines, are located all over the country. “All essential medicines are available in the market, but the factories are told to be operating at less than 50% of their capacity. The distributors may not be able to supply all medicines if the production remains affected at the source level for a long time,” read the report. Bundela said that the report is a preliminary submission prepared to draw the broader contours of issues related to availability of essential items. “It is the first report and doesn’t mean the task of the empowered group is over. It is a work in progress,” she said.The first reports submitted by each of the five empowered groups will be analysed by chief secretary Vijay Dev, who will identify the actionable points and issue directions to the concerned agencies. If any of the problems highlighted are found to be extremely serious in nature, they will be flagged to the lieutenant-governor, who is the chairperson of the DDMA and the chief minister who is the co-chairperson of the DDMA. The general findings by the groups will also be conveyed to them. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-allows-plumbers-electricians-to-resume-work/story-HjivroDj8BNDFeOWAZMsXO.html

No deaths were recorded for two days in a row, shows the Delhi government data.So far, 54 people have died of the viral infection in the city. Of them, almost 54% were 60 years or older. Also, over 85% of those who died had some co-morbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and heart and kidney disease. So far, 877 people have recovered from it in the city.Of the 2,177 active cases — those still with the infection — 642 are admitted to nine Covid-19 designated hospitals in the city.

27-04-2020||Mumbai||Aerosol levels drop 50% in Mumbai||The concentration of aerosols — tiny solid and liquid particles suspended in air — dropped by half in Mumbai during lockdown, says a study by Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES).The study used satellite images of aerosol concentration which showed a 50% decline over Mumbai region and about 65% over Indo-Gangetic plains, said Madhavan Rajeevan, secretary, MoES.Aerosols include particulate matter (PM) which is a mix of organic and chemical particles that can be harmful if inhaled. Southeast Asian countries generally witness high aerosol concentration between January and April.“Our satellite study for aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the last week of March to third week of April showed a marked decline in concentration, especially across northern parts of the country, owing to reduction in anthropogenic sources such as industrial and transport related emissions,” said Rajeevan adding that AOD is the measure of light reflected by airborne particles revealing the quantitative aerosol concentration of the whole atmospheric column. “For Mumbai and surrounding areas, the reduction was significant due to drop in transport pollution, which accounts for 30%-35% of all pollution sources.”Last week, an analysis by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), under MoES, showed air pollution hotspots across major cities turned from ‘red’ to ‘green’ zones with clean air quality. Mumbai saw a 60% decline in nitrogen dioxide levels, 49% in PM10 and 45% in PM2.5 concentration during lockdown.“Our analysis goes a step ahead and assesses the overall atmospheric scenario vis-à-vis falling human-induced emissions,” said Rajeevan.A similar AOD study done by US-based National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) compared satellite images for the period of March 31 to April 5 from 2016 with that of 2020, which showed air pollution over the Indo-Gangetic plain has dropped to a 20-year low.Another factor that has been relatively less researched is the declining trend in surface ozone (O3) during lockdown, said Rajeevan. O3 is photochemical oxidant formed when pollutants like volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen chemically react in the presence of sunlight. High ozone concentration, which can be dangerous, is generally witnessed during this time of the year across major metropolitan cities, he said adding that it can lead to a lot of health problems such as asthma and cardiovascular diseases. “However, O3 levels recorded by SAFAR across Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Pune, and a few of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) stations have seen a sharp decline during lockdown due to a drop in human activities,” the MoES secretary said. “SAFAR and IMD have been directed to analyse this data and publish a detailed report.”Rajeevan also addressed concerns of predicted rise in air pollution after lockdown owing to an expected surge in private vehicles and industrial emissions. “There is a need for cultural and behavioural change post lockdown where we try to increase the frequency of working from home, cycling or walking. While it may not be possible for all, especially those working in factories, construction sites etc, such alterations are essential,” he said.In addition, the ministry also studied the drop in overall human-induced noise from transport, aviation and construction sectors, which helped scientists detect and identify smaller earthquakes. “During the lockdown, we were able to easily detect earthquakes less than 2.8 or 2.5 on the Richter scale, and in some cases as low as 2.2 magnitude,” said Rajeevan. “Overall, the lockdown is giving us a natural laboratory to understand what background pollution levels are expected to be in cities. When it is over and activities pickup, pollution will rise again, and we need to calibrate and compare levels to come up with effective solutions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aerosol-levels-drop-50-in-mumbai/story-jBNBRm7XPk0RXElbdFV81K.html
27-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government to push Centre for funds, supply of PPE, aid to migrants||Though Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray did not get an opportunity to speak during Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s video conference with chief ministers of states on Monday, the Maharashtra government has decided to push its demands for financial aid, special trains for migrants and adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) kits from the Centre.The state government will also clarify its stand on extension of the lockdown after the second phase of the restrictions ends on May 3. “Since the PM has hinted at the continuation of the restrictions in heavily affected Covid-19 areas, and the state agrees, there should not be any problem in deciding over it. We will wait till the Union cabinet meeting on Wednesday before deciding the state level by the end of the week,” said a state official.Home minister Anil Deshmukh said that the lockdown will have to be extended for red zones like Mumbai, Pune, Malegaon, and Nagpur. “But the final decision will be taken by the high-power committee headed by the chief minister,” he said.According to a state government official, Thackeray was expected to raise issues of financial assistance, supply of PPE kits, and aid to stranded workers from other states during the video conference with the PM. “The Maharashtra CM has been speaking to the PM and other ministers, including home and health ministers regularly. We have raised many issues with the Centre time and again. They will be discussed again before the Union cabinet’s scheduled meeting,” said a senior government official.Maharashtra has already demanded financial assistance of ₹50,000 crore to be released over the next five months, amid the drop in state revenue due to the lockdown. A finance department official said that the CM and deputy CM Ajit Pawar have already written to the Centre about receiving the financial aid at the earliest. The state cabinet on Monday decided to push for central assistance and a few relaxations from the Reserve Bank of India. It also discussed the possibility of making jobs available for migrant workers at construction sites and factories that started operating from April 20. “In case the Centre does not respond positively to the plans to arrange their transportation, this could be an option for us,” said a cabinet minister, requesting anonymity. “We have also been demanding adequate supply of the PPE kits for doctors and medical staff treating Covid-19 patients. In Mumbai alone, we need more than 35,000 kits a week and the municipal corporation has been arranging them from the domestic market. We have also sought clarity on the usage and manufacturing of these kits,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-to-push-centre-for-funds-supply-of-ppe-aid-to-migrants/story-1DuUocARLIVHYHP9NHGnaJ.html
27-04-2020||Mumbai||Citizens group claims coastal road work threatening safety of staff||Alleging that construction being undertaken by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as pre-monsoon work for the coastal road project was a violation of lockdown rules, a citizens group has filed a complaint with the ministry of home affairs (MHA).The letter by Save Our Coast, Mumbai, with members from Nepeansea Road, Bhulabhai Desai Road, Haji Ali, and Worli, was sent to the secretary, MHA on April 23 and made public on Monday. The complaint states that work being carried out was ‘non-essential’ and workers were forced to operate without masks and recommended social distance.BMC maintained that if work was not completed before monsoon, it would lead to flooding. The civic body also claimed that all project workers had tested negative for the coronavirus.Activities in the form of land reclamation, tunneling using explosives, pile driving, and construction of new structures were a violation of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the letter. “Photographs show workers are not wearing protective equipment and not maintaining distancing norms. Entry and exit points of the [workers’] buses are in populated residential areas already within Covid-19 containment zones.”Vijay Nighot, chief engineer, BMC’s coastal road project, said, “Placing of armour (quarry) stones and reclamation is ‘essential work’ before monsoon when rough seas will flood the entire south Mumbai coastline. Five hundred workers have tested negative for the virus and have been provided protective gear. Prescribed distancing is followed with only one person per seat on the buses.” The latest complaint to the Centre comes after a legal notice was sent to the BMC by Save Our Coast on April 8 and a police complaint was filed on April 7. “Our legal team has responded to the group’s notice,” said Nighot.“Unfortunately, the agency supposed to enforce the lockdown is itself breaking it,” said environmentalist Debi Goenka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/citizens-group-claims-coastal-road-work-threatening-safety-of-staff/story-zUtzicdLaNFpFSggHuir1K.html
27-04-2020||Chandigarh||From doubling every 30 days, Covid cases now doubling in 12 days in Chandigarh||With a surge in positive cases over the last three days, the rate at which Covid-19 cases are doubling in the city has fallen sharply from 30.26 days on Friday to 12.34 days on Monday.This means, up till April 24, it took around 30 days for positive cases to double in the city, but now, cases are doubling in only around 12 days. The doubling rate of Covid-19 cases is calculated by using growth over the past seven days. In neighbouring Haryana, the doubling rate is 19 days.On April 24, Covid cases in the city stood at 27, then increased to 28 by April 25, but by April 27, the number of positive cases jumped to 45.As per Union health ministry guidelines, state and union territories have to calculate the doubling rate, which is also a determining factor for designating a hotspot.The city is a hotspot with several cases and is designated as a red zone by the Centre. The UT administration, too, designated the entire city as a containment zone on April 18. Hotspots (designated red zones) can be assumed to be undertaking effective containment activities if no case is reported in next 14 days (designated orange zones) and are deemed successful in containment if no case is reported for 28 days (designated green zones).With increasing number of cases in the city, UT officials admitted it was unlikely that major relaxations will be introduced in the city after May 3.Stating that a final decision on relaxations as well as the future course of action will be decided on May 2, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said, “I have constituted a committee headed by UT finance secretary AK Sinha and other senior UT officials. The committee will examine and recommend steps to be taken by the administration in the post-curfew period in the city.”The administration is mulling revoking curfew while continuing with the lockdown.

27-04-2020||City||Giggles, smiles welcome volunteers distributing sanitary pads in Mohali||Giggles and shy smiles welcomed the volunteers of an NGO and Punjab police personnel who went door-to-door distributing sanitary napkins in Mohali colonies.In consideration of women’s menstrual health, Punjab Police started distributing free sanitary pads to women who cannot move out owing to the curfew imposed to contain the epidemic.For this endeavour, the NGO and Punjab police had primarily chosen colonies in Jagatpura which have been sealed owing to Covid 19 cases, Amb Sahib Colony, Ambedkar Colony and Azadpur Colony in Balongi in Mohali.“We had started using cloth when we couldn’t get sanitary pads. The problem was not just getting the pads, but also of disposing them,” said Santosh Rani, resident of Amb Sahib Colony and working as domestic help. She and her two daughters had resorted to using cloth as they couldn’t leave home to buy pads.“My father has been without work for more than a month now, so we’re saving every penny we have as we don’t know when this will end. How can I ask them to buy me pads?” said a 15-year old from Azadpur colony, not willing to be named. Her father, a driver, has been without work due to the curfew.“The women would pick the packets with a shy smile or giggle and cover them with their pallu and run back into the house,” said Gaurav Gaur, NSS, program officer, Panjab University, who, too, was part of the project. He said so far they have distributed about 1,400 packets of sanitary towels.“Initially people thought we were there to distribute gloves or masks. We had to make announcements that only women should come forward. They hesitated initially, but after sometime it didn’t matter whether the persons distributing pads was a male or a female,” Gaur added. Manjula Sularia, director of Prasanchetas Foundation, working on menstrual hygiene, said that when they reached out to the men and told them what they were distributing, they were pleasantly surprised. “In fact, it was the men who helped volunteers and cops to identify houses where women lived. There is huge demand for pads, as from one small room, we would see about 5 to 6 women emerging to collect the packets,” Sularia said.Punjab Police have distributed free sanitary pads as part of the #SheFirst campaign by Paree, a sanitary napkin brand. Sahil Dharia, founder and CEO of Paree, “We tied up with local enforcement agencies to reach out to women. In fact, the women are more than forthcoming in asking for sanitary pads, and did not shy away as we had anticipated.” “People were surprised to see Punjab police personnel knocking at doors to distribute sanitary napkins. No doubt people hesitated but women were forthcoming and demanded more packets. This shows how people living in slums have also started believing in the importance of menstrual hygiene,” said Gurpreet Deo, additional director general of police, community affairs division, Punjab. She added that in places such as Jagatpura, which are sealed due to Covid cases, police teams helped in drawing people out of their homes, while ensuring social distancing was maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/giggles-smiles-welcome-volunteers-distributing-sanitary-pads-in-mohali/story-LZ0bhDPmAEBlGxh3uhnz6H.html

But this is the first time that I am seeing fear and hesitation,” says Gulzar Singh, a 57-year-old worker at the LPG crematorium in Sector 25, Chandigarh.At a time when social distancing has become the norm, Gulzar and his team members Surender Kumar, 38, and Raghubir Singh, 39, are helping the UT administration cremate bodies of those who have died of Covid-19.Surender and Raghubir recall the first time they cremated a Covid positive person. “It was a moment of great fear. Neither were we given any training nor were we taught any protocol on how to handle such cases. We, too, have families. But we could see the helplessness of the deceased’s son,” says Surender.‘‘Since the government had mandated wearing of PPE suits, we waited for the gear to arrive, and as soon as it did, we immediately cremated his father,” Raghubir adds.To date, a total of four persons who have died of Covid-19 have been cremated at the LPG crematorium.The most difficult cremation for them, however, was that of the six-month-old baby. “I have never cremated a child before. I was shocked that no family member accompanied the dead infant,” says Gulzar, adding, “She was brought here by the Red Cross workers.”Back home, these unsung heroes have their own share of troubles. “Since our relatives got to know about the work that we have been doing at the crematorium, they have started maintaining a distance from us, which is fine because these days everybody fears for their lives. But we are performing our duty, we too need to earn and run the family,” say the trio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/while-fear-hesitation-grip-chandigarh-residents-bidding-adieu-to-their-loved-ones-crematorium-workers-rise-to-the-occasion/story-llTSBdZmNswiOQrZxMoFtK.html

The school was scheduled to conduct the mid-term exams from March 16, but had to reschedule it after a lockdown was announced on March 22.Applauding the move, vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said, “To complete the academic requirements for the MSc and MPhil/PhD degrees, the School of Environmental Sciences, JNU has started the mid-semester exams using digital means from today (April 27) until May 4.”Last week, the varsity had given the approval for all schools and centres to hold the examinations in their preferred mode -- online, offline, or a combination of both. The School of Environmental Sciences is among the five schools that approved the online mode of examinations. Students who miss these exams can appear for it later as well.Shairik Sengupta, who is pursuing his masters from SES, was among those who wrote his mid-semester paper on Monday. “We received the question papers via email at around 8am and were given 24 hours to submit the answers. Though the questions I answered today were similar to our offline examinations, there have been concerns over the quality of questions in the remaining papers, especially since this is an open-book examination,” he said.The second-year MSc student also pointed out that many students did not take their study material with them when they left for their hometowns in the run up to the lockdown. “In addition to slow internet issues, students don’t even have their study material at home. For them, the online examination can be an issue,” he said.Another student, Saumya Awasthi, said students were also concerned about the submission of their dissertation. “The last day of submission is May 22 and our department has decided to not extend the dates. We need our laboratories to conduct experiments and collect data for our thesis. It is not possible to finish the work even if lockdown restrictions are lifted on May 3,” she said.Asking to postpone the semester, Raj Maurya, student councillor for SES, said, “This situation is particularly bad for the MSc final year students as they could not start their dissertation work due to the university strike against fee hike from October to January.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jnu-s-school-of-environment-studies-starts-online-exams/story-Vs3zcSC1iZzHPXFxfAg8fK.html

The police arrested seven persons in the case, including the girl’s father and the groom.According to Manish Sharma, senior manager of the NGO’s access to the justice department in Delhi, on April 25, he got a tip-off on his WhatsApp about a girl, a student of class 10 in a government-run school in Burari, being taken away by her father to get married in Haryana amid the lockdown.“The WhatsApp message I received was from an unknown number. It also mentioned the contact number of the girl’s father. I then shared the details with our Haryana state coordinator, who, in turn, informed the police and other state authorities,” said Sharma. As per a statement from the NGO, the state anti-human trafficking unit (AHTU) also took note and approached the police for help. The Sonepat police’s cyber-crime unit put the girls’ father’s phone on surveillance and tracked it down to the district’s Gohana village. “After being put on surveillance on April 26, it was found that the girl was married to a 27-year-old man late on the night ,of Akshay Tritiya. It has been a a long-standing tradition here, many people marry off their underage daughters on this day,” the NGO’s statement said. Subsequently, the police rounded up the suspects and rescued the girl. The girl was produced before the local Child Welfare Committee (CWC) whose members heard in detail the events leading to the arrests, it stated. Superintendent of Police (Sonepat) Jashandeep Singh Randhawa confirmed the arrests. “The minor has been rescued and seven people have been arrested in this connection,” he said.

The NGO in its statement further said, “It is now for the court to declare the ‘marriage’ null and void. The minor has been housed at a quarantine facility in Sonepat. The incident shows that children are not safe even with the lockdown and strict surveillance is required on the part of authorities in all states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/teen-girl-forcibly-married-to-27-yr-old-man-on-akshay-tritiya-rescued-7-booked/story-lQnAuku2vJz9HuokAxuHeM.html
27-04-2020||Lucknow||Sighting of rare dolphins increases in Ganga basins of West UP||With people practising social distancing and staying at home due to the Covid-19 lockdown, endangered Gangetic dolphins are returning to their habitats, all thanks to the reduced water pollution and less human activities across the river in West UP. Dolphins’ sighting has increased at different locations in upper Gangetic basin (168 km stretch of Ganges between in Bijnor and Narora of West UP). Aquatic lovers are even sharing dolphins’ sightings in fresh water on twitter and other social media platforms and sharing knowledge about these aquatic mammals.Sandeep Behra, a biodiversity expert and associated as consultant with National Clean Ganga Mission shares, “At least 40 plus dolphins have been sighted in upper Gangetic basin and it is due to less human activities and reduced pollution level in the river.” He said these dolphins can differentiate only dark and light, but can’t see. They use echolocation, often known as sonar, to see better underwater. They are also known as indicator of a robust river and mainly found at confluence of tributaries and other water bodies in river Ganga.Behra said in upper Gangetic basins--Karnwas and Aahar in Bulandshshar district, Pooth in Hapur, Tigri in Amroha and a near barrage in Bijnor district are favourite spots for spotting these dolphins, which have been declared “National Aquatic Animal”. Besides, 82 kms stretch of Ganges between Garh Muktesgwar and Narora was the first wetland of UP declared “Ramsar Site” in the year 2006 for conservation of these dolphins. Ramsar is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. The treaty was signed in 1971 in the city of Ramsar in Iran, and India is one of its signatories. Dr Behra said that not only in upper Gangetic basin, but the sighting of these dolphins has also been noticed close to Ghats in Kolkata after a long period of three decades. “These are not mere sightings but indications that how animals and human are associated with each other, and increased human activities have driven them away from us.”These highly endangered fresh water dolphins (a species different from marine dolphins) are facing multiple threats for their existence. Chemical seepage in river from riverbed farming, illegal fishing activities, rising level of pollution and poaching for their blubber are some major threats to these dolphins.Two months ago an adult dolphin was killed in Hastinapur area of Meerut district and injuries of piercing it with some sharp weapon was spotted on its body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/sighting-of-rare-dolphins-increases-in-ganga-basins-of-west-up/story-ldT2mN63qdkOZV8eVXRLlO.html
27-04-2020||Delhi||Mansara Apartment residents get some freedom after relieved of ‘containment zone’ tag||It was after nearly a month that residents of Mansara Apartments, in east Delhi’s Vasundhra Enclave, heaved a sigh of relief. Not finding layers of police barricades at their gates was a welcome change. On March 31, five days after a resident tested positive for the coronavirus, the complex that has around 85 families was declared a containment zone. That was when the Delhi government’s SHIELD protocol kicked in: Sealing with barricades and police at the gate with no entry or exit for residents or outsiders, home quarantine for all residents, isolation and tracing, essentials would be home delivered (at the gate), local sanitisation and door-to-door health checks.Those involved in essential services were allowed to move but their health too is strictly monitored.Last Friday, the Delhi government ordered lifting of restrictions after no fresh cases were recorded during the stipulated 28 days since the last positive case was detected.After staying locked up in their houses, sustaining on home deliveries from local grocery stores, residents finally stepped out on Saturday to purchase essential commodities. “I went out in the morning to get some milk and vegetables and it felt really nice. We know this freedom has come at a cost, so we are maintaining social distancing, wearing masks and taking all the precautions. This has, however, been a glimmer of hope for all of us in these tough times,” said Shailja Srivastava, a resident of the colony.The “freedom”, however, is not full as the Capital still is under lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. Government officials said they instructed the residents to use their judgment before stepping out.District magistrate (east), Arun Mishra said, “Though the apartment has been de-contained, we have asked the residents to refrain from moving out frequently to quell any chance of the virus spreading.”A senior Delhi police officer from the district, said, “We met with the residents’ welfare association (RWA) before the official announcement of de-containment was made. We told them that the situation for them might have eased but the general scenario in the city is still grim. There are some basic things, such as relying on home delivery services and restricting movement of people within the colony, that the residents must continue to follow,”The RWA released advisories to engage with their members and sought their cooperation in this regard. Sourabh Mukherjee, president of the RWA, said that they have relaxed the mandatory home delivery of essentials.“Today people went out to buy groceries and also stepped out for a walk within the society. But all these activities were done keeping social distancing in mind. We have also issued advisory regarding “dos and don’ts” for the residents. We have asked them to not step out unless it’s very important. We will follow all measures to avoid any possibility of the coronavirus disease spreading,” Mukherjee said.The local grocery shops say they will continue to offer home deliveries to the residents and also to all those nearby.“We are making nearly 40 to 50 deliveries everyday across all colonies here and all the shop owners selling essential commodities are trying to do our best to ensure that people do not have to step out. We will continue to do so,” said Vishal Agarwal, owner of a grocery store near Dharamshila Narayana Super Specialty Hospital, which is less than a kilometre away from Mansara Apartments.Arzoo Raj, a resident of Mansara Apartment in Vasundhara Enclave said that there was no fresh case reported from the locality so de-containment was a “required move”.“It is a welcome move. Regular screening of residents was being conducted ever since the society was declared a containment zone. Therefore no fresh cases appeared. The authorities helped us in getting essential items at our doorsteps. We still will take precautions and avoid going out of the society,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mansara-apartment-residents-get-some-freedom-after-relieved-of-containment-zone-tag/story-gfYVRcWeB5Reb0wOUITFhM.html

One takes care of the borders of the village while other three teams move around the village, counselling masses on the need to follow social distancing and staying indoors,” he added. “Whenever anyone is caught on CCTV roaming outside without any appropriate reasons, their name is called out on the public address system. They are then asked to stay indoors,” Chatar Singh, a villager of Upeda said. “In case any outsider enters our village, immediately the information reaches the authorities who quiz the visitor about the reason for his arrival. The outsiders are granted entry only if they give valid reasons,” he added. Lahadra with a population of 3,500 people is another village taking measures to prevent people against coronavirus infection. “All the entry points of the village are sealed by the youngsters of the village in the wake of Coronavirus. More than 30 youths are engaged in the ‘fight against Coronavirus’ in the village,” said Manoj Kumar, the 35 year old village head of Lahadra. “These youths move around in small batches to conduct door-to-door awareness sessions around the village,” he said. “Apart from that, all daily requirements for villagers are provided by these teams who have distributed WhatsApp numbers among the villagers asking them to list their routine requirements like milk, vegetables and ration which is delivered at the people’s doorstep,” he said. Kumar said that the villagers are cooperating by following the lockdown as people step out only in unavoidable circumstances. “To keep a check on entry points of the village, villagers are working in three shifts of 8 hours each and man these points. In case any outsiders wants to enter, villagers inform the police and health authorities before granting them entry,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/twin-west-up-villages-set-up-own-system-to-check-lockdown-violation/story-xB01xtc1IIn1zGLT7ypa5I.html

Even those who can pay are consciously considering the lockdown period as a fee-free period,” he said.The association members said teachers were giving their best despite hectic routines with online classes. They said schools have been successful in conducting such classes for students but they should not be made to bear unsustainable losses.Punj said schools were currently facing a cash crunch, making it difficult for managements to fulfill liabilities, such as salaries of teachers and other staff. Also, many schools have reported that pending fees of defaulters are yet to be recovered, he added.The association also took up transport issues, citing that there are certain fixed expenses incurred through the year, such as salaries of drivers, conductors and monthly EMI’s to be paid to banks, insurance and other taxes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unable-to-pay-salaries-panchkula-schools-call-for-govt-to-review-mandate-on-fees/story-J2RiDCVAnkMDKvolLMEKIP.html

They are collected for accurate results,” said Prof Tripathi.Prof Tripathi said, “We tested Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) level in the Ganga water samples. We found that the concentration of dissolved oxygen increased by 20 to 30 percent in Ganga water and the concentration of biochemical oxygen decreased from 35 to 40 percent. In total, Ganga pollution load has been decreased from 25 to 30 percent.” Prof Tripathi added that there has been a very positive effect on Ganga as the river shows that it can rejuvenate itself.Insisting that there were many reasons for the decrease in pollution in Ganga, he said the pollution has decreased because there was around 40 percent decrease in the number of bodies cremated at Manikarnika Ghat and Harishchandra Ghat. There is also a check on the immersion of half-burnt flesh content of cremated bodies in the river Ganga.Prof Tripathi said that at present the discharge of toxic effluent from more than 1,000 small scale and cottage industries and motor workshops is completely stopped in Ganga in Varanasi.Prof Tripathi further added that during the sampling of water from Ganga, the highest transparency was observed because fishes were seen swimming up to the depth of one meter from the surface of the Ganga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bhu-study-pollution-in-ganga-has-decreased-by-25-to-30-during-lockdown/story-ffyblTwG6csVQHTgu20u1O.html

27-04-2020||Chandigarh||Week on, Covid-19 concerns, strict norms keep most industries in Punjab shut||The easing of lockdown norms by the Union home ministry and state government has done little to get the industries on track in Punjab.A week after the Centre allowed industrial operations in non-containment areas with certain restrictions to restart economic activity, only 3,341, or say 1.32%, of the 2,52,741 registered units are working in the state, according to the latest information by the industries department. Of these industrial units, 2,650 were already running when the modified lockdown norms kicked in last week, while 691 have resumed production since.The remaining factory owners have been held back by the strict norms, disruption of supply chain and the prevailing business environment even as fresh Covid-19 cases continue to fuel fears in the state’s industrial hubs. Five industrial districts of Jalandhar, SAS Nagar (Mohali), Patiala, Ludhiana and Amritsar account for 73% of the total 330 infected cases so far.Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) president Upkar Singh Ahuja said that minimum 70% industry must be allowed in one go on all-India basis along with warehouses, industrial supplies, and smooth transportation of goods, otherwise manufacturing activity would not start due to shortage of raw material and components. “At the same time, sales outlets should be opened in compliance with social distancing norms. Workers should be allowed to commute to the factories on foot or on own two-wheelers individually,” he said, listing the measures needed to restart industrial activity in a phased manner.Seconding these views, Surinder Singh Chouhan, president of industrial focal point phase 6 in Ludhiana, said industry would find it difficult to resume operations till the entire supply chain, from availability of raw material to transportation and retail sale of products, is restored.Industries Director C Sibin said the state government was giving permission to all those who fulfilled the conditions, but not many industries located within the city limits in places such as Ludhiana were granted relaxations under the modified lockdown norms issued by the Centre. “Also, industry and district administration are cautions about Covid-19 related health concerns,” he said, stating reasons for the lukewarm response across the state.Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has, in a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, also urged to allow opening of small shops, businesses and industries in all areas except containment zones, giving an assurance that the state would comply with the norms to prevent the spread of Covid-19.In the state’s industrial hub of Ludhiana, 1,014 of the 95,202 units are operating currently. Of these, 413 factories had restarted operations during the initial 21-day lockdown (curfew in Punjab), which was extended by the Centre on April 14 for 19 more days, after the CM on March 29 had asked the industry to start operations to stop the exodus of migrant workers from the state.Similarly, only a few factories are working in the remaining districts with lower staff capacities. In SAS Nagar, 160 of the 15,564 industrial units are open. In Amritsar, which is home to 20,200 units, only 121 are running as of now.Balwinderpal Singh, general manager of district industries centre in Amritsar, said, “Being an old city, most factories are located within the urban limits. Those units located in rural areas, outside the municipal limits or in industrial zones are facing raw material availability and delivery issues,” he said, buttressing CICU’s contention.The Union home ministry had on April 15 issued detailed guidelines allowing factories in rural areas (outside the limits of municipal corporations and municipalities), special economic zones, industrial townships, and industrial estates, besides export-oriented units (EoUs), in non-Covid hotspots and containment zones to reopen from April 20 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/week-on-covid-19-concerns-strict-norms-keep-most-industries-in-punjab-shut/story-XpvCxIpHvEHHlT8H2RkewI.html

The group, formed on April 25, is headed by former planning commission chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and held its introductory meeting with the CM on Monday, via video-conference.Montek told the meeting that the group of experts that had co-opted two more members had been further divided into sub-groups of finance, agriculture, health, industry and social aid.Amarinder told the group that the state’s financial situation was grim, with monthly revenue losses to the tune of Rs 3,360 crore. This includes losses on account of GST (Rs 1,322 crore), state excise on liquor (Rs 521 crore), motor vehicle tax (Rs 198 crore), VAT on petrol and diesel (Rs 465 crore), electricity duty (Rs 243 crore), stamp duty (Rs 219 crore) and Non-tax Revenue (Rs 392 crore).The state’s cash inflows had completely dried up, said the CM, adding that power consumption had declined by 30%, casing a daily loss of Rs 30 crore. The state’s industry has been shut down, with less than 1% of working, he added. Group member and industrialist SP Oswal said the state and the industry were facing a hard time.Group’s deliberations afutile exercise: Bir DevinderFormer deputy speaker of Punjab Vidhan Sabha Bir Devinder Singh has claimed that the group’s deliberation will be a futile exercise. “It has no practical knowledge of Punjab’s problems; hence I am afraid that the deliberations of the expert group would merely be a futile exercise of optics without any cogent objectivity and meaningful delivery for the purpose it has been constituted,” he said.“How will the state government, or for that matter, the expert group, will ascertain and visualise a post-covid scenario, when you have no idea when Punjab would be free of the virus,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/manmohan-to-guide-punjab-s-expert-group-on-post-covid-revival-plan/story-fhIe35aSmYk4WX4y02WJZI.html

This section will be developed as 6-lane access controlled expressway along the existing alignment only,” the minister said. The expressway is aimed at promoting tourism by linking two major religious shrines, the Golden Temple in Amritsar and the Mata Vaishno Devi Temple in Katra of Jammu and Kashmir. Notably, the website of the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, shows that Amritsar district is not part of the execution plan of the project, which means the expressway bypasses the district in the alignment proposed. To this, the minister added, “The alignment approved by Punjab and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) provides the shortest, and express, connectivity to the cities of Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Sangrur, Patiala with the National Capital as well as to UT of J&K.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amritsar-will-be-joined-to-delhi-katra-expressway-singla/story-j5JxxU44afEJX2dvqgyOkN.html
27-04-2020||Lucknow||From resistance to cooperation: How attitude began to change in Kasaibada||A dual policy of reaching out to residents and going tough on lockdown violators is beginning to yield results in Sadar’s Kasaibada locality, the first to be declared a coronavirus hotspot in Lucknow.“As a result of the carrot and stick policy, more than 300 people from the area of Kasaibada have been tested and now there is no resistance to testing,” says Amit Mishra, chief executive officer of the Cantonment Board.“Initially we thought that police and administration would be able to handle the situation. But when we saw the inhabitants were not under control, we decided to be very strict with people who were creating problems for the authorities. We decided to go for aggressive testing in every house and anyone stopping that would be dealt with according to the law,” Mishra adds.Kasaibada area of Lucknow’s Sadar area was declared a hotspot when 12 jamaatis were found infected with the coronavirus on April 3. Later, 74 more people tested positive. About 3,000-4,000 residents of Kasaibada live in ghettos.“At the same time, we had to create awareness among the people and meet their daily needs like milk, bread and other food items. We arranged a community kitchen to ensure proper food distribution in every house in the presence of the local corporator and other influential people. We also motivated the residents to volunteer for testing as it was in their interest to do so. The corporator and influential people played their part perfectly,” Mishra says.At present, the authorities are distributing food to rozedars in the evening and encouraging them to get medically examined, says Mishra.However, some people still ventured outdoors, defying the lockdown and spat ‘deliberately’ on the road and then ran away. “We decided to go tough against these misguided people, who are trying to test the patience of the police. We used informants to record their acts on mobile phone cameras. We also used our CCTV network and drones to control such activities. Around 30 FIRs were lodged against troublemakers and 15 of them were arrested on the basis of evidence,” the CEO said.Local corporator Anjum Ara says, “Person-to-person contact while distributing food brought things in our favour. We not only supplied food but also medicines, fruits, and other household items. A WhatsApp group was also created and officials of the Cantonment Board, the district administration and police were included. People’s queries were answered. This swung the game in our favour and now residents are coming for tests on their own accord and have started maintaining social distancing.”The corporator also says, “After jamaatis were taken away, the lack of trust was visible as people were not happy with the police. But now they have befriended them as police are supplying food and medicine daily.”Taking the help of public representative worked, says district magistrate Abhishek Prakash. “Such interventions are required where people are less aware, less educated. We are confident we will control the coronavirus in the area soon,” he says.“For decades, the authorities shut their eyes to problems of the area, where certain pockets lack toilets and ventilation. Now it’s the time to address real issues like proper toilets and running water supply,” says Pramod Sharma, former vice-president, Cantonment Board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/from-resistance-to-cooperation-how-attitude-began-to-change-in-kasaibada/story-xcJQQc2Zbzbb7n4aLUfyFO.html
27-04-2020||City||STF recovers cash, drugs from Nabha ASI’s house||Two Punjab Police personnel, including an assistant sub-inspector and a constable, have booked for allegedly running drug business in connivance with drug peddlers during lockdown.A team of STF, led by deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Sukhamrit Singh, raided ASI Manjit Singh’s residence on Sunday night. Manjit is the chowki in-charge of Rohti Pull police station in Nabha.The team raided his house and office and recovered 5gm heroine, 15kg poppy husk, 250gm charas, 30 illicit liquor and Rs 2.7 lakh ‘drug money’.The cash was recovered from his house while the drugs were found from the residential quarter of the accused at the police station, STF AIG Gurpreet Singh told HT.ASI Manjit Singh and constable Gagandeep Singh have been booked at Mohali STF police station for alleged involvement in drug trade under the NDPS Act and under Sections 213 and 166 of the IPC. Both the accused are absconding.IG STF Balkar Singh Sidhu said said that the accused cops used set drug smugglers free in exchange of money. They used to seize the drugs from the smugglers and keep it with themselves.“The accused cops caught two drugs smugglers Barinder Singh and Manjit Kaur on April 24 and let them go after setting deal for releasing Barinder for Rs 2.5 lakh and Manjit Kaur for Rs 1 lakh,” the IG said.The STF said two days back, both the cops had taken in possession the car of a drug smuggler and demanded money to release the vehicle.Police have recovered the cash taken in exchange of the vehicle and recovered the car.Senior superintendent of police Mandeep Singh Sidhu said both the accused cops have been dismissed from the service with immediate effect.“We will not tolerate such elements. Further punitive action will be initiated against the two,” the SSP said.One of the officials, privy to the investigation, said “The accused ASI shares cordial relations with the personal assistant of a Congress leader. Investigation is on as we are collecting more information on call records of the accused.”The Rohti Pull police station is situated at Rohti Chhanna village, where many residents have been booked under the NDPS Act. The area is infamous for illicit activities.People of the surrounding villages have protested over this on multiple occasions and raised questions on the working of police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stf-recovers-cash-drugs-from-nabha-asi-s-house/story-lwO8AQ6DWOiH2zKcMs3KkL.html
27-04-2020||Chandigarh||Rohtak PGI to explore TB vaccine’s efficacy to tackle Covid||Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak in Haryana will shortly start clinical trials to research the efficacy of a tuberculosis vaccine, the recombinant Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), to potentially protect people from the novel coronavirus.The development is significant in present times when the need to have an antidote to tackle the fast spread of respiratory illness is being looked for. The BCG vaccine protects against tuberculosis and is administered to newborn infants in the country.Professor of pharmacology at the institute, Savita Verma who is the primary investigator for clinical trials said that the drug controller general of India (DCGI) has granted them the permission to hold a clinical trial for the rBCG. “We have also obtained regulatory permissions from the ethics committee of the PGIMS,’’ she said.Head of the pulmonary and critical care medicine at PGIMS Professor Dhruva Chaudhary who is also a part of the clinical trial team said the trials are aimed to find out whether rBCG boosts immunity and can decrease the incidence or severity of symptoms in patients infected with the coronavirus.Professor Chaudhary who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 at PGIMS said that BCG was developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, but studies have shown its ability to induce potent protection against other infectious diseases.“A favorable effect has been observed in studies on BCG for distinct viral pathogens like the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common respiratory virus which causes mild, cold-like symptoms,” Prof Chaudhary said.Prof Verma said rBCG is a live vaccine against tuberculosis and is based on the well known BCG strain used since 1921 and administered approximately four billion times worldwide. “As BCG is not sufficiently effective to stop the spread of tuberculosis, two modifications have been implemented in rBCG to improve its immunogenicity. Thus it is believed to be an appropriate means for improving the induction of immunity,’’ she said.The PGIMS research team said due to the capacity of BCG to reduce the incidence of respiratory tract infections in children, they hypothesise that this vaccination may induce some protection against the susceptibility to or severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.What are clinical trials The World Health Organization (WHO) says clinical trials are a type of research that studies new tests and treatments and evaluates their effects on human health outcomesPeople volunteer to take part in clinical trials to test medical interventions including drugs, cells and other biological productsThe trials are carefully designed, reviewed and completed, and need to be approved before they can startrBCG trials at PGIMS will be done on above 18 individuals who have come in contact with Covid-19 patients and include health care workersInformed consent will be taken by the institute from every person involved in the trial||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rohtak-pgi-to-explore-tb-vaccine-s-efficacy-to-tackle-covid/story-bzcf7eTp0WIKIAmsN1l8IK.html
27-04-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow: Lack of piped water, narrow lanes evoke concern in Sadar’s Kasaibada||The fight against Covid-19 is quite tough in Sadar’s Kasaibada locality, more so because of a lack of piped water supply in illegal brick houses that have mushroomed along the railway track in the area over the years.Running water is essential to wash one’s hands with soap for at least 20 seconds as this is an effective way to keep the Sars-Cov-2 pathogen at bay.The lack of running water is not the only matter of concern as these illegal houses don’t have toilets in them. Although the Cantonment Board has constructed public toilets and mobile toilets, most slum-dwellers still relieve themselves beside drains or the railway track. Despite the area being open defecation free, residents of Sadar’s Kasaibada just have one toilet per 200 people.The area was declared a hotspot on April 3 after 12 Tablighi Jamaat members were found infected with the coronavirus. Since then, 74 more people have tested positive in Sadar, Kasaibada.Arif, a resident of Kasaibada, says, “A number of houses in narrow lanes across the railway track are illegally constructed. They don’t have access to proper civic amenities and basic hygiene.”Another resident Abid says, “Lack of awareness about sanitation, modern education in slums of Kasaibada in Sadar are making things difficult.”Most of the slum-dwellers are butchers and vegetable vendors. Some of the houses are situated on two- feet wide streets and have very little ventilation with narrow drainage giving an open invitation to disease.“The houses are so small that it is not possible for anyone to isolate family members in case of an infection. They don’t have space, no separate rooms for home quarantine,” says Anjum Ara, the local corporator.She says, “Initially, they were taking the coronavirus infection like any other infection because they did not know about the havoc caused by the virus in Wuhan, China. They were under the impression that they would remain unaffected by the virus as they have better immunity than others.”“Earlier, many residents were not cooperating with the health officials because there was a trust deficit. Secondly, none of them wanted to be quarantined, if they tested positive,” she says.Cantonment Board chief executive officer Amit Mishra, who has supervised the work in this hotspot, says, “Our staff has entered the lanes, where no one dared to go in the past. It has been possible with perfect cooperation among the district administration, the police and the Cantonment authorities. We cleaned all the drains. We are cleaning the lanes regularly. Sanitisation is ensured daily. We have sealed entry points from the railway tracks. The shanties of butchers, where animals used to be slaughtered illegally in the past, have been seized.”He says, “We have ensured water supply in houses allotted to butchers, but the illegal houses along the railway track don’t have piped water supply. We have now put pressure on them to use public toilets and mobile toilets, but many of them still relieve themselves beside drains and the railway track. Awareness about basic hygiene is being created through corporators and influential people,” he says.He says, “The presence of security personnel, cameras, drones and lodging of FIRs against some people has also instilled the fear of law among hooligans who used to pelt people with stones and disappear inside narrow lanes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lucknow-lack-of-piped-water-narrow-lanes-evoke-concern-in-sadar-s-kasaibada/story-RxcFP5qY521NDHbc9sDReL.html

Karnal deputy commissioner (DC) Nishant Kumar Yadav on Monday paid surprise visit to district grain markets and directed the officials of procurement agencies to speed up the lifting process to ease the procurement operations.The DC also made it clear that strict action will be taken against those agencies which fail to lift wheat from the mandis as per the schedule. As per the reports from the Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board officials, about 40% of the procured wheat was still lying in the mandis.The heaps of wheat in the mandis have created a glut and the farmers are not getting enough space to unload their produce. The DC issued directions to the mandi secretaries to cancel the license of those commission agents who are found violating the norms of the procurement. Notices have been issued to 14 commission agents for not following the lockdown instructions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/procurement-agencies-to-face-action-for-tardy-lifting-in-karnal/story-DV5K5rflRvsKAjOytV5uTN.html

As per the protocol of Indian Council of Medical Research, private labs need to provide reports within 24-hours. But due to the mismanagement on the part of the private laboratory, they aren’t submitting the reports within the stipulated time. “It is up to ICMR to suspend any lab’s license to run the test. So, under our jurisdiction, we can only send show cause notices seeking an explanation,” said Dr Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.As HT had reported earlier, several private labs are providing reports 2-3 days late. In a recent example, a 27-year-old nine month pregnant woman from Grant Road had to wait for four days to get her report from a private laboratory for admission in a hospital for her delivery. Her samples were taken on April 11 and the reports came on April 13.Chandrasekar Mani, vice-president of Thyrocare didn’t respond to calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-sends-show-cause-notice-to-thyrocare-for-late-report/story-3JiiyNl1dpsU74846czG1O.html

This is to express my concern for my country and especially my border people. Being BDC chairperson of Nyoma block, it is my responsibility to inform that a few days ago, 50km away from Demchok village, there was movement of around 300 vehicles in China-occupied Tashi Gang region. Even aircraft movement was heard in our area. The heavy vehiclular movement is happening in their own region, but why now when the whole world is in war against Covid-19?” she had stated in the Facebook post on Monday morning.Urgain also cited a report on how China had placed an order of 2,00,000 body bags from Taiwan.“It might be possible that they are planning to dump the bodies in that barren region, which is so close to our border. If that is the case, then dumping so many bodies may spread the virus through different carriers of air, water and migratory animals,” she had stated.“Even if it’s not about their Covid-19 victims, what is the big urgency of doing all this during this critical time? It is my plea to the government and policy makers to investigate this urgent matter,” she had added.Before withdrawing her post, Urgain had told HT that she had sent messages regarding the Chinese activity to BJP MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal and the Leh deputy magistrate.“There is something fishy and the government needs to investigate it,” she remarked.BJP MP Namgyal said he has forwarded the BDC chairperson’s messages to the ministries concerned in Delhi.“She had sent me messages on WhatsApp and I forwarded them to the ministries concerned. At the same time, I am trying to reach out to a few more people on the ground in Nyoma for counter verification (of her claims) before officially writing anything to the ministries,” said Namgyal.However, Ladakh divisional commissioner Saugat Biswas dubbed Urgain’s claims as “unverified reports”.Leh deputy magistrate Sachin Kumar Vaishya didn’t respond to calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bdc-chairperson-flags-chinese-activity-in-ladakh-s-demchok-later-withdraws-post/story-RmANIYvWfS9tpUPBQCJfZN.html

27-04-2020||Chandigarh||Free ration rumour triggers commotion in Chandigarh’s Hallomajra||After Mauli Jagran, huge commotion was witnessed in a locality of Hallomajra in Chandigarh after rumours of free ration distribution spread in the area on Monday morning. The police had a tough time dispersing the crowd that gathered there assuming that ration was being distributed near a government dispensary by the UT administration. However, no such announcement was made.Police public relations officer (PRO) DSP Charanjit Singh Virk said, “As checked from the assistant superintendent of police (south zone), the incident was triggered by a rumour. As soon as we got to know, the public that had gathered was sent back. We will take legal action against those involved behind spreading these rumours.”WAITING FOR RATIONUT department of food supplies and consumer affairs began free ration distribution to 63,616 identified beneficiaries on April 10 but in Hallomajra, approximately 3,000 beneficiaries have been awaiting free ration to date.HT accessed a letter written by a para legal volunteer, Dalip Kumar, of Chandigarh State Legal Services Authority to UT administration on April 20 in which he mentioned that ration distribution in the area must be speeded up since it has a lot of poor families who are struggling to manage enough food amid the lockdown. Area councillor Bharat Kumar said department secretary Vinod P Kavle had assured last Thursday that ration distribution will start from Saturday, but he still had no communication from the department.“Such commotion was bound to happen since residents’ patience has been running thin. Most of the people living in Hallomajra are labourers and daily wagers who have gone unemployed due to the lockdown. Similar rush was seen earlier too but distribution has yet not begun. I request authorities to speed it up as it is already over a month and no supply has reached the area,” Kumar said.However, when contacted, Kavle said that there was no such assurance from the department. “The date for distribution is being finalised after consulting stakeholders concerned,” he said, adding that 40,000 eligible families (63%) have already been distributed wheat and pulses in the city, and around 23,500 were yet to be covered.Another department official anonymously said people should not fall victim to wrong information. “We issue distribution plan and coupons in advance before providing ration to any area,” he said. OPPN QUESTIONS DELAY Meanwhile, local Congress president Pardeep Chhabra questioned the delay in reaching out to poor people. “The UT must deploy additional staff and cover all areas as the poor are facing hardships,” said Chhabra, while saying that local BJP MP Kirron Kher had ignored the public in these difficult times.“Kher, who should have come forward and stood shoulder to shoulder with the public, has been missing for almost a month now. It was only after the public started questioning her absence that she chose to release a video on social media full of political rhetoric and directionless comments,” said Chhabra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/free-ration-rumour-triggers-commotion-in-chandigarh-s-hallomajra/story-tEr2MhtNB4Srj4c7V3DGtK.html

Following their arrest on Sunday, the police had recovered two country-made pistols with magazines, six live cartridges and two bullet shells from them. “As per the initial interrogation it has been learnt that the accused had procured the country-made pistols from Uttar Pradesh’s grey market,” said an official on the condition of anonymity.On Sunday, a team of Mohali police had received a tip-off that the prime accused in an attempt to murder case, Harsimran, alias Simu, of Naraingarh (Ambala), and his aides — Dhruv Mohan Garg of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, Gurcharan Singh, alias Gunna, of Parwala village in Raipur Rani, and Gurpreet Singh, alias Gopi, of Derabassi — were hiding in Billa village, following which a raid was conducted.An official privy to the investigation said both Keshav and Satwinder knew one of the gangsters, Dhruv Garg, which is why they helped them get an accomodation in the village. “The duo knew that the accused persons were outlaws. The gangsters had rented the place before the lockdown began and had even disappeared for a couple of days in between. They did not get any police verification done nor was a rent agreement signed,” said the official.The times when the gangsters would not be able to sneak out to get food from nearby dhabas, the two locals even arranged meals for them. Both Keshav and Satwinder have been booked under Section 216 (harbouring offender who has escaped from custody or whose apprehension has been ordered) of the Indian Penal Code.Meanwhile, after getting the gangster’ remand, police said they will interrogate them on the source of weapons and about other accomplices and connections. As per the officials, accused Simu and Gunna were involved in the Mohali attempt to murder case that dates back to March 11, when 22-year old milkman, Kamalpreet Singh of Chachumajra village in Kharar, was shot at in Mohali’s Phase 9 by three motorcycle-borne persons owing to a college-time rivalry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-after-arrest-of-four-gangsters-in-panchkula-two-local-men-held-for-harbouring-them/story-5hkyDrYNhkvMEtWjE5EFSN.html

He also reiterated the state’s demand for assistance to MSMEs and power generation and distribution companies by way of interest subvention, deferment of loans by commercial banks and reduction in GST on coal.“A revenue grant for the next three months, with flexibility to spend as per local conditions, would help tide over the acute fiscal crisis faced due to revenue shortfall,” the CM wrote, reiterated his suggestion that 15th finance commission should review its report for the current year. “The 15th Finance Commission should recommend devolution of funds for five years beginning from April 1, 2021 (instead of 2020) onwards, after factoring in the impact of the pandemic,” the CM suggested.He also demanded a special risk insurance of police personnel and sanitary workers engaged in fight against the pandemic and relief for daily wage and industrial labourers, who have lost their jobs, in the form of Universal Basic Income of Rs 6,000 per month.Other key demands included: payment of 15 days unemployment allowance per month for three months under MGNREGS to mitigate distress of rural poor; allowing 10-day wages under MGNREGS to small and marginal farmers; and allowing use of 14th finance commission grants by urban local bodies (ULBs) and panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) for emergency relief.The CM also demanded Rs 729 crore for upgrade of health infrastructure, as well as permission to set up an advanced centre of virology at New Chandigarh.Strap/BlurbAmong other issues, Amarinder seeks release of Punjab’s GST arrears of Rs 4,386 cr and bonus to farmers for staggered purchase of wheat||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/allow-opening-of-small-shops-biz-and-industries-capt-to-shah/story-7DcThiywfdO9f4Vmzf8H2N.html

27-04-2020||City||Lockdown hits Mohali MC, left with funds to pay just 3-month salaries||As Mohali’s municipal commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg took charge as its administrator on Monday, he faces a herculean task. Owing to a cash crunch, the MC has only ₹22 crore in its kitty, just enough to pay salaries of employees for the next three months. The nationwide lockdown has made the problem worse, as MC cannot collect dues and taxes which could have generated funds for the civic body.With Mohali MC’s five-year term getting over on April 26, powers will be vested with new MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg from Monday. The posts of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor have been dissolved.Amid scarce funds, more than 200 tenders of development works worth ₹30 crore have not been allotted in the past six months. The works pertain to development of parks, laying of paver blocks, foot paths, re-carpeting of roads and installing gyms in parks.Even in December last year, after failing to spend ₹9 crore allocated under various heads, Mohali MC re-appropriated the budget to shift the surplus funds to account heads with a deficit.MC Commissioner of Mohali, Kamal Kishore said, “We are just left with ₹22 crore with which we can only pay employees’ salaries for three months. We have asked the state government for funds to carry out some development works. Moreover, the lockdown has put an end to activities such as collecting property tax, water bills, advertisement fees and more, which has further aggravated the financial issue, he said. Every month, the civic body spends ₹5 crore on paying salaries, power bills, fuel charges and private agency maintaining cleanliness in city.On the other hand, members of all 65 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) of Mohali are sour with the MC not paying for maintenance of parks. CL Garg, the president of confederation of Greater Mohali RWAs, apex body of 65 RWAs, said, “We have been paying gardeners from our own pockets for the past three months. But the MC has assured it will clear the dues,” he said.Even Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has failed to pay Rs 191 crore to the municipal corporation (MC) of Mohali. As per an agreement signed in 2017, GMADA was to pay ₹200 crore every year to MC for maintenance of 540 parks, roads and streetlights. However, in the past three years, it has only paid ₹9 crore to the civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-hits-mohali-mc-left-with-funds-to-pay-just-3-month-salaries/story-fDwJd3XJ7DhHIs9AwLO6oJ.html
27-04-2020||Mumbai||HC asks state to justify claim of Covid-19 spreading through newspapers||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) rapped the state for making sweeping statements that the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, could spread through newspaper distribution and hence should not be allowed. The court held that the state should substantiate its claim with evidence and the opinion of experts rather than making such statements. The court was hearing a suo moto public interest litigation (PIL) following news reports of door-to-door distribution of newspapers being barred by the government.The single bench of justice Prasanna Varale, while hearing the petition on Monday, was informed by amicus curiae advocate Satyajeet Bora that following the April 20 news report which read “Maharashtra allows printing but bans distribution of newspapers”, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court had also taken cognizance of the issue and passed an order on April 20.Referring to the April 18 order of the government, which restricted door-to-door delivery of newspapers and magazines as a precautionary measure to curb the spread of Covid-19, government pleader DR Kale informed the court that the order was amended on April 21 and door-to-door distribution was allowed across the state except in Mumbai, Pune, and other containment zones.Kale justified the April 18 order through an affidavit, stating that experts had opined that the virus remained on surfaces for some time and hence, newspapers could be a medium for spreading.In the absence of any data or proof to justify the statement in the affidavit, the court said, “It seems that this is only a general and sweeping statement made in the affidavit in reply. There is no reference to any comment of the experts in the field or any opinion formed by anybody working in the health area.”The court, however, added that the state could consider restricting door-to-door delivery of newspapers in particular areas and asked the government to file an additional response to its queries along with a report by amicus curiae Bora. The case has been posted for hearing on June 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-asks-state-to-justify-claim-of-covid-19-spreading-through-newspapers/story-ZFKmKjOj2gbPylMt1aMppK.html

27-04-2020||City||Covid-19: Punjab institutes design containment box for protecting frontline healthcare workers||The Indian Institute of Technology(IIT) Ropar and Dayanand Medical College and Hospital(DMCH), Ludhiana, have designed a containment box for protecting frontline healthcare workers fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.The aerosol containment box that can be manufactured out of readily available materials was jointly developed by Dr Ashish Sahani from IIT Ropar along with Dr Vivek Gupta and Dr GS Wander from DMCH.According to Dr Sahni, coughing, sneezing or aerosol generating procedure in the Covid-19 patients leads to spread of heavy viral load among healthcare workers. Despite using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and taking appropriate precautions, the healthcare workers get infected with coronavirus, due to which a higher than normal infection rate has been noted among them, he added.He said that containment box could be quickly made out of commonly available resources such as wood, thick poly-vinyl chloride (PVC) sheets, velcro and pasting and fixing materials. This box has a design that can allow it to be converted into a negative pressure chamber by connecting the vacuum from wall-gas supplies, which are readily available in most of the hospitals, said Dr Sahni, adding that aerosol particles are passed through a micron-level filter before being passed out to atmospheric air, which are standard fittings in majority hospitals.He further said that the containment box has been tested at DMCH for its aerosol containment capability. “Patient comfort has been validated through volunteers lying with the box over their heads for more than one hour. They didn’t feel claustrophobic and their oxygen saturation levels remained normal throughout the test,” he added. He also said that the advantage of the design was that it could be made and deployed easily by the hospitals themselves without depending on any external supply chains, many of which were broken due to lockdown in ever part the country. Dr Sahani, Dr Gupta and Dr Wander hope that the design will be adopted by the hospitals in order to provide additional layer of protection to frontline healthcare workers fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. They are willing to offer help for quick adoption of this technology, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-punjab-institutes-design-containment-box-for-protecting-frontline-healthcare-workers/story-N5Z1n2fPq0Zbf8Ss5w2iDL.html

The participants have opined that the lockdown is likely to deeply impact Indian businesses if the economy isn’t opened soon. More than four-fifths of the respondents said the Government of India should consider staggered opening of the economy post May 3, to put it back on growth track and at the same time, control the spread of the virus. When asked to rank pressing challenges faced by India Inc, a majority (58%) of the respondents cited liquidity crunch as their biggest concern, followed by supply chain bottlenecks and labour shortage.Also, majority of the respondents expect significant decrease in their companies’ topline and bottom-line during the year 2020-21. More than 10% fall in employment opportunities is also expected.The CEOs also said they expect government support in the payment of wages to industries impacted by the lockdown along with a waiver of fixed utility charges and low interest rates.Commenting on the poll, Nikhil Sawhney, chairman, CII Northern Region, said, “The results indicate the mood of Indian industries. The MSME sector that provides significant amount of employment opportunities will need stimulus from the government to get back up on its feet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/northern-industries-body-for-staggered-opening-of-economy-from-may-3/story-xO3YjFHp2IqooRPKFECkuJ.html

27-04-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank fraud case: Wadhawans sent to CBI custody till Wednesday||The special CBI court on Monday remanded Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan of Diwan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) in Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) custody till April 29. The lawyer for the brother objected to the custodial interrogation of both calling their arrest as illegal. The court held that the investigation is at a primary stage and therefor detailed investigation is necessary to reach a proper conclusion. The court also refused to entertain the bail plea of the accused observing that it cannot be considered at this stage as they both are remanded to CBI custody.Two brothers were arrested by the CBI from their bungalow in Mahabaleshwar on Sunday afternoon and were brought to Mumbai. On Monday morning the agency produced the two before the special court and sought their custody for eight days.The CBI prosecutor Ashok Bagoria, argued that the case is of serious nature relating to a huge amount. The prosecution alleged that the accused are linked with a former senior officer of Yes Bank – Rana Kapoor. The prosecution also submitted that they were issued notice to join investigation but they failed followed by which CBI had to obtain a warrant against the two.According to the CBI FIR, between April and June 2018, Yes Bank invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures of DHFL, which is till date not redeemed. It is further alleged that Yes Bank had sanctioned loan to RKW developers, where Dheeraj is a director and the whole amount was siphoned off by Kapil. CBI has alleged that In return, Wadhawan allegedly “paid a kickback of ₹600 crore” to Kapoor and family members in the form of loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd.The plea was objected by Wadhawan’s lawyer Amit Desai and Subodh Desai. They pleaded that the arrest of the accused is unconstitutional and illegal, hence there is no question of sending them to CBI custody. Further, the defence pleaded for bail of the two.The defence pleaded that the prosecution obtained an arrest warrant without informing them. It was pointed out that the execution of the warrant was stayed by the special court till May 5. In between the stay was lifted by the special CBI court on April 25. The defence pleaded that the order of the special court lifting stay is illegal, hence Desai pleaded that the demand for CBI custody of Wadhawan brothers be rejected.After hearing the prosecution and the defence argument, special judge AS Sayyad observed, “From the case papers it appears that Rana Kapoor, who is proprietor, director and chief executive officer of M/s Yes bank limited entered into a criminal conspiracy with the present accused for extending financial assistance to their respective companies and allegedly obtained undue pecuniary advantage from M/S DHFL from the companies of the accused.”The court rejected the argument of the defence that the order dated April 25 lifting the stay on the execution of the arrest warrant is illegal. The court held that the order of April 25 was not to be stayed or set aside by the higher court, hence it is still in existence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-case-wadhwans-sent-to-cbi-custody-till-wednesday/story-VU9qNvGtcRtwTdSrVNMMIP.html

27-04-2020||Mumbai||HC extends stay on publication of first merit list for PG medical admissions||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday extended the stay on publication of Maharashtra’s first merit list for admissions to postgraduate (PG) medical courses till May 5. The list was scheduled to be published on April 24.Justice Ujjal Bhuyan on Monday continued the stay order passed last week by justice SJ Kathawalla on separate petitions filed by two PG aspirants through advocate Madhav Thorat.One of the petitioners, Dr Rajdeep Deshmukh, has sought admission to a non-surgical PG course through the physically handicapped category, as he is affected by a congenital deformity which has led to the shortening of his index and middle fingers.Dr Deshmukh moved the HC after he was declared ineligible for admissions to the course. He contended that despite the deformity, the functional capacity of his upper limbs is very strong and he can carry out routine activities without difficulty.“In other words, he does not have any functional impairment of upper limbs in as much as there is only shortening of the fingers and not the absence of limb or fingers,” stated his petition.According to Thorat, Dr Deshmukh was admitted to the MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) course through the physically-handicapped category, pursuant to the order passed by the HC.The second petitioner, Dr Abhinav Bhute, has challenged the government resolution (GR) issued by the medical education department on March 19 last year, granting only 4℅ additional weightage to in-service candidates who have worked in rural areas, instead of the 10℅ weightage given by the Medical Council of India (MCI).Thorat had earlier pointed out that the MCI had in April 2018 issued a notification granting 10℅ additional weightage per year of service, subject to a cap of 30℅, to candidates serving in tribal areas, difficult terrains, and rural areas.Bhute has served in rural areas for six years and accordingly, sought 30℅ additional weightage last year. When the department refused to give him the 30% weightage, he moved the HC. The court had on March 12, 2019, directed the state government to extend additional weightage as contemplated by MCI notification to in-service candidates who have served in rural areas. Despite the HC’s direction, the department refused to give the 30% weightage to Bhute, Thorat had added. The petitions will now come up for further hearing on May 5 and the stay will continue till then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-extends-stay-on-publication-of-first-merit-list-for-pg-medical-admissions/story-LOG2X0XqHsxFGQ6agJONOL.html

Some of them have even written to the civic authorities and political leaders, asking for a change in the market hours in their locality.“People are finding it difficult to get food. If we are fasting all day, we will need good healthy things to eat in the night after we break our fast. But none of the shops or eateries are allowed to stay open then. We need some sleep after sehri [early morning meal], so by the time we wake up, markets are already shut. This will lead to more problems eventually,” said Aslam Malkani, a resident of Marine Lines.Some community leaders have suggested that families could purchase fruits and other essentials and for the entire week, instead of stepping out daily.“One can even break the fast by having a pinch of salt and dates. These are testing times and Ramzan teaches us to be patient even in testing times,” said Sohail Khandwani, trustee of the Mahim and Haji Ali dargahs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/muslim-groups-demand-evening-market-hours-to-buy-food-to-break-fast/story-xbJvyOhPntLuXVLMLBvCBN.html
27-04-2020||Mumbai||Education department braces for challenges in junior college admissions||Even as the state education department has announced the cancellation of the last paper of SSC exams, it now faces the challenge of planning for the first-year junior college admissions (FYJC) amidst the Covid-19 lockdown. With some boards completing its exams and decision still pending on the conduct of exams in other boards, equivalence of marks while taking admissions will be a concern.In a recent meeting between officials of various boards and education department, FYJC issues were discussed. The admission process usually begins in June. “The status of all the three key boards- SSC, CBSE and ICSE, is different in case of Class 10 exams. While SSC board has cancelled its last papers and the CBSE has completed its main exams, ICSE is yet to come up with a decision on the remaining papers. This might lead to issues concerning the equivalence of marks. For this, the government would have to come up with a plan,” said an official, who was present at the meeting. “These issues, however, can be resolved later, depending on how things pan out,” he added.Vaishali Bafna, from the System Correcting Movement (SYSCOM), a Pune-based think-tank, said that the government would have to come up with a concrete plan to ensure that no student has an added advantage. “To take a call, they first have to see how the remaining papers for other boards are conducted. Since students from other boards are only a small per cent of the overall applications, having a common policy should not be very difficult,” said Bafna. Meanwhile, parents from the state are now requesting the Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry to reduce the syllabus for Classes 1 to 12, owing to the current situation in the country. “Students will be under a lot of pressure to study the entire syllabus once schools reopen,” said Anubha Sahai, president of the India Wide Parents Association, who wrote to the ministry on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/education-department-braces-for-challenges-in-junior-college-admissions/story-LI1lsptEM1XdZQ6hfLXwiM.html

They then blocked the path of my car with their two-wheeler. The pillion rider hit the right-side driver window several times and after realising that the car windows were up, the pillion rider removed a liquid bottle from his pocket and threw liquid on the driver’s side of the car where I was sitting,” Goswami said in his complaint.He also said that the attackers were apprehended by Mumbai Police protection team.In his complaint, Goswami pointed fingers at the Congress and mentioned a tweet by party leader Alka Lamba “just three hours after the attack”.At the same time, Congress leaders also filed FIR’s against Arnab across the country for pointing fingers at Sonia Gandhi in the Palghar lynching incident. One cased filed at Nagpur was transferred to NM Joshi Marg police station for inquiry.

These courses have been on for over a week now and the college, as the same time, is also conducting webinars for their students as well as interested students of other institutions on career calls and higher education opportunities.Similarly, the management of Shri Vile Parle Kelvani Mandal (SVKM) has started online training for the staff of all the institutes under their aegis. “We have also encouraged our staff to look up other new and interesting courses that could help enhance their understanding of any chosen subject and submit a report on the same by May 3,” said Anju Kapoor, principal of Usha Pravin Gandhi College, Vile Parle, a part of the SVKM group.The union government has already released recommendations by two separate expert committees, both suggesting online exams in July followed by start of the new 2020-21 academic year by September this year. However, experts have pointed at the fact that online exams will not be possible for colleges and universities set up in rural India as many students will have no access to computers or internet. At present, Maharashtra state government is yet to announce their final call on what lies ahead for higher education institutes and students.“Since the future is uncertain, we have been encouraging students to keep opting for all the free online courses made available by the union human resource development (HRD) ministry.

27-04-2020||Chandigarh||People turn to deities in HP for answers to Covid-19 as temples give freely to CM’s relief fund||Its mountains almost touching the heavens and its numerous ruling deities truly make Himachal Pradesh dev bhoomi (land of the gods), and now, with the battle against Covid-19 getting fiercer, people are turning to temples and the gods and goddesses for aid… and answers, as they have done through centuries during a crisis or calamity.Last week two temples, Baba Balak Nath shrine in Hamirpur and Chinmastika Dham or Chintpurni Temple, one of the state’s richest shrines and an important Shakti peetha (spiritual power centre), donated Rs 5 crore each to the chief minister’s Covid-19 relief fund Two other major temples, Jawalaji and Brajeshwari Devi in Kangra district are proposing to donate Rs 1 crore and Rs 50 lakh, respectively, again to the state’s coffers.Temples across Rohru and Jubbal have opened their treasuries for the second time after the Sino-India war in 1962, when the country faced a financial crunch.Deity speak: Wait for a monthDeities, speaking through their gurs or priests, who also act as interlocutors between the gods and devotees, have predicted that Covid-19 will continue to spread for another month. Some have blessed rice to be distributed in villages. “We had invoked the local deity Jaga Mata, believed to be the manifestation of Lord Krishna’s mother Devaki, and she predicted that the impact of virus will reduce in the coming month but it will continue to wreak havoc for a few years,” says Vinod Boris, kardar or manager of the Mahasu Mandir Committee in Balsa, Shimla. “The deities have decreed that rice be given to every person in the village to protect them from the virus.”In Kullu the committee of kardars had invoked the town’s supreme deity, Hadimba mata, wife of Pandava Bhim, who presides over the Hadimba Temple in Manali, which was built by Maharaja Bahadur Singh in 1553. “People here have firm faith in the goddess, she has vowed to protect us and our people in Kullu valley,” says Jai Dev Thakur, head of the Kullu Devi Devta Kardar Sangh, an association of a committee which manages various temples across Kullu. They are also donating cash and other relief material.The temple committee in Gothan village in Theogh, which has the influential Dhoom Devta as its principal deity, has decided to donate a ventilator to Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) in Shimla. “We will shortly donate a ventilator to IGMC,” says Madan Lal Verma head of the temple committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/people-turn-to-deities-in-hp-for-answers-to-covid-19-as-temples-give-freely-to-cm-s-relief-fund/story-pwRgVwNnCX5AjLlAiEVGVM.html

27-04-2020||City||Jai Ram Thakur favours lockdown extension beyond May 3||SHIMLA: Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Monday said lockdown should continue beyond May 3 to contain the spread of coronavirusPrime Minister Narendra Modi earlier held a video conference with the CM to discuss the situation arising due to Covid-19.Thakur also demanded more ventilators for the state hospitals. PM Modi appreciated the HP government for its efforts to fight Covid-19 and undertaking an Active Case Finding Campaign that helped screen the entire population of the state for Influenza-like illness.During the video conferencing with the chief ministers, PM also urged other states to emulate initiatives taken by Himachal Pradesh in the battle against coronavirus.He also urged all states to follow HP in this initiative to combat the pandemic and motivate their people to download Arogya Setu App which would help in detecting active coronavirus carriers.Meanwhile, Thakur urged PM Modi to provide an adequate number of ventilators to the state to meet any emergent situation.He said that pharma units in the state have started operations and were trying to meet the demand of medicines in the state and the country.“However, about 80% of pharma units in the state are in the micro, small and medium enterprises sector, so the Union government should provide all possible help to ensure a smooth supply of chemical and raw material.Thakur said that the state government has constituted a task force to restart economic activities in the state. He said that the state was heading towards starting economic activities.“Tourism in the state has been adversely hit by Covid-19. Similarly, horticulture especially apple cultivation is a key contributor to the state’s economy and there is an urgent need to ensure an adequate supply of carton boxes and also a better facility for smooth transportation of apples,” he said. Briefing the PM about the situation due to coronavirus in the state, Thakur said that to date 40 persons have tested positive for the infection of which 25 have been cured and one person has died of the virus.“Four persons have shifted outside the state for treatment,” he said.The lockdown should be continued but at the same time all states must be allowed to start economic activities particularly in the green zone, he said.CM added that the testing ratio of the state was 700 per million which was one of the highest in the country.He said that the state health department screened 70 lakh persons for influenza-like symptoms under the Active Case Finding campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jai-ram-thakur-favours-lockdown-extension-beyond-may-3/story-jl5EuhW8Gww3v9AKiYl6AI.html

27-04-2020||Pune||Monday Musings: What explains lowest Covid-19 infections in Aundh, Kothrud?||Even though the novel coronavirus pandemic originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and then spread across the world via air travel, it is by now clear that people from the IT industry have not been badly hit by the virus even though they travel widely around the world. In the United States, almost half of the 53,000 deaths due to Covid-19 have occurred in New York state, and less than 10% of this in California which hosts one of the major IT hubs in the world. Closer home, India’s IT capital, Bengaluru, has not been as badly affected as say, Delhi, Mumbai or Pune. As of April 24, Maharashtra had 6,430 positive cases and 283 deaths against 474 cases in Karnataka and 18 deaths. Bengaluru has had 67 positive cases and four deaths as against 1,070 positive cases in Pune and 69 deaths.In Pune, the entire contiguous belt of Aundh, Baner, Balewadi and Kothrud has consistently shown the lowest number of Covid-19 cases.While Pune has seen more than 1,000 positive cases and 69 deaths as of April 25, Aundh-Baner and Kothrud have seen a total of three cases and zero deaths. Last week, Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad told this newspaper that these two wards could be moved from the orange zone to the green zone, any time now, giving greater relaxation from the lockdown to the people there. Whether it is the United States or India, one common factor in the rapid spread of Covid-19 is high population density. New York has the highest population density in the US and governor Andrew Cuomo co-related high population density to the high incidence of the disease in the Big Apple.In Bengaluru, the latest nine positive cases were detected in a colony of labourers in the city. In Pune, the worst hit areas are primarily the high-density, low income localities of Bhavani Peth and Kasba-Vishrambaugwada in the heart of old Pune. Even in areas like Shivajinagar-Ghole Road and Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori, it is primarily the slum pockets that have seen a high incidence of Covid-19 cases. Given the strong co-relation between high population density and high incidence of Covid-19, the situation in Mumbai does not come as a surprise at all. A city doctor explained the low incidence of Covid-19 in Aundh-Baner and Kothrud, by saying that “the living conditions are better and most of the areas in these localities are not congested as in the peths (inner city) where poor people living in wadas (typical structures in old Pune) have to share common toilets. Another observation was that the IT industry mostly has young people, especially the ones who are sent abroad on assignments, and as is well-known, it is the older age-group which is more susceptible to the coronavirus infection. High population density has clearly emerged as a major vulnerability for the coronavirus infection because it stands in inverse proportion to social distancing. This is the picture that has emerged most clearly and therefore the response from the health authorities too, can now be delivered with greater precision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monday-musings-what-explains-lowest-covid-19-infections-in-aundh-kothrud/story-wpP4ZUDI80xog1ngc2Bw8J.html
27-04-2020||Chandigarh||#MainBhiHarjeetSingh ‘a huge reward,’ says emotional Covid warrior||Covid-19 frontline warrior, sub-inspector Harjeet Singh, whose hand was dismembered by a group of Nihangs (warrior order) on April 12 in Patiala, is a proud man today because of the enthusiastic response to the #MainBhiHarjeetSingh social media campaign launched by Punjab police on Monday to show solidarity with him.“I had never thought or imagined that I would get such a huge reward,” Harjeet Singh said in a phone call with Hindustan Times from his bed at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.As top policemen and others in khaki replaced their name badges with his, the sub-inspector said it was not just pride but “an emotional moment for me. I and my family will cherish this reward throughout our lives. The thought that the entire police force is standing by my side will keep me and my family in high spirits and help us emerge from these trying times,” he added.He said he also wanted to share this “reward with all the police personnel who were present” when they were attacked by the Nihangs and “gave a befitting reply to them.”What added to his joy, Harjeet Singh said, was the news of security forces from across the country enthusiastically participating in the campaign.“I will always be grateful to Punjab director general of police Dinkar Gupta and Patiala’s senior superintendent of police Mandeep Singh Sidhu for supporting me and my family in these hard times,” Harjeet Singh said.Where his medical condition is concerned, he is now able to feel movement in his left hand.Thanking doctors and other medical staff at PGIMER for putting all their efforts in saving his life, he says he is eager to rejoin duty and serve Punjab police with high spirits and honesty.Patiala SSP Sidhu said campaigns such as #MainBhiHarjeetSingh will help boost the morale of the entire police force fighting the Covid-19 battle as frontline warriors.“I have never witnessed in my career such a campaign launched to give respect to the force’s heroics. It gives a clear message to the force that Punjab police will always stand by its personnel through thick and thin,” the SSP said.Terming it a “great and proud moment for the family,” Harjeet Singh’s brother Gurmeet Singh said, “We will never forget the respect shown to Harjeet not only by Punjab police but also by the people of Punjab in praying for his health.”The family, which was in deep shock after the attack on the sub-inspector , felt its spirits uplifted because of the support from top Punjab police officials, he added.Harjeet Singh’s 24-year-old son Arshpreet Singh said his father’s act of exemplary courage and bravery had been recognised by the police force across the state.“The family will always be thankful to Punjab police for being with and supporting the family through these hard times,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mainbhiharjeetsingh-a-huge-reward-says-emotional-covid-warrior/story-jnQXMoh66bHEGGtAvaNJHO.html
27-04-2020||Chandigarh||Kangra police use cartoons to drive home dos and don’ts regarding Covid-19||Every morning, inspector Dhyan Singh diligently offers his daily dose of advice, mostly tips to fight Coronavirus and dos and don’ts to prevent the infection and warns residents against flouting guidelines.Only, inspector Dhyan is not a Himachal Police cop but a cartoon character, which features in the Kangra police’s series ‘Dyan Ra Gyan’ (Dhyan’s Advice) on their Facebook page.Adept at multitasking, the good inspector conveys vital information about the deadly virus while simultaneously tickling the funnybone.The endearing character’s unique selling point (USP) is that he conveys the information in the region’s local dialect, which adds to the humour.In one of the cartoons, a man asks another to act like a patient so that they can go for a spin around town but inspector Dhyan counsels them saying, “Pulsa Ta Jana Dena par Corona Pakdya Ta Kuthi Joge Ni Rehna (Police may let you go but you will be ruined if corona gets you).In another popular illustration, four people, who claim to be bored due to the lockdown, are playing cards in a jungle.“Je chimdya Corona ta na khaloni tash na rehna udas (If you get infected, you will neither feel sad nor will be able to play cards),” the inspector Dhyan tells them, sagaciously.CARTOONS BRAINCHILD OF KANGRA SPThe cartoons are the brainchild of Kangra superintendent of police (SP) Vimukt Ranjan.“A Dharamshala-based cartoonist Arvind Sharma volunteered to help the police with this initiative,” he said.Ranjan said the cartoon series had garnered a good response from the netizens and are being widely shared and liked.Meanwhile, Arvind Sharma, who created inspector Dhyan, said the character was inspired by all cops in his neighbourhood and their interaction with the general public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kangra-police-use-cartoons-to-drive-home-dos-and-don-ts-regarding-covid-19/story-N8KYSkwBTNaiq24W6kAELJ.html
27-04-2020||Mumbai||Number of containment zones in Mumbai has come down: BMC mayor||The number of containment zones in Maharashtra’s Mumbai, the worst-hit city in the country, have come down significantly after no case of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) were reported from the metropolitan in 14 days, news agency ANI reported on Monday citing the mayor.“Our containment zones had reached to 1036. There has been a significant drop in the number of containment zones in Mumbai,” Kishori Pednekar, the mayor of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, was quoted as saying by ANI.“Two hundred and thirty-one zones are out of the containment zone list after they didn’t record a single Covid-19 positive patient for the last 14 days,” she said.Mumbai had recorded the majority of the state’s cases of the coronavirus disease with 358 new infections, taking the tally to 5407, on Sunday. The city reported 12 deaths.Maharashtra on Sunday reported 440 cases, a slight drop from Saturday’s record figure of 811, taking the number of infected people in the state past the 8000-mark to 8,068. The state on Sunday recorded 19 deaths, taking the toll to 342.With the rising number of cases in Mumbai and Pune region, the state government is yet to take a call on the Union ministry of home affairs notification allowing all shops, excluding liquor shops and those providing services, in urban and rural areas to reopen. State officials said that the government is still considering the “pros and cons” of allowing the opening of shops in urban areas.“Allowing shops to reopen in the non-containment areas of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune region could be harmful as hundreds of cases are being recorded daily. The chief minister is taking a review of all areas,” an official said.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday indicated that the decision on a relaxation of restrictions in the state will be taken after a review of the situation once the national lockdown ends on May 3. BMC, which has 67.01% of the total Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, is preparing for a drastic spike by May 15. According to Manisha Mhaiskar, one of the bureaucrats on the Covid-19 task-force in BMC, the civic body is basing is preparedness plan on the projections of the Centre for Mumbai. Mhaiskar said that taking an input assumption for a doubling rate of seven days in Mumbai, the modelling suggests that there would be around 70,000 cases towards the second half of May.“I am not saying this, this is a projection of the Centre,” she said.In a Facebook post, Mhaiskar said the “obvious” task before the civic body is to improve the doubling rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/number-of-containment-zones-in-mumbai-has-come-down-bmc-mayor/story-LHjN6SjvTFxIeQ0A9xCukI.html

The pilgrims, which include two women, are part of a group of 14 people who were dropped by the Maharashtra-based driver to Tarn Taran on Sunday. Three others are from Moga’s Chak Tarewa village. At least 3,000 pilgrims from Punjab were stranded in Hazur Sahib, one of the five temporal seats of Sikhs, after the nationwide lockdown was imposed. Eight of the eleven persons hail from Khemkaran, a Nagar Panchayat that falls within Bhikhiwind sub-division, while the remaining two hail from Mianwal and Ramuwal villages. “The pilgrims returned on Sunday and were quarantined in their homes after their return.

The thousands of wooden and plastic crates lined up at the market added fuel to the fire. Five fire tenders were pressed into service to douse the flames. It took two hours to bring the fire under control.Sub-fire officer Atish Rai said, “Timely action was taken and the crates that had not caught fire by the time we arrived were removed.”Rai, while maintaining that the cause for the blaze had not been determined, did not rule out foul play. Fruit Mandi Arhtiya Association president Kamal Gumber said the loss was being assessed. “The crates that caught fire were being used to distribute fruits among the vendors,” he said, while thanking the fire department and alert workers present on the spot. “Had the godowns been gutted, the loss would have been irreparable,” he said.SOURCE OF INFECTIONLudhiana’s main vegetable market has been mired in controversy for blatant violation of guidelines, which led to Punjab Police assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Anil Kohli catching the deadly virus, which claimed his life, during crowd control duty. The ACP’s wife, Palak, Jodhewal station house officer Arshpreet Kaur, her driver assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Sukhdev Singh, a police constable Prabhjot Singh, district mandi officer Jasvir Kaur, her daughter block development and panchayat officer Navdeep Kaur and latter’s husband food supply inspector Prabhjot Kuar were all subsequently tested positive for the virus and are undergoing treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/blaze-breaks-out-in-ludhiana-s-vegetable-market/story-dCdy6ebIGsnhNad3n2I47L.html

BADGE OF SOLIDARITYThe Punjab Police campaign is called #MainBhiHarjeetSingh where the police personnel are being asked to replace their own name with Harjeet on their badges.A social media campaign has also been launched for people to show solidarity with him and other police personnel and healthcare experts in the country who are risking their lives during the epidemic. “We all will be Harjeet Singh, because for society, Harjeet Singh symbolises the two top attributes of a good cop which is not meeting violence with violence or resorting to tit for tat and showing courage in the face of fire,” Gupta said.In his letter to the police chiefs, Gupta said Harjeet Singh has emerged as the symbol of the nation’s fight against Covid-19 and its spread. ‘PROTECTORS AND SAVIOURS’“Harjeet’s episode signals to us all that the frontline warriors need to unite and stand together for each other in a demonstration of solidarity and support to each other. We must also convey a clear message—don’t attack policemen, the ‘protectors’, and don’t harass doctors and heathcare workers, the ‘saviours’,” said Gupta in his letter.

27-04-2020||Chandigarh||Marathon veteran Amrik Singh succumbs to virus at 84||Popular Glasgow businessman Amrik Singh, 84, the man who ran the London Marathon 26 times and graced various marathons around the world with his presence, has died after a four-day battle with coronavirus, his family said. He came to Glasgow from India in the 1970s. “Goodnight Amrik Singh. Gone but never forgotten. I hope to be able to do a fraction of the good and kindness you spread in the world. I hope you knew how loved you were at the end,” his grandson Paman Singh informed in a tweet. RAN OVER 650 RACES Paying tributes in a series of tweets, he recalled his grandfather by saying, “Apart from helping people, his passion was for running. They might as well have based the running man part of Forrest Gump on him. He ran over 650 races, from 5k to 10k, to half-marathons to full marathons, even though he only picked up running in his late forties. KEPT ASSISTING THE BLIND TILL THE END“Even in retirement, his routine was to wake up and be at the gym at 6 am to pound the treadmill, all the way into his 80s, before going to help at the gurdwara. “He would raise funds and then travel and assist those who had no money suffering from eye problems. He wasn’t an ophthalmologist, he was a simple shopkeeper, but he was qualified to change bedsheets, and feed and bathe. He continued to do this until his final trip last month,” his grandson said. For Paman Singh, his grandfather was utter inspiration and his best friend in life someone who empowered others to become better versions of themselves. “I would never have become a solicitor without him taking me under his wing and stopping me from going off the rails,” he said. FOUNDING FATHER OF SCOTLAND’s SIKH COMMUNITY Amrik Singh, the “founding father” of Scotland’s Sikh community, was admitted to a hospital last Sunday with symptom and he battled heroically, but eventually succumbed on April 23. “From when he came over to the UK in the 60s, he remained steadfast in his faith -- that of humanity. He faced up to the National Front and horrific racism with a smile, for him, these people weren’t enemies.” He served Glasgow’s west end community for nigh on 35 years from his small shop, always ensuring that he made deliveries to elderly people. BATTLED HATRED WITH KINDNESS“I remember him telling me when a man came into his shop and was hurling racist insults at him, but then was injured in a road accident just outside. My grandfather closed the shop and drove the man to the hospital himself and became friends with him,” he wrote in a tribute. “This was only a small part of his life though. His main focus was on seva -- volunteer work. NO WORK WAS BENEATH HIM, SEVA WAS HIS GOAL“At the local gurdwara, he would cheerfully wash the dishes, clean the toilets, and wipe shoes of those who came through the doors. Nothing was beneath him. “He was the inspiration behind the Scottish Sikh community’s drive to feed the disadvantaged and homeless regardless of beliefs, funding and setting up all manners of outreach support programmes, which is still going strong today,” his grandson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/marathon-veteran-amrik-singh-succumbs-to-virus-at-84/story-rnG5PqwR1qqCJh5ItqqlhP.html

He said grain markets in Karnal, Nissing, Jundla, Gharaunda, Assandh, Nilokheri, Kaithal, Guhla Cheeka, Pundri, Pai, Dhandh, Ismailabad, Shahbad, Pehowa, Jhansa, Bilaspur, Jagadhari, Yamunanagar, Rohtak were waterlogged.“The net consequences of mismanagement and ill-preparations of state government have resulted in destruction of crop. But the M L Khattar government refuses to acknowledge this. We demand that it’s still not too late to increase the limit of moisture content from 12 to 18%,” he added.Referring to effect of unseasonal rains, Surjewala said that massive losses had occurred in Kaithal, Kalayat, Pundri, Cheeka, Karnal, Yamunanagar and Rohtak. The BJP-JJP government should immediately take responsibility for the purchase of lakhs of quintals of wheat lying drenched due to rains, he said.22 LAKH MT WHEAT PROCURED LAST WEEKProcurement agencies in Haryana have purchased around 22.41 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of wheat from nearly 1.48 lakh farmers in the last seven days.

27-04-2020||City||Illegal entry of street vendors continues to crowd Ludhiana’s vegetable market||Even though the threat of a Covid-19 outbreak looms large over the vegetable market near Jalandhar Bypass, there seems to be no end to crowding in the area despite deployment of police at the entry point. On Saturday, a huge crowd was witnessed inside the mandi, prompting police to drive them away with lathi charge. Besides authorised vegetable vendors, the gathering comprised street vendors and staff of commission agents. Some street vendors scaled the boundary wall to avoid the police at the entry gate, while several others entered the market with the enlisted vendors. Basti Jodhewal station house officer (SHO) Pramod Kumar said he had received information about the ruckus in the market, following which he led a team to the market and police used lathi charge to disperse the street vendors.In the wake of the Covid threat, the administration had closed the vegetable market for four days from March 31 and restricted its operations to three days a week thereon. Amid the curfew, only enlisted vendors can enter the market for supplying veggies and fruits to street vendors at ward level. Earlier this month, district mandi officer (DMO) Jasbir Kaur had tested positive for the virus, and deceased ACP Anil Kumar Kohli is also suspected to have contracted the infection while he was deputed at the vegetable market. His contacts - his gunman; sub-inspector Arshpreet Kaur and her driver ASI Sukhdev Singh were also found positive. Last week, DMO’s daughter and son-in-law were confirmed infected.POLICE ACCUSED OF MANHANDLINGCommission agent Lucky Galhotra accused SHO Kumar of beating up workers and illegally grabbing fruits worth Rs 7,000 while they were unloading produce in the market on Saturday. The SHO on the other hand refuted the allegations, stating the workers were illegally selling fruits to street vendors. The produce was later returned to the vendors, he claimed.‘ALTERNATE DAY OPERATIONS CAUSING CROWDING’Chairman of the market committee, Darshan Lal Baweja said currently the mandi was operating only on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday to ensure social distancing. However, whenever the market reopened on alternate days, bigger crowds visited it, defeating the purpose of the move. He said he will urge the deputy commissioner to open the market for at least six days a week, and ban the entry of street vendors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-entry-of-street-vendors-continues-to-crowd-ludhiana-s-vegetable-market/story-BXg82X3n3yLTbIMbXRUxlI.html
27-04-2020||Chandigarh||Nuh fights back: No new Covid-19 case in 8 days||It took barely three days for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to turn Nuh, a backward district with 80% Muslim population, into the hotbed of the outbreak in Haryana. With three cases on April 4, the count jumped to 37 on April 7 and subsequently went up to 56 on April 17. Amid the rapid increase in cases, via the Tablighi Jamaat followers who had attended the Nizamuddin congregation, the fight back of Nuh administration has been equally striking. No fresh case has been detected in the past eight days, even as the district, with 57 cases, still has the maximum number of cases in the state. According to Nuh deputy commissioner (DC) Pankaj, a large number of Covid-19 positive cases pertain to people linked to the Nizamuddin congregation and their direct contacts. “In two days, beginning March 31, we tracked 656 Jamaat attendees and in the next three days, we identified 312 people who had direct contact with them,” said the DC, who is known for his hands-on approach.Until Sunday, the number of active cases in Nuh had shrunk to 18 after the recovery of 39 Covid-19 patients, according to official data.The district began hitting the path of recovery on April 17 when the first batch of four patients were discharged.The Nuh district in Mewat area is close to the national capital. It emerged as the epicentre of the disease after 711 Tablighi missionaries, including 57 foreigners, were tracked down in Nuh district alone.The health department, says Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj, director health services Haryana, swung into action very fast and worked day and night after the Centre sounded about the Tablighi Jamaat.“Without wasting time, we took samples of not only Jamaat people but also of their contacts. All of them were quarantined. That helped us,” Dr Kamboj said.QUICK TRACING AND TESTINGAccording to Nuh DC Pankaj, “quick identification, quarantine and testing” has been at the core of the administration’s collective response.The DC says that so far, over 1,500 samples have been taken and from Saturday, they started collecting samples of cops posted in “high exposure” areas.Nuh was divided into six zones with 36 villages in containment zones and 104 villages in buffer zones.“For active surveillance, 289 teams were deployed to cover all 501 villages,” Praneet Jaswani, a CMGGA (chief minister’s good governance associate) posted in Nuh said. “More than 2.3 lakh households were covered and over 14 lakh people were screened for symptoms in one-week period.”As per the official data, more than 1.8 lakh food packets were distributed, while 97 FIRs were lodged for lockdown violations and 677 vehicles impounded till April 23. Essentials were handed over to the people at their doorsteps in containment zones.And to ensure that people don’t step out of their homes, religious leaders of all the faiths were roped in to sensitise people about the benefits of the lockdown.“Still we will have to be very vigilant,” Pankaj, the DC Nuh, cautions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nuh-fights-back-no-new-covid-19-cases-in-8-days/story-2A9QkYyUoazJmavXjE7kNI.html

Our family is against accepting cash and cars and it was only fitting for the groom to receive masks and sanitisers as wedding gifts in the prevalent times,” he added.When the groom arrived, the bride’s family was all set for their welcome. They had kept sanitisers at the entrance and the wedding guests cleaned their hands with them and also wore masks throughout the affair. The couple too performed all rituals while wearing masks.Masks, sanitisers and gloves were presented as gifts to the couple during the wedding ceremony.Both the newly-weds said they were happy with the way they tied the knot.“Many of our relatives and friends could not attend the wedding due to the coronavirus scare. But we will invite them over for lunch after the situation improves across the country. The total spending for this marriage was on a mangalsutra and food for 10 people,” the couple added.The couple has appealed to the public to maintain social distancing, use masks and wash hands either with a soap or sanitiser.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jhajjar-man-ties-the-knot-in-lockdown-gets-masks-sanitisers-for-wedding-gifts/story-y2V8XIJgkA5AHjKndro5FM.html

Manch president Gurpreet Singh Chandbaja said the pollution had decreased as the dyeing industry, which dumped untreated water in the sewer lines, was closed during the lockdown. “As the recent PPCB reports are contradictory, we have demanded that the NGT monitoring committee may conduct sampling to detect heavy metals in the nullah,” Chandbaja added.He said, “These reports can then be compared with the sample reports that will come out once the industry restarts its operations. The truth about the matter will then become clear.”A municipal corporation (MC) official, requesting anonymity, said the MC was also collecting samples from the nullah as the pollution level had comparatively decreased, adding that the reports will be out in a week.MC, PPCB AT LOGGERHEADS The MC and the PPCB have been at loggerheads over the Buddha Nullah pollution with each blaming the other for its failure to curb its pollution.Last year, the PPCB had also filed a criminal case against mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, MC commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar and six others for the civic body’s alleged failure in operating the sewer treatment plants (STP) properly due to which the pollution level of the nullah was rising. However, the case was withdrawn in January this year.PPCB chairman Satwinder Marwaha was unavailable for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ngo-writes-to-ngt-seeking-collection-of-samples-from-ludhiana-s-buddha-nullah/story-En7vEIJ4Hhi8hnDSUAnhgP.html

27-04-2020||City||Coronavirus lockdown: Punjab dyers’ body complains to PM office about high interest rates||With certain banks not reducing the interest rate on loans even when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decreased the repo rate (RR), the dyeing industry in Ludhiana has filed a complaint with the Prime Minister’s office (PMO) demanding its intervention to pass on the benefit to the industry amid the coronavirus lockdown.Repo rate refers to the rate at which commercial banks borrow money by selling their securities to the RBI to maintain liquidity, in case of shortage of funds or due to statutory measures. It helps RBI keep inflation under control.The Dyers Association complained that on March 27, RBI had reduced the RR from 5.15% to 4.4% to reduce industrialists’ hardships. “The benefits are to be passed on to the industry and residents, but the purpose is being defeated as the banks are still charging interest on the previous rates. Bank officials claim they have received nothing in writing from RBI to reduce the interest rates on loans,” said Bobby Jindal, general secretary, Punjab Dyers’ Association.President of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), DS Chawla, said, “The industry is facing a tough time during the lockdown and the government is aware of it. RBI should take immediate steps to bring some relief to the industry by stepping in, pass on the benefit to the industry and later, a declaration should be taken from the banks, stating that the benefit has been passed on.”‘POST LOCKDOWN, DEFER EMIs FOR 6 MONTHS WITH INTEREST WAIVER’Chawla also said the RBI hac deferred the EMIs for three months -- April, May and June, but it, along with the Union government, had failed to waive the interest. “Further, the government should also defer the EMIs for at least six months post the lockdown, as the industry needs time to revive. No interest should be charged for this period because if interest is not waived, there will be no benefit to the industry,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-punjab-dyers-body-complains-to-pm-office-about-high-interest-rates/story-7YIJrNOFxZC1n2JlUWXwCM.html

27-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid-19 case tally crosses 8,000; death toll rises to 342||Maharashtra on Sunday reported 440 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a slight drop from Saturday’s record figure of 811, taking the number of infected people in the state past the 8,000 mark to 8,068. The state doubled its tally from 4,000 to 8,000 in seven days. The state took six days to go from both 2,000 cases to 4,000 and from 1,000 to 2,000.The state on Sunday recorded 19 deaths, taking the toll to 342.Of Sunday’s cases, Mumbai continued to record the majority of the state’s cases with 358 new infections. Mumbai alone has 5,407 cases, while its surrounding areas of Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts have 936 cases in all. Mumbai reported 12 deaths, while Pune saw three, Jalgaon two and Solapur city and Latur saw one each.With the rising number of cases in Mumbai and Pune region, the state government is yet to take a call on the Union Ministry of Home Affairs notification allowing all shops, excluding liquor shops and those providing services, in urban and rural areas to reopen. State officials said that the government is still considering the “pros and cons” of allowing the opening of shops in urban areas. “Allowing shops to reopen in the non-containment areas of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune region could be harmful as hundreds of cases are being recorded daily. The chief minister is taking a review of all areas,” an official said.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday indicated that the decision on relaxation of restrictions in the state will be taken after a review of the situation once the national lockdown ends on May 3. He also for the first time in his address said that this was not the time to play dirty politics, indirectly alluding to the politicking over his nomination to the Maharashtra legislative council. The governor, Bhagat Singh Koshyari, has not yet responded to the state cabinet’s recommendation to nominate Thackeray to the upper House.Thackeray has until May 27 to get nominated to one of the Houses of the state legislature and if is isn’t elected until then, he will be forced to step down.“There are questions about what will happen after the lockdown ends on May 3. Since April 20, we have gradually eased restrictions at some places. In Mumbai, this led to crowds that we cannot afford… We are not opening district borders in rural Maharashtra but gradually easing restrictions within districts to allow economic activity to resume. I am receiving daily reports. I will hold a review today evening and decide on further relaxations from 3rd May onwards,” Thackeray said, during his address via Facebook Live.“If we do politics at this time, then we do not need any other enemy. Elections come and go, so does power. But now if lives are lost, they will not come back. Therefore, no one should play dirty politics in this.” At the same time, he thanked Union minister Nitin Gadkari for sending a message to his party colleagues to keep politics aside at the time of a national crisis. A day ahead of the meeting between chief ministers of all states and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Thackeray took a review of the situation in Maharashtra on Sunday. An official, who was present in the review meeting, said, “The CM took stock of the situation. He reviewed the situation in Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, which have more cases. There are 11 districts, including Sangli, which have not reported any new cases in the past three days, while three districts — Bhandara, Gadhchiroli and Wardha — do not have any cases so far. The doubling rate of the cases and the death rate in the state was also discussed as Maharashtra has been reporting around 20 deaths for the past three days.”Maharashtra, till date, has conducted 1,16,345 coronavirus tests, of which 1,07,519 are tested negative. On Sunday, the state health department said that 112 people have been discharged from the hospitals, taking the total number of recovered patients to 1,188. Currently, there are 1,36,926 people under home quarantine, while 9,160 are under institutional quarantine.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which has 67.01% of the total Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, is preparing for a drastic spike by May 15. The civic body, according to Manisha Mhaiskar, one of the bureaucrats on the Covid-19 task-force in BMC, is basing is preparedness plan on the projections of the Centre for Mumbai. She said that taking an input assumption for a doubling rate of seven days in Mumbai, the modelling suggests that there would be around 70,000 cases towards the second half of May. “I am not saying this, this is a projection of the Centre,” Mhaiskar said.In a Facebook post, Mhaiskar said, “The current doubling rate of coronavirus in Mumbai is 7 days. Positive cases doubled from 2,120 on 17th to 4232 on 23rd April. If 7days is taken as the input assumption, the modelling suggests that there would be around 70,000 cases towards second half of May. This has become the basis for preparing for Ides of May.” According to her post, the “obvious” task before the civic body is to improve the doubling rate. House-to-house surveillance, aggressive contact tracing, and containment strategies have been put in place, an official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-case-tally-crosses-8-000-toll-rises-to-342/story-99utgrubYi5uJg5vtmnAnN.html
27-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid warrior: Maharashtra doctor takes the fight to protect healthcare workers to Supreme Court||When the Centre brought in a landmark ordinance on April 22, amending a 123-year-old Act to enhance protection for health workers and frontline staff battling Covid-19, doctors across the country welcomed the decision. Among them, Dr Jerryl Banait, 27, a dermatologist from Nagpur, heaved a sigh of relief.Hearing of frontline staff getting infected as well as cases of assault against medical workers, Banait grew concerned for the safety of his elder brother Dr Yash Banait, 29, who was leading a team of 30 doctors at Mumbai’s international airport, to screen suspected coronavirus patients. “This had to stop, and the only way out was through the judiciary,” said Dr Banait, who decided to move the Supreme Court (SC) against the Central government in March. “The main aim of my petition was to provide police protection to health workers; jail term for assault on frontline staff and doctors, and ensure availability of personal protective equipment (PPE).”Banait failed to get his petition admitted multiple times before the SC. “By the time I had completed my research and prepared the final draft, a surge in Covid-19 cases began in Maharashtra and a partial lockdown was already in place. I could not physically submit my petition. Even the postal service had shut down,” he said. After calls and emails to SC judges, advocates, and politicians, Banait began losing confidence. “Fortunately, after a reminder email to the Chief Justice of India and relentless efforts from my advocates Astha Sharma and Prastut Dalvi, the plea was admitted,” he said.On April 1, the SC heard the matter and issued notices to the Central government. On April 8, a bench of Justices Ashok Bhusan and Ravindra Bhatt passed directions for immediate procurement of PPE; police protection for health workers at hospitals and those collecting samples on the field, and necessary action against persons inflicting violence or obstructing duties of medical staff. Subsequently, the Centre and states issued advisories and notifications based on the order.Last Wednesday, the Centre, citing the SC order based on Banait’s petition, also amended the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 as the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, making attacks on doctors and health workers a punishable offence with imprisonment up to seven years and fines up to ₹7 lakh. It also provided for expedited investigations and imposing stringent penalties on vandalism and damage to property. President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday gave assent to the ordinance and it is to be ratified by both houses of Parliament once the lockdown ends.“The efforts are nothing but a cog in the larger wheel to support countless doctors and medical staff. They are the foot soldiers at the vanguard in this war against Covid-19,” said Banait.Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) president Dr Rahul Wagh, said, “When we don’t end up going home for days due to our duty, and our family members hear of incidents of violence, their immediate reaction is to ask us to leave everything and come home. After a long time, due to this timely petition, and consequent decisions, there is relief.”The Indian Medical Association (IMA) said it was a long-drawn fight with the combined endeavours of the entire medical fraternity and individuals. “Amidst our attempt to address the surge in cases of violence against health workers, we may not have heard of individual efforts. However, we are aware of the recent petition and the SC order. This gives the entire fraternity more impetus to strengthen our focus in combating this grave crisis being faced by the country,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, national president, IMA.Dr RV Asokan, general secretary, IMA, said, “When there are multiple representations from society in the same direction, change is inevitable. We must not discount any effort to bring this change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-warrior-maharashtra-doctor-takes-the-fight-to-protect-healthcare-workers-to-supreme-court/story-S8uDZrkMEUBaL8HAOo3VwM.html

Over 3,200 people reside in the village.The Owe camp village is 5km away from Kharghar railway station.Ramchandra Jadhav, 34, resident of Owe Camp village, said, “There is no gathering of any kind and villagers don’t step out of their houses at all. The vegetables too are grown locally. Groceries shop is also owned by one of us, hence, we ensure that essentials are delivered to individual homes.”“Marriage, engagements and all other celebration have been postponed and people have been asked to strictly follow the lockdown rules. We guard the entry and exit point of the village so that nobody leaves the village except in case of a medical emergency,” said Jadhav.The villagers ensure that there is zero contact with those outside the village boundaries and follow social distancing among themselves. Those working in essential services are allowed to travel.There are a total of 49 positive cases in Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC).

27-04-2020||Chandigarh||Two floors in PGIMER building separate them, but this nursing couple won’t be able to see each other for days||Two floors in a building separate this couple at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), both have been assigned night shifts, but nursing officers Gurbinder Singh Dhillon and Kuldeep Kour last set eyes on each other five days back.They’ll be separated for a long time as Dhillon, aged 31, works in a high-risk zone where patients with flu-like symptoms tested for Covid-19 are handed their reports. Staffers over here have to be isolated once their weekly shifts are over. In Dhillon’s case, it will be next week, after which he will be quarantined up to May 13.As of now, he lives in a temporary accommodation in a hotel and works in the hospital from 8 pm to 2 pm, while Kaur, aged 29, returns to their Sector 38 home. She works in PGIMER’s emergency operation theatre, considered to be a moderate-risk area even though chances of contracting the infection in hospital settings are high.“Yes, it is frustrating, but one rejoices in knowing that you are doing what society requires in this pandemic. There is a cost to pay, however, because one has to live apart from the family,” she says.Once the infection spread to India, the couple decided to move Dhillon’s parents, both nearly 70, with Kour driving them nearly 450km to drop them at their village, Nangal, in Faridkot, and returning to Chandigarh.“Given their age which brackets them in the high-risk group and before I started dealing directly with Covid-19 suspected cases I moved them and my daughter to our ancestral village to minimise infection risk,” Dhillon adds.In the three years that she has been married, Kour says the family have never been separated for so long from each other.Work helps. “Once I am with my patients I forget everything and just focus on them, but when I go home it’s distressing to live alone, and have no one to speak to. To tell them how you feel working in these conditions,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-floors-in-pgimer-building-separate-them-but-this-nursing-couple-won-t-be-able-to-see-each-other-for-days/story-byPsWyxxhRu1InlvBX3R5O.html
27-04-2020||Mumbai||IPS officer had no authority to let Wadhawans travel: Report||A probe commissioned by state home minister Anil Deshmukh found that senior IPS officer Amitabh Gupta had no authority to issue letter to Diwan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan to let them travel despite lockdown restrictions on humanitarian grounds. The officer admitted that he had issued the letter to the Wadhwans. Deshmukh on Sunday confirmed that the report on the issue by Manoj Saunik, additional chief secretary, finance, has been submitted to the government. The report also states that Gupta admitted that he was not under any political pressure as suspected by the opposition parties. The report also found that the senior official had exceeded his jurisdiction and had no authority to issue such a letter. It, however, stated that a malafide intention could not be established as it needs further probe by a proper investigation agency. Even if the state government accepts his explanation a warning should be issued to check the background of the individual before extending such help in future. “We have received the probe report and it was found that Amitabh Gupta has admitted issuing the letter on his own. He has also said that he was not under pressure from anyone. The report will now be sent to the chief minister for further action,” Deshmukh said on Sunday.Gupta, who was serving the state home department as principal secretary (special), was sent on compulsory leave on April 10 after it came to light that he had issued a letter to aid Wadhawan brothers, accused by the CBI and their families to travel to Mahabaleshwar amidst the lockdown.“Amitabh Gupta has accepted the letter was issued by him and he should not have issued it but he said it was done on humanitarian grounds. The IPS officer has also said that the letter was issued based on an application in which Wadhawan had said they were stuck in a rented guesthouse in Lonavla and wanted to go back to their own house in Mahabaleshwar. Gupta clarified before the probe panel that his letter was not a directive to any authority and it was given only to facilitate the travel as per the discretion of the local authorities,” said a senior official.A fact-finding committee under senior bureaucrat Manoj Saunik was constituted to investigate the matter. Police had detained 23 people, including DHFL promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhwan, for violating prohibitory orders of the nationwide lockdown. Kapil and Dheeraj are accused in DHFL scam and had been issued non-bailable warrants by the CBI. The family, along with other outsiders, had travelled from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar in their cars even when the borders of Satara and Pune districts were sealed.The home minister also said the report will be made public soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ips-officer-had-no-authority-to-let-wadhawans-travel-report/story-6GjzbaUIIi2ErvOZ97pwLJ.html
27-04-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal Pradesh students stranded in Chandigarh find little help on helpline numbers launched by state government||A day after the Himachal Pradesh (HP) government started bus service for its natives stranded in Chandigarh and surrounding areas, many students wanting to return home claimed that calls made to helpline numbers launched for the purpose are going unanswered. Meanwhile, others had trouble in reaching Himachal Bhawan, Sector 28, from where the buses were to leave, as there is no local transport facility available in the area.Renu Bala, who is from Kangra district and had recently completed her graduation from a local institute, said: “There are no arrangements in place for picking up students from different locations. How can I walk from Nayagaon, where I live, to Himachal Bhawan along with my belongings?” Renu said even the personnel manning the helpline number were of no help. Gaurav Sharma, a student leader in DAV College, Sector 10, said: “A few days back , the HP transport minister had assured students of help during video conferencing. Though he arranged the buses, mismanagement has left students confused.”Gaurav said even he has been trying to call the helpline numbers, but not a single one is working. “We don’t know how many students are being ferried in in one day or for how long students will stay in Solan before being sent to home districts. There is no one to answer our queries. In fact, a few students had to return from Himachal Bhawan on Saturday after getting no seat in the buses,” he said.In fact, this correspondent tried to contact all helpline numbers provided by the department of public relations, Himachal Pradesh, as well as circulated on different social networking sites, but could not get through a single one. While four numbers (9418008000, 9988898009, 8446313167 and 9418010857) were either switched off or went unanswered, a landline number (0172- 2638285) remained busy for an hour.Nodal officer Rajiv Sharma could not be contacted for comment as his mobile number, too, remained switched off.Meanwhile, sources said a total of 366 students from Chandigarh and its surrounding areas have been taken to Solan in 15 buses. The students are being put up at Satsang Bhawan there, from where they will be sent home after medical checkup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-pradesh-students-stranded-in-chandigarh-find-little-help-on-helpline-numbers-launched-by-state-government/story-WeSFrCcxcaEMPyBfnIvtcI.html
27-04-2020||Noida||Child helpline receives double the usual number of calls amid lockdown||The district child helpline has received more than twice the number of calls during the ongoing lockdown than it usually does with regards to the nutrition of children. The data obtained by Hindustan Times showed that 220 calls were made to the district child helpline, 1098, between March 16 and April 26. This means that more than five calls were received per day.“This is more than twice the normal call volume that we face everyday. On an average, we receive about 70-80 calls per month. However, the last few days have seen a significant increase in the numbers,” said Satya Prakash, programme manager, FXB India Suraksha, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that manages the district helpline. Of the total calls the came in, at least 39.5% were nutrition-related calls.“Most people in the need of dry ration or essential services are getting raw uncooked food in the form of care packages, containing rice, flour, etc. from the administration, the police or other sources. However, most of the calls coming to us are for nutrition products for kids, such as milk and milk-based supplements. In the last 40 days, 87 such calls have been made,” said Prakash.This, however, does not mean that calls for food are not coming in. On an average, 56 calls are made related to food supplies, while 23 call are related to coronavirus-related cases. At the same time, calls related physical and sexual abuse of children continue to pour in. Thirteen child abuse cases have been reported to the helpline while 12 calls have been made for the care and protection of children.“One positive effect of the lockdown is that there has been a reduction in the number of cases of children being lost. There were two instances of kids running away and seven of kids being lost and five children being found,” said Prakash. The figures are less than the usual number of calls received during normal times. Due to industries and private establishments being shutdown, the number of cases pertaining to child labour has also gone down to just two in the past 40 days.“There have been two reported instances of child marriage. Yesterday, we got a call from a 16-year-old girl, who alleged that she had been brought to Noida from Gorakhpur some time back. She wasn’t very clear on the details but it seemed to be a case of child marriage. Upon checking, it was found that her family had not filed any missing case back home. She is now recuperating at the shelter home,” said Prakash.With Sunday being Akshay Tritiya, the department is also on high alert for any child marriage cases in the district as per the orders by the district probation officer. The helpline is required to submit information about any such cases to the government by April 28. However, by Sunday evening, no calls had come in to the helpline regarding the same. Other reasons for calls include education of children, care and protection, counselling, shelter requirement etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/child-helpline-receives-double-the-usual-number-of-calls-amid-lockdown/story-gzup46Dt2U66be8TvMkoRK.html

Harish Chander, deputy superintendent of police, Noida Central, said the man lived with his family in a high-rise apartment. “The family members had dinner and then went to sleep. The elderly man came to the balcony when everyone else was asleep, and allegedly jumped to his death around 6am,” he said.The security personnel in the society found him wounded and alerted the residents, the police said. They added that the man was rushed to a private hospital where doctors declared him dead.Chander said that a police team had visited the spot after getting information about the incident. “The victim’s family members informed the police that he was depressed because of a prolonged illness,” he said. The police said they have not found any note from the spot. The body has been sent for an autopsy and the police are investigating the matter. Chander said the Bisrakh police are scanning the CCTV camera footage of the premises as part of the investigation. The man’s family has not filed any complaint to the police yet.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/65-year-old-ends-life-in-greater-noida-west/story-KkaAgAbpgZ3aeWakIMuL2J.html
27-04-2020||Noida||In absence of clear guidelines, confusion prevails about de-sealing of societies||The residents of many high-rises in Gautam Budh Nagar district, which were sealed after the detection of several Covid-19 positive cases, are keeping their fingers crossed as the district administration has yet not announced the exact dates to de-seal their societies.Abhinav Ashwin, a resident of Logix Blossom County in sector 137 said that one month after three cases were reported from his society, he found on Saturday that the society is now part of the orange zone, instead of the green zone.“What are the parameters for converting red zones into orange zones and orange zones into green zones? Has the administration given the exact date of de-sealing any society before it is sealed? The administration does not care about the basic needs of the residents of the 900-odd flats in our society,” he said.Questioning the methodology of containment, he asked that if Wazidpur village in Sector 135, which is around three kilometres away and Paras Tierea, another high-rise in Sector 137, could be part of the same containment zone, how could other neighbouring societies in Sector 137 get relaxation in containment norms? “It clearly indicates that the administration is biased and it decides the containment zone randomly. Even the policemen deployed at our gates do not know about the relaxation norms for different categories,” Ashwin alleged.Echoing similar views, Ravish Gupta, the president of the apartment owners’ association in Paras Tierea, said that the district administration has not defined parameters for the sealing and de-sealing of societies. “Five cases had been reported from our society nearly one month ago. The administration has said that there will be a three-kilometre quarantine zone for a cluster with more than one Covid-19 case. If that is true then how can containment norms be relaxed for our neighbouring high-rise? How can two high-rises sharing a boundary wall be placed in different categories of containment?” he asked.The last positive case from Paras Tierea society was reported on March 29. On Sunday, its completed 28 days of quarantine. Similarly, the last positive case among the three cases from Logix Blossom County was reported on March 26 and the mandatory 28 days of quarantine were completed on April 23.The hotspots are divided into three zones--green zones, where no positive case have been reported in the last 28 days, orange zone, where no positive case has been reported in the last 14 days, and red zone, where a positive case has been reported in the last 14 days.Gautam Budh Nagar currently has 40 hot spots, where 10 are in the green zone, 13 in the orange zone and 17 are in the red zone.It may be noted that last Sunday, the district magistrate Suhas LY had categorically said that a two-kilometre buffer zone has been created outside quarantine zones and no activity other than the supply of essential commodities and visits from medical and sanitation teams will be permitted in these quarantine and buffer zones. But, he had also said that if no infection is reported during the next 28 days, the hot spot will be converted into a green zone.Despite repeated attempts via the phone and text messages, district magistrate Suhas LY did not respond for comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/in-absence-of-clear-guidelines-confusion-prevails-about-de-sealing-of-societies/story-Ft60uz1YalI0hcJs70VtGM.html
27-04-2020||Delhi||A Covid positive nurse and her toddler’s long wait to return home||Among the few words her two-year-old can utter are ‘mumma’ and ‘papa’.Huddled close on a hospital bed together, the mother springs up and makes a video call to her husband whenever her child says ‘papa’.“My boy hasn’t learnt how to speak yet, but he understands that the man on the mobile screen is his father,” says the child’s 29-year-old mother.The woman and her son have both been quarantined at a city hospital for 19 days, ever since they tested positive for Covid-19. She worked as a nurse at another hospital, where one of the doctors had tested positive for the virus on April 7.At the quarantine centre, for a lot of time when they are awake, the mother is often seen holding her mobile phone in front of her two-year-old so that he can watch cartoons. “He is a very active child. But he hasn’t troubled me at all here despite facing issues with his food and milk,” the woman said.“Our hospital wasn’t even treating or screening Covid patients, so I don’t know how he (the doctor) got infected. But once he tested positive, all of us who were in contact with him had to undergo tests,” said the woman, who doesn’t want either the hospital she works at, or where she is admitted to be identified. Soon after the tests, she and some other healthcare workers tested positive for the virus.An official from the hospital administration said they still haven’t been able to pinpoint how the doctor tested positive, despite not treating any Covid patients. They added that two members of the doctor’s family had returned from abroad, but that was several weeks before he was infected.In any case, this nurse thought that she was safe as neither there were any cases at her hospital,nor had anyone been tested. So, she didn’t feel the need to keep her child away from her while at home.But that changed and soon enough. After the doctor’s case, she and her son tested Covid positive while her husband’s result came negative.The two were allotted a hospital room, but the facility is nowhere close to what the nurse would have liked. “My child would get the milk around 11am or so. I can survive till 2 pm with just a packet of biscuits, but I can’t expect my two-year-old to be as tolerant,” she said.For the last two days, she said, milk has not been arriving. “I am using packed milk that my friends brought us and am heating it up in an electric kettle that I had brought along,” she said.She, however, fears that the electric kettle may not serve them anymore soon. “Anytime the kettle makes a sound, I worry that it will malfunction,” she said.The milk that her friends sent, too arrived after a lot of hassles. “The initial few days, the hospital staff wouldn’t let anyone bring anything for us. I am a nurse myself, but the hospital staff would look at me as if I have committed a crime by getting infected. But thankfully they allowed the milk to come in when we needed it the most,” she said.The mother and son sleep on the same bed. Unlike earlier, she said, she doesn’t feel like watching films on her mobile phone any more. Family members keep calling her through the day and all they want to know is the condition of the child, a thought she said her mind too is constantly occupied with. “Though it worries me that my child fell sick, he is the reason I am able to survive the quarantine,” she said.The nurse did have a little fever around the time she tested positive, but her son hasn’t displayed any symptoms. “My only prayer is that he remains asymptomatic,” she said.She said this was valuable time she is getting to spend with her son, though she misses her husband’s presence. “I’ll teach my child to speak a few more words by the time he gets to actually meet his father”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-covid-positive-nurse-and-her-toddler-s-long-wait-to-return-home/story-OOmX0GbfsL6cDU2pRNrt7J.html
27-04-2020||Delhi||Braving Covid threat, woman travels 2,400 km to help sister fight cancer||The lingering threat of Covid-19 failed to dissuade forty-nine-year-old Debeshwari CH from travelling over 2,409 kilometres to help her sister. She was determined to be in Gurugram to donate bone marrow for her sister’s transplant, but little did she expect to undertake a four-day car journey to reach the city from Imphal, Manipur. She reached the National Capital Region (NCR) from Imphal in Manipur on April 22 for the donation. Her sister, CH Ningolee, 55, was admitted to Fortis Memorial Research Institute (FMRI) in the last week of January to undergo treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia, a type of blood cancer where excess production of immature white blood cells affects normal blood production.“She has high-risk cancer, where the mortality is 100% if a bone marrow transplant is not done. We had to get her to remission — less than 5% of the leukaemia cells surviving — before a transplant could be done. Her first two chemotherapy failed, but she responded well to the third one. The lockdown was already underway when we informed her family that she was in a condition to undergo a transplant,” said Dr Rahul Bhargava, Institute of Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplant, FMRI.Debeshwari was informed on April 7 about the improvement in her sister’s condition. The family decided to wait a week, expecting the lockdown to be lifted.Vilina L, Debeshwari’s daughter, said, “We had booked flight tickets for April 15. However, by April 13 or so, there was news about an extension of the lockdown, so we approached the state government. We asked them if my mother could hitch a ride on the cargo planes, but we did not get the permission. That is when we tweeted out and received a lot of support from the public and government agencies.”Under the lockdown, only two people are allowed to travel in a car but the family received permission for five — two drivers and three family members — as they had to cover a long distance. The doctors gave Ningolee another round of chemotherapy to ensure she remained healthy till her family arrived.“Because of the lockdown, there weren’t any hotels or restaurants open on the way either. We had to map the travel meticulously, planning all stops. The district authorities got in touch with the local police and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), who arranged for our stay in hotels and guest houses on the way. We were scared and anxious about travelling such a long distance, especially through the hilly terrains of the North East, but the authorities met us at every step of the way, checking in on us,” said Vilina.She said that lunch was provided by NGOs along the way.Upon reaching Gurugram on April 22, Debeshwari underwent a Covid-19 test and tested negative on Saturday. From today, she will receive injections to prepare her for the donation. The injections force the blood-forming cells into the blood, which is then collected by applying apheresis — a process in which a machine separates the components of the blood, collects the required cells and pushes the rest back into the body.She is an allogenic donor, meaning that she is a genetic match for her sister.“We had counselled the family about the risk of undergoing a transplant during the Covid-19 pandemic. First, there was a risk to the family members who would be travelling to the hospital and second, to the patient who might be susceptible to infections. However, the risk of the disease was more than that of Covid-19 and the family decided to proceed with the treatment,” said Dr Meet Kumar, consulting haematologist and bone marrow transplant physician at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/braving-covid-threat-woman-travels-2-400-km-to-help-sister-fight-cancer/story-Fl4la3gbHBEcXYY2JQF2QI.html
27-04-2020||Delhi||Traders anxious as test results still pending from Azadpur mandi||A large number of traders at the Azadpur Mandi in north Delhi have refused to resume business until contact tracing of all those associated with Mandi who have reported Covid positive so far. Four confirmed cases, including one death, have been found to have a direct link with Delhi’s largest mandi, which is the food supply lifeline of the capital. With reports of more cases associated with the market continue doing the rounds contributing to the anxiety of the traders and their employees, traders claimed the authorities are not coming out with precise data about cases from the market. “Now we have reached a stage where the total number of Covid-19 cases associated with the market is difficult to ascertain,” said Adil Khan, chairperson of the Azadpur agriculture produce market committee (APMC). Besides four cases in mandi, all of whom were traders, the daughter of a fifth trader tested positive last week, health officials confirmed.“So far, we have names of at least eight people who are suspected to have the infection but there is no official confirmation. Large groups of traders have refused to resume business until all contact tracing is done and pending test results are out,” said Anil Malhotra, a trader and elected member of the market’s committee.District Magistrate (North) Deepak Shinde said: “It is difficult to share official figures at this juncture. The number of people being traced as contacts and being sent for tests is on a rise. We have to have a final list of results and more details to ascertain figures. We are working in adherence to all protocols.”So far, test results of at least 100 persons associated with the market in capacities that range from trader to porters and accountants are pending. While 50 of them were tested after they complained of symptoms following a screening programme that covered around 400 persons in the last 48 hours, the others were contacts of the four cases, including the one who died, said a senior official in the district health department.The market has around 2,800 registered traders and 12,000 people who work there as porters, loaders, labourers, accountants, etc. On an average day, it witnesses arrival of around 3,300 trucks.Meanwhile, the Azadpur APMC issued guidelines to regulate the movement of trucks inside and around the premises of the market, spread over 101 acres space in north Delhi, to ensure congestion does not take place and social distancing norms can be better adhered to.The regulations include reserving an open space in Burari area where a token counter would be set up for access into the market premises based on serial numbers, issuing not more than 3300 tokens to truckers each day, issuing not more than 200 tokens per hour and penalising drivers who park vehicles for more than six hours anywhere inside the premises of the market, said the document which HT has seen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traders-anxious-as-test-results-still-pending-from-azadpur-mandi/story-ALMQl4TAhbpcgsnVWQ3EAJ.html
27-04-2020||Delhi||Hindu Rao hospital to partially open today after nurse tested Covid positive||The Hindu Rao Hospital (HRH), capital’s biggest municipal corporation-run health facility, will partially resume services on Monday after being temporarily shut down following a hospital nurse testing Covid positive. The 980-bed facility which is run by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation caters to 5,000 patients daily and is one of the designated Covid screening centres in Delhi. All the entry and exit points to the hospital were sealed on Saturday night after the test reports of the 30-year-old nurse, who has been suffering from high fever the last one week, came positive. “We will resume services of casualty and emergency wards, including the flu clinic and the three OPDs (gynecology, paediatrics and medicine) with a restricted entry of patients and attendants from tomorrow, i.e, April 27,” said the north body commissioner, Varsha Joshi.Complete sanitisation of the hospital premises, with sodium hypochlorite spray, was carried out on Saturday, she said.At least 250 doctors, nurses, patients, their attendants, sweepers and even canteen workers were held back for testing on Saturday, who could have come in contact of the infected nurse. “Most of the staff workers had come for the night shift (8 pm to 8 am) and were told to stay back Sunday morning. They already had segregated duty rooms with beds to take rest and were provided food the entire day. The existing 170 patients were also taken care of,” a resident doctor, who didn’t wish to be named, said.Also, more doctors and nurses, who had worked closely with the affected nurse but were not present in the hospital on Saturday night, were summoned for testing.“Contact tracing of 52 staff members here, who have been in contact with the nurse, has been completed. In the case of seven contacts, the collection of samples has been done and they are currently in institutional quarantine. Rest are in home isolation and their sample collection will start tomorrow,” Joshi said.An enquiry has been initiated by the civic body on who asked the nurse to come for work in spite of symptoms. “There appears to be definite negligence at some level and we will take action against those responsible,” a corporation official, who didn’t wish to be named, said.Meanwhile, over 1,000 doctors, who are now apprehensive for their safety, presented a new charter of demands to the civic body.“We definitely need more Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) here. Besides, the administration must book rooms for us to stay in nearby hotels. The accommodation provided in the New Hostel Block here for doctors attending to suspected COVID patients is not sufficient, and we don’t want to go back home and transfer any possible infection to our families,” a resident doctor, who requested anonymity, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hindu-rao-hospital-to-partially-open-today-after-nurse-tested-covid-positive/story-8bPNH9wIS6RQAlDnNj25lO.html
27-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi government orders an audit of seven city hospitals||With an increasing number of healthcare workers testing positive in the national capital, the Delhi government’s health department has requested the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to do an assessment and audit of implementation of guidelines and standard operating procedure (SOPs) followed at seven city hospitals.Delhi recorded a huge jump in cases on Sunday with 293 people testing positive for Covid-19, taking the total to 2,918. Fifty-four people have died of the disease so far.The seven hospital where the audit will be done are: All India Institute of medical Sciences (AIIMS), Safdarjung Hospital, Ram Manohar Lohia, Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital, Max hospital in Saket and Indraprastha Apollo hospital.With several healthcare workers and patients visiting various hospitals in the city testing positive for Covid-19, district authorities raised the issue of hospitals becoming a major source of infection in a meeting with Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal held on April 21.“We haven’t received any such letter yet. We do inspect the quarantine facilities etc sometimes but not hospitals. In case of such complaints, the health ministry constitutes special teams – of which NCDC officers might be a part – for inspections like it is happening in other states,” said Dr Sujeet Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control. Central teams have been sent to states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana among others.This comes on a day when at least 29 healthcare workers – including12 doctors and 11 nurses -- tested positive for Covid-19 in Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital in Rohini. Earlier this week, 57 people from the hospital had been quarantined after they came in contact with a suspected Covid-19 patient, a 40-year-old woman from Jahangirpuri, where six of the eight containment zones from North district are located. In another hospital in Jahangirpuri – the non-Covid-19 Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial hospital -- at least 44 healthcare workers had tested positive for the infection.On Saturday, a security guard and a nurse from the cancer centre of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) tested positive for Covid-19. So far, at least eight healthcare workers – all from the non-Covid-19 areas of the hospital – have tested positive for the infection. Two of the children of nurse also tested positive for the infection.South Delhi district magistrate BM Mishra told HT, “Nearly 30% of the cases reported in my district are of healthcare workers.”The chemotherapy area had to be shut for a couple of hours for sanitisation on Saturday after the nurse got her report. Several of the 40 chemotherapy patients who visit the centre in a day have also been advised home quarantine. At least 70 healthcare workers from the hospital are in quarantine.“There is a team that is contact tracing and will advise home quarantine or testing to colleagues and patients who might have come in contact with the nurse,” said Dr DK Sharma. All the patients from gastroenterology department of the hospital, where another nurse had tested positive, tested negative for the infection.A staff of Batra hospital tested positive on Sunday. The woman, who lives in Malviya Nagar, was employed in the hospital’s pharmacy. “Four of her family members have been put in institutional quarantine and one low risk contact has been put in home quarantine,” said a senior district official.In a letter to NCDC director, dated April 24, Delhi government’s health secretary Padmini Singla referred to the above mentioned hospitals and wrote, “It has been reported that doctors, nurses and other support staff (of the above mentioned hospitals)…are getting themselves infected with COVID-19 and becoming a source of infection in the society when they go to their respective homes. It is suspected that proper guidelines and SOPs may not be properly followed in these hospitals.”The government requested the NCDC to carry out a “quick assessment and audit of implantation of various guidelines, SOPs and other measures in these hospitals” to prevent the spread of the infection to doctors etc.“The increase in the number of health care workers, those posted at hospitals and their contacts testing positive is a cause of concern. It might be that adequate measures for protection are not being taken by hospital authorities, including those which are not treating Covid-19 cases. There is an urgent need to fix these lapses,” said a district magistrate (DM), requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-government-orders-an-audit-of-seven-city-hospitals/story-GeoG1zFvts7eS2GSMuIQGJ.html
27-04-2020||Delhi||At Delhi’s shelter homes, inmates complain of no medicine while doctors battle multiple threats||Nearly 110 doctors, all of whom are postgraduate students of the Delhi government’s Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) and have been posted to shelter homes, quarantine centres and government dispensaries across the city, say they have no medicines, infrastructure or even basic equipment to treat patients.Delhi has 259 regular shelter homes for the homeless, of whom 112 are porta-cabins, 111 are inside buildings and 36 are tents. The government has also converted 256 school buildings into shelters for migrant workers. Each of these facilities can house between 300 and 600 persons.“On Friday, a man living in a shelter home complained of severe pain in his lower abdomen. A few hours later, he started vomiting blood. Such a patient requires a hospital set-up for treatment and I did not even have the equipment needed to conduct his physical examination,” a doctor deployed at a shelter home in west Delhi, said requesting anonymity. On Tuesday, a 50-year-old migrant worker died at a Delhi government-run temporary shelter home in Chabi Ganj, Mori Gate. Officials said that though the man had no signs of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), he was unwell. The lack of medical supplies at the shelter home had prompted him to seek treatment from the Aruna Asaf Ali hospital last weekend. He died a few days later.Doctors said they only have basic treatment plans, which include medicines for fever, flu and stomach infections. In many places, they do not even have a thermometer or a blood pressure monitor.There is no provision to attend to cases of hematemesis, probable fractures or mental health episodes, which are some of the most reported cases from these facilities. According to 48-year-old Mohammad Tanveer, who is housed at a shelter home at central Delhi’s Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, he has had high fever for the past three days, along with bouts of vomiting. He alleged that the shelter did not even have a thermometer to check his temperature. All he was given was a paracetamol.When there was no relief or help from the facility, Tanveer said he took a loan of ₹2,500 from his fellow inmates at the shelter and with their help got himself admitted to a private hospital nearby, that too after much pleading.“I had almost lost consciousness, but there was no help at the shelter facility. I have been here for more than 20 days, but not a single doctor has visited. People have no means, proper food or even medical aid. If we die like this, how different will it be from dying of the virus?” Tanveer, who is a migrant labourer from Bihar’s Purnia, said.Thirty-five-year-old Mugeri, who goes by his first name, also a daily wager housed at the same shelter, said that many people here have complained of breathlessness, fever and dehydration over the past few days but doctors have not been informed.“Their condition cannot be helped by just some basic medicine. They need hospital-like care. A week ago, we called an ambulance. It took more than four-five hours to reach us and when it did, they refused to take the man saying it was not their case. We then had to call an NGO for help,” Mugeri said.Sunil Kumar Aledia, a social activist working for the homeless and founder of the Centre for Holistic Development (CHD), said, “Medical teams are visiting only a few shelters. Besides erratic timings and meagre food portions, there is no arrangement to provide medical aid to occupants,” Aledia said.He added that many inmates are patients of tuberculosis and HIV, and most are falling sick of the heat and improper nutrition. “The government must ensure proper medical aid for the large number of migrants and the homeless in shelters to save them from diseases and death.”The doctors also expressed their trepidations. A doctor, who has been posted at one such shelter home in east Delhi, said several inmates have been showing signs of physical discomfort as well because of their history of substance abuse.The doctor said that when they are not given proper medical attention, they often resort to violence and become a threat to others. He said two doctors are usually stationed at these centres during the day, and one doctor takes the night shift.“The government needs to understand that we are working without proper gear. We do not get personal protective equipment (PPEs) to protect ourselves from possibly infected patients; neither do we get alternative accommodation nor do we get any transportation facilities. We have been thrown here in these facilities, where there is a grave risk of violence against us,” he said, requesting anonymity.Another doctor posted to west Delhi said that medicos have been facing harassment—inmates have even tried to spit and urinate on them. She said that one of the homeless facilities in the area had to be shut down after a person staying there was found Covid-19 positive.“We are working in such close proximity with people who could have the coronavirus disease, that too without any protection. Last week, when I was leaving after the end of my shift, a man from the shelter began to chase me and I had to run to save myself. The policemen stationed there did nothing to protect me,” she said.The Resident Doctors’ Association of MAMC and associated hospitals, which represents four hospitals—including Lok Nayak Hospital (LNH), one of the biggest Covid-19-designated centres in the Capital—had written to the Delhi government on April 13 against the deployment of these 110 students in shelter homes, quarantine centres and dispensaries when they could be used to strengthen the workforce at Lok Nayak.“This relocation of PGs clearly overburdens the vital manpower resources at LNH, which are already under excessive stress,” the letter written by the association read.A senior Delhi government official said there is a clear-cut protocol in place that if anyone needs medical attention in such centres, they need to be shifted to a non-covid hospital in the area. “Any hospital will take them and treat them. There is no point in making an issue of this. There is no shortage of medicines in any of the centres but you can’t expect to treat severe medical conditions there,” the official said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-delhi-s-shelter-homes-inmates-complain-of-no-medicine-while-doctors-battle-multiple-threats/story-ygEUDEqBpmztdr3t5xF51L.html
27-04-2020||Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad tests Covid-19 negative, claims aide||Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad has tested negative for coronavirus, according to his associate. The person, who requested not to be named, said Saad’s result was received on Sunday and they will submit it to the police on Monday. “The crime branch had asked us to submit his Covid-19 test results. Now that we have it, we’ll submit it to the police team on Monday,” the person said. However, Saad is unlikely to appear before the police immediately. “We have been cooperating with the police and following their instructions step by step. If they summon him, he’ll visit them,” the person said.Saad has been booked under the Epidemic Act and sections of Indian Penal Code, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, after hundreds of people who visited the Nizamuddin Markaz in March were found infected with Sars-Cov-2. Saad remains in home-quarantine at a relative’s house in south Delhi.While senior police officers remained tight-lipped about the developments in this case, an officer said they are in no hurry to arrest Saad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tablighi-jamaat-chief-maulana-saad-tests-covid-negative-claims-aide/story-qA4kk0zspXFzwq6OltVg8O.html
27-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi shops remain shut as owners wait for more clarity||Till 1pm on Sunday, Sanjay Sharma (42), owner of an electric shop in south Delhi’s Munirka village, kept calling his friends in the local market to enquire if they were planning to open their shops. The Delhi government’s decision on Saturday to implement the Centre’s guidelines for reopening neighbourhood shops and stand-alone stores in residential neighbourhoods had given him hope of reopening his store after a month. But due to lack of clarity, Sharma and his friends decided to wait for further clarity on the matter. “We don’t want to violate the law and get into trouble. It is better if we keep it closed till things are clear,” said Sharma.Close to one lakh small traders in the city are likely to benefit, but many didn’t open their shops, citing lack of clarity and fear of police action.In most residential localities, only grocery stores, chemist shops and those selling vegetables and milk were open on Sunday.Need for definitionIn most residential areas, commercial activity is allowed on the ground floor of many buildings. Due to the rampant commercialisation of residential areas, there are no stand-alone shops anymore.“My shop is in a residential area, but there are other shops around. What does the government mean by stand-alone shops?” said Anil Chandiok, owner of an electrical appliances store in Acharya Niketan Market of Mayur Vihar Phase 1. “There is little clarity. I asked my staff who stays nearby to open and clean the shop at least,” he said.Deepak Sabrawal, a trader at Kotla Mubarakpur, said, “For the past two days, we have been getting contradictory orders and reports. Traders in the city are confused. The government should come out with a list of permitted traders.” The police didn’t allow traders here to open the shop.The issue was also raised by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) with the Union home ministry on Sunday. Praveen Khandelwal, secretary-general of CAIT, said, “There is no such thing as neighbourhood shops in Delhi. We have sought clarity.”Traders in local shopping complexes, mainly located in residential areas, said that market complexes should be allowed. “If a stationery store is allowed in a shop operating from a residential building, then why is it not permitted in the neighbourhood market? Moreover, market complexes are planned areas; it is easier to ensure social distancing,” said Rajinder Sharda, president, M-Block market in GK-I.With shops closed for over a month, most traders said that they have incurred huge losses. Sumit Gupta, the owner of a stationery shop in Patparganj, said, “This is the busiest time of the year for us. With most schools turning to online learning, there is a chance that my business will suffer…Not many know what all is allowed now,” he said.Police actionNot just the traders, but the police were in a quandary too about the relaxations. Till Sunday evening, the Delhi Police had not received any written orders regarding the relaxation from the government.“In a conference with the chief secretary, we were informed that the markets, malls and shops in the clusters wouldn’t be allowed to open. Once we receive the written orders from the PHQ, we’ll inform our officers on the ground about implementation,” a deputy commissioner of police (DCP) said. Another DCP said that he plans to allow up to two adjacent shops to open. “Up to two shops is not a cluster. But beyond that, it would be difficult to enforce social distancing,” said the DCP.While the police refused permission to open shops in some areas, traders in most parts of Delhi didn’t open their stores, fearing police action. In south Delhi neighbourhoods of Malviya Nagar and Khirki Extension, confusion prevailed.“Yesterday (Saturday), we had a copy of the Union home ministry’s order on our phones, but the police did not listen to us. Now, we have heard about the CM’s announcement in the news. What is the guarantee that the police will let us function?” said Satpal Rana, a stationery shop owner in Khirki Extension.On Sunday, Rana opened his shop after around a month, but only for cleaning and dusting. As a few customers approached, he requested them to call him tomorrow.In north Delhi’s Ashok Vihar, the police did not allow traders to open their shops in the residential area of pocket B, Phase-3, as they had not received such orders.Pramod Kohli, president, residents’ welfare association, said, “The local police told us that they haven’t received orders yet and from tomorrow (Monday), shops dealing in stationery, electronic items, mobile accessories and other such stores can open.”Shop owners, who opened their stores, said that there is not enough stock as shops have remained closed for a month now.Gautam, a resident of Aya Nagar who has an electrical goods store in the area, decided to open his shop on Sunday. While there is a huge demand for fans, coolers and air-conditioners, Gautam says that he doesn’t have stock. “We usually get our stock in March-end, but this time, we couldn’t get it due to the lockdown. We have placed the order, but the supplier doesn’t have stock. There is no point in opening the shop when we don’t have goods,” Gautam said.Another issue, Gautam pointed out, is of transportation. “There are no rickshaws or cart pullers available. How should we send the goods to customers? The labour is not available due to police fear,” he said.Residents oppose moveA large number of residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in the city opposed the government’s decision.Rejimon CK, member and co-founder of Dwarka Forum (an association of RWAs in Dwarka), said, “The decision to allow neighbourhood shops will only lead to chaos and increase the threat of transmission of Covid-19, as residential areas in Delhi are largely commercial. There is nothing like a stand-alone shop in Delhi. The government should open them in a phased manner.”Some RWAs did support the government’s decision to relax norms but feel that only essential service providers should be allowed and that too, only in local shopping complexes. “Local complexes have a lot of space and social distancing can be ensured there. Also, open essential services, like electricians, plumbers, mechanics, etc, in areas under the green zone. The government should tell people which municipal wards are in the red zone,” said Atul Goyal, president of URJA, a collective of RWAs in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-shops-remain-shut-as-owners-wait-for-more-clarity/story-0j1pFNgt1pKf5V55o4PcOM.html
27-04-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal says no further relaxation till May 3, traders seek clarity on shops allowed to open||There will be no lockdown relaxations in Delhi until May 3, except for those suggested by the Union home ministry, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday, adding that his government’s focus is on bringing down Covid-19 infections in the city.He said that neighbourhood and stand-alone shops will be allowed to reopen, but markets, shopping complexes and malls will remain closed. Curbs in containment zones will continue as is, the chief minister said in a press briefing through video conference. His statement came as confusion prevailed on the implementation of the Centre’s guidelines in the Capital, amid opposition from residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) across the city. Till Sunday, 2,918 positive cases and 54 deaths were reported in Delhi.Stand-alone shops in residential areas, including those selling non-essential goods, are allowed to function in the Capital, expect in containment zones. These shops will have to follow the guidelines issued by the Union home ministry on Friday night. After the lockdown ends on May 3, the relaxations or curbs would depend on guidelines issued by the Central government.“Shops selling essential goods would continue functioning like they were during the lockdown. Other than that, stand-alone shops in residential areas not selling essential goods would be allowed to function too, in adherence to the Central government’s guidelines. But no shops in markets, DDA (Delhi Development Authority) and civic authority-run commercial complexes and shopping malls would be allowed to operate. Also, no activities would be allowed in the containment zones,” said Kejriwal.Delhi currently has 97 containment zones, which are under strict surveillance and subjected to periodic sanitisation, door-to-door health checks of residents and scaled-up testing. In these red zones, the government ensures doorstep delivery of essentials, so that residents do not venture outdoors.Earlier, the Central government, in guidelines issued on April 15, had allowed conditional relaxations in areas outside containment zones from April 20. This includes self-employed workers, such as plumbers and electricians, workers at construction projects and industrial activities in designated industrial areas that have an adequate arrangement for accommodating workers. However, Delhi has not allowed these relaxations due to presence of hot spots in all its 11 revenue districts. Kejriwal had earlier proposed to revisit the decision on April 27, but the plan has now been called off, said senior government officials on Sunday.“Measures we take after May 3 will depend on the guidelines issued by the Central government,” said Kejriwal.On Monday, chief ministers are scheduled to join Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a video conference, to decide on the future course of action.“Last week, there were more than 850 fresh Covid cases reported, along with 21 deaths. This week, the number of fresh cases dropped to 662 and nine deaths were recorded. It is important to note that recovery rate has doubled – from 260 people last week to 580 people this week. The trends are encouraging,” read a statement issued by the chief minister’s office later in the day.Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev issued an order about reopening of neighbourhood shops. “The said activities shall be allowed to operate in letter and spirit in Delhi with immediate effect, subject to strict maintenance of social distancing and other prescribed Covid-19 protocols… District disaster management authority shall ensure strict compliance of this order and bring this order to the knowledge of all field functionaries at ground level in Delhi for strict compliance without fail while ensuring that the containment of Covid-19 disease remains the main and prime objective of the district administration,” read the order.Several trade bodies reported confusion about the implementation of the order. “There is a lot of confusion among traders, which prevented them from opening shops today (Sunday),” said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary-general of the Confederation of All India Traders. The body has written to the Union home ministry, seeking clarifications, he said.“In its letter to the home secretary, the confederation has said that despite orders being issued, there is confusion regarding what constitutes ‘neighbourhood shops’ and ‘stand-alone shops’. There are several interpretations by the authorities. There is, as such, no clear definition for such terms, which is a problematic matter,” said Khandelwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-says-no-further-relaxation-till-may-3-traders-seek-clarity-on-shops-allowed-to-open/story-8jLPWDmhb1FJV3QO855daN.html
27-04-2020||Gurugram||Five landlords arrested for forcibly demanding rent||Five landlords were arrested at Sarawati Kunj in Sector 53 on Saturday for allegedly demanding rent from their tenants during the lockdown. The police said that the arrests were made after the tenants, all of whom are migrant workers, approached them and registered five different cases. The landlords were granted bail. The Haryana government and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) had earlier issued directions stating that landlords in the city should not demand house rent for one month from migrant workers, students and paramedics. In an order issued earlier this month, the authorities had stated that if any landlord was found forcing his tenants to vacate, he would be liable to face strict criminal action.According to the police, the tenants came to the station to complain about their landlords on Saturday. Five separate cases were registered based on statements recorded by Raju from Delhi, and Alibudin Seikh, Rabirul, Armaan Seikh and Jiyar Ali from West Bengal. They work as daily wagers in Gurugram. The complainants alleged that they were paying rent between ₹600 and ₹1,500 every month. Deepak Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Sector 53 police station, said, “The complainants alleged that their landlords were forcibly demanding rent from them. On Saturday, we received five different complaints and arrested the men. We are investigating the matter.”Cases were registered against the men under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 384 (punishment for extortion) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Sector 53 police station on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/five-landlords-arrested-for-forcibly-demanding-rent/story-aEa0puRphRUcjshLnaBjqL.html
27-04-2020||Gurugram||Haryana govt allows construction work on small sites with 10 or less workers||In order to ensure that migrant labourers get work, the Haryana government has allowed the resumption of work on small construction and industrial construction sites where the number of workers is 10 or less, provided that these sites fall outside the containment zones. A directive issued by labour department, late on Saturday night, stated that no permission would be required for these projects to resume, provided that the social distancing norms are observed and the standard operating procedure is followed.It is estimated that this decision will help at least 2,500 builder floors and housing projects spread across various sectors of the Haryana Sahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) and private licenced colonies in the city, said officials. At majority of these sites, the labourers either are staying on the site or at a short distance from the site, officials added. The order issued by the labour department stated, “No permission will be required for small residential/industrial construction sites employing up to 10 workers only within the limit of municipal corporations, municipalities and rural areas where workers are available on site and no workers are brought from outside (sic).”Ramesh Singla, president, Gurugram Home Developers and Plot Holders Association, said that this was a positive decision and could help kick-start real estate industry in a big way. “A large number of contractors are taking care of their workers amid the lockdown and this is proving to be a big financial burden for them. It is important the work starts on these sites but the administration need to bring more clarity on this and help to smoothen out the resumption of work,” he added.A district administration spokesperson said that work can be resumed at those sites, where labourers are already staying. “The construction sites will have to be sanitised and disinfected regularly. Workers will have to wear masks and maintain social distancing during work,” he added.Meanwhile, the developers and contractors, who are operating such construction sites in various parts of the city said that they would wait for some time before resuming work. “The work can only be started if construction materials, such as sand, stones, tiles and cement, are available. Right now, it does not seem that these materials would be available easily. As such, we have decided to wait till May 3,” said Pramod Kumar, a contractor in Palam Vihar, who runs 11 small sites and has 80 workers working under him.Kumar said that he has been providing food and dry ration to the workers during the lockdown. “We want things to settle down a bit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-government-allows-construction-work-on-small-sites-with-10-or-less-workers/story-Jt1QJVzy6YC0shiO1y60WL.html

VS Kundu, monitoring official for Covid-19 preparations in Gurugram, said on Sunday that all those who have offices in the city should prefer working from home model till the extent possible. Kundu is also the chief executive officer of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). Speaking with HT, Kundu, who is also the additional chief secretary of Haryana government, said that given the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, the administration was looking at gradual resumption of work at offices of private firms operating in the city, while maintaining social distancing and safety norms. “It is my personal estimation under prevailing situation that some staff in non-essential and routine offices in Gurugram may have to work from home till July-end. No such advisory or order has been issued by the government. The directions of the central and state governments will be meticulously followed in Gurugram in this regard,” said Kundu. Gurugram is home to a large number of IT, ITes, and BPO companies, which have been forced to close their offices since March 25 after the lockown was announced by government. A number of these companies have successfully managed to ensure that their workers are able to work remotely so that the business continuity is not disturbed.In a broader context, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said on Sunday that the lockdown will have to be lifted gradually in a phased manner. “Everything cannot be done everywhere at the same time. So, the things have to be re-opened gradually according to the situations. To prevent damage to economy, it has been decided to open the sale and production of everyday essential commodities first,” said Chautala in a statement released on Sunday. He also made it clear that liquor shops will stay closed till May 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/employees-of-private-firms-in-ggm-may-have-to-work-from-home-until-end-of-july/story-59zNrflRrOWhYKA341PEJN.html

The hospital gave him one more transfusion of 200 ml on Sunday, the final one (also of 200 ml) will be given on Monday.The therapy involves transfusing plasma – a component of the blood – from a recovered patient into one who is fighting the infection, to act as a reinforcement for the latter’s immune system.“His intake of oxygen has improved but it will be too early to comment on it,” said a health officer from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Coincidentally, the blood group of the donor which is O-positive, got matched with the recipient. Though cross -blood group transfusion is possible but presently hospitals are not risking it.In this process, blood is collected from cured young patients who don’t have any comorbid health issues. After extracting plasma, it is transfused into older patients who have a higher mortality rate. Kerala was the first state to start the convalescent plasma therapy with approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). As HT reported earlier, on April 13, Lokmanya Tilak General Municipal Hospital collected around 600 ml of blood from a recovered Covid-19 patient in his 20s for the transfusion. Dr Om Srivastava, an epidemiologist is heading the process. Following this, ICMR, Lilavati hospital was allowed to conduct the first plasma transmission in the state on Saturday night. “To run the clinical trial, we had to seek permission from the family of the patients,” said an official from the hospital.As per the sources from the hospital, they have sought approval from BMC to allow them to extract plasma for the process, so that they don’t have to depend on other hospitals. “We have our blood bank where cured patients after three works of recovery can donate his/her blood for the process. But for that we have approached BMC which will seek permission from the ICMR,” said the official, on condition of anonymity. BMC has got three more donors for plasma therapy..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-plasma-therapy-trial-in-maha-53-year-old-s-condition-improves/story-MfBtsAYPwirheZAWZdeCaK.html

It is sad, but serves a lesson: As you sow, so shall you reap. While family members anxiously wait for their loved ones to recover and welcome them with flowers, Sehgal’s family refused to pick him up. There was no one to receive him as he walked out of the Covid-19 ward,” said civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga, adding that the youth will continue to stay at the hospital for sometime as providing a patient nutritious diet was important. Arrested on April 5 for snatching, Sehgal was suspected to be infected by a doctor posted at the Ludhiana Central Jail, where he was taken for judicial custody post his arrest. As he tested positive for coronavirus on April 9, as many as 17 police personnel, including Focal Point SHO Mohd Jamil, two civilians and a duty magistrate were home quarantined.

Wondering how carjackers could be active during heavy police deployment because of the curfew, the police team reached the complainant’s home to find him sharing details of the vehicle with the PCR officials. “We proceeded to check the cameras and also questioned the helpers in the man’s house but could not join the dots, as they no clue about it,” said a police official requesting anonymity.However, as the police were questioning people living in the house, a young woman came forward and confessed that she had lied about the theft fearing the wrath of her family.“The girl took the vehicle for a ride up to Sector 11, when it was stopped at a checkpoint by the police patrolling staff near the sector 23/24 light point. Since she did not possess a curfew pass the vehicle was impounded and out of fear she cooked up a story,” the official added.Investigators tracing the vehicle found it had been taken to the traffic lines. A challan was issued in the name of the woman. The vehicle owner is a businessman related to a highly placed political family in Punjab.Jaspal Singh, station house officer (SHO) Sector 3, said, “We have not taken any action against the girl and after recording the statements the matter was closed.

27-04-2020||Pune||120 micro-clusters in hotspots under scanner in Pune||The city police have identified at least 120 micro-clusters across the city, from where positive cases have been reported. Along, with the officials of the Pune Municipal Commission (PMC), the police will visit these spots and ensure aggressive enforcement of lockdown and restrict the movement of people. This will help PMC officials to screen residents for possible cases of Covid-19 (coronavirus).K Venkatesham, commissioner of Pune police, said, “The survey has been done by additional commissioner of Police (crime) Ashok Morale and his team. Based on the number of cases in a particular area and the reasons for infections reported in the areas.”“We will see if 100 per cent restrictions should be imposed and identify people who have come in contact with positive patients so that they can be treated. Senior citizens and comorbid people in these areas could be put in shelters in a particular area,” he said.Most of the city’s cases are reported from Bhawani peth, Kasba peth and neighbouring areas, which prompted police and civic administration to declare it as containment zones early this month. However, despite declaring parts of peth areas as containment zones, Covid-19 cases have been on a rise.“We have established a network of volunteers to help. The purpose (of this exercise) is to identify people as early as possible and to break the chain. If there are people who are not reporting due to some fear, we will be reaching out to them by going to doorstep while taking due precaution and maintaining social distancing,” said Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of police, Pune.The spots clusters have been identified with the help of crime branch and are spread across 13 major clusters in the city, according to Sanjay Shinde, additional commissioner of police, Pune. Every cluster has multiple micro-clusters he said.“Micro-clusters are those areas from where five-ten cases have been reported. We will be visiting and conducting a joint survey in these areas. The aim is to contain and restrict the spread of infection. The visits will begin tomorrow. For example, if you visit Tadiwala road, there are five to six places. We will ensure availability and use of mask, sanitiser, inspect the cleanliness of common toilets, social distancing, fumigation,” said Additional CP Shinde.The 13 clusters are spread across multiple areas including Mukundnagar-Parvati darshan, Gultekdi, Lumbininagar, Tadiwala road, Bhawani Peth, Kasewadi, Ghorpade Peth-Mominpura-Gurwar Peth, Nana Peth, 633-455 Gunj Peth, 54 Lohiyanagar, Mangalwar peth-Kasba peth, Mithanagar-Saibabanagar-Bhagyodaynagar in Kondhwa, 1088 Ravivar peth, Patil Estate, and Lakshminagar-Yerawada.While the PMC and police have been working in their own capacities, this exercise will bring the two on the same page, according to a senior official.As on April 25, the city had 1139 positive cases of which at least 214 are from the Bhawani peth area, at least 160 in Dhole-Patil road area, at least 133 in Shivajinagar-Ghole road area, at least 127 are from Kasba peth-Vishrambaugwada area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/120-micro-clusters-in-hotspots-under-scanner-in-pune/story-Nb7CKHV5T472sK1DPWeoaP.html

Although top companies are selling products online, they are also finding fewer customers in the state.Akshaya Tritiya, a spring festival mainly observed by Hindus and Jains, signifies the day of unending prosperity. On this day, they purchase gold products or invest in properties.According to jewellers, Akshaya Tritiya used to be a day of huge business, and huge rush of customers was common at their shops every year.“But today, shops are closed and we are sitting home,” said Anand Sikri, president of the Jewellers Association, while recalling the hustle and bustle in the market witnessed on this day.“This time, enthusiasm is missing. Jewellers are sitting at home and unable to sell anything, even online,” he said, adding he had not received even a single call from any customer since morning, which had never been the case earlier.Nand Kumar Jain from Munish Diamonds said, “The country’s economic growth was already slow, but now it has been hit hard by the lockdown.”“Residents are also showing less interest in buying gold. They are rather focusing on purchasing grocery items, medicines and arranging money for their workers,” he said.Asim Nagpal from Tanishq, Ludhiana, said, “The company is booking some orders with advance payment on its online portal, but products will be delivered to customers only after the lockdown is over.”“However, people are hesitating to make big purchases, and most of them are preferring coins. Gold jewellery worth less than Rs 2 lakh is available on the portal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akshaya-tritiya-jewellers-consumers-in-ludhiana-miss-the-usual-hustle-and-bustle/story-CerCDuX0L3dX0qWEcEfIcL.html

This year the scenario will be different as we will have fewer fresh players on the court during the entire year.”“The players who have played district, state or national tournaments will not be affected much as they continue practice, even now. They follow an exercise routine at home and perform drills. They will be eagerly waiting to get back on the field,” said Nahata.NBA India junior west zone trials affectedAn important game which city players missed due to the lockdown is NBA India Junior West Zone trials which were scheduled for March 14 and 15, according to Nahata.“It was a vital tournament and gives good exposure to players. Selected players represent west zone at the NBA India National Championship which was scheduled in May, but it is now cancelled,” explains Nahata.NBA juniors is popular in the city as it attracts quality players. “In the last couple of years we have seen many players from state getting selected for NBA India Junior programme and they also get chance to go overseas and train in NBA academies,” added Nahata.Junior (under- 18), youth (under- 16) category tournaments suspendedMost of the under-16 players avoid playing during their Class 10 exams and train hard during these two months (April and May) to get selected for nationals and state tourneys, and the same is for the under-18 category. This year tournaments under these categories stand suspended.“The season for the junior and youth categories starts in April and May. For these players, it is their last chance in the u-16 category and these two months are all about sharpening their drills to give in their best performance,” said Nahata.Coaches keep players motivated via fitness drillsMost of the coaches are now using social video apps to task various coaching drills to the players. “They conduct online competitions like whoever post best fitness video will become the leader of the group and all other will be following her/him to do the fitness drills,” said Nahata.“Keeping players motivated is one of the biggest tasks for coaches,” added Nahata..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/few-fresh-faces-will-be-on-field-this-year-lalit-nahata-vice-president-pdba/story-lLlMRPzUG4KMWFFRMj5coL.html

27-04-2020||Pune||Decision on Pune varsity exams only after lockdown, says SPPU vice-chancellor||In view of the Covid-19 (coronavirus) lockdown, the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), on Sunday, announced that it will wait for the state government’s decision about when to hold university and college examinations for all the institutes under the SPPU umbrella. Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor, SPPU, said that colleges will not reopen until the state government issues an order. The order is likely to come after May 3.Karmalkar said this after a panel set up by the University Grants Commission (UGC) submitted recommendations on the revised academic calendar and suggestions for holding examinations under lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic.According to the statement released by UGC, the commission members are likely to discuss the recommendations via video-conferencing on Monday and issue advisory guidelines for institutions of higher education. Most colleges and universities have not yet held their semester examinations to close out the current academic year.The first committee under the chairmanship of professor RC Kuhad, former member UGC and vice-chancellor, Central University of Haryana, was given the responsibility to look into the issues related to examinations and academic calendar. The second committee under the chairmanship of professor Nageshwar Rao, vice-chancellor, Indira Gandhi National Open University (Ignou) was asked to look into issues related to promoting online education.UGC will issue guidelines in consultation with the ministry of Human resource development following which universities can chalk out their action plan.“We have taken cognisance of the report submitted by UGC but I will believe in any order coming in from the state office, the report should be rectified by the commission first after it has been submitted. We may not follow in totality all the points put forth by the UGC but only in accordance with changes applicable in the state,” said Karmalkar.Maharashtra board may delay SSC and HSC results With the delay in the assessment of HSC and SSC papers due to the lockdown, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), is likely to delay the announcement of results for secondary and higher secondary school exams.According to MSBSHSE officials, the decision is pending due to the delay in assessment of the Geography paper. “Due to the lockdown, submission of answer sheets to moderators has become a challenge and that could add to the delay in results being declared. Usually, we would declare the HSC results by May end, and SSC results by June first week, however, students will have to wait for a bit longer for their results,” said Shakuntala Kale, chairman, MSBSHSE.On Geography’s evaluation in view of cancellation of exam, Kale said, “We are waiting for a government response on what will be the next step regarding the remaining subject, but we haven’t received any reply yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/decision-on-varsity-exams-only-after-lockdown-sppu-v-c/story-SUMfNppwh3STsl2gTtBvbM.html
27-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: Making 6,000 chapattis in an hour... just to ensure nobody goes hungry||The Sikh community in Pune is working tirelessly to deliver free meals, daily, to people struggling with financial hardship during the Covid-19 lockdown in Pune. At the Gurdwara Gurunanak Darbar in Camp, a langar (community meal) is being prepared for 5,000 people every day. Sant Singh Mokha, a Sikh community leader and chairman of the Darbar, speaks to HT about how the community kitchen safely serves meals to the poor and hungry.What exactly is your role in this crisis?We prepare food for at least 5,000 people daily. Our volunteers prepare the food at the community kitchen. The langar is distributed to social organisations, NGOs and the Army, who then distribute it to the poor in the city. With respect to funds, we are not facing any shortage as of now. We are coordinating with the regional gurudwaras for this. My responsibility is to ensure that no one sleeps hungry. We have two chapatti-making machines at our kitchen. While one machine can make 4,000 chapattis at a time, the other one can make 2,000 chapattis in an hour. So a total of 6,000 chapattis are made and served in one hour to feed the poor.How does your day begin and roll out?After waking up I do yoga for half-an-hour and also walk in my house. Post that, I take a call on what has to be done in the community kitchen during the day. I have a conversation with our volunteers who execute the plan for the day.What precautions are you taking?I take necessary precautions like wearing a mask, sanitising my hands and wearing gloves whenever I head out. Our volunteers who prepare the food at the community kitchen also follow social distancing norms and wear masks.What is your assessment of Covid-19 crisis in Pune?The officials have not been able to curb the spread of Covid-19 in slum pockets. People there have small houses which makes it difficult for them to follow social distancing norms; they are also not aware about the health and hygiene standards that must be followed. I believe that there should be equitable development where all persons can avail the same quality of life.What gaps do you see in health and relief work?The government has done a good job by imposing a strict lockdown. However, the areas where there are no patients must not be subjected to restrictions. The administration must concentrate on the red zones in the city to help curb the spread of virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/6-000-chapattis-in-an-hour-to-ensure-nobody-goes-hungry/story-EJiPfRKbu58ZhaiaLPAMfJ.html
27-04-2020||Football||East Bengal prematurely terminate contracts of players, citing COVID-19 pandemic||In a big blow to the players and officials, I-League side East Bengal have terminated all the existing contracts, citing ‘Force Majeure’ in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. Left with no option, the players have now knocked the doors of the Football Players Association of India who have assured full support and referred the matter to the world body for players (FIFPro). Confirming this, East Bengal’s top Spanish winger Jaime Santos Colado said the entire team disagrees with the decision. “This is true, they have terminated our contracts citing COVID-19 pandemic (Force Majeure). The entire team disagrees with that decision, we hope to reach an agreement soon. We are working on that,” the 24-year-old, who has two more years’ contract left, told PTI. Currently, several foreign players of East Bengal are stuck in India because of the lockdown. “We are trying to go home, but no club or embassy is helping us at the moment,” a desperate Colado added. Coming in support of the players, FPAI wrote on their Twitter handle: “No club can prematurely terminate contracts with players because of the pandemic. There has to be a mutual understanding and the player must agree to it. “We are in touch with all the players and will take up this issue on a priority basis with global stakeholders @FIFPro.” The big blow came on Saturday when East Bengal’s title sponsors Quess Corp, who have already announced their dissociation with the club from June onwards, informed the players and officials about the decision by an e-mail. Founder of Quess Corp Ajit Isaac and the company’s CEO Sanjit Sen were not available for comment. East Bengal, who are already in a team-building mode, are in talks with prospective investors in their bid to follow arch-rivals Mohun Bagan into the Indian Super League from next season. The red-and-gold outfit had a patchy I-League campaign that saw them parting ways with coach Alejandaro Menendez after losing the derby to eventual champions Mohun Bagan. They were at second spot (with 23 points) when the remaining I-League matches were cancelled due to the coronavirus-forced nation-wide lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/east-bengal-prematurely-terminate-contracts-of-players-citing-covid-19-pandemic/story-u66rw1jhu5fBsiyrn4LjMP.html

The low-cost hand sanitiser is being used by the staff and is proving to be effective in containing the spread of the virus,” he said.GADVASU vice-chancellor AS Nanda said the timely availability of this product had helped in the provision of services by the university while keeping the varsity staff safe from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gadvasu-develops-low-cost-hand-sanitiser/story-sFcP7jxlKm8azHuvFwDlrO.html

The 9,000 square feet hall on the first floor of mosque has a capacity for 80 beds has been turned into a quarantine centre, informed P A Inamdar, chairman of Maharashtra Cosmopolitan and Education Society (MCES).The officials of the Campus have offered the facility to the district administration who is yet to decide on the same. Inamdar said, “We have obtained required permission from the administration and the first floor is ready for use as a quarantine facility. Our trust will also provide food to patients who will be here.”“We are contributing whatever we can towards helping the state government in combating the Covid-19 pandemic. The mosque has all the facilities like beds, toilets, fans, electricity and other essentials needed for housing Covid-19 patients,” he said.”If more space is required for patients here it can be handed over to the administration,” Inamdar said.SM Iqbal, director, Muslim Co-operative Bank, said, “Giving the mosque for a quarantine facility is a good initiative. However, the Unani Hospital on the campus also has a full-fledged infrastructure while Inamdar Multispeciality Hospital in Wanowrie can also be used as a quarantine facility for patients.”“The administration must consider the hospital first as they have the necessary facilities to provide relief to the patients. The Inamdar hospital is also run by a public trust and is eligible to be given to quarantine patients,” said Iqbal.Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “We will consider the facility which has been offered by the Azam Campus management. We have been looking out for big spaces and a final decision will be taken after necessary checks are done.”The MCE Society management which runs the trust had earlier expressed its readiness to voluntarily handover the mosque for creation of quarantine facility patients from Bhavani peth and Nana peth. These two areas located near Azam Campus have seen a maximum number of Covid-19 patients.Azam Campus management has so far distributed groceries estimated to be worth over Rs 25 lakh to the poor and needy and deployed five ambulances with a staff of 25 doctors to cater to the patients in central parts of the city including Kondhwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/city-mosque-ready-for-use-as-quarantine-facility/story-PIxOKkYtPYa37vXHfrHmeO.html
27-04-2020||Pune||Living in lockdown: No short supply of medicines; challenge is in delivery, say Pune distributors||In spite of numerous hurdles on account of lockdown in the city, medical distributors have been ensuring that supply reaches pharmacies throughout the city. According to Vijay Changeria, committee member chemists association of Pune, “Business is down by about 20% because almost 90% of doctors are not operating their clinics. People are not venturing out.”Besides, the chemists have been asked to maintain a record of people who ask for paracetamol or cough and cold medicines. “This list we have to send to the police every evening and send the customer to a doctor,” he said. When the lockdown was announced on March 25, there was panic, according to Vijay Rathi, owner of Anand Distributors, the largest in the city. Apart from the panic buying in the initial period, Rathi had to deal with reduced manpower as 50% of my staff didn’t turn up for work. On a normal day, Anand Distributors sees about 300 customers at the godown. “There was chaos for about two weeks. Customers would crowd at our store since there weren’t enough delivery boys. My staff too was at half strength. It took much longer to pack an order. Social distancing was very hard to maintain,” he saidFinally, a system was introduced whereby days were fixed for delivery to certain areas. While buyers could come from any area on Mondays to purchase emergency medicines, Tuesdays were allotted to Deccan, Aundh, Senapati Bapat road and Wednesday for Katraj, Bibvewadi, and so on. The distributor provided safety gear to his staff to reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection.Online suppliers to pharmacies like Biddano did not have a problem with staff shortage, said Talha Shaikh founder of the firm. However, getting police passes became difficult, especially during the extended phase of the lockdown, he said.Biddano has 4,000 pharmacies and over 200 hospitals as their customers. Almost 85% of their delivery executives use mobikes and they have about 30 tempos. PharmaRack another online platform with about 2,000 pharmacies and about 200 distributors in Pune on its platform faced a problem of getting permissions in place. Says Amit Backliwal co-founder, “It’s the last mile delivery that is an issue. For us the challenge is not so much the people to deliver the medicines but the passes they need to do the work. This is still a very cumbersome process. You have to go on the site, you get rejected, you apply again and you go through this rigmarole three to four times. Moreover, every pass is individual. It would be infinitely better if they gave it to an organisation instead.”Vinay Baldawa, an authorised dealer for medical equipment focusing mainly on dialysis consumables and machines, said, “A renal failure person has to undergo dialysis twice or thrice a week. If I cannot supply the consumables to the hospitals where they do it, their lives are at serious risk. So, Covid or no Covid, we have to deliver.”His deliveries have, however, been quite difficult, primarily because of labour shortage. Distributors said there is no shortage of stocks. “We have enough stocks for at least three to four months” said Rathi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/living-in-lockdown-no-short-supply-of-medicines-challenge-is-in-delivery-say-pune-distributors/story-UhOdpR7ZDedXwQIWVNiW6I.html

The pandemic could cost the global economy “tens of trillions of dollars,” he said in the interview.The foundation has contributed $250 million to help counter the coronavirus and is re-purposing units dedicated to fighting other diseases to join in the battle against the pandemic.“We’ve taken an organization that was focused on HIV and malaria and polio eradication, and almost entirely shifted it to work on this,” he told the FT.Gates also defended the World Health Organization against accusations from U.S. President Donald Trump that the body had mishandled the virus response.“WHO is clearly very, very important and should actually get extra support to perform their role during this epidemic,” Gates said. He said he doesn’t believe Trump will follow through on his threat to withdraw funding for the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-s-coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-12-months/story-nfp8plhHNyNfjBMELKsomM.html

27-04-2020||World||New York state set to start reopening from May 15 in phases||New York state, the American epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic, will begin reopening around mid-May, starting with low-risk businesses in regions with low incidence of the disease. New York city and its suburbs, which have borne the brunt of the epidemic, will remain under lockdown.“The numbers are on the decline: everything we have done is working,” New York governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters at his daily briefing Sunday. “There’s no doubt that we’ve gone at this point through the worst. And as long as we act prudently going forward, the worst should be over.”Phase One of the reopening could start on May 15, when the stay-at-home orders in the state are set to end.Cuomo told reporters Monday that he will be extending these restrictions — called the “New York on Pause” order — for parts of the state and will “unpause” them for some but urged local officials, who are raring to reopen, to be “smart” about it, and weigh their options carefully.Several US states have reopened or decided to over past few days as the spread has slowed down with a continuing drop in new cases and hospitalization — Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee. In addition to South Carolina, Georgia, Alaska and Oklahoma.But the cumulative number for all of the United States still look daunting: total infections went up by 27, 631 to 965,951 over the last 24 hours and fatalities by 1,126 to 54,877.New York state has been the worst hit with 288,045 infections thus far and 22,269 death with 17,280 in New York city alone.Officials have expressed optimism that the state may have come around and has passed the worst, even as they stress caution, urging people continuously to exercise all the necessary social-distancing guidelines, which, as the governor told reporters, has worked, slowing down the epidemic.Low-incidence area of upstate New York could begin reopening after May 15 when New “York State On Pause” are set to end. The reopening of an area or region will depend on a steady decline in new cases for 14 days there, and will apply to construction and manufacturing sectors., These areas will be closely monitored and the state could move to the next phase only if there was no resurgence in cases because of the reopening. In phase two, the resumption would be “business-by-business”.As a sign of continued improvement in the situation in the state, USNS Comfort, the naval hospital ship, that had been docked off New York city since March 30 to help it deal with a surge in cases, is returning to its bases in Norfolk, Virginia. It discharged its remaining patients Sunday, will be sailing for home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-state-set-to-start-reopening-from-may-15-in-phases/story-BCYUIZchNcJIUxJM9ZNs4L.html
27-04-2020||World||Nancy Pelosi, top House progressive give Joe Biden twin endorsements||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden renewed his party unification efforts Monday with bookend endorsements from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the leader of the House progressive caucus that sometimes battles the speaker from the left.The twin announcements from Pelosi and Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal highlight Biden’s effort to avoid a repeat of the 2016 presidential election, when tensions between establishment Democrats and the party’s progressive flank hobbled Hillary Clinton in her loss to President Donald Trump.Pelosi, a longtime friend of Biden’s, is a face of the Democratic establishment and boasts perhaps the widest network across the party’s wealthiest donors. Jayapal, who had previously backed Bernie Sanders for president, is co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose members want sweeping expansion of the federal government’s role in the economy, notably through a single-payer “Medicare for All” insurance plan that Biden and Pelosi do not favor.The two women reflected those varied approaches Monday as they explained their common conclusion that a Biden administration is the best chance for Democrats to advance a liberal agenda, even if in degrees.Pelosi, speaking in a video, said Biden offers “hope and courage, values, authenticity and integrity.” She said he’d be a “voice of reason and resilience” amid the coronavirus pandemic.The 80-year-old speaker also cited Biden’s work as President Barack Obama’s vice president during the 2010 health care overhaul and the economic recovery acts after the 2008 financial collapse.Jayapal, in her own statement, noted she has “not always agreed with Vice President Biden on matters of policy.” Yet she struck a pragmatic bottom line about the prospects of a second Trump term.“Any progress toward a better future requires defeating him this November,” Jayapal, 54, said.Further, the congresswoman echoed a claim Biden has repeated often amid his recent outreach to progressives. She framed his agenda as “the most progressive” for any Democratic nominee “in history.”In particular, the 77-year-old Biden touts his preferred health care path, a “public option” government plan to compete with private insurers but not outlaw them, as a major leap forward. He’s also moved toward the progressive flank, though not all the way to Sanders and Jayapal, with proposals to ease student loan debt and waive public college tuition for poor, working-class and many middle-class households. Sanders proposed forgiving all student loan debt and making all public college tuition-free.Pelosi’s support wasn’t unexpected now that Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee. Her backing nonetheless reinforces Biden’s contention that he is the party’s best chance to keep the House majority and regain Senate control from Republicans.As House minority leader in 2018, Pelosi spearheaded Democrats’ midterm House victories. The party won more than 40 Republican-held seats to take the majority and hand Pelosi a second turn as the first female speaker in U.S. history.Most of the party’s gains came in battleground districts anchored by suburbs and exurbs, places where the Biden campaign believes he can outpace Trump in November.Biden campaigned for many of the current House freshmen, and he often cited their victories during his primary campaign against progressive presidential rivals. He argued that Democrats succeeded in the 2018 midterms because they did not move too far to the left in historically Republican-leaning districts. Pelosi has said repeatedly that Democrats win when they recruit candidates who “fit their district.”Biden’s alliance with Pelosi, paired with his ongoing outreach to progressives, is not without political irony and risk.The former vice president has worked for decades to cultivate his image as a working-class ally born in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Pelosi, though mistrusted by the left as an establishment figure, has been a favorite target of Republicans who caricature the wealthy San Francisco Democrat as out of touch with most Americans.Republicans have doubled down with a similar strategy on Biden as he’s picked up more endorsements from progressives, including Sanders. Ultimately, those dynamics will test what is more persuasive to voters: the Republican contention that Biden’s proposals are a government expansion that threatens taxpayers or Biden’s contention that a liberal agenda is what would boost the middle class and overall economy.___Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-top-house-progressive-give-joe-biden-twin-endorsements/story-98KqwahXpRI3CuDdJBzO1H.html
27-04-2020||World||India, Kuwait resort to damage control after leak of Kuwaiti Cabinet note||Indian and Kuwaiti authorities resorted to damage control on Monday after a Cabinet note of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member state that expressed concern about the “targeting of Indian Muslims” was leaked on social media over the weekend.Kuwaiti ambassador Jasem Ibrahem al-Najam and external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava issued separate statements that highlighted strong bilateral ties and cooperation between the two countries in the fight against Covid-19.Srivastava also noted the Kuwaiti government had assured India that it doesn’t “support any interference in the internal affairs” of the country.The note in Arabic from Kuwait’s council of ministers, which was dated March 2 but was leaked on Twitter on Sunday by a well-known Kuwaiti scholar, expressed concern “about the targeting of Indian Muslims” and called on the world community and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to take steps to stop such attacks and end the bloodshed.At least two people familiar with developments confirmed the authenticity of the Kuwaiti Cabinet note.External affairs ministry spokesperson Srivastava noted the references to India by non-official social media handles in Kuwait and said: “The government of Kuwait has assured us that they are deeply committed to friendly relations with India. They also do not support any interference in the internal affairs of India.”Srivastava said India recently deployed a rapid response team at the request of Kuwait to assist that country in its fight against the Coronavirus. “During its two-week stay in Kuwait, the team rendered valuable medical assistance in testing and treatment of afflicted persons and training their personnel,” he said.He added, “It is therefore important that friendly and cooperative nature of our relations is accurately recognised and misuse of social media is not given credence.”Ambassador al-Najam said in a statement issued to Kuwait’s state-run Kuna news agency that the two countries “share many principles in their foreign policies, like respecting the UN Charter, non-interference in other countries’ affairs and respecting sovereignty of nations”.He further said Kuwait and India have a historic relationship and “always seek to develop them in [the] political and economic domains”. The two sides are cooperating and coordinating to step up the fight against Covid-19 and had been looking forward to a meeting of the bilateral joint committee in the first quarter of 2020 but this was postponed due to the pandemic, he said.India has been concerned by criticism on social media of the treatment of Indian Muslims by prominent commentators and members of royal families in some West Asian states. Over the past few days, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has reached out to his counterparts in GCC states and other Arab nations to discuss this issue and the welfare of Indian expatriates.On Monday, secretary (overseas Indian affairs) Sanjay Bhattacharyya of the external affairs ministry held a teleconference with envoys of the GCC states as a follow-up to Jaishankar’s conversations, people familiar with the development said.The GCC envoys thanked the Indian government for keeping open supply chains for food and medicines and for assisting in the evacuation of their citizens, one the people cited above said. The envoys also requested the deployment of Indian healthcare personnel in their countries to deal with the pandemic and discussed the issue of Indian nationals who want to return home, the person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-kuwait-resort-to-damage-control-after-leak-of-kuwaiti-cabinet-note/story-fJEQuzVXBWCVJ8X1Er06zH.html
27-04-2020||World||Violence increased in Afghanistan after US-Taliban deal: UN||Violence surged in Afghanistan in the weeks after the United States and the Taliban signed a deal supposed to pave the way for a peace process, a UN agency said Monday.Afghans had enjoyed a period of relative calm ahead of the February 29 accord, but the conflict resumed almost as soon as the deal was signed, and the militant group has since rejected multiple calls for a ceasefire during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.“The report tracks a disturbing increase in violence during March at a time when it was hoped that the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban would commence peace negotiations,” the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a statement accompanying the release of its quarterly report.More than 500 civilians were killed and over 700 injured during the first three months of the year, UNAMA said.While casualty numbers rose in March, UNAMA noted that the overall toll for the first quarter of 2020 was down 29 percent from a year earlier, thanks to a lull in fighting in January and February -- including a week-long partial truce -- as US and Taliban negotiators ironed out a withdrawal agreement.Under the accord, American and other foreign forces have pledged to quit Afghanistan by July 2021 provided the Taliban stick to several security guarantees and hold talks with the government. However, fighting spiked in March as the Afghan government and Taliban bickered over a number of issues, preventing negotiations between the two from opening.“To safeguard the lives of countless civilians in Afghanistan and to give the nation hope of a better future, it is imperative that violence is stopped with the establishment of a ceasefire and for peace negotiations to commence,” UNAMA chief Deborah Lyons said.The Taliban rejected the figures, claiming the report “conceals the daily crimes” committed by the government and US forces.UNAMA did, however, note that pro-government forces were responsible for more than twice as many child deaths than the insurgents were during the first quarter, mainly due to air strikes and shelling.Recent attacks have mostly been limited to rural areas and small towns. Under the framework of US-Taliban deal, the insurgents have agreed not to attack cities.The release of the UN report comes hours after the US special envoy who brokered a deal with the Taliban called for the militants to implement a humanitarian ceasefire while Afghanistan tries to tackle its worsening coronavirus crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-increased-in-afghanistan-after-us-taliban-deal-un/story-bFxfou5YB8WSqrjYJxMlHO.html
27-04-2020||World||UN report notes drop in number of Afghan civilians killed||A report by the U.N. mission in Afghanistan on Monday noted a drop in the number of civilians killed in violence in the first three months of this year, compared to the same time last year, but underscored the still heavy toll the conflict continues to inflict on the civilian population.The report said 533 people, including 152 children, died due to the fighting in the war-torn country in the first quarter of 2020, and hundreds more were wounded. That represented a 29% decrease, compared to the same period in 2019, and the lowest death toll figure for a first quarter of a year since 2012.The report came as the Kabul police said a sticky bomb attached to a vehicle detonated in the capital on Monday but caused no casualties.According to the report, the Taliban and other anti-government militant groups, such as the Islamic State group’s affiliate in Afghanistan, were responsible for the majority of the civilian casualties during the first three months – or 55%. The Taliban were responsible for as many as 39% of civilian casualties, the report said, an increase by 22% compared to the same period last year.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected the U.N. report as an attempt “to cover up daily crimes against civilians committed by U.S. and Afghan forces.”“Afghans are witnessing that most of the civilian casualties are due to indiscriminate bombings, rocket attacks on villages and towns as well as raids on civilian homes,” Mujahid said.The U.N. report said Afghan forces and their allies were responsible for 32% of all civilian casualties during the first quarter of 2020. The report also said that pro-government forces were responsible for more child casualties than the Taliban and other militants and over twice as many child deaths — mainly due to fatalities inflicted during airstrikes and indirect fire during ground operations against militants.Children and women continue to be disproportionately impacted by the violence, it said, adding that the U.N. mission documented that 152 children and 60 women died in violence from Jan. 1- March 31.The report also highlighted a disturbing increase in violence in March, when it was hoped that the Afghan government and the Taliban would start negotiations after a peace deal that was signed by the Taliban and the U.S. at the end of February.The U.N. mission in Afghanistan is especially concerned about the escalation in violence in March and increasing civilian casualties, the report said, an in particular, about the uptick in civilian casualties last month as a result of operations by Afghan forces, mainly ground engagements, indirect fire and airstrikes.The U.N. report came a day after Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan, called on the country’s feuding leaders to set their differences aside to combat the coronavirus pandemic and COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, and advance the stalled U.S. deal with the Taliban.Deborah Lyons, the U.N. chief’s special representative for Afghanistan, echoed that appeal, saying she called “on all parties to seize the opportunity” and “to focus collective efforts on fighting a common enemy, the COVID-19 pandemic.”“To safeguard the lives of countless civilians in Afghanistan and to give the nation hope of a better future, it is imperative that violence is stopped with the establishment of a cease-fire and for peace negotiations to commence,” she said.Afghanistan has reported 1,703 cases and 57 deaths from the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-report-notes-drop-in-number-of-afghan-civilians-killed/story-fj3f6mVXWiViQAvFVjaHVM.html
27-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Boris Johnson ‘refuses to risk second major outbreak’, urges patience over UK lockdown||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged his lockdown-weary nation to be patient Monday, arguing that easing social and economic restrictions too soon would create a second deadly spike of coronavirus infections.On his first day back at work in three weeks after a bout of COVID-19 that left him dangerously ill, Johnson said Britain had reached the moment of “maximum risk” in its outbreak.Speaking outside his 10 Downing St. office, Johnson said the country was reaching “the end of the first phase of this conflict” but warned that a quick end to a lockdown due to last at least until May 7 was not in sight.“I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the (health system),” said Johnson.The 55-year-old leader appeared thinner but better-rested than when he was last seen in public early this month.As of Sunday, Britain had recorded 20,732 deaths among people hospitalized with COVID-19, the fifth country in the world to surpass 20,000 deaths. Thousands more are thought to have died in nursing homes during the pandemic.Despite the death toll, Johnson’s government is under mounting pressure to set out a blueprint for easing the lockdown that has sharply curtailed business and daily life since March 23.More than 1.5 million Britons have applied for welfare benefits in the past month, and the government’s economic watchdog says the economy could shrink by 35% by June 1.In signs of lockdown fatigue, the volume of road traffic has begun to creep up, and businesses including construction sites and home-supply stores have begun to reopen after introducing social distancing measures.As other European countries begin to reopen businesses and schools, Johnson said he shared Britons’ impatience to get back to normality. But he said “we simply cannot spell out now how fast or slow or even when those changes will be made.”Johnson indicated that any loosening of the lockdown would happen in stages, as authorities “begin gradually to refine the economic and social restrictions and one by one to fire up the engines of this vast U.K. economy.”Johnson spent a week in St. Thomas’ Hospital in London earlier this month, including three nights in intensive care. When he was discharged on April 13, he thanked medical workers at the hospital for saving his life, saying his condition “could have gone either way.”During his absence, Johnson’s Conservative government has struggled to counter criticism over shortages of protective equipment for medical workers and a lack of testing for the virus. The government has promised to conduct 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April, but has yet to reach even 30,000 a day.Countering claims that the government has been secretive, Johnson promised decisions about ending the lockdown would be made “with the maximum possible transparency” and in consultation with businesses, regional authorities and opposition parties.___Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-boris-johnson-refuses-to-risk-second-major-outbreak-urges-patience-over-uk-lockdown/story-VgugbF4bAXz4ij7nd5euFM.html
27-04-2020||World||‘Kim Jong Un could very well be OK and reappear’: Experts debate on rumours||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s prolonged public absence has led to rumors of ill health and worries about how it could influence the future of what one analyst calls Northeast Asia’s “Achilles’ heel,” a reference to the North’s belligerence and unpredictable nature.But there’s a basic, unanswered question, debated by the media and government intelligence services alike: Are the rumors even true?The exact state of Kim’s health matters because it could determine the stability of the dynastic government in Pyongyang and the security of nuclear weapons that the nation has repeatedly threatened to use on its neighbors and the United States.It’s a problem that outside nations have faced for decades. Gathering intelligence on perhaps the world’s most secretive, suspicious and difficult-to-read country is incredibly difficult. And there’s probably nothing North Korea guards more closely than information on Kim’s health, which is only likely shared among a small portion of the elite, including his powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong.At the heart of the intelligence shortcomings about North Korea is its extremely closed nature. But there is also plenty of blame leveled in South Korea at efforts there.Supporters of South Korea’s current liberal government, which remains eager for inter-Korean engagement, lament the previous decade of conservative rule there, when exchanges between diplomats, government and business leaders, aid groups and others stopped under hard-line polices toward North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. This, they say, deprived spies of high-quality information sources.Conservatives, on the other hand, blame liberals for supposedly downsizing espionage operations while pursuing inter-Korean rapprochement. They say such networks have been difficult to rebuild.South Korea’s government has repeatedly played down unconfirmed media reports that Kim is in fragile health following heart surgery, saying it has detected no unusual activity in North Korea or any emergency preparation by its ruling Workers’ Party, military and Cabinet. Without specifying its information sources, South Korea’s presidential office said it believes Kim is handling state affairs normally at an unspecified site outside the capital, Pyongyang.However unfounded the fears may be, some experts say South Korea, as well as its regional neighbors and ally Washington, must begin preparing for high-level instability that could come if Kim is sidelined by health problems or even dies. That could include North Korean refugees flooding South Korea or China, or military hard-liners letting loose nuclear weapons.While those are worst-case scenarios, planning for them is crucial because nobody knows for sure what’s happening inside North Korea, said Nam Sung-wook, a North Korea expert at Seoul’s Korea University who termed the situation the “Achilles’ heel of international politics in Northeast Asia.”“Instead of just saying he’s fine ... our government should prepare for various chaotic scenarios,” said Nam, a former director of a think tank affiliated with South Korea’s main spy agency. “He could very well be OK and reappear in North Korean state media again, but considering his weight and worsening shape, the risks linked to his health will sharply increase as he gets older.” Kim is overweight, reportedly smokes heavily and has other health problems.Questions about Kim’s health have been raised since he missed the birthday celebration of his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, the country’s most important holiday.Kim, who is in his mid-30s, was last seen in public on April 11, when he presided over a meeting discussing coronavirus prevention and electing his sister as an alternate member of the political bureau of the ruling Workers’ Party. State media have since reported that he sent greetings to Syrian President Bashar Assad, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa..On Monday, the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said Kim sent a message of gratitude to workers building tourist facilities in the coastal town of Wonsan, which is where some speculate he is staying. No photos of him were published.South Korean intelligence combined with North Korean state media reports suggest that Kim could have suffered some sort of medical setback but likely not a life-threatening one, said Du Hyeogn Cha, a senior researcher at Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.But the root problem may be the shaky nature of South Korean intelligence.“Even after decades of work, South Korea has yet to build a reliable intelligence network to gather information on the North,” said Cha, an ex-intelligence secretary to former South Korean President Lee Myung-bak. “It’s clear our government has some level of information on the North, but not enough to make a confident statement about where he is and whether he’s fully healthy.”Finding out what’s happening with Kim is important because incapacity at the top could lead to a bogged-down decision-making process that could boost the hard-liners who emerged following the collapse of Kim’s second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in February last year. The Americans at that summit rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North’s nuclear capabilities.The National Intelligence Service, Seoul’s spy agency, has said it can’t confirm whether Kim had surgery. If Kim emerges alive and well in state media, supervising a weapons test or celebrating the construction of one of his many resort projects, he would join past North Korean officials who were incorrectly reported incapacitated by outside media.“Kim Il Sung shot dead” remains perhaps the most famous newspaper headline in South Korean history three decades after it caused both public panic and euphoria.The 1986 Chosun Ilbo story was initially backed by a South Korean military statement that North Korea had announced the demise of its founder over loudspeakers at the mine-strewn land border between the rival nations. But just hours after the newspaper was released, Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, appeared at Pyongyang’s airport to greet a visiting Mongolian delegation.Another big problem is that for decades South Korea never really had a strong grip on the location and health of North Korea’s top leadership, which continues to be kept tightly under wrap, according to Cheon Seong Whun, a presidential secretary during the South’s previous conservative government.“Anybody who says they know something for certain is just writing a novel,” Cheon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-could-very-well-be-ok-and-reappear-experts-debate-on-rumours/story-bX0qhrxukKivhfDu4H1x1L.html

Recent victims of the virus included doctors Jitendra Kumar Rathod, Manjeet Singh Riyat and Krishan Arora.The Boris Johnson government has set up an inquiry to probe initial data that Indian and other non-white people are disproportionately falling victim to the virus. So far, 492 people categorised as British Indian have died in England.Kallil, chair of National Health Service in Thurrock said: “We were very sad to hear of the passing of Dr Masson, he was a well respected and liked GP in Thurrock, with a significant contribution over the last 30 years in the borough caring for patients and providing support”.“Later he provided GP services in both Thurrock and Basildon. We extend our heartfelt thanks to Dr Masson for his commitment and passion and our condolences to his family for their loss.”Masson’s family said he came to the UK in 1973 after completing his medical training in India and working as a doctor in East Africa. He was recognised by patients, colleagues and peers as a dedicated, determined, positive individual who would always do his utmost to help in all endeavours.“Dr Masson was an honest, kind and generous man who was deeply respected by anyone who was privileged to cross paths with him. He was jovial, funny and kind, always wanting to make the best of any situation”, his family said in a statement.“Dr Masson was taken from us too soon and still had so much to give. He had practised medicine for over five decades and was a dedicated servant to the NHS for 47 years. He would have wanted to practice medicine for many more years to come”, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-deeply-respected-indian-origin-doctor-dies-due-to-coronavirus-in-uk/story-TV2cOg68FGhUdAo4cX9JbN.html
27-04-2020||World||China, Australia in diplomatic spat over call for international Covid probe||Chinese citizens could avoid Australian products and universities if Prime Minister Scott Morrison doesn’t stop calling for an international enquiry into the coronavirus origins, a top Chinese official has said in what is fast developing into a testy diplomatic exchange between the two countries.Australia has shot back against the threat, cautioning China against any threat of “economic coercion”.In the past week, Morrison had spoken to the leaders of the US, France and Germany to gather support for an international investigation into the Wuhan origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.Beijing didn’t take lightly to the move.Chinese ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye said in an interview to The Australian Financial Review on Sunday that the call for the probe was “dangerous”.“If the mood is going from bad to worse, people would think ‘why should we go to such a country that is not so friendly to China?’ The tourists may have second thoughts,” Cheng said, adding: “It is up to the people to decide. Maybe the ordinary people will say ‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?’”“The parents of the students would also think... whether this is the best place to send their kids,” he added. China is not only Australia’s largest export market for wine and beef, it is also the largest markets for energy exports, education and tourism – Bloomberg reports that Australia’s is the most China-reliant economy in the developed world.On Monday, Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne cautioned China against attempts at “economic coercion”.Payne said in a statement on Monday that Australia had made a “principled call” for an independent review of the Covid-19 outbreak which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late last year.“We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation,” Payne said in the statement.China had earlier called the move to ask for an independent inquest politically motivated.“Currently, with the pandemic still spreading across the world, the most pressing task is to put people’s life and health first and work together to defeat the virus,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang had said.“At such a critical juncture, it is highly irresponsible to resort to politically motivated suspicion and accusation. We advise the Australian side to put aside ideological bias and political games, focus on the welfare of the Australian people and global public health security, follow the international community’s collective will for cooperation, and contribute to the global cooperation in fighting the virus, instead of doing things to the contrary,” Geng had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-australia-in-diplomatic-spat-over-call-for-international-covid-probe/story-bf0CCxNJARMq2ruY2K5VdL.html
27-04-2020||World||Italy’s daily Covid-19 death toll lowest since mid-March||After being battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Italy on Monday recorded its lowest number of deaths in 24 hours since mid-March. The number of people who died due to the disease between Sunday and Monday is 260, the country’s health department said. Italy had the bad luck of being the first Western nation to be slammed by the outbreak, and its official total of 26,600 fatalities lags behind only the US in the global death toll. Its first homegrown case was recorded on February 21, at a time when the World Health Organisation (WHO) was still insisting the virus was “containable” and not nearly as infectious as the flu.The hardest-hit region in Europe’s hardest-hit country is Lombardy. Virologists and epidemiologists say what went wrong there will be studied for years, given how the outbreak overwhelmed a medical system considered one of Europe’s best. In neighbouring Veneto, the impact was significantly more controlled.Even after Italy registered its first homegrown case, doctors didn’t understand the unusual way Covid-19 could present itself, with some patients experiencing a rapid decline in their ability to breathe.Italy was forced to rely on home care in part because of its low ICU capacity: After years of budget cuts, Italy went into the emergency with 8.6 ICU beds per 1,00,000 people, below the average of 15.9 within the developed countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).Some 20,000 Italian medical personnel have been infected and 150 doctors have died.Two days after Italy registered its first case in the Lombardy province of Lodi, sparking a quarantine in 10 towns, another positive case was registered more than an hour’s drive away in Alzano in the province of Bergamo.By March 2, the Superior Institute of Health recommended Alzano and nearby Nembro be sealed off like the Lodi towns. But political authorities never implemented that recommendation, allowing the infection to spread for a second week until all of Lombardy was locked down March 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-s-daily-covid-19-death-toll-lowest-since-mid-march/story-LWIjKmrNvUOy4MEGDRlsBI.html
27-04-2020||World||Canada looking to gradually ease Covid-19 restrictions||Even as Canada recorded its 2,500th fatality due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the country could witness gradual easing of restrictions as some of its largest provinces now want more business to become operational as early as possible.While the number of confirmed cases in Canada has crossed 45,000 and was at 46,848 on Sunday evening, the tally for the number of deaths have climbed to 2,560.But those figures may be gradually peaking and two of the worst hit provinces, Ontario and Quebec, are now planning on releasing their plans for opening up more businesses. Other provinces like Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are also considering similar return-to -near-normalcy in some sectors. In Ontario, the country’s most populous province, the rate of growth of cases has slowed over the last fortnight. As it reported 437 new cases and 24 deaths, those figures represented the lowest numbers since April 13. Nearly 60 per cent of these cases are in the Greater Toronto Area or GTA.But any such measure will be taken in a graduated manner. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed the matter with premiers of provinces this weekend and they “acknowledged the importance of restarting the economy through a gradual and phased approach, based on the advice of public health experts,” according to a statement from the PMO. It also said that they “agreed that protecting the health and safety of all Canadians should remain the top priority while restarting the Canadian economy.”While talk has increased of resuming some economic activity which have been restricted during the crisis, the country is still grappling with measures required to make that effort viable without endangering the population. Among the measures announced is the setting up of a Covid-19 Immunity Task Force which will try and estimate “how widely the virus has spread in Canada and provide reliable estimates of potential immunity and vulnerabilities in Canadian populations.”Part of the process could be influenced by the experience of states south of the border, in the United States. As Trudeau said recently during a media briefing, “”As provinces look at their own situation and how we can move forward on beginning to reopen our economy, I know their decisions and our decisions will be informed by what is working, and what is perhaps not working as well, elsewhere the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-looking-to-gradually-easing-of-covid-19-restrictions/story-lGwZPc0xxVyPyo77c9VF4H.html

It was a first step as the government plans a gradual process of easing restrictions.“I never thought I would miss school but I really miss it,” Lucia Ibanez, 9, out for a walk with her mother told news agency Reuters. Ibanez said she had missed the streets and the park and “feeling the air on your face” during lockdown.Children have been allowed one hour of supervised outdoor activity per day between 9 am and 9 pm, staying within one kilometre of their home. Many children wearing protective masks were seen strolling the streets in Madrid.As per the relaxation allowed by the government, adults can accompany up to three children who will not be allowed to use playparks or share toys, and must adhere to social distancing guidelines, remaining at least two metres from other people.“It was totally necessary after 42 days,” said Carla Marquez, out with her daughter near Las Canteras beach in Gran Canaria. “It has been super emotional... We have to value the small things in life which apparently we didn’t before”.Spain’s health ministry, meanwhile, said that 288 more people had died after being diagnosed with Covid-19, the lowest daily rise in the death toll in the past month.That brought the total number of deaths to 23,190, while the overall number of cases rose to 2,07,634. Spain has registered the third highest number of Covid-19 deaths, after the United States and Italy.The government had declared a state of emergency on March 14 and shut down most public life and economic activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/feeling-air-on-my-face-children-in-covid-19-battered-spain-come-outside-after-6-weeks/story-VdJTA1EtSMv3my42Fva9LK.html
27-04-2020||World||Oklahoma guv asks Trump to declare Covid-19 ‘act of God’ to help oil producers||Oklahoma’s governor has called on U.S. President Donald Trump to declare the coronavirus pandemic an “act of God,” a step to help oil-producing states contend with a crude glut that caused futures prices to close below $0 last week for the first time. “Over-production of oil continues to threaten the economy,” Governor J. Kevin Stitt said in a letter to Trump that Stitt posted on Twitter late on Saturday. Declaring a “force majeure” or “act of God” would allow oil companies to halt operations without risking that land leases will be canceled for stopping production, Stitt said.Oklahoma’s energy regulator said on Wednesday that producers could close money-losing wells without losing their leases, the first victory for struggling U.S. oil companies seeking relief from states after the market crash. U.S. production reached a record-high of near 13 million barrels per day late last year, but the pandemic has cut global consumption by 20% to 30%, or up to 30 million bpd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oklahoma-guv-asks-trump-to-declare-covid-19-act-of-god-to-help-oil-producers/story-9KOmNoyFsrVghidtJPXcfJ.html
27-04-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson makes first public appearance after coronavirus absence||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday made his first public appearance since being hospitalised with coronavirus three weeks ago, saying Britain was beginning to “turn the tide” on the outbreak but rejecting growing calls to ease a nationwide lockdown.In a statement in Downing Street marking his return to work, looking thinner and with his trademark blond hair a little longer, Johnson apologised for being away “for much longer than I would have liked”.He thanked the British people for heeding a month of stay-at-home orders, which have helped stem the spread of COVID-19, although more than 20,000 people have already died from the virus.Their efforts had ensured the state-run National Health Service was not overwhelmed, “and that is how and why we are now beginning to turn the tide”, the 55-year-old said.Johnson pledged on March 19 that Britain could “turn the tide on coronavirus within 12 weeks” but only if people heeded advice to avoid social contact.But while acknowledging the concerns of many businesses and increasing numbers of MPs in his own Conservative party about the economic toll, Johnson warned that now was not the time to ease the lockdown.“I know it is tough and I want to get this economy moving as fast as I can,” the prime minister said.“But I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak, a huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS.”New normalJohnson became the most high-profile world leader to contract COVID-19 one month ago.He spent a week in hospital, including three nights in intensive care, later admitting in a video message after he was discharged that things “could have gone either way”.He returned to his Downing Street residence on Sunday night, after two weeks spent recovering at his countryside retreat of Chequers, and was due to chair the daily government coronavirus meeting on Monday.In his absence, the government has faced increasing criticism over its response to the pandemic, as the death toll in Britain climbed to among the highest in the world.Healthcare professionals still complain about a lack of protective masks and gowns, while a target to test 100,000 people a day by the end of April looks like a tough ask.Debate is also still raging about whether Britain introduced the lockdown too late, as a decision looms on whether and how the measures could be eased.People have been asked to stay at home where possible and non-essential businesses have been shut for more than a month. The rules are up for review on May 7.Some hardware stores are already beginning to reopen and several construction firms have announced a phased return to work.A senior Conservative MP, Graham Brady, on Sunday said the government must get the economy moving again, after dire predictions from the Bank of England last week of the worst recession in centuries.“If there is a question over whether something is necessary or not, I think we should err on the side of openness and trying to make sure that more people can get on with their lives and more people can get on with getting back to their jobs,” he told BBC radio.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been standing in for Johnson, said on Sunday however that social distancing measures would remain in place for some time.People would have to get used to the “new normal”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-makes-first-public-appearance-after-coronavirus-absence/story-9MXUEnF4NCccitiuLM4x2L.html
27-04-2020||World||Donald Trump’s disinfectant remark remaining in the news is bothering: White House doctor||US President Donald Trump’s remarks that disinfectants could potentially treat coronavirus patients remaining in the news after four days of them being made was “bothering”, a key member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus has said. “I think it bothers me that this is still in the news cycle, because I think we’re missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing, as American people, to continue to protect one another,” Dr Deborah Brix, member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, told CNN in an interview. Trump on Wednesday had suggested the possibility of studying injecting disinfectants into COVID-19 patients or bringing UV light “inside” their bodies to kill the deadly virus, drawing immediate flak from health experts while a leading disinfectant producer urged people not to listen to such dangerous speculation. Brix, a leading doctor specialising in HIV/AIDS immunology, said the dialogue should focus on asymptomatic cases and not on the president’s remarks. “We should be having that dialogue about this unique clotting that we’re seeing. We are the first country that really had young people to this degree. Italy and Europe is about eight years older than us, as a median age. “So, this is the first experience of this virus in an open society, where we really can understand what’s happening to every different age group. These are the things that we should be talking about and focusing on,” Brix said. “As a scientist and a public health official and a researcher, sometimes, I worry that we don’t get the information to the American people that they need, when we continue to bring up something that was from Thursday night,” she said. Responding to a question, Brix said Trump made it clear that physicians must study his idea. “I think I have made it clear that this was a musing. But I want us to move on to be able to get information to the American people that can help them protect each other and also help them understand how devastating this virus is to different age groups and different symptoms and different comorbidities,” she said. Dr Brix said that she is “always concerned” when asked about a potential surge in new cases and deaths after many states have started taking actions to open up their economy. “I’m always concerned. And that’s why we put out key, key gating criteria. And that gating criteria was not only looking at the epidemic. It was looking at the health care workers and making sure that the health care workers were protected. And it was also looking at capacity within the hospitals,” she said. Noting that over the last few weeks there is a better understand how much asymptomatic cases and asymptomatic spread may be out there, Dr Brix underscored the need for sentinel surveillance, monitoring proactively in long-term care facilities, in inner-city clinics that have multi-generational households, in prisons, among Native Americans, to really ensure to find the virus before people even get symptoms. “And that’s a key part of this also that, sometimes, I think is missing when we’re talking about diagnosis and contact tracing. We also have to diagnose the virus before it is evident in communities,” she said. The coronavirus, which originated in China’s Wuhan city, has claimed over 2,00,000 lives and infected nearly 3 million people in the world so far. There are nearly a million confirmed coronavirus cases with over 54,000 deaths in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-disinfectant-remark-remaining-in-the-news-is-bothering-white-house-doctor/story-DLxywru7XijgazX4NzAwLM.html
27-04-2020||World||Funding and access can avert starvation due to Covid-19 crisis, says UN food programme head||The head of the World Food Program says he has been on the phone with leaders of some of the world’s richest nations with a critical message: the coronavirus pandemic is not only affecting your economy but is impacting the economies of vulnerable and conflict-torn countries where millions of people will face starvation if you cut the U.N. agency’s funding for food.David Beasley said in an interview with The Associated Press he has also been telling leaders that maintaining supply chains is critical and there are many potential obstacles — export restrictions, closed borders and ports, farms not producing and roads closed.“If we have money and access we can avert famine and we can truly avert catastrophic humanitarian death from starvation,” Beasley said. “But if we lose our funding, or we lose supply chain, there’s going to be disaster.”Beasley warned the U.N. Security Council last week that as the world deals with the COVID-19 pandemic it is “on the brink of a hunger pandemic” that could lead to “multiple famines of biblical proportions” within a few months if immediate action isn’t taken.He said 821 million people go to bed hungry every night all over the world now, a further 135 million people are facing “crisis levels of hunger or worse,” and a new World Food Program analysis shows that as a result of COVID-19 an additional 130 million people “could be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020.”WFP is providing food to nearly 100 million people on any given day, including “about 30 million people who literally depend on us to stay alive,” Beasley said. And if those 30 million people can’t be reached, “our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three-month period” — and that doesn’t include increased starvation due to the new coronavirus.“In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries,” and in 10 of them there are already more than 1 million people per country on the verge of starvation. According to WFP, the 10 countries with the worst food crises in 2019 were Yemen, Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Syria, Sudan, Nigeria and Haiti.In the interview following up on the Security Council briefing, Beasley said support for WFP comes from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the European Union, Japan and other prosperous nations.“If their economies deteriorate substantially, that impacts our money, it impacts the local economies in the developing nations in a variety of different ways,” he said.He cited the examples of South Sudan, which has faced years of conflict and is 98 percent dependent on revenue from oil whose price has plummeted as a result of COVID-19 and where WFP feeds about 6 million people, Nigeria where 90 percent of the economy is oil, and Ethiopia which has been struggling to feed its poor and where 50 percent of the economy is from tourism that has vanished since the pandemic.Beasley stressed that “We can’t say it’s hunger vs. COVID.”“We’ve got to work this together and look at the whole picture, keep the supply chain going, and minimize the economic impact so that we can make certain that people don’t starve to death,” he said. “So it’s going to be a very delicate balancing act for leaders, and I think they’re learning.”The WFP executive director said he is asking donor nations to accelerate the $1.9 billion in funding they’ve already pledged in order to preposition food to protect against the effects of supply chain disruptions, commodity shortages, economic damage and lockdowns.WFP is also seeking a further $350 million to set up a network of bigger logistics hubs, distribution points and transport systems to minimize the risk of supply chain breakdowns, he said.“And if we can do that it will save us money, and it will save us time, and it truly will end up saving lives,” he said.But Beasley said he’s very concerned some of that money will disappear.“That’s why I’ve been on the phone Skyping, Zooming, literally hours and hours and hours per day, and I have gotten nothing but extremely positive response from the leaders of major donor countries,” he said.He said, however, that if leaders are told, for example, that their country will see a 25 percent reduction in revenue for the rest of the year, “you know that all bets are off at that point in time.”Beasley, a former governor of South Carolina who has recovered from COVID-19, has spent the past week in Washington speaking to senior figures in the Trump administration, WFP’s largest donor.Beasley said he has also been warning leaders that economic deterioration, lack of money and a breakdown in the supply chains will lead to “destabilization and chaos in many countries around the world, which will result in significant financial implications for all regions of the world.”Beasley said he’s also been stressing to leaders that they can’t take a short-term perspective.He said “it’s going to be worse” in Africa because in very fragile areas people’s immune systems “are already troubled,” and children have poor nutrition and aren’t getting lunches with schools closed.“What you see in Africa right now is nothing, nothing, compared to what you’re going to see, just like what you were looking at in the United States or the UK just six weeks ago,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/funding-and-access-can-avert-starvation-due-to-covid-19-crisis-says-un-food-programme-head/story-dCUXn9OOpGR3rPZmsMDkIK.html
27-04-2020||World||Avocados are in, pork bellies out in the era of Covid-19 pandemic eating||There is no trend, exactly, other than this: People want comfort. They also want to eat their way to stronger immune systems. They’re stress baking, but they’re also eating healthier than they would have at restaurants. Avocados are in. Pork belly out. Frozen pizzas and instant noodles are selling out.And these seemingly conflicting and converging buying patterns are upending agricultural markets, sending prices for avocados surging 60% from early March, while butter is tumbling because of the loss of restaurant demand.Any way you cut it, the coronavirus has “completely changed everything,” said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor and senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.“People are more concerned about putting food on the table than anything else,” he said. “That really changes the mindset of a consumer.”Some of these trends could be here to stay, experts say. Now that some people have gone back to packaged foods, they may be surprised to see the quality improvements for these products and keep buying them even in the post-quarantine world. Cooking more at home might also continue well after the lockdowns end.‘Health Halo’Avocados are one of the foods that have seen a surprising price surge in the last few weeks. When lockdown measures first went into effect, farmers in Mexico, the world’s top producer, started slowing harvest activities, anticipating a demand drop-off.But it turns out avocado toast and guacamole are proving to be stay-at-home favorites. Demand has been much higher than the growers were expecting, and that’s sent prices surging. A box of Hass avocados from the state of Michoacan, Mexico’s biggest producer, cost about 480 pesos ($19) on April 24, according to the government. That’s up about 60% from 300 in early March.Other produce items have been flying off grocery shelves. U.S. retail sales of citrus were a standout, gaining about 50% from year-earlier levels in March, according to data from researcher IRI.“There is a general health-halo over all fresh produce items,” said Roland Fumasi, analyst for RaboResearch, in Fresno California.It might be the vitamin C content in citrus that prompted the buying as consumers look to boost their immune systems. Orange juice, once a breakfast staple that had fallen out of favor because of its high sugar content, also got a boost. Futures traded in New York are up about 13% since the end of February.In Asia, consumers are turning to traditional remedies to safeguard themselves from the virus, according to Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. In Vietnam, people are eating more black garlic and Indonesians are stocking up on jamu, a traditional medicine made from natural ingredients.Comfort FoodsFor a lot of people, eating has become an escape from boredom and stress these days. Consumers are picking up items at the grocery store they had been shunning just a few months ago -- packaged foods in particular have been given new life.“Traditionally, food has a comforting role,” Tan of Mintel said.Nestle SA, the world’s largest food and beverage company, is seeing very strong demand for essential food and drink items, Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said earlier this month. The company makes DiGiorno frozen pizzas and Maggi instant noodles.Conagra Brands Inc., which includes Duncan Hines, Chef Boyardee and Birds Eye in its portfolio, is seeing a lift across all the categories, Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said late last month.“It moved in waves, but everything is moving,” he said.Snack consumption is also going up. That’s partly because people are stuck at home, but also because they’re spending more time doing activities that lend to munching, like binge-watching “Tiger King” on Netflix.The case of South Korea is instructive for other markets, according to researcher Euromonitor International Ltd. Snack sales at a popular convenience store in the country were up 9% from a year earlier in the first part of March.Restaurant LossesEven with the huge spike for grocery store buying, the blow from the closure of restaurants is just too big to overcome in some markets. That’s why there’s been things like milk dumping. Farmers are being forced to dispose of excess supplies because demand from cheese and butter makers has dried up.Price moves illuminate that pain. Butter futures in Chicago have tumbled to the lowest in a decade, and cheese has also crashed.Belgium’s storied pomme frite purveyors are another victim. The country is the world’s top shipper of frozen potato products, hawking fries, crisps and mash to more than 160 countries, said Romain Cools, secretary general of industry group Belgapom. The vast majority is exported and demand dried up as the food-service industry grinds to a halt. European processing-potato futures are down almost 90% this year, trading at an all-time low.Even if restaurants are still doing take-away orders, many have reduced their menu offerings while home cooks in general are not using as many ingredients as they might eat at a sit-down meal.But consumers will also be pleased to see that $20 goes a lot more at the grocery store than it does at a fine-dining or quick-serve restaurant, said Nicholas Fereday, a consumer goods senior analyst at RaboResearch in New York. And the revival of packaged foods might have some longer-term impacts on buying habits.“There’s a simplification going on,” Fereday said. Packaged foods are “certainly more available because there’s more output, and people will remember that. When there was nothing left to eat, these companies delivered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avocados-are-in-pork-bellies-out-in-the-era-of-covid-19-pandemic-eating/story-jLBATOzvhxQF7WwnSlyZHI.html

We’re going to be looking at an unemployment rate that approaches rates that we saw during the ‘Great Depression’ of the 1930s,” President Donald Trump’s adviser, Kevin Hassett, said at an ABC programme.A record 26.5 million Americans have filed for jobless benefits since mid-March, and retail sales, homebuilding and consumer confidence have all cratered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-54-000-covid-19-deaths-in-hardest-hit-us-number-of-cases-near-a-million/story-7yyz2FRmu0VfN6SMCVwE1L.html

He went on to blame the pandemic on the prevalence of lying, dishonesty and betrayals in society, lack of honour and people accumulating wealth through fraudulent means. Also Watch | ‘Pakistan planning to export COVID-19 patients to J&K’: DGP Dilbag SinghJameel had also condemned the media for what he said was disseminating lies. “The prime minister is here, anchors are sitting here... Do we consider how we are going to face the day of judgement due to our deceitfulness?” he asked.“The owner of a very big channel asked me for some advise; I told him to abolish all lies from his channel. The owner replied that the channel would be close but lies would not end... This is not just here, but media the world over is the same,” he said.He later apologised for that remarks, saying it was a slip of tongue.“Who has torn honour to pieces in my country? Who makes my country’s daughters dance? Who is asking them to wear skimpier clothes? Whom should I hold accountable for this sin?” he said.“I seek forgiveness from Allah that I could not make my community understand. When a Muslim’s daughter choose the path of indecency and the youth choose vulgarity… The biggest curse of God was on the people of Lut as they crossed all boundaries of indecency and were cursed five times,” he said. The Human Right Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has pulled up the cleric for his statement against women. “HRCP is appalled at Maulana Tariq Jamil’s recent statement inexplicably correlating women’s ‘modesty’ to the Covid19 pandemic. Such blatant objectification is unacceptable and, when aired on public television, only compounds the misogyny entrenched in society,” the commission tweeted.The country widely-read newspaper Dawn wrote in an editorial that statements like this are troubling, adding they are also aired, unchallenged, from a very high-profile platform.  Dawn said that it is a “shame” that the cleric was not corrected when he made these offensive comments. Cases of domestic abuse cases have soared during the coronavirus pandemic as women are forced to stay home for extended periods with their tormentors.Pakistan has reported 11,940 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), including 253 deaths across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-because-of-them-pakistani-cleric-blames-women-for-covid-19/story-pAGSvpSTNg9rZTc6JKSqHK.html
27-04-2020||World||Saudi Arabia ends death penalty for minors and floggings||Saudi Arabia’s King Salman has ordered an end to the death penalty for crimes committed by minors, according to a statement Sunday by a top official.The decision comes on the heels of another ordering judges to end the practice of flogging, replacing it with jail time, fines or community service and bringing one of the kingdom’s most controversial forms of public punishment to a close.King Salman’s son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is seen as the force behind the kingdom’s loosening of restrictions and its pivot away from ultraconservative interpretations of Islamic law known as Wahhabism, which many in the country still closely adhere to.The crown prince has sought to modernize the country, attract foreign investment and revamp Saudi Arabia’s reputation globally. He’s also overseen a parallel crackdown on liberals, women’s rights activists, writers, moderate clerics and reformers. The 2018 killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey by agents who worked for the crown prince drew sharp criticism internationally.The latest royal decree by King Salman could spare the death penalty for at least six men from the country’s minority Shiite community who allegedly committed crimes while under the age of 18, including Ali al-Nimr, who had participated in anti-government protests. Such activity carries terrorism-related charges in the kingdom for disturbing order and disobeying the ruler.In a document seen by The Associated Press, the royal decree orders prosecutors to review cases and drop punishments for those who’ve already served the maximum 10 years.However, the decree states that terrorism-related cases of minors will be tried differently. It was not immediately clear whether these cases would be bound by the 10-year prison limit.Last year, Saudi Arabia executed a young man convicted of crimes that took place when he was 16 years old. Amnesty International said Abdulkareem al-Hawaj was found guilty of offences related to his participation in protests in Shiite-populated areas of Saudi Arabia.Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have long called on the kingdom to abolish the use of the death penalty, particularly for crimes committed by minors.The president of the Saudi government’s Human Rights Commission, Awwad Alawwad, confirmed the latest decision in a statement Sunday, saying it helps the kingdom establish “a more modern penal code and demonstrates the kingdom’s commitment to following through on key reforms.”He said “more reforms will be coming,” and that the two decisions “reflect how Saudi Arabia is forging ahead in its realization of critical human rights reforms even amid the hardship imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.”The decree expands on a previous order by King Salman issued in late 2018, which set a maximum 10-year prison term for minors in certain cases, except for crimes punishable by death. Now the 10-year maximum applies to all crimes by minors, with the possible exception of terrorism-related crimes.“This step, if true, needs to nullify current death sentences of all children,” Ali al-Ahmed, a Saudi rights activist in Washington, said.Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court recently issued a directive to end flogging as a form of punishment sometime in April, according to another document seen by The Associated Press.The public spectacle of whipping a handcuffed prisoner for often non-violent crimes had drawn some comparisons to the types of punishment carried out by extremist groups like the Islamic State. Saudi authorities had argued it was a form of deterrence against potential criminals. Rights groups criticized the practice as inhumane.The Supreme Court document said the decision was in line with the kingdom’s reforms and developments in the realm of human rights as directed by King Salman and overseen by the crown prince.Five years ago, prominent Saudi blogger Raif Badawi was given 50 lashes before hundreds of spectators in the metropolitan city of Jiddah. It drew outrage and condemnation from around the world, including from many of Saudi Arabia’s Western allies. Badawi’s feet and hands were shackled during the flogging but his face was visible.Badawi is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence and was ordered to pay more than $266,000 in fines on charges related to his criticism of Saudi Arabia’s powerful clerics on the liberal blog he founded.While some crimes, such as murder, may carry fixed punishments under Saudi Arabia’s interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, many other offenses are considered “tazir,” meaning neither the crime nor the punishment is defined in Islam.Discretionary judgments for “tazir” crimes, such as flogging, have led to arbitrary rulings with contentious outcomes. Muslim countries generally do not practice public flogging.“This is a good step but we are still waiting to see if existing lashing sentences will be reversed and expunged,” al-Ahmed said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-ends-death-penalty-for-minors-and-floggings/story-pAjBbWIxUQ6CE13iL0qTjN.html

All businesses will have to follow rigorous workplace safety protocols.Conte said that the government has fixed the price of surgical masks at 50 euro cents each to prevent speculation and promised “massive support” measures for businesses and the tourism sector in order to reopen the economy during Phase Two.“If you love Italy, maintain your inter-personal safety distance to keep the new coronavirus pandemic at bay. We are about to embark on the phase of living with the virus. We must be aware that the curve of the contagion could go back up in some parts of the country,” he added.“The risk is there and we must take it on, methodically and rigorously. This is why during Phase Two, it will be even more important to maintain the inter-personal safety distance of at least one metre,” the Prime Minister further said.“If we do not respect the distance, the curve will go back up and it could go out of control. Our deaths will increase and at that point, the damage to our economy could become irreversible. Our objective is not to have more people on welfare but more people with jobs,” Conte said.According to Sputnik, Italy has recorded 260 coronavirus-related deaths over the past 24 hours, which is the lowest number of daily deaths registered since March 14, the country’s civil protection department said in a statement on Sunday. The death toll stood at 26,644.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-pm-announces-plan-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdown/story-L9qDctWxCe3UMez0asI8oL.html
27-04-2020||World||Amid coronavirus crisis, world’s biggest wheat supply from Russia dries up||For the first time in a decade, the world risks being cut off from Russian wheat at a time when some key buyers are rushing to import it.The top shipper last month limited sales through June to protect its own supply as the coronavirus crisis sparks food-security concerns around the world. Although the curbs were seen loose enough to ensure normal trade flows for this time of year, Russia has already burned through the entire quota. It will halt grain shipments to all but four former Soviet neighbors once the last cargo booked under the limits leaves the country.While the ban will only last until farmers start harvesting in July, some other nearby nations have also restricted grain exports, threatening to reroute global trade and fueling worries about food shortages and higher prices. Countries from Egypt to Turkey are trying to load up on imports while they still can, and Russian shippers have been feeding that demand.There has been “a flurry of activity” recently, said Andrey Sizov Jr., managing director at consultant SovEcon in Moscow. “Buyers want to stock up because they realize they may not have the chance to do it later.”The window has closed fast. In just a few weeks, shippers booked out all of the 7 million-ton quota set through June. As well as strong demand from importers, a weak ruble is keeping Russian grain attractive. Also, sales from government stockpiles -- another measure intended to safeguard domestic supplies -- have helped contain local prices and keep exports competitive.The Agriculture Ministry on Sunday didn’t specify when the last cargo booked under the quota could leave.One reason the limit was reached so quickly was because shippers rushed to get customs paperwork for future cargoes, according to Dmitry Rylko, director general at the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies. That means about 3 million tons could still be exported in the next two months, Reuters reported him as saying.Russia has a history of disrupting the wheat market through restrictions or taxes, but last imposed an outright ban in 2010 after drought destroyed crops. The move caused wheat futures to rally and some researchers saw it as as an indirect contributor to the Arab Spring uprisings.While there’s still ample global supplies, the memories of past food shortages have restarted the debate about food nationalism. Organizations such as the United Nations and European Union said the risk of social and political unrest is rising again as the pandemic spurs discontent, and urged against unjustified measures that could hurt food security and raise prices.Trade ShiftBanning Russian exports could benefit rival suppliers such as the EU and the U.S., said Amy Reynolds, a senior economist at the International Grains Council in London. Crops office FranceAgriMer this month raised its outlook for French wheat exports outside the bloc to a record for the season that ends in June.Egypt is one country that may purchase more from the EU. The top wheat buyer is taking an unusual step of importing a large amount of wheat during its own harvest to ensure it has enough to feed its population, many of whom live in poverty. The North African nation is heavily reliant on Black Sea grain, but has already boosted French purchases this season due to more competitive prices.The increased demand is drawing down European inventories at a time when dryness is threatening crops across the region. If conditions in the Black Sea deteriorate further, that could prompt buyers around the world to stock up on supplies even more in the coming weeks, SovEcon said.“The probability of that scenario is growing, given the current weather,” SovEcon’s Sizov said. “Among the major exporters, the U.S. has some of the biggest inventories, and that may help their sales.”Still, forecasting trade flows remains difficult due to the uncertainty over how the health crisis will play out. Plus, the collapse in the energy market will likely take its toll on the economies of wheat importers like Algeria and Nigeria, which derive large amounts of income from oil.“The demand profile is uncertain and clouded further by events in the crude oil sector, with some of the key buyers potentially affected by falling oil revenues,” the IGC’s Reynolds said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-coronavirus-crisis-world-s-biggest-wheat-supply-from-russia-dries-up/story-7DT8yYgkhdelSRVVosSZ3M.html
27-04-2020||World||Covid-19 Update: Spain lets children play, US states move at various speeds||Spain let children go outside and play Sunday for the first time in six weeks as European countries methodically worked to ease their lockdowns and reopen their economies, while governors in the United States moved at differing speeds, some more aggressive, others more cautious.Elsewhere around the world, China’s state-run media said that hospitals in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the disaster, no longer have any COVID-19 patients, after a crisis in which the city recorded nearly 3,900 deaths. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson planned to be back at his desk Monday at 10 Downing St. after a bout with the coronavirus that put him in intensive care.While governors in states like hard-hit New York and Michigan are keeping stay-at-home restrictions in place until at least mid-May, their counterparts in places such as Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska are allowing certain businesses to reopen. And churches in Montana began holding in-person services again Sunday.Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, said each state is different. Still, she told NBC, social-distancing recommendations would “be with us through the summer to really ensure that we protect one another as we move through these phases.”The official death toll from the virus topped 205,000 worldwide, with over 2.9 million reported infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, though the real figures are believed to be much higher, in part because of inadequate testing and differences in counting the dead.Italy, Britain, Spain and France accounted for more than 20,000 deaths each, the U.S. for about 55,000.Some encouraging signs were seen, as Italy recorded its lowest 24-hour number of deaths since mid-March, with 260, and New York state registered its fewest since late last month, with 367.Seven weeks into Italy’s strict lockdown, Premier Giuseppe Conte laid out a long-awaited timetable for getting back to normal, announcing that factories, construction sites and wholesale supply businesses can resume activity as soon as they put safety measures in place against the virus.Conte also said that starting May 4, parks and gardens will reopen, funerals will be allowed, athletes can resume training, and people will be able to visit relatives living in the same region. If all goes well, stores and museums will open May 18, and restaurants, cafes and salons on June 1, he said.But he warned that if people don’t wear masks and obey other social-distancing rules, “the curve of contagion can rise again, it will go out of control, deaths will climb and we’ll have irreparable damage” to the economy. After Italian bishops complained that these latest rules didn’t allow for public Masses, Conte’s office said a plan for such worship would be released.In Spain, where the crisis is also easing, the streets echoed again with children’s shrieks of joy and the clatter of bicycles after youngsters under 14 were allowed out of their homes with one parent for up to an hour of play.“This is wonderful! I can’t believe it has been six weeks,” Susana Sabaté, a mother of 3-year-old twin boys, said in Barcelona. “Today when they saw the front door and we gave them their scooters, they were thrilled.”Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will present a detailed plan Tuesday for the “de-escalation” of Spain’s lockdown but said it would be cautious. His French counterpart will as well on the same day.In the U.S., where President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed to reopen the country for business and a split has opened among the states along often partisan lines. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, told “Fox News Sunday” that with hospitalizations dropping in his state, he will reopen churches and restaurant dining on Friday, with social-distancing guidelines in place.“We believe it’s the time to have a measured reopening,” he said.But Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, told ABC that her state is not ready and needs more robust testing, community tracing and a plan for isolating people who get sick.“We’ve got to be nimble and we have to follow the science and be really smart about how we reengage,” she said, “because no one — no one, even if you’re a protester or you’re the sitting governor or you’re on another side of the issue — we know that no one wants a second wave.”In Montana, some churchgoers returned to Sunday services as a general stay-at-home order expired. At Christ the King Lutheran Church in Billings, every other pew was kept empty. Roughly 100 people streamed into St. Anthony Catholic Church in Laurel, where ushers tried to keep families separate from one another and hand sanitizer was available.“It’s like being given life again,” said church member Jack Auzqui. He said being unable to attend had been spiritually difficult for him and his wife.Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, in announcing the opening of several businesses last week, reiterated religious services were allowed as long as strict social-distancing protocols were followed. But leaders of various denominations said they would keep their buildings shuttered for now.In a sign that it could get harder to enforce restrictions as the weather improves, a lingering heat wave in California lured people to beaches, rivers and trails Sunday, prompting warnings that defiance of stay-at-home orders could reverse progress. Most recreation areas are shuttered, but officials worried that those still open could draw people who will ignore the rules.On the other side of the Atlantic, as Britain’s prime minister returns to work, he faces calls for more clarity on when his government will ease the lockdown, now set to run until at least May 7.Other European nations are further along in relaxing their restrictions. Germany allowed nonessential shops and other facilities to open last week, and Denmark has reopened schools for children up to fifth grade.In China, Wuhan said all major construction projects have resumed as authorities push to restart factory production and other economic activity after a 2 1/2-month lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-spain-lets-children-play-us-states-move-at-various-speeds/story-7THq2GNMTid1lNWxKKYXtK.html
27-04-2020||World||Kim Jong Un mystery grows on reports of train, medical team||Speculation about Kim Jong Un’s health intensified over the weekend after tantalizing -- yet unverified -- reports about a visit by a Chinese medical team and movements of the North Korean leader’s armored train.China sent a team including doctors and senior diplomats to advise its neighbor and longtime ally, Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, a train resembling one long used by North Korean rulers was parked last week near a coastal leadership compound in Wonsan, according to an analysis of satellite imagery released Sunday by the website 38 North. A prominent South Korea adviser also rejected the notion that Kim was ailing or dead.“Our government position is firm,” Moon Chung-in, a foreign policy adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told CNN. “He has been staying in the Wonsan area since April 13” with “no suspicious movements” detected.The latest developments shed little immediate light about the 36-year-old ruler, who U.S. officials said they were told had been in critical condition after cardiovascular surgery. Kim -- a heavy smoker who has gained considerable weight since taking power in 2011 -- hasn’t appeared in state media for two weeks, and missed April 15 birthday celebrations for his late grandfather, state founder Kim Il Sung, for the first time.The episode renews longstanding questions about the stability of a regime built on iron-fisted authority and a cult of personality for Kim, who has no known successor. Health scares have been a common occurrence over the years, and the leader’s medical condition is a closely-guarded subject in one of the world’s most secretive states.Any leadership change in North Korea could increase the threat of instability on China’s border and raise questions about control of the country’s expanding nuclear arsenal. Kim has also been central to U.S. President Donald Trump’s so far unsuccessful efforts to get him to reduce his weapons stockpile.The mystery sent journalists, diplomats and non-proliferation experts scouring satellite images, state news outlets and unverified social media feeds for clues about Kim. The hashtag #kimjongundead was the among the top subjects trending globally Saturday on Twitter. The name of his younger sister Kim Yo Jong -- a potential successor -- was also trending in the U.S.“Information about the serious state of health of our Marshal Kim Jong Un is false and malicious,” Korean Friendship Association head Alejandro Cao de ­Benos said in a tweet Saturday. Cao, who was featured in the 2015 documentary “The Propaganda Game,” didn’t say where he got the information and declined further comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.Kim similarly disappeared from state media for six weeks in 2014, prompting speculation that he had been sidelined by gout, an ankle injury or was even overthrown in a coup. He subsequently showed up walking with a cane during a visit to a new residential block.A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party’s International Liaison Department -- which manages relations with North Korea -- departed Beijing on Thursday, Reuters said, adding it wasn’t able to immediately determine what the trip signaled about Kim’s health. Officials with the U.S. National Security Council declined to comment on Saturday.Speculation about Kim’s condition accelerated after Seoul-based news site Daily NK, reported April 20 that the North Korean leader was recovering from surgery, citing one unidentified person inside the country. CNN reported a short time later that Kim was in “grave danger.”Trump has since said he believed the CNN report was “incorrect,” saying he heard “they used old documents.” South Korean officials said repeatedly last week that they believed Kim was conducting “normal activities” in a rural part of the country assisted by close aides, and that they detected no unusual movements by the regime.The presence of Kim’s train in Wonsan, about 230 kilometers (143 miles) east of Pyongyang, potentially fits with the South Korean account. The area has received intense interest from Kim in recent years, hosting an expanding leadership compound, a large tourism development project and numerous weapons tests.The train, which Kim took to his failed summit with Trump in Hanoi, arrived at a nearby railway station on or before April 21, 38 North wrote, citing satellite imagery. The train was spotted again at the station on April 23, and appeared to be repositioned for departure.North Korea’s eastern coast saw a burst of military activity on April 14, including cruise missile tests and fighter jet maneuvers, that at the time appeared to be timed to coincide with South Korean parliamentary elections. The next day, Kim was absent from events marking his grandfather’s birthday, known as the Day of the Sun and North Korea’s most politically significant holiday.Although state media has continued to publish messages exchanged between Kim and dignitaries, such as a letter sent to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday, reports included no fresh images and made no mention of new events attended by the leader. Kim was similarly missing from events Saturday marking the anniversary of the Korean People’s Revolutionary Army, although he also didn’t attend the events last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-mystery-grows-on-reports-of-train-medical-team/story-xb5P2KNSzDulho5FkarhTO.html
27-04-2020||World||Covid-19: UK PM Boris Johnson returns to work as business demands lockdown clarity||Boris Johnson returns to work for the first time in a fortnight with one key item at the top of his in-tray: when will he let Britain do so?The prime minister will chair the government’s Monday morning meeting to coordinate efforts to tackle the virus. He spent the last two weeks recuperating at Chequers, his grace-and-favor countryside house, after contracting Covid-19 himself and spending three nights in intensive care.With the nation recording its lowest daily death toll since March and lockdowns being partially lifted on the European continent, Johnson is facing increasing pressure to explain how his administration will move Britain onto the next phase.Businesses are “clamoring” for information, the Institute of Directors said. A survey of more than 1,000 business leaders showed fewer than one in four were optimistic for their prospects over the next 12 months.How and WhenSix business leaders, including Conservative Party billionaire donors Michael Spencer and Peter Hargreaves, have written to the government asking them to ease restrictions, according to the Sunday Times. Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer wrote to Johnson calling for an “exit strategy,” while his party’s senior spokeswoman Rachel Reeves told the BBC the public should be treated as adults.“We should really begin to offer a narrative of how and when it’s going to stop,” Spencer told the newspaper. Three unidentified Cabinet ministers told the paper they questioned how much more voters would stand.The Daily Telegraph reported Monday the premier could ease the lockdown as early as this week. Citing unidentified allies of the prime minister, the paper pointed to May 7 as a possible date. Johnson’s office rejected the report.On Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who’s been deputizing for Johnson while the premier was out of action, rejected the calls for an early easing of the lockdown, telling Sky News the outbreak was still at a “delicate and dangerous” stage. On Sunday, the U.K. reported 413 hospital deaths from the previous day, taking the tally to almost 21,000, the fifth highest in the world. More than 150,000 people have tested positive for the virus.In a series of television interviews on Sunday, Raab wouldn’t be drawn on how and when the U.K. would scale back restrictions. “Until we can be confident -- based on the scientific advice -- that we are making sure-footed steps going forward that protect life, but also preserve our way of life, frankly it is not responsible to start speculating,” he told Sky.Domestic ViolenceIt’s not just the economic impact that Johnson needs to weigh. The cross-party Home Affairs committee called for action against rising cases of domestic abuse, citing “higher levels of violence and coercive control.” Pressure group Counting Dead Women calculated that between March 23, when the lockdown began, and April 12, there were at least 16 domestic abuse killings of women and children, according to the report.In the daily televised news briefing on Sunday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said workers are taking advantage of the government’s furlough program -- where up to 80% of their salary is paid by the taxpayer -- will be asked to take second jobs in the agricultural sector to help farmers bring in the harvest, as migrant numbers are down.Meanwhile, second home owners in Wales could be ordered to leave their properties under measures being considered by the Welsh Government, the nation’s First Minister Mark Drakeford said. Doctors in rural areas, where there are fewer health resources, appealed for second home owners to stay in their primary residence.“If we are going to get to that position, we have got to do it and be confident that the law is secure under our feet,” Drakeford told BBC Wales on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-pm-boris-johnson-returns-to-work-as-business-demands-lockdown-clarity/story-fZrl7bSeQPasG1G0STzHXO.html
27-04-2020||World||As mystery over his health deepens, 5 things to know about Kim Jong Un||The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea since it was founded in 1948. Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who assumed power after his father Kim Jong Il passed away from a heart attack in 2011. It is said that Kim and his ancestors have Paektu bloodline, which is named after the highest peak on the Korean Peninsula-- Mount Paekdu--where Kim’s late father and former leader Kim Jong-il was born. It is also said that those with the Paektu bloodline and its direct descendents have the right to rule the country. Kim Jong Il was groomed for close to 20 years as North Korea’s prospective ruler, while Kim Jong Un had to suddenly take over the reins due to his father’s sudden death.Likely SuccessorKim’s sister Kim Yo-jong is widely seen as a likely successor if Kim dies before his eldest child is ready to take over. Some commentators familiar with the pecking order inside the Kim dynasty say that Kim Yo-jong, the youngest daughter of Kim Jong-il, has the strongest claim to the leadership position by virtue of her bloodline and also because of her experience in politics. She is an alternate member of the Politburo and vice director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK). ALSO WATCH | North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in critical condition? Watch China’s reaction She’s believed to be in her 30s and a few years younger than her 36-year-old brother. She has maintained a relatively low profile and was noticed last month when she hit out at South Korea, comparing the rival nation with a “frightened dog barking” after it lodged a protest against a military exercise conducted by the north. She is said to well-versed in the art of running the North Korean propaganda machinery. She was blacklisted by the US Treasury Department in 2017. HealthKim Jong Un has not been seen publicly in the last 15 days since he attended a major party meeting on April 11. Some reports suggest he underwent a cardiovascular surgery due to health issues triggered by heavy smoking and weight gain. There’s also a family history of cardiovascular problems which has made matters worse. This would not be Kim’s first ‘health-related’ disappearance. In 2014, he was unseen for over a month- 40 days to be exact-- before he re-emerged, walking with a limp and using a cane. It was said that he was tending to an ankle problem.Given the nature of their dynastic rule great secrecy is maintained around health issues of the first family. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, had also vanished for months in the year 2008 due to a heart stroke which was confirmed only later by a French doctor. The supreme leader died three years later. Early LifeHe is widely believed to have studied in the West during his school days. By most accounts he was a shy boy who loved basketball and spent several hours sketching Michael Jordan, who used to play for Chicago Bulls, said The Washington Post. He was also fond of computer games and liked to watch Jackie Chan action movies. There is also a wide agreement that Kim went to Kim Il-sung University as youth between 2002 and 2007. The university is a leading officer-training school in Pyongyang. Kim is said to have obtained two degrees, one in physics and another as an Army officer from the Kim Il-sung Military University. Political KillingsReports allege Kim’s role in purging several political leaders including his own uncle after he assumed power in 2011 for the purpose of consolidating it by eliminating all threats. Jang Song-thaek, Kim’s uncle was executed for alleged treachery. Kim was also widely blamed for the murder of his half-brother Kim Jong-nam in Malaysia in February 2017. However, it couldn’t be proved conclusively. Kim Jong Un’s uncle Jang Song-thaek was arrested in December 2013 and executed soon after by a firing squad. Kim is believed to have put to death all members of his uncle’s family, including the children and grandchildren of all close relatives. Jang’s sister Jang Kye-sun, her husband and ambassador to Cuba, Jon Yong-jin, and Jang’s nephew and ambassador to Malaysia, Jang Yong-chol, are all believed to have been executed on Kim’s orders. In another incident of political purge to safeguard power, deputy security minister O Sang-hon was allegedly eliminated using a flamethrower in 2014 for his role in supporting Kim Jong Un’s uncle Jang Song-taek Assasination Attempt2014 was a difficult year for Kim as news of an assassination attempt surfaced while he was busy consolidating power by purging his uncle’s loyalists. It was revealed that year that an assassination attempt had been made on the young leader in 2012, when a machine gun was discovered under a juniper tree in Ryugyeongwon, near a route that Kim was taking. Three years ago, in May 2017, Kim’s government accused the American spy agency, the CIA and the South Korean intelligence service, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to have hired a North Korean lumberjack to assassinate Kim. It was alleged that this was to be achieved using a “biochemical weapon” that was not only radioactive in nature but also was nano-poisonous. The effect of the poison would have only appeared a few months later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-mystery-over-his-health-deepens-5-things-to-know-about-kim-jong-un/story-rsI4wOeY6v7SdhBDsRXWoL.html
27-04-2020||World||With Kim Jong Un’s health uncertain, spotlight shifts to his sister Kim Yo Jong||Of all the family members who could eventually take the reins from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, his sister seems like the obvious choice.Kim Yo Jong, in her early 30s, has been by her brother’s side at summits with U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, sat behind Vice President Mike Pence while representing North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics and became the first immediate member of the ruling family to visit Seoul, where she delivered a personal message from her brother inviting South Korean President Moon Jae-in to a summit.The biggest potential hang-up: She’s a woman in a society rigidly controlled by men. While many North Korea watchers say bloodline is more important than gender, others are skeptical.ALSO WATCH | North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in critical condition? Watch China’s reaction “Yo Jong’s role will likely be limited to a regent at most” due to North Korea’s feudal patriarchy, said Yoo Ho-yeol, who teaches North Korean studies at Korea University and formerly advised South Korea’s unification ministry and defense ministry. “Not only the male-dominant leadership, but also ordinary people there would resist a female leader.”The question of whether Kim Yo Jong will become North Korea’s first woman leader has suddenly become front and center as questions about her brother’s health intensify. Kim Jong Un hasn’t appeared in state media in two weeks, prompting a flurry of reports suggesting he could be incapacitated.The Kim family dynasty has ruled North Korea for three generations since its founding after World War II, when the Soviet Union and the U.S. divided up control of the Korean Peninsula. Over that time, it has built up one of the world’s most vigorous personality cults -- making the preeminent claim to legitimacy in the dictatorship a bloodline said to stem from the sacred Mount Paektu near the Chinese border.When Kim Jong Un took power after his father’s death in 2011, the big question was whether a leader in his 20s could rule a country that revered seniority. He soon exerted authority over geriatric generals and eliminated potential rivals: He executed his uncle and one-time deputy, Jang Song Thaek, and was suspected to have ordered the assassination of his exiled older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, in Malaysia.In many ways, Kim Yo Jong -- who has spent nearly a decade enmeshed in the state apparatus -- has been better groomed to take over the top leadership role. She could also similarly surprise anyone who doubts her ability to run the country, according to Soo Kim, a Rand Corp. policy analyst who specializes in Korean Peninsula issues.‘Begins and Ends’“I don’t think she needs to worry about gaining acceptance as a leader by the North Korean people by virtue of her Kim family bloodline,” Soo Kim said. “North Korea’s fate begins and ends with the Kim family.”The other potential male Kim heirs are younger or less experienced in the halls of power in Pyongyang. His brother Kim Jong Chol has no official title and seems to be more interested in playing guitar than politics, while his nephew, Kim Han Sol, has denounced the regime and is believed to be living abroad.South Korean media reported that Kim Jong Un has a 10-year-old son, but none of his children have been officially mentioned in state media. Thae Yong Ho, the former No. 2 at North Korea’s embassy in London who defected to South Korea, said in a radio interview that one potential successor is Kim Pyong Il, the only surviving son of North Korea’s founder Kim Il Sung who returned to the country last year following four decades overseas serving as a diplomat.“Those who’re serving Kim Jong Un are the first generation in their 60s through 80s, so there’s at least a 30-year age gap with Yo Jong. In their eyes, Yo Jong is just a novice,” Thae said. The same argument was made when Kim Jong Un took power, though his youth didn’t block his ascent or his control over the old guard.Either way, Kim Yo Jong remains the most prominent heir. Born in either 1988 or 1989, she was once a chubby-cheeked girl who loved dancing and was nicknamed “Princess Yo Jong” by her father, the late dictator Kim Jong Il, according to a biography of Kim Jong Un titled “The Great Successor” by Anna Fifield. She joined her brother at a school in Bern, Switzerland until about 2000 and later came back to study in North Korea.Rising ProfileHer appearance by her brother’s side at the time of their father’s death let the North Korean public know she was a part of the Paektu bloodline. She soon had a position in the Workers’ Party Propaganda and Agitation Department, according to South Korea, where she was responsible for managing the image of the leader in state media -- a post similar to one held by her father when he was being groomed for succession.She steadily rose through the ranks and became a closer confidante to her brother, accompanying him on inspection tours of factories, farms and military units. Then her high-profile appearances on the international stage, which included mundane tasks like helping the leader extinguish a cigarette during a train stop in China, helped cement her status.Kim Raises Sister’s Profile With North Korean Politburo Post“When Kim Yo Jong has risen as high as she already has, she is no longer considered a woman but a leader who inherited greater legitimacy to rule than others,” said Chun Yungwoo, South Korea’s former envoy to international nuclear talks with North Korea. “North Korea certainly is one of the most male chauvinistic societies in the world, but bloodline supplemented by status in the Korea Workers’ Party supercedes gender.”Kim Yo Jong’s clout was on display last month when she personally responded to a letter from Trump offering assistance to fight Covid-19. In a statement carried by state-run Korean Central News Agency, she said Trump’s “close relations” with her brother weren’t enough to settle differences between the longstanding enemies -- providing a glimpse into how she would handle U.S.-North Korea ties if she does take power.‘More Powerful’“We try to hope for the day when the relations between the two countries would be as good as the ones between the two top leaders, but it has to be left to time and be watched whether it can actually happen,” she said. “However, we will never lose or waste time for nothing, but will keep changing ourselves to be more powerful for that time just as how we made ourselves for the past two years.”Kim Hong-gul, the youngest son of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and a lawmaker-elect, said Kim Yo Jong looked firmly in control when a delegation from Seoul visited Pyongyang as part of a summit between the leaders of the countries in 2018.“I saw from a distance, at the airport upon our arrival and the banquet in Pyongyang, Yo Jong meticulously taking care of everything near her brother,” Kim Hong-gul said. “It looked like she was the top supervisor on the site.”On paper, there’s nothing stopping a woman from taking power in North Korea, even though its rubber-stamp parliament shows the vast majority of its members are older men -- one of the least gender diverse in the world. The constitution says “women are accorded an equal social status and rights with men.”Still, some analysts don’t think Kim Yo Jong could hold sway over the country’s generals who command the nuclear weapons program, which for many in Pyongyang represents the main guarantor of protection against a U.S. war for regime change. Ra Jong-yil, former deputy director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, said it was more likely the country is run by a military junta than Kim Yo Jong.Playing the Game“It is almost unthinkable to have a female leader in North Korea” in part due to its “unique patriarchy based on the Confucianism,” said Lee Byong-chul, a former South Korea presidential adviser on national security issues who is now a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. He questioned whether she could control the “old male generals” without her brother’s influence, and saw it more likely that either her uncle Kim Pyong Il or nominal head of state Choe Ryong Hae takes over.Still, North Korea’s “cult-driven system” makes it essential to have a family member in charge, and Kim Jo Yong “has shown that she knows how to exercise authority,” according to Sung-Yoon Lee​, who teaches Korean Studies at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts.“The generals with the big guns have every interest in protecting their own power and they understand that power runs through the Kim family,” he said. “She will be able to wield power through a mix of terror and promotions. She knows how to play the game.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-a-woman-run-north-korea-kim-jong-un-s-sister-outshines-male-rivals/story-wBRP1dQpI1MvO8f8CAipvI.html

27-04-2020||India||Covid-19: India moving towards financial emergency, states rendered helpless by govt, claim Opposition leaders||Finance ministers of Opposition- ruled states on Monday said they fear country is moving towards a financial emergency and no concrete measures are being taken by the Centre to address the mounting woes of the states as they remain helpless amid the coronavirus pandemic.The ministers were addressing a webinar hosted by Gulati institute for Finance and Taxation (GIFT) in Thiruvananthapuram. The opposition leaders said they want the Centre to take immediate loan from the Reserve Bank and transfer the money directly to the states. Instead of this the Centre is waiting situation to be worsened and if people suspect a financial emergency they can’t be blamed, they said. All states, the ministers said, should come together and fight what they called ‘unilateral decisions of the union government.’ Despite emergency situation, the union finance minister is yet to call a meeting of state finance ministers even as the states face a major fiscal crisis as all sources of revenue shrunk like never before, they said. The meeting was called by Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Issac in the backdrop of states plagued by fiscal constraints in dealing with the pandemic and many of them were forced to cut salaries of its employees.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, former finance minister of Jammu and Kashmir Haseeb Drabu, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI secretary D Raja and writer and economist Sanjay Baru attended the webinar. Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was among those listed as speakers but he was not seen in attendance.“Delhi is in dire straits. If the situation continued like this even the health sector will also be affected. Being a consumerist state we are suffering heavily due to loss of economic activities. We need immediate help,” said Manish Sisodia. Punjab Finance Minister Badal said Rs 1000 crore was due in Goods and Services Tax (GSST) to the state and the Centre was not even ready to part with this amount.“There is an undeclared emergency in the country. The country is going through a difficult situation and the economy is in doldrums. We don’t want mere slogans now. The centre is yet to come up with a concrete plan to revive the economy,” said Jairam Ramesh.The Kerala Finance Minister said that even during the pandemic there is no end to discrimination. The Centre had recently said corporate donations to PM-CARES come under the CSR but such donations to the CM relief fund do not come under the category. “We have been asking for the state FMs’ meeting for quite some time. But it is yet to take place. We have been hearing only monologues. We don’t need mere self praise or kudos. We need proper share and money to tide over the crisis,” said Issac adding the initiative to bring together opposition ruled states will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-moving-towards-financial-emergency-states-rendered-helpless-by-govt-claim-opposition-leaders/story-1kSHCiVoWTTDJkARWz14EK.html
27-04-2020||India||Jamia alumni chief held under UAPA||New Delhi: The Delhi police on Sunday arrested Alumni Association of Jamia Millia Islamia president Shifa-Ur-Rehman under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for his alleged role in inciting the communal riots in Northeast Delhi in February. Rehman, who faces up to seven years in prison if convicted, was produced before a court which sent him in 10-day police custody for further interrogation. A police officer, who did not wish to be named, said they have technical evidence against Rehman which suggests that he allegedly incited mobs during the riots. “We have his CCTV footages and we have also checked his call record details and WhatsApp messages which suggest his involvement in hatching conspiracy to instigate riots in northeast Delhi.”No senior police officer authorised to speak to the press wished to comment on the arrest. The Alumni Association of Jamia Millia Islamia did not respond to the arrest either. The communal violence had broken out on February 24 and 25 after clashes started between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) supporters and its opponents. It later degenerated into the riots that left at least 50 dead.HT has learnt that police have arrested at least 1,100 people in 760 cases of rioting, murder and violence. Of these, police claim that around 70% cases have been solved. Last Wednesday, the police booked suspended Aam Aadmi Party councillor Tahir Hussain under the UAPA. Hussain is in jail in connection with communal violence and murder of an Intelligence Bureau staffer.The police have also arrested Jamia Millia Islamia students Meeran Haider and Safoora Zagar under the UAPA. They are accused of allegedly conspiring to incite the communal riots. A 20-member group of scholars, filmmakers, advocates and writers protested against the witch-hunt of anti-CAA activists and released a statement saying that instead of engaging with protesters, the state has chosen to detain and arrest them under harsh penal provisions. They said while the crime branch is already probing the riots, the Delhi police’s special cell has filed a separate first information report (FIR) under which the scholars were being arrested. “This FIR has enabled the stitching together of a political narrative where a direct link is sought to be made between anti-CAA protests and the widespread violence that rocked Northeast Delhi in the end of February,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jamia-alumni-chief-held-under-uapa/story-546yQNkokyjexNTePJkOVI.html
27-04-2020||India||NBWL allows coal mine in part of Assam’s elephant reserve||New Delhi: The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has recommended that part of 98.59 ha (hectares) reserve forest land that is a part of Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve be used for opencast coal mining by North-Eastern Coal Field of Coal India Limited according to minutes of the 57th Meeting of the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife held on April 17 through video-conferencing. The rest of the area may be considered for underground coal mining, the body said. The proposal of locating the coal mine inside the reserve was considered during the 54th meeting of the board on July 18 last year when it was decided that a committee comprising noted elephant expert and member of NBWL, Professor R Sukumar, a representative of the wildlife division and the state chief wildlife warden of Assam would visit the site and submit a report to the ministry. The environment ministry was to also arrange a meeting with officials of Coal India Limited.R Sukumar submitted to NBWL that 57.02 ha of forest land has already been used for mining by Coal India Limited and that in the balance 41.39 ha of unbroken area a cautious approach needs to be adopted owing to the rich biodiversity according to the minutes. The NBWL meeting was chaired by environment minister, Prakash Javadekar.The so called unbroken area is on a steep hill slope that is part of the Dehing Patkai Elephant reserve adjoining forests in Arunachal Pradesh which includes Deomali Elephant Reserve with a sizeable population of elephants. The say the proposal for already “broken up area is recommended for approval” subject to submission of a rectified site specific mine reclamation plan in consultation with the Assam Forest Department and that for the unbroken area, the matter will be considered after Coal India Limited submits a feasibility report for underground mining.“Coal India had broken up 57.2 ha years ago and mined it without any permission, in violation of laws. They have been directed to (pay) penalty for this and submit a mine reclamation plan. The plan they have submitted includes trees from central India which is not even the native biodiversity of Assam. So they have been asked to come back again with a proper plan,” said Sukumar, ecologist at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). “The rest of the area bordering Arunachal Pradesh, it cannot be broken up. The standing committee has told them (CIL) that forests there cannot be opened up,” he added over phone from Bangalore.A CIL spokesperson said he was not aware of the NBWL decision and needs time to get details on it.“Elephant herds have strong fidelity to their range. They move around the same area for many years. Obviously such projects will affect their movement and demographics. I am not very aware of the landscape in this reserve but conflict is bound to increase if there are human dominated areas in the neighbourhood,” said M Ananda Kumar, elephant biologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nbwl-allows-coal-mine-in-part-of-assam-s-elephant-reserve/story-nftehXmWLCWGC4tZkcBmuJ.html
27-04-2020||India||2 brothers die in MP as doctor fails to refer them to Covid hospital||Two brothers in Raisen district died of coronavirus in a span of 48 hours in a hospital in neighbouring Bhopal while four others in the family have been hospitalised after it emerged that the doctor treating them did not refer them to a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, officials said.The developments also forced Raisen’s superintendent of police to send 57 police personnel who dealt with one of the deceased to quarantine centres and ask their family members to self-isolate.District collector Umashankar Bhargava on Monday issued a show cause notice to a doctor posted as medical officer in the district hospital holding him responsible for the deaths, and terming his act as tantamount to a serious crime under Madhya Pradesh Civil Service Conduct Rules, 1965.According to the show cause notice, the doctor treated the elder brother, a trader who ran a tiffin service, in his private hospital since April 17 but didn’t advise him to go to a dedicated Covid hospital. He did not inform the administration and his seniors either in health department.Those hospitalised from the affected family include parents of the deceased, their younger brother and the eldest brother’s wife.The eldest brother who was 45 years old died on Friday in Hamidia hospital in Bhopal. As he was a suspected case of Covid-19 the district administration did not allow the body to be carried to Raisen. After due procedure by the health department, the body was handed over to his wife who cremated it alone with the assistance of her friend. Later, she was hospitalised.The test of his sample which came after his death suggested that he was suffering from Covid-19. Later, his younger brother who was 40-year-old and ran a coaching centre at Raisen too died in the same hospital on Sunday. He was cremated by their youngest brother in Bhopal, who was later hospitalised with symptoms of Covid-19.The parents of the deceased have been hospitalised in Raisen district hospital, district collector Bhargava said.“The eldest among brothers had symptoms like fever, cough and respiratory problem on April 12 itself. He went to the private hospital of Dr Deepak Gupta who is posted as a government doctor in the district hospital at Raisen, on April 17. Neither he advised the patient to go to a dedicated Covid hospital nor did he inform the administration. On April 20, the patient went to the district hospital from where he returned home. Again when he came to the district hospital on April 22 his condition was serious. He was referred to Hamidia hospital in Bhopal where he died on April 24,” the DC said.“His younger brother was referred to the Bhopal hospital on April 24 where he died on April 26.”The collector’s notice to Dr Deepak Gupta said, “Despite seeing the Coronavirus symptoms and being a government doctor you treated the patient (eldest brother) in your private hospital which resulted in death of two persons. Hence, your act being tantamount to a serious crime under MP Civil Service Conduct Rules, 1965 is a punishable act. You are expected to give reply to the notice within 48 hours otherwise one-sided action will be taken against you. Since you are under home quarantine this notice is being served to you through WhatsApp and you are expected to reply through WhatsApp only.”Superintendent of police, Raisen district Monika Shukla said, “Fifty seven police personnel who took food packets from the tiffin centres have been quarantined and their family members asked to self-isolate. The samples of the police personnel are being collected to send it for tests.”She said, “The deceased who ran the tiffin centre should have told us about his condition when he developed the symptoms. But he didn’t. In a way his act of concealing his disease and continuing his business of tiffin centre was a criminal act. But since he is no more we can’t lodge an FIR against him.”Dr Gupta claimed he was being made a scapegoat.“I examined him on April 17 in good faith. He had only fever and no symptom of Coronavirus. I advised him to go to district hospital if he has any problem. Had he had any symptom of coronavirus why I would have exposed myself to the threat of contracting the virus. I have my family and children too. He went to the district hospital twice on April 20 and 22. On both occasions two different doctors examined him but they too didn’t find any symptom of coronavirus in him. Even in Hamidia hospital where he was referred the doctors didn’t see any symptom in him. But unfortunately I am being made a scapegoat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-brothers-die-in-mp-as-doctor-fails-to-refer-them-to-covid-hospital/story-9rE4rvFzxlSBlgGbq6LYwJ.html

The deceased, identified as Sudeep Kariyanna, is said to be a native of Honnavara, Uttara Kannada district but was studying at the zoology department of Karnatak University, Dharwad and staying in a rented accommodation in Hoysala Nagar.A station house officer of Sub Urban Police station in Dharwad said that the incident was reported to them on Monday afternoon by the landlord of the house which Sudeep had rented after foul smell was emanating from it. An empty bottle of sanitizer as well as a bottle of cough syrup was found next to his body and the landlord in his complaint to the police said that the student had been complaining of lack of availability of liquor due to the lockdown.Sudeep’s body has been shifted to the Dharwad district government hospital for post-mortem. “Prima facie it looks like a case where the deceased has consumed a mixture of sanitizer and cough syrup as a substitute for liquor. We have registered a case and are investigating,” said the SHO who did not want to be named as she is not authorized to speak to media.It maybe recalled that about 10 days back in Gambayarpur village of the same district, two people died and 13 others fell ill after consuming sanitizer for its alleged ‘alcohol content.’ Cops and health officials have repeatedly appealed to people not to consumer sanitizers or syrups. Desperate tipplers have taken to consuming all kinds of substances and there have been numerous reports of break-ins and thefts at liquor stores across the state ever since lockdown was announced on March 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unable-to-get-liquor-man-drinks-mixture-of-sanitizer-and-cough-syrup-dies/story-7Dm07kg6bRRWPKmAS7BWOM.html
27-04-2020||India||Goa seeks lockdown extension, but wants economic activity resumed||The Goa government has recommended to the Prime Minister that the lockdown should continue beyond May 3 even though economic activity within the state should be allowed to continue. Amid demands that since Goa is a green zone, economic activity within the state can resume, Sawant said that there will be no further relaxations until May 3, but depending on the central government’s advice, a decision regarding opening up other sectors like public transport will be taken after that. “We have sent our written representation. We are of the opinion that the lockdown should be extended, but economic activity within the state, should continue. This is especially important since our neighbouring states of Maharashtra and Karnataka are witnessing a rise in figures it is important that the lockdown continues,” Sawant said. After the Ministry of Home Affairs allowed some more relaxations, shops including non essential shops located outside municipal markets have opened in the state marking a significant resumption of economic activity in the state. However, the hospitality, tourism sectors as well as public transport continued to remain shut making the full resumption some distance away. “Depending on the central government guidelines that come for the lockdown 3.0 to be effective after May 3, we will decide on opening up sectors,” Sawant said. Sawant also said that the people of the state will have to get used to practising social distancing for the better part of the next 12 months and possibly even more. “People should get used to social distancing for the next one or two years,” Sawant said. Sawant has however said that the state government has been talking to their counterparts from other states concerning the facilitating of transport arrangements for those migrant labourers who wish to return to their villages. Those locals who have been stranded in other places too will be allowed to return if they can make their own transport arrangements, Sawant said. “We are talking to officials from other states” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-seeks-lockdown-extension-but-wants-economic-activity-resumed/story-DbKBpFCQfw6VAFzT6zn6IM.html
27-04-2020||India||Odisha faces quarantine crunch as 5 lakh workers register to return home||Over five lakh migrant workers stranded in different states have registered themselves since Friday on an online portal started by Odisha government to facilitate their return after the lockdown to check the spread of the Covdi-19 pandemic is lifted, officials said Monday.“The portal which was running since Friday, saw 5.5 lakh people registering their names and other particulars,” said Odisha’s government’s chief spokesperson on Covid-19, Subroto Bagchi.Officials fear that the massive registration could overwhelm the preparations made by the State government for the workers’ return.“We have no idea as to what would be the final number of registration on the Covid portal. If all the 5.5 lakh turn up within one week of the opening of lockdown on May 3, it would be impossible to house all of them at one go,” said an official in charge of overseeing the quarantine set-up. OIdisha has reported a total of 111 cases of Covid-19 so far. On Saturday, the Odisha government had said it has managed to create 2.2 lakh quarantine beds in 7,120 temporary medical centres in about 7,000 gram panchayats and 120 urban local bodies to house the migrant workers for 14-day quarantine. Though the government earlier had made the provision for home quarantine of 14 days for anyone returning from outside Odisha, it shelved the idea as a number of people in home quarantine slipped out and spread infection.Already 86,000 workers, including 16,000 from within Odisha, are being accommodated in 2,610 quarantine camps in various districts of the state.Political leaders from districts like Bolangir and Kalahandi expressed their apprehension over the influx of the migrant workers. Sangeeta Singh Deo, BJP MP from Bolangir said many sarpanchs are worried over whether quarantine and social distancing protocols can be managed at the temporary centres with the return of migrant labourers.Kalahandi MP Basanta Panda, said the panchayats are ill-equipped for such large scale return and the government should address their concerns before allowing migrants to return.With lakhs of its migrant workers getting restive to return home, the government on Sunday had said that it would arrange buses to Gujarat and Maharashtra to bring back stranded migrant workers after the lockdown ends on May 3. In a video conference with his Gujarat and Maharashtra counterparts, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said a coordination committee comprising two officers each from all the three states will decide on the modalities of bringing back the stranded workers by buses or any other modes of transport available.But on Monday, around 200 migrant labourers from Odisha stranded in Surat boarded four buses to return home. The migrant labourers said they have got approval from Surat district collector Dhavalkumar Patel. Ganjam district collector Vijay Amruta Kulange said the migrant labourers returning from Surat will be kept in the government quarantine facilities for 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-faces-quarantine-crunch-as-5-lakh-workers-register-to-return-home/story-faNpZr80AQJig1mLoYCbHO.html
27-04-2020||India||Telangana may soon be Covid-19 free hopes KCR, says lockdown to continue till May 7||Emphasising that Telangana was heading towards becoming a coronavirus-free state gradually, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday said the lockdown would continue strictly till May 7, as announced earlier, without any scope for complacency.KCR, who attended the video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday morning but did not get an opportunity to speak, shared the details of the video conference with his senior officials at a meeting later in the evening.He said Telangana was gradually coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic and there were clear indications that the state would become coronavirus-free very soon.On Monday, only two positive cases – both from Hyderabad – were reported in the state and as many as 21 out of 33 districts in the state are going to be declared Covid-19 free by April 28. “More than 97 per cent of the patients admitted in hospitals are on the path of recovery,” the chief minister said.Stating that Telangana was able to prevent the spread of the virus by strictly enforcing lockdown restrictions, KCR said many containment areas were reporting zero positive cases. “By next week, I am sure the entire state will report zero positive cases. Even if one or two cases surface here and there, they could be tackled very easily,” he said.He, however, said the government would not remain complacent just because the numbers of positive cases were coming down. “We are always alert about any unforeseen situation that would result in an increase in the number of cases. The department of health is always alert with all the necessary equipment,” he said.“We shall bring down the number of containment zones as the number of positive cases comes down. But the officials and the people will be alert in the containment areas,” he said and appealed to the people to follow rules and cooperate with the government by staying indoors, except in emergency situations.On the other hand, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, who too could not get a chance to speak at the PM’s video conference, said his government had put forth certain proposals post-lockdown on May 3.He said while introduction of public transport might take more time, allowing private transport could be looked into. He wanted that the inconvenience to the people should be mitigated, though the state would have to bear the brunt of financial loss in the coming days.He said the state has 676 mandals (revenue blocks) of which 63 are in red zones and 54 in orange zones and the remaining are in the green zone, which account for 80% of the total mandals. While safeguarding the green zones the government will have to see that orange and red zones change into the green. Hopefully activity may pick up in the green zones soon, Jagan said.He asked the people not to attach any stigma to coronavirus positive patients as it could affect anybody in the state including him in the days to come.“The coronavirus is not going to disappear from the country. It is going to stay here for a long time and we have to live with it. It can affect anybody. Even I may get coronavirus. So, we should not subject coronavirus patients to social discrimination as it comes and goes after running its course. We have to learn to live with it in the days to come,” Jagan said in a message to the people through electronic media.He said the people would have to make some lifestyle changes to boost their immunity levels, maintain social distancing and take care of the old and sick. “Coronavirus will come and go and we need not attach any stigma to it as anyone is vulnerable to the disease and we should take precautions as per guidelines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-may-soon-be-covid-19-free-hopes-kcr-says-lockdown-to-continue-till-may-7/story-jCMdu6wG54dvLDrA9Gif7O.html
27-04-2020||India||Yogi holds Covid-19 review meeting, discusses quarantine centres||Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister Yogi Adityanath held a review meeting of the state’s Covid-19 management team on Monday and ordered officials to ensure that adequate arrangements for food and drinking water etc. were made at all quarantine centres and shelter homes in the state.Earlier on Monday morning, Yogi attended Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference with all the CMs to review the lockdown situation in the country. “The CM didn’t make any demand at PM’s Modi’s video-conference meeting with all the CMs,” said RK Tiwari, chief secretary. “UP’s turn to air its views also didn’t come on Monday’s meet,” said Awnish Awasthi, additional chief secretary, home.Adityanath’s order about the availability of food and drinking water assumes significance after reports appeared about inadequate facilities at some of the quarantine centres and shelter homes in the state. The CM said each quarantine centre and shelter home should have a capacity between 15,000 and 25,000 litres of water.He said the capacity of dedicated Covid-19 hospitals should be expanded in all the districts. He also ordered that all migrant workers from UP, who are slated to return to the state soon, should be mandatorily quarantined for 14 days at these centres and shelter homes.He appealed that lockdown should be strictly enforced and those living in hot spots should not venture out under any circumstances. Only healthcare personnel, sanitation workers and home delivery of essential items would be allowed in the hotspots, he added.He said emergency health services for non-Covid-19 patients should be restored immediately in hospitals. All patients, who are coming to hospitals, must be compulsorily screened, he added.The CM said most of the state’s private hospitals have been covered under the Ayushman Bharat scheme and a protocol for Covid-19 and non-Covid hospitals is in the works. “UP is setting up a Covid-19 hospital in all the 52 medical colleges in the state. Those districts that don’t have a medical college should convert its district-level hospital as a Covid-19 facility,” he said.“An additional chief medical officer-rank officer has been entrusted with the responsibility to train medical officers and paramedical staff. A mobile app is being developed for effective training. Teachers and principals of high schools and intermediate colleges, respectively, will also undergo compulsory training,” he added.The CM announced that the distribution of food grains to the poor and the needy would restart on the International Labour Day on May 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-holds-covid-19-review-meeting-discusses-quarantine-centres/story-thbIHcv9DlVZSbG4rrAlhK.html
27-04-2020||India||3 IRS officers stripped of their charge for creating panic with tax hike report||Three senior Indian Revenue Service officials who had played a key role in preparing a report on raising income tax and placed it in public domain have been chargesheeted for conduct rule violations, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times. They have also been stripped of their charge.The three officers, according to documents accessed by HT, are Prashant Bhushan, Prakash Dubey and Sanjay Bahadur.The action comes just a day after the Finance Ministry distanced itself from the recommendations of the widely-circulated report that had proposed raising income-tax rate up to 40% from 30% for those with income of Rs 1 core per year, reimposing a wealth tax on those with a net wealth of Rs 5 crore, and levy of a one-time Covid-19 relief cess of 4% on those with a taxable income of Rs 10 lakh and above.Also read: Centre rejects tax hike proposal by IRS officials, calls it ill-conceivedThe government had described the report as ill-conceived and irresponsible.Officials told Hindustan Times that a preliminary inquiry carried out by the government had blamed the three officials.Prashant Bhushan, a 1988 batch IRS officer, is the general secretary of the Indian Revenue Service Association and is alleged to have placed the report, drafted by a group of young IRS officers, in public domain.Prakash Dubey, the joint secretary of the IRS Association, and Sanjay Bahadur, a 1989 batch officer, have been charged with getting young income tax officers to prepare a report which they passed on to the IRS Association that ultimately placed it in public domain.Prakash Dubey was a director in the department of personnel and training while Sanjay Bahadur was the income tax department’s Principal Director Investigation, North East Region.Also read: At meet with chief ministers, PM Modi’s 5 clear messages on Covid-19 battleA government official explained that the three officers, despite having more than 30 years of service, had failed to exercise due care and misguided 50 young officers to prepare the report and circulate it.In this case, the three officials of the rank of Principal Commissioner, instead of sending the government through official channels, misguided the junior officers and went public with it.“This created panic and tax policy uncertainty in the already stressed economic conditions in the country,” a top government official said, explaining why the government had moved swiftly and firmly to act against the three officers.Top government officials underscored that the officials had no business circulating reports about an official matter in their personal capacity. They, one of them said referring to the charge sheet issued to other officers, had ended up creating confusion and uncertainty with respect of the policy of the government on income tax rates, which could have an adverse impact on economy, especially when the country is battling a pandemic and the government is keen to ensure a stable tax regime.It has also been pointed out that the proposals are against the government’s existing policy on taxation.In the budget this year, the government offered individuals the option of paying lower income-tax rates provided they forgo tax exemptions.It had earlier reduced corporate tax rates drastically in September, sacrificing Rs 1.45 lakh crore in revenue. Companies were given the choice of opting for a lower corporate tax rate of 22% (15% for newly incorporated companies) provided they don’t seek exemptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-irs-officers-stripped-of-their-charge-for-creating-panic-with-tax-hike-report/story-ZIpQborTMv2SKbcnuHRnGJ.html
27-04-2020||India||Petition against PM-Cares Fund has political colour: Supreme Court||A petition challenging the validity of the PM-Cares Fund, which was set up last month in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, and various Chief Minister Relief Funds has a “political colour”, the Supreme Court said on Monday.The court was hearing the plea by three lawyers and a law student, who chose not to pursue the case after a three-judge bench headed by NV Ramana asked them to withdraw the petition or face fine.“The petition has a political colour. Either you withdraw it or we will impose fine,” the bench, which also comprised justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and BR Gavai, said.In their plea filed on April 11, the petitioners submitted that the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF), which aims to aid families affected by natural calamities, the PM-Cares Fund and the Chief Minister Relief Fund of various states did not have the backing of any law.They argued that the money received in those funds, instead, should be transferred to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) which are funds created under the Disaster Management Act.“The Prime Minister is calling for money and promoting the non-statutory ‘PM-Cares Fund’ instead of calling for money and promoting the NDRF which is the statutory fund, under the 2005 Act needed to combat the COVID-19 crisis...,” the petitioners said.The petitioners also prayed “mass house-to-house tests” should be conducted so as to trace, identify and isolate persons infected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19.“Universal house-to-house testing is indispensible for the purpose of tracing the carriers/patients and isolating them for good, otherwise the whole exercise of our fight against COVID-19 pandemic would prove to be futile and the country and public at large would suffer irreparable consequences and untold misery,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petition-against-pm-cares-fund-has-political-colour-sc/story-93CUJypKO4eWiqX8ik58QN.html
27-04-2020||India||Amazon partners with Indian Railways for transporting essentials||E-commerce platform Amazon India has tied up with the Indian Railways for using special parcel trains for transporting essential goods under the lockdown.In a statement issued on Monday, Amazon said it has ramped up its operations to 55 lanes in a bid to enable faster deliveries. The Indian Railways has deployed special parcel trains in addition to freight trains for movement of essential goods in small parcel sizes.“Amazon India will transport consignments via rail across the country and is leveraging the ‘COVID-19 Parcel Special Trains’ introduced by the Indian Railways to ramp up its operations to 55 lanes during the lockdown period. This enhanced network will enable sellers in Amazon India’s network to ship their products across the country and keep their businesses running, thereby, allowing people to access a more diverse selection of essential products,” a statement by Amazon said.Amazon had last year tied up with the national carrier got for inter-city transportation of e-commerce packages on 13 lanes, and had also set up pickup kiosks for customers in Kolkata and Mumbai.At present, the home ministry has allowed e-commerce companies to deliver essential goods.The home ministry on Saturday had issued a clarification stating e-commerce companies would be allowed to sell only essential goods on their platforms.“It is clarified that sale by e-commerce companies will continue to be permitted for essential goods only,” the home ministry had clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amazon-partners-with-indian-railways-for-transporting-essentials/story-1vaj4vE0emo4ol6hGekeNP.html
27-04-2020||India||This Kolkata hospital offers ‘virtual visiting hours’ for Covid-19 patients||A private hospital that registered West Bengal’s first Covid-19 death on March 23, has found a way to make patients interact with their families since the state government has banned mobile phones in isolation wards at hospitals across the state.The government’s decision came after a patient at the state-run Bangur Hospital in Kolkata shot a video of a dead body lying in a ward and shared it on social media. Subsequently, even the inter-ministerial central team (IMCT) visiting Bengal raised the issue. In its order, the government said the ban was being imposed because mobile phones carry germs and infection. “Keeping in mind the anxiety of family members of patients and the recent government directive banning mobile phones in isolation wards, given how mobile phones are carriers of germs and infection, AMRI Hospitals has started ‘Virtual Visiting Hours’ so that patients can keep in touch with family members even from isolation,” AMRI hospital said in a statement on Sunday. The service was launched on the very same day.“Every day, nurses at the isolation wards will approach each patient and connect them to their family over video call. The virtual visiting hour will take place from 4:30 pm to 5:30 pm,” the statement said.Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI Hospitals, said, “Since normal visitations don’t apply to patients in isolation wards, we have been thinking of how to help our patients and their family members. We started it on Sunday, which has made both patients and their family members happy. This will mitigate their anxiety to a great extent. Our doctors also believe that getting to interact with their loved ones will help patients recover faster.”Dr Koushik Chaki, secretary, West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, said, “Experts have categorically said that when a patient is kept in isolation the mobile phone becomes an essential item. It helps him fight the isolation and psychological pressure. And, it takes only a few seconds to disinfect a phone.”Incidentally, a senior health department official infected with Covid-19 died at AMRI Hospital on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-kolkata-hospital-offers-virtual-visiting-hours-for-covid-19-patients/story-Re1poRjBAqW64H082TM9YP.html

27-04-2020||India||Bengal’s Covid-19 graph shows sharp spike, cases more than double in 1 week||West Bengal’s graph of people testing positive for Covid-19 is sharply rising, with the number of total cases more than doubling in seven days. Earlier, the state had recorded 339 cases between March 17 and April 20, however, as many as 357 cases have been recorded in the past seven days. On Monday, 47 new Covid-19 cases were reported.The state has recorded 696 positive cases till April 27, of which 504 are active cases.While the state administration claimed the increase was at par with the national average, senior doctors attributed the sudden rise to the low testing rate during the early days.Incidentally, the state that had been receiving a lot of flak over its low testing rate increased the number of daily tests conducted from April 15, when it started testing about 350 people per day on an average. The number of tests further increased from April 20, the day when incidentally, two inter-ministerial central teams reached Bengal. While the state had conducted only 5,469 tests till April 20, another 6,574 tests were conducted in the last seven days.“Our testing has rapidly increased. As many as 1,150 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours,” chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said on Monday evening.“Our positive confirmation rate is at par with the national rate,” Sinha said.Senior doctor Kunal Sarkar, however, said that the state was still not conducting enough tests. “We have to keep in mind that here we have not yet found as many asymptomatic patients as in other states. The testing rate is still low. Going by the state’s population and national testing average, Bengal needs to conduct 4,000 tests on a day on an average,” Sarkar said.Doctor and Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Fuad Halim echoed Sarkar. “The number of Covid-19 patients is increasing with the increase in the number of tests. The tests increased in the first place after I filed public interest litigation in the Calcutta high court. But, the state is still testing about four times below the national average, going by per million population,” Halim said.West Bengal’s present population is estimated at 10 crore.Only four of Bengal’s 23 districts are in the ‘red zone’ and, according to Sinha, 80% of the state’s cases are from the state capital of Kolkata.The situation is improving. “Five out of 8 containment zones in East Midnapore, 13 out of 57 containment zones in North 24 Parganas, 13 out of 56 containment zones in Howrah have not reported a single case in the past two weeks,” Sinha said.For Kolkata, however, the situation is not so hopeful. Of the 227 containment zones in the city, only 18 have not reported any case in the past two weeks.Under this scenario, the police have started acting tough. On Sunday, Kolkata police prosecuted 163 people for not covering their faces and 26 people for spitting in public places, besides booking 554 people under the Disaster Management Act for violating the lockdown.The police in the districts are using drone cameras and balloon cameras to identify lockdown violators, even though reports of lockdown violation, especially at various market places, came from different parts of the state even on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-covid-19-graph-shows-sharp-spike-cases-more-than-double-in-1-week/story-JjnNN6tIbSpjHAEM02TdmI.html

27-04-2020||India||HD Kumaraswamy demands Covid-19 tax on ‘super rich’ to offset economic losses||Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former chief minister of Karnataka HD Kumaraswamy has demanded that the government announce new schemes to save livelihoods of people especially those in the unorganised sector. Asking the government to provide immediate relief to farmers, construction workers, cab and auto drivers, garment workers and others, Kumaraswamy said that the economy is unlikely to bounce back quickly, it is important to lower the cost of living.Demanding that the government cut petrol and diesel prices, the Karnataka leader said in a series of tweets that the loss of revenue maybe offset partially by imposing Covid-19 cess on the ultra-rich. Citing RBI and international economic agencies, he said that GDP growth rate is expected to fall to a historic low. “Such a dire situation calls for citizen centric measures like full or partial waiver of EMIs, rents, school fees and other levies,” he added. Meanwhile, former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, in a letter to Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, demanded a special package for farmers on the lines that the state government has provided to dairy farmers. Gowda, who has always projected himself as a farmer leader and a ‘son of the soil’, said that farmers are on the brink of bankruptcy as they are unable to sell their produce due to the lockdown. Underlining that this was forcing farmers to sell their land, Gowda demanded that an immediate package for distressed farmers be announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hd-kumaraswamy-demands-covid-19-tax-on-super-rich-to-offset-economic-losses/story-FYzKjk85UCVG6IurZTGmnL.html
27-04-2020||India||Singapore, Kuwait record highest number of Indians infected with Covid-19||Singapore and Kuwait have emerged as the countries with the highest number of expatriate Indians infected by the Coronavirus, accounting for more than half of the 6,200 such infections reported from across the world, people familiar with developments said on Monday.More than 2,300 infections among Indian nationals, most of them workers living in dormitories, had been recorded in Singapore till late last week, and more than 1,300 infections were reported among expatriate Indians in Kuwait, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Other countries where sizeable numbers of Covid-19 infections among Indians have been reported are Bahrain and Qatar (about 500 each) and Iran (about 300), the people said.Iran was the first country where a large number of Indians were infected by the Coronavirus last month. Most of them were elderly Shia pilgrims from Kashmir and states such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, and a majority of the infections occurred in the holy city of Qom.Indian diplomats worked with Iranian authorities to create a special facility in Qom to treat the infected Indians, who are now expected to be brought back from Iran once the nationwide lockdown is eased next month.As of April 16, the total number of Indians infected in 53 countries was 3,336 and this almost doubled to 6,200 by last week. The total number of infected Indians who have died abroad currently is around 40, the people said.The welfare and treatment of infected Indians has figured in conversations between the prime minister and external affairs minister and their counterparts in countries such as Singapore and Kuwait.During a conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 23, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said his government “will care for Indian migrant workers here, just as we care for Singaporeans”.Indians now account for almost a quarter of the more than 11,000 Covid-19 cases recorded in Singapore till last week. Most of Singapore’s infections are work permit holders living in foreign worker dormitories and 25 of these dormitories have been designated isolation areas so far, Channel News Asia reported.The welfare of Indian nationals also figured in Modi’s recent phone conversation with his Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh Sabah al-Khaled al-Hamad al-Sabah, who said his government “values the contributions of the large Indian community…and would continue to ensure their safety and welfare in the present situation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singapore-kuwait-record-highest-number-of-indian-covid-19-cases/story-nNW338HhJdwSu93GC2aCOM.html
27-04-2020||India||Amid Covid-19 crisis, senior bureaucrat Amit Khare returns to helm I&B ministry||Senior IAS officer Amit Khare on Monday took charge as the secretary of the Information and Broadcasting (I&B) ministry, a vital move, as the government is increasingly focussing on adopting the right communication strategy as the country prepares to move into the next phase in the battle against coronavirus.This is the second time that the Jharkhand-cadre 1985-batch IAS officer will work at the helm of the I&B ministry. He had occupied the position before being made Secretary (School Education) in the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD). At present, Khare also holds charge as Secretary (Higher Education) in the HRD ministry.On Monday, Khare took charge of the ministry in the afternoon and met all the key officers.The return of the veteran officer to the I&B ministry, which decides the Union government’s communication outreach, is important as the government has been trying to spread awareness about the tough decisions it has been forced to take following the Covid-19 outbreak.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been at the forefront of this information outreach as he has repeatedly made television addresses and held interactions to communicate the government’s perspective on the situation.On Sunday, in his Mann Ki Baat address, PM Modi had once again focussed on coronavirus and warned against any complacency.With the government focussing on hotspots and devising different strategies for different districts depending upon their situation, the I&B ministry is also working to tweak its strategy to localized needs, which considering the diversity is a challenge.Another challenge that the ministry has been facing is the unending stream of fake news and untruths that have swamped social media sites.The appointment of Khare also comes at a time when the media, be it newspapers, broadcasters or the cinema industry have all been hit hard. Representatives of these sectors have repeatedly approached the government about the adverse impact their advertisement revenues as well as circulation mechanisms have suffered.In an order on Sunday, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) headed by the prime minister made several key changes including bringing Khare into the I&B ministry in place of Ravi Mittal, who has been made secretary sports. CBSE chairperson Anita Karwal has been made School Education secretary in the HRD ministry, a charge Khare held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-crisis-senior-bureaucrat-amit-khare-returns-to-helm-i-b-ministry/story-DO6ZmBhXB8zW06y1PJfm9I.html

Sunny Sutradhar, 24, a supervisor in export sector in Delhi got married to Subhra Shil, a swimming instructor at a school in Delhi. Both of them are from Purba Gakulpur village, near to Udaipur in Gomati district , almost 50 kilometres from Agartala. They met each other over social media many years ago and fell in love. Their families also fixed their marriage long back but they had to hold the marriage due to lockdown. “ We need to join our work in Delhi as soon as the lockdown is lifted. We have no time on our hand and that’s why, we sought special permission from the administration for our wedding. We have cut off many rituals except the customary one. We married maintaining social distance and wearing masks,” Sunny told reporters. Only 20 invitees from both the groom and bride’s family attended the wedding. The groom’s family got to know about the provision for seeking special permission regarding marriage from the administration. Accordingly, they applied for so and their all official formalities were done in two days. Udaipur sub divisional magistrate Aniruddha Roy said, “ Seven restrictions were given to them during the wedding including no wedding reception except the customary one, not more than 20 invitees from both the sides can attend, one vehicle will carry only one passenger and the driver, wearing masks, using hand wash or hand sanitizers, social distancing etc. All the rules were followed by them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-outbreak-tripura-witnesses-first-wedding-amidst-lockdown/story-f7bfWX5fY68b2JfFrDWgSP.html
27-04-2020||India||Testing, surveillance behind high number of cases in Ahmedabad: Municipal commissioner||With 1,854 Covid-19 cases and 103 deaths, Ahmedabad is the most affected district of Gujarat and has reported the second highest number of deaths. Jaykishan Sharma spoke to the city’s municipal commissioner, Vijay Nehra, about the reasons for the spurt in cases and the strategy to contain the virus.What are the reasons behind the high number of Covid-19 cases in Ahmedabad?While we were aware that every effort must be made to contain the disease, we realize it will not be possible unless we do proactive discovery of cases and nip the infection spread in the bud. So, we adopted an intensive proactive discovery approach to find cases which we call the EPIC approach – enhanced testing, intensive surveillance, proactive detection and corona checkposts. As a corollary to this approach, it was all but natural that reported cases would go up. It must be appreciated it helped us in locating cases before they did large-scale damage through community spread. We have done 3,250-plus tests per million, more than double than the next highest figure in a city like Delhi, which has done around 1,500 tests per million. The doubling rate, which was three to four days, increased to seven to eight days. The recovery has improved. In the past, it was 5% and at present, the recovery rate is 10%.Any other reasons behind such a high number of cases?In the entire world, the problem has come to the cities first. In India also, Delhi, Mumbai, Indore, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and big cities with dense population were the first to be affected by Covid-19. As a quick early response, we effectively home quarantined almost 6,000 passengers who had come from Covid-19-prone nations. Of them, only 14 were found positive. But the cases increased after people in large numbers from Ahmedabad, who attended the [Tablighi Jamaat meet] in Delhi, came to Ahmedabad and were found positive.Maximum cases have been reported from the Walled City. Is there any specific strategy to deal with this?More than 800 medical teams are in the field for surveillance and as a result, we are able to catch super-spreaders like vegetable sellers, kirana owners and milk sellers on a daily basis through our intelligent sampling approach. On a scale never seen before in India, we sealed the old Walled City and in a single day, surveyed more than 100,000 people. We adopted a strategy of cluster containment early on and were able to moderate the growth of virus in hot spots like central Ahmedabad. Even at the cost of a rise in figures, we firmly believe aggressive testing and surveillance is the way forward. It might give an impression figures are rising in Ahmedabad, but it should be appreciated we are testing most aggressively. To complement our medicare efforts, we used the technology infrastructure that we had as part of Smart City Ahmedabad. We proactively monitor the lockdown in Ahmedabad through our 3,000-plus cameras in the city and in close coordination with police. Spitting fines and mask-wearing compliance is done through these cameras.What was the initial response of the administration to Covid-19 cases in Ahmedabad?Ahmedabad is a unique cosmopolitan city with a diverse multi-ethnic population. At the same time, it has diverse residential and habitation patterns which pose their own challenges regarding spread of the virus. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) was alive to the Covid-19 challenge even before the first case cropped up in India. We were among one of the first urban civic bodies to suspend mass transport to avoid infection spread. We were the first civic body to launch a massive disinfection campaigns with support of our fire department.How are you tracking the people in home and institutional quarantine?Everything, right from daily essentials to medicines to special requirements, were supplied to the 6,000 home quarantined passengers by AMC staff and there was real-time monitoring of these people. We used GPS app-based location tracing of quarantined people to monitor their real-time locations. For those who were not home quarantined, we established a world-class facility in the Sports Club of Ahmedabad with every modern amenity and passengers were kept there free of cost. We are happy that the quality of quarantine ensured there was hardly any spread of infection from these passengers and we were ahead of the curve when it came to dealing with the disease. We established quarantine facilities in every zone of AMC to deal with Covid-19 in a decentralised and effective manner. We now have more than 10 quarantine centres in Ahmedabad either operational or ready to be put into operation.What were the steps taken to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential commodities after the lockdown?Once the lockdown started, the biggest challenge was to ensure citizens don’t face any hassles and have uninterrupted access to basic requirements of life. Immediately, AMC rolled out new initiatives, including door to door supply of vegetables and other essentials, collection of garbage of Covid-19 suspects such as bio-medical waste, free food and medicine delivery to elderly on demand, surveillance and fumigation through drones and disinfection through a wide range of mechanical vehicles. Hyper-marts were taken on board and door to door supplies of groceries is being done by them. Our e-rickshaw-based Vegetable on Wheels initiative was recognised by the Union government as a model to be replicated by all.How are you tackling the distribution of food in slums and areas having high concentration of workers?We tripled our citizen helplines and now address citizen complaints, including Covid-19-related ones, almost on a real-time basis. To ensure the person at the bottom of the pyramid doesn’t suffer, AMC tied up with civil society members and we distributed around 50,000 food packets a day to the needy and no one in Ahmedabad slept hungry. Stranded migrant workers were provided with a roof and thousands were given a place to dwell. Similarly, to address the nutritional needs of people in slums, AMC supplied free vegetables and milk. We were one of the pioneers in social distancing and the ubiquitous circles outside shops were drawn very early on in Ahmedabad. AMC has enlisted more than 5,000 citizen volunteers through its online volunteer platform, who came forward to donate ration kits, food packets and sanitary material. Ahmedabadis came forward to sponsor tests for fellow citizens and hundreds of tests have been sponsored so far. With the support of Ahmedabadis, our strategy of aggressive testing is bearing fruit and we are hopeful that by May-end, we will be able to tide over this situation and this city will emerge victorious over Covid-19 sooner than later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/testing-surveillance-behind-high-number-of-cases-in-ahmedabad-municipal-commissioner/story-BpkFhHSduN6upEFWvIMFJK.html

He said, in the last meeting with the PM, he had spoken in detail so this time the chief secretary attended the meeting and submitted the state’s proposals in writing.“Our cumulative loss is over Rs 80,000 crore. Micro and small and medium enterprises alone lost over Rs 14,000 crore. Hotel, tourism, fisheries, IT, self-employment and other sectors also lost badly. So we want an exclusive package to revive these sectors,” said the CM, adding the state has also asked the Centre to hike its borrowing capacity from the present 3% to 5%.The CM said 13 fresh cases were reported on Monday and two districts in green zones — Kottayam and Idukki — were put in the red zone as more cases were reported from there. Out of 13 new cases, Kottayam reported six and Idukki four. The state had reported 481 positive cases and 358 people were recovered, he said.Another issue raised at Monday’s video conference was the return of immigrant workers from Middle-East countries, said the CM. “We want the Centre to bear the airfare of the people, as they are reeling under financial constraints. We will screen them thoroughly at airports and they will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine on their arrival,” he said, adding more than 2, 20,000 were registered on the website of the non-resident Keralites affairs (Norka) department.There are at least 18 lakh people working in Gulf countries from the southern state and it is expecting that almost two lakh will be returning in the coming months. The CM said the state also sought the Centre’s help in sending stranded migrant workers back to their states. There are at least four lakh migrant workers who are living in 10,000 camps in different parts of the state. He sought non-stop trains from the Railways for the stranded labour force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-for-partial-nationwide-lockdown-till-may-15-seeks-financial-relief/story-dFJ8lhHE4gsGTYmNs5X2YM.html

What should we do? There is a lack of clarity between what the Central government is saying and their directives,” she said at a briefing at the state secretariat according to ANI.Banerjee who was among the chief ministers who did not get to speak at the video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday morning, said her government was in favour of the lockdown.“If you open shops, how would you enforce lockdown? I think the Centre should come out with a clarification,” Banerjee said.She also said that the Centre should consult states before releasing circulars.“Central government is releasing circulars all of a sudden. I don’t have any problem with it but there must be some consultation. They should have asked the position of states,” she said.The lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus is scheduled to end on May 3 but a few chief ministers want it extended. West Bengal has so far reported 696 cases of Covid-19.Last week, Banerjee clashed with the Centre over the visit of two Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) to Bengal to oversee the state government’s efforts in the containment zones in teh fight against Covid-19.While the central teams complained that they did not get support in accessing hospitals and that local officials refused to accompany them, the ruling Trinamool Congress accused the two Central teams of spreading a “political virus” in the name of assessing the coronavirus containment efforts on the ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-do-you-enforce-lockdown-and-open-shops-asks-mamata-banerjee/story-1vEWDNObFZ02HAPH9JEgjN.html
27-04-2020||India||Rajasthan gears up to bring back its workers stranded in other states||The Rajasthan government has initiated steps to bring back its migrant workers from other states and to send workers from other states back home ahead of the possible easing of the nationwide lockdown.Rajasthan has selected 19 IAS and IPS officers to coordinate with the governments of 14 states, district authorities and other agencies on the issue of migrant workers. Guidelines have been issued for authorities in districts where returning workers are expected to enter the state.After constant pursuance of the matter by chief minister Ashok Gehlot, other states agreed to transport the migrants workers to their respective hometowns. Gehlot also raised the matter with the central government a number of times. Gehlot tweeted on Monday: “After much effort by state government, migrants of Rajasthan will soon be returning home from other states. These people suffered a lot during lockdown. Now when they return, it is our moral duty to take care of them, provide them all help regarding food, medicines and quarantine facilities.“My appeal to all is please give moral support to our brothers and sisters returning home after a very hard period. Following the culture of Rajasthan that we never leave our people in distress, take proper care of the migrants.” Additional chief secretary (industries) Subodh Agarwal said the state government is constantly making efforts to address the grievances of workers from across the country, and all efforts are being made to send them home. Guidelines have been issued for migrant workers either going out of or coming to the state, he said.Chief secretary DB Gupta said the 19 selected officers will coordinate with the governments of other states and other agencies of the Rajasthan government to resolve the issues of Rajasthani workers in other parts of the country.He said they will also coordinate with other states to address the issues of workers staying in Rajasthan during the lockdown and the planned inter-state movement, as and when permitted, while ensuring strict observance of medical and safety protocols, screening and social distancing. The officials have been selected to liaise with Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. After a meeting chaired by Gehlot on this issue, Gupta issued directives related to protocol. Transit camps are to be established at border check-posts and adequate arrangements made for food, water, shade and medicines at the camps. Authorities will also earmark large spaces with buildings where for migrant workers can be segregated, and social distancing norms shouldn’t be violated under any circumstances.Wary of an increase in movements in the coming days, Rajasthan’s home department also has issued guidelines.Additional chief secretary (home) Rajeeva Swarup, in a circular issued to all district collectors, said residents of Rajasthan with permits are returning to the state and the number is going to increase. In such circumstances, there could be chances of the spread of Covid19, and check-posts should be established in border districts where all those arriving can be registered along with their names, addresses and mobile numbers.Swarup also asked authorities to strengthen the information system in villages and colonies to keep tabs on any persons coming directly to their hometowns and to ensure people stay in quarantine for 14 days. At places where local residents aren’t allowing in outsiders, they can be kept in quarantine at school buildings.

No ‘bazaar’ or ‘haat’ (market places) will open,” Assam chief secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna tweeted.Of the 33 districts in Assam, 5 districts-Golaghat, Nalbari, Marigaon, Dhubri and Goalpara in the red zone.While the shops in rural areas will be allowed to open from Tuesday, decision on allowing shops in urban areas to operate will be taken only after May 3 when the ongoing lockdown period ends.Parliamentary affairs minister Chandra Mohan Patowary informed that shops within a radius of 5km around the boundary of districts declared as red zones also won’t be allowed to open.“Areas within that radius even if they fall in a green zone will continue to follow the rules meant for red zones,” Patowary said.He informed that the ongoing relaxation for interdistrict movement of people stranded across the state due to the lockdown will get extended till May 2.Since April 25, Assam State Transport Corporation has been transporting people across the state in buses free of cost. While 41,000 people had registered to avail the service, till Monday, 27,000 had travelled to their respective destinations. The service was launched initially for 3 days, later it was extended till April 30.“Some people have not been to avail the service yet and we are getting lots of requests from the districts to extend the date. Hence the cabinet decided to extend the date further till May 2,” he said.Patowary added the ongoing lockdown measures for districts in the red zone will continue to be strictly enforced.Assam has recorded 35 Covid-19 positive cases till date.

He was undergoing treatment at Parel’s King Edward Memorial Hospital. This is the third death due to coronavirus from the Mumbai police force in the last 48-hours. Over 50 policemen from the city police have tested positive for Covid-19 so far and are undergoing treatment at various hospitals. He is the third Mumbai police constable to succumb to Covid-19.A senior police officer confirmed the development to HT. Mumbai Police on Monday evening informed about the demise of the head constable through Twitter.The head constable had tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of KEM Hospital. He had medical history of blood pressure, a senior police officer said.On April 21, he was allegedly denied admission by four civic hospitals despite having coronavirus symptoms. The head constable’s 25-year-old son rushed him to Rajawadi Hospital around 2 pm after he had developed fever. The doctors conducted preliminary analysis and recommended home quarantine for him. “When I asked them to admit him, they claimed there was no bed available and asked me to take him to Kasturba Hospital,” the head constable’s son earlier speaking with HT said.He then took his father to Kasturba Hospital, where doctors supplied oxygen to the head constable. “They asked me to take him to Nair Hospital and didn’t even take my father’s swab for testing,” the 25-year-old alleged.At Nair Hospital, too, the authorities did not admit him stating they had no beds and that they did not test patients. “On their recommendation, I took my father to KEM Hospital, where doctors refused to admit him. After I contacted the police, my father was admitted to the ICU at 11pm,” the youth said.“My father has given 28 years to police service. If anything goes wrong, the doctors are responsible,” an emotional son had said.The deceased cop’s brother is also a policeman attached with the Mumbai Crime Branch. The head constable lived with his wife, two sons and two daughters at Kurla’s Kamani slums. His elder son works as a CCTV operator at Mantralaya for a private firm on contract basis.A 35-year-old constable, also attached with the Kurla traffic division, has tested positive for Covid-19, and has been admitted to Thane’s Kaushalya Hospital. It is suspected that he contracted the virus from the head constable.Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), on Friday had said that the constable was stable and the hospital’s dean will speak to his family about their complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-cop-who-was-denied-admission-in-4-civic-hospitals-dies-of-covid-19/story-Xg6fqLi4wqXEqquZ0txmzN.html

We provided them breakfast after they underwent proper screening. Altogether, 213 students, including 57 from Ladakh, left for Srinagar in the morning. Another 186 students, accompanied by 30 of their parents, from Jammu will reach their destinations by the evening,” said OP Bhagat, deputy district magistrate, Kathua.“As per the guidelines, the students will be kept in administrative quarantine before they are allowed to go to their homes. However, the health officials didn’t come across Covid-19 symptoms among any students,” he added.The students are happy to be back home.“Most of the students from the other states had left for their native places after the lockdown restrictions were announced. Our classes stopped on March 25 and we’re also facing problems in getting our food. Then, we got in touch with J&K officials and also tweeted our plight tagging our Lieutenant Governor G C Murmu,” said a female student from J&K.An official the Ladakh UT administration thanked the J&K authorities for the cooperation. “We’ll be receiving our first batch, comprising 57 Ladakhi students, from Kota soon.”A total of 15 Jammu and Kashmir State Road Transport Corporation buses were pressed into service to bring back the students from Kota.J&K has reported 523 Covid-19 positive cases, of which 137 have recovered and six have died, according to the latest figures of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-j-k-evacuates-369-students-from-kota/story-btyFucgH9IRSHc30acIPeK.html

Many are also in different parts of the country to get coaching. Bringing them back is not possible under the present framework. For this to happen, the Centre needs to amend its existing guidelines and issue fresh directives,” chief minister said, suggesting that any such relaxation should be evaluated for striking a uniformity in the future strategy on Covid-19.Kumar, who heads a coalition government with the BJP and the LJP in the state, said that it was for the Centre to take a call on the duration of the lockdown. “It can take the views of specialists and qualified persons in this regard. Bihar will comply with the Centre’s decision,” he said.Pressure has been building on the government for the safe passage of thousands of students and lakhs of migrant workers back home from their present locations as educational and industrial activities came to a juddering halt. Anxious parents, relatives and Opposition parties started to mount pressure, accusing the government of abandoning its own people.A public interest litigation (PIL) was also filed in Patna High Court and the verdict that was due for the day has been deferred for Tuesday.Aware that the return of students was intricately linked with the similar demand by a very large number of migrant workforce, the state government is treading with caution both to abide by the legal obligation for following the existing guidelines and also for limiting the spread of the contagion.Kumar informed the PM that the state government has received over one lakh phone calls and messages from migrant workers. “Based on their feedback, we are making an all out effort to redress their problems,” he said, while urging that anyone being allowed to be sent back to the state should be subjected to intensive screening.“We have also received 25 lakh applications seeking Rs 1,000 assistance announced by the state government and have transferred the amount through DBT mode into the accounts of 15 lakh people so far,” he said, drawing the attention of the PM towards the urgent requirement of additional ventilators and testing kits.Last week, Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey had raised the earlier demand for ventilators from 100 to 500.Chief minister said that the state government was taking all possible steps to contain the spread of the pandemic and has initiated intensive drive for door-to-door, on the pattern of pulse polio campaign, for screening.“Seventy-five lakh families have been screened. We want to screen each and every family in the state, after the exercise is over in four worst affected districts. Testing is being carried out on a massive scale and the number of quarantine centres has been increased,” he informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-possible-bihar-cm-cites-lockdown-for-delaying-kota-students-return/story-JZaVfa2D7mQvdwa11qwXvJ.html
27-04-2020||India||Anantnag braces for Covid-19 spurt as woman tests positive after death||The death of a woman in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district who later turned Covid-19 positive too, triggered fear among the already declared hotspot that many people who participated in her last rites may have contracted the infection as she was not buried as per the Covid-19 protocol.The family of the deceased alleged that the Maternity and child care hospital in Anantnag, where the 32-year old woman delivered dead twins and shortly died herself on Saturday, did not follow the proper protocol as they handed over the body to her family before the test results were out, due to which a large number of people attended her funeral in Kharpoora (Already declared hotspot) area of Anantnag.Her tests came out positive late on Sunday, a day after she was buried.The family alleged that the doctors at the hospital were negligent as they delayed her treatment on Saturday citing that she had come from a red zone. “She was left unattended for nearly 2 hours, after which she delivered two dead children, and shortly died herself too,” a relative said.“A probe is underway as the attendants of the woman have accused doctors of negligence. Regarding the SOP, the doctors had properly wrapped the body and advised the attendants of social distancing, however, the release of the body before the test result is a lapse which people have to answer,” said principal Government Medical College, Anantnag, Shaukat Jeelani.The relative added that “The doctors are lying when they say that the body was properly wrapped. They also did not advise us anything. We washed the body and around 100 people attended the funeral.”The authorities have now quarantined three doctors and the two paramedical staff who came indirect contact with the woman and also started quarantining the people who participated in her funeral.Deputy commissioner Anantnag Basher Ahmad Dar, “Enquiry is under way. On the basis of findings, action will be taken. No body will go unpunished if found involved in negligence and dereliction of duty”.In the southern district of the Valley, over 50 cases have been reported so far out of which two are pregnant women.Health authorities of the maternity hospital said that the woman’s twins were a case of Intra-Uterine Death (IUD) and the probe will make clear the sequence of events.“The probe will make clear everything about her death as well as the protocols. On our part, we followed the Covid protocols, wrapped her properly and gave instructions to her family not to wash her and maintain social distance while performing her last rites. What they did was beyond our control,” said medical superintendent of the hospital, Dr Mir Ji Andrabi.The incident has created a fear among the localities and even people are also questioning the administration as to how the pregnant woman directly reached the maternity hospital from a red zone and how a large number of people were allowed to gather for her funeral.“Not only the health dept but also district admin should be questioned… when the village of the deceased lady has been already declared as red zone…How these people came out of their houses and participate in the funeral???,” questioned a netizen. Kashmir reported its first case on March 18 and it was not until April 15 that the Anantnag district reported its first Covid-19 positive case..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anantnag-braces-for-covid-19-spurt-as-pregnant-woman-tests-positive-after-death/story-TIrbJFLgqqqvCxOBcmNodM.html

I put on my uniform to convey a message to the nursing fraternity that I’m one of their own. I interacted with the nursing staff to encourage them in their valiant fight against the pandemic. These are hard times. We need to stand by each other to fight this pandemic together,” she told HT. pic.twitter.com/jzrImVsuZgPednekar, who was born to a mill worker father, started her career as a nurse before she took to politics and joined the Shiv Sena’s women’s wing in 1992. Initially, she worked for the Sena in Raigad and Sindhudurg districts in western Maharashtra. She was elected a BMC councillor in 2002 and has since been re-elected twice in 2012 and 2017.She had quarantined herself at her official residence in Byculla for a week after 53 Mumbai-based journalists recently tested Covid-19 positive at a health camp organised by the BMC authorities. Pednekar, who was present at the health camp, had announced that she would quarantine herself for two weeks but decided to get back to her public life after she tested Covid-19 negative for the second consecutive time.“I stepped out after both my swab samples tested negative. I’m Mumbai’s first citizen and I need to work for the Mumbaikars,” she added.On Tuesday, Pednekar plans to make a similar visit to the BMC-run Sion Hospital. Mumbai reported 5,407 Covid-19 positive cases and 204 deaths till Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-mayor-visits-hospital-in-nurse-s-uniform-encourages-health-staff/story-hHHRo1VSrUWxYBY1GTIhXJ.html
27-04-2020||India||‘Shame and disgust’: Rahul Gandhi amid row over cost of Covid-19 test kits||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday alleged a scam in the supply of rapid test kits to the government to detect coronavirus cases, saying it was beyond belief that some people were indulging in profiteering from the immeasurable suffering of millions.He urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take immediate strict action to bring the corrupt to justice.“That any human being would try and profiteer from the immeasurable suffering of millions of his brothers and sisters is beyond belief and comprehension. This scam is an insult to every Indian. I urge the PM to act swiftly to bring the corrupt to justice,” Gandhi tweeted.“When the entire country is fighting against the Covid-19 disaster, some people are still profiteering. Shame and disgust at this corrupt mentality. One detests and feels ashamed of such a corrupt mindset. The country will never pardon them. We demand from the Prime Minister strict action against these profiteers,” he said in another tweet in Hindi.The Congress cited media reports about rapid test kits for Covid-19 were being sold at around 150% profits to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and asked the Prime Minister to fix the responsibility for it.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said it was “shameful and inhuman” that people were supplying test kits bought for Rs 225 at Rs 600 to the state exchequer.“Corruption in Corona Testing Kits OR Profiteering by duping the Exchequer. Import Price of 1 Testing Kit= Rs 225! Purchase Price of Testing Kit= Rs 600! Profit Margin = 166.66 pc! Shameful and Inhuman! Will PM fix responsibility,” he tweeted.Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel too demanded a clarification from the government. “The recent Delhi HC (high court) judgement has raised a pertinent question - Why was ICMR purchasing antibody test kits for Rs 600 per piece, which was imported for Rs 245?” he asked on twitter.Later addressing reporters through video-conferencing, Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari demanded that the government should make public details of all purchases made in the last one month to fight Covid-19.He said the government should put an immediate end to the huge profiteering in procurement of equipment.“What is happening? There seems to be absolute anarchy in procurement of equipment for fighting Covid-19. We would like to demand from the government to make public all details made with regard to procuring equipment for testing, PPEs and ventilators. All those transactions must be transparently placed in public domain,” added Tewari.Referring to a company engaged in supply of testing kits acquired from China, he alleged that kits purchased at Rs 245 were being sold by the same company to ICMR at Rs 600 each while the same to Tamil Nadu government were sold at Rs 400 each.“The price of one testing kit was Rs 245, thus 5 lakh kits amount to Rs 12.25 crore. However, the firm sold the kits to another company at Rs 21 crore and the ICMR procured these kits at Rs 30 crore, which is a profit margin of more than 100%,” Tewari said.The Congress leader said the matter came to light in a petition before the Delhi high court by a company supplying such equipment.“This is an extremely serious matter which hurts the fight of India against Covid-19. Our country’s resources are scarce and we have to optimise them and not allow companies to make arbitrage of over 60% in these transactions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shame-and-disgust-rahul-gandhi-amid-row-over-cost-of-covid-19-test-kits/story-pFuGuYnu80STKteQOXwhrM.html
27-04-2020||India||At meet with chief ministers, PM Modi’s 5 clear messages on Covid-19 battle||Prime Minister Narendra Modi told chief ministers on Monday to focus on a graded exit from the national lockdown from May 3 and plan for a step-by-step revival of economic activity in green zones that haven’t reported Covid-19 cases.PM Modi, who was speaking at his fourth interaction via video conference with chief ministers on the Covid-19 challenge, underlined that the country had to think of the way ahead, beyond May 3, when the second round of the national lockdown ends.The states should strictly enforce the lockdown guidelines in the hotspots, or the red zone areas, and focus on converting them into orange zones - areas with a few Covid-19 cases - and thereafter to green zones.Watch | PM Modi discusses lockdown exit strategy with CMs: All the key details Apart from a graded exit from the lockdown, PM Modi outlined his government’s thinking on reviving the economy, the plan to evacuate Indians stranded abroad, the condition of migrant workers and stressed that fighting Covid-19 was a collective responsibility.India had gone into a complete lockdown mode on March 25 to prevent the coronavirus disease from spreading. The lockdown brought economic activity to a grinding halt, and put a lid on consumption that powers the economy. PM Modi renewed the lockdown on April 14 but this time, started easing the restrictions to revive economic activity.But the lockdown had saved lives, PM Modi told the chief ministers. Many countries, much smaller than India, had lost many more lives in the pandemic. But he cautioned that the danger of the virus is far from over in India.Instead, the prime minister asked states to consolidate their gains and at the same time, revive economic activity. But you should ensure that there is no casual attitude towards the virus, he told them.Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma summarised PM Modi’s message, saying that even as the lockdown is relaxed from May 3, the entire mindset of the lockdown should continue.PM Modi also hinted that the government might look at certain reforms that had been held up earlier. “We have to be brave and bring in reforms that touch the lives of common citizens,” he said. PM Modi did not elaborate on the reforms that he had in mind.PM Modi also underlined the plight of migrant workers and asked chief ministers to take special care of workers from other states and ease their hardship.The government has been reluctant to facilitate the return of millions of migrant workers on grounds that mass travel can take the infection to unaffected areas. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thakceray has repeatedly asked for special trains to be run to let the migrant workers return home. Some other states have offered to run buses.PM Modi didn’t rule out the Centre’s approval but appeared to message that states should assess how they would be able to run the factories and industrial units in the absence of the migrant workers.The prime minister also indicated that the Centre’s evacuation plan for Indians stranded abroad was on track. Since Indian citizens stuck abroad would have to be placed in quarantine centres immediately on their return, the Centre has made it clear that this plan would depend heavily on the ability of states to accommodate them at quarantine centres and hospitals.This, PM Modi said, had to be done keeping in mind that the citizens don’t get inconvenienced on their return and their families are not under any risk.PM Modi, who has more than once spoken of the crucial role played by state governments in fighting Covid-19, underscored that it was the collective responsibility of the Centre, states and people to stop the virus from spreading.If one state goes down, it will take the entire country down, he said. The remark came against the backdrop of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s faceoff with the Union home ministry over the visit of a central team to her state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-meet-with-chief-ministers-pm-modi-s-5-clear-messages-on-covid-19-battle/story-vL2yCGml7bKacATZmb8NGI.html
27-04-2020||India||Return Covid-19 rapid test kits: ICMR to states after complaints over results||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) asked states on Monday to stop using rapid tests kits made by two Chinese companies and return them.In a letter to chief secretaries, ICMR additional director general GS Toteja said the scientific body has evaluated the performance of the kits, which were initially seen as crucial in efforts to speed up Covid-19 testing, and found wide variation in results.ICMR has tested the kits of Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon diagnostics in field conditions, the letter said.“The results have shown wide variation in their sensitivity despite early promise of good performance for surveillance purposes,” it said.He said states should stop using kits procured from these companies and return them so that they could be sent back to the suppliers.Toteja said several states procured rapid antibody test kits even as ICMR made them available at the clear instruction that these kits were to be used only for surveillance purposes. On April 16, ICMR received a consignment of 550,000 of these test kits from the two Chinese companies.On April 21, ICMR put on hold the use of rapid testing kits after complaints from several states. The first came from West Bengal, which said the kits returned ‘inconclusive results’. Soon, Rajasthan, which was the first to start using the kits on April 18, found that patients already confirmed through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were reported as negative by the rapid test kits.After India halted its use, both the Chinese companies that exported the kits issued a statement saying their testing kits were of optimum quality and they would cooperate with the Indian authorities to get to the cause behind the inaccurate test results.The principle mechanism of how the blood tests work is one of the reasons they are turning out to be complicated: these detect antibodies that an infected person’s body creates in response to the virus, instead of detecting the virus itself – which is the case in the swab tests.Antibodies can take days to show up in the blood, scientists say. In a yet-to-be peer reviewed paper comparing 12 such blood test kits, American researchers found that the accuracy of positive results ranged between 81.8-100% after 20 days of a person first showing symptoms. The accuracy of negative results in those not infected was in the 84.3-100.0% range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/return-covid-19-rapid-test-kits-icmr-to-states-amid-complaints/story-fKtXccLsVltpHNTaUIXunK.html

While one patient has died 11 others are recovering. All the cases are from the state capital Shillong.“As far as Mizoram is concerned, I informed the PM that we have just one Covid-19 patient who is recovering slowly. But since we are surrounded by Myanmar, Bangladesh and neighbouring states which also have Covid-19 patients, we can’t be complacent and guard have to ourselves very strictly,” Mizoram CM Zoramthanga told HT over phone from Aizawl.“We will try to relax the lockdown a little after May 3 and allow some economic activity slowly. In our view, the lockdown should continue as the situation is grim in several places. But some kind of activity can be permitted in green zones,” he added.Mizoram has reported only one case of Covid-19 so far. At the video conference, Prime Minister Modi told the chief ministers that the lockdown has yielded positive results and the country has managed to save thousands of lives in past one and a half months.The lockdown which began on March 25 was to end on April 14 but was extended to May 3 after many chief ministers recommended it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-and-mizoram-cms-want-lockdown-extension-with-some-concessions/story-vq9B4yulTfglADlQpE9u8J.html
27-04-2020||India||Pak Army publication focuses on Kashmir; Bajwa writes on Art 370, Balakot||Kashmir appears to be the focus of the 2020 edition of an internal publication of the Pakistan Army, with its chief Gen Qamar Bajwa describing last year’s Balakot air strike and the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status as events that impacted regional geo-politics.A majority of articles in the latest edition by army officers, former diplomats, academics and journalists reference the Kashmir issue, and offer suggestions ranging from creating a Kashmir Fund to support people in the Indian Union Territory, and adopting information and cyber warfare by establishing communications links inside the Kashmir Valley.The Green Book 2020, a biennial publication of the Pakistan Army with essays by both serving and retired officers that reflect the military’s overall strategy and objectives, also has a message by Bajwa that describes Kashmir as a “nuclear flashpoint”.In his message in Green Book 2020, posted on the website of Pakistan’s National Defence University (NDU), Bajwa says the environment in South continues to be complex, with the lines getting blurred between different types of warfare.“Year 2019 witnessed two significant events which will have lasting imprint on the geopolitics of this region; first, the unwarranted Balakot Strike by Indian Air Force on 26th February and second, the unilateral annexation of Indian Occupied Jammu & Kashmir by [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi on 5th August, through abrogation of Article 370 and 35A,” Bajwa wrote in the message issued as patron-in-chief of the publication.“Former was a coercive attempt to carve out space for war under nuclear overhang and enforce compellence; adroitly denied by Pakistan Air Force the very next day, through a calibrated and proportionate response – Indian craving for establishing a New Normal was stymied comprehensively. The latter, despite condemnation by the world at large, continues to haunt the lives of over eight million Muslims of [Kashmir]…,” he added.“Kashmir is a nuclear flashpoint and in total disregard to international norms, Mr Modi has not only endangered the immediate neighbourhood, but has also raised the ante for the entire World. The scholarly discourse in current edition of Pakistan Army Green Book has accordingly spotlighted the implications of these events from diverse perspectives and dimensions,” Bajwa further wrote.Some recent editions of the Green Book had focused on the internal threat posed by terrorist groups but this year’s edition marks a return to the traditional focus on India as Pakistan’s greatest threat. Several articles in the Green Book dwell at length on the Pulwama terror attack by the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in February last year that triggered a fresh stand-off between India and Pakistan, the Indian Air Force strike on a JeM facility at Balakot and the retaliatory action by the Pakistan Air Force.The articles make references to other events such as the 1999 Kargil conflict and the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, which led to face-offs between the two countries, but make no mention of the role of Pakistan-based elements in triggering these events.Lt Gen (retired) Raza Muhammad Khan, a former Corps Commander and former president of NDU, in his article, “The prospects and panacea of peace in South Asia”, recommended the creation of a “domestic and international Kashmir Fund”, saying it could crowd sourced and the Pakistan government “should provide tax incentives for donations”.The federal government, in the absence of resources, “must encourage the provinces to allocate at least one percent of their NFC [National Finance Corporation] shares and earnings” and the Kashmir Fund should be controlled by the prime minister to prevent human rights violations in Kashmir, “informing the Indian masses and liberal intellectuals about the colossal cost…of enslaving nine million Kashmiris…and exposing the lies of the Indian government,” Khan wrote.Khan also recommends that Pakistan must make any dialogue with India “conditional with the reversal of all illegal measures taken by it in August, and inclusion of third party, preferably UN mediators in the process”.Journalist Farzana Shah, who focuses on defence issues, wrote in her article “National security & emerging geopolitical scenario: Post Article 370 obliteration”, that Pakistan should adopt am out of the box solution by taking “the war into non-kinetic domains” such as information and cyber warfare and electronic warfare.Pakistan’s establishments “must provide support to diplomatic efforts being done by government through operations in these two domains with focused goal of extracting authentic information from stakeholders in [Kashmir], most importantly from general public…Once information [is] gathered, FO [Foreign Office] must disseminate it with proper narrative of the state of Pakistan,” she wrote.“A single video clip or picture can change the perception of India, which it has built so painstakingly over the years. Pakistan needs to keep world attention on [Kashmir] and in order to do that communication links inside the [Kashmir] valley must be established…Pakistan’s response in these two domains will be purely non-kinetic, denying any involvement of arms. If executed properly and a local uprising occurs inside [Kashmir], it will make it extremely difficult for India to keep selling the terrorism card….”“Only a native uprising will be just and politically defendable for Pakistan on international forums. Even such an uprising will need support in the information domain,” she added.Lawmaker Mushahid Hussain, chairman of the parliamentary committee on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), wrote that Pakistan needs to pursue a multi-pronged strategy with regard to India and Kashmir with the “kind of clarity and commitment that Pakistani policy-makers demonstrated while building the Nuclear Bomb”.“Such a strategy should target Modi and his RSS Gang, and separate them from the broader Indian society and polity that opposes Modi, along with a united front of all Kashmiris and the linkup of the Kashmiri resistance with other insurgencies inside India,” he added.Former foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmad Khan, in his article “India-Pakistan relations in perspective”, wrote that “India’s continued ascendancy in Afghanistan will remain a danger of no less gravity to the already volatile security environment of this nuclearised region” than the Soviet presence in Cuba in the early 1960s.“Our main concern has always been to offset India’s superior conventional strength. The only credible response has to be a counter force which in the dreary India-Pakistan scenario could only be tactical warheads,” he added.The former diplomat wrote that US President Donald Trump’s offer during Prime Minister Imran Khan’s visit to Washington in July 2019 to play a “facilitating role in resolving the Kashmir issue” was the “best-ever position taken by an American president in recent history on India-Pakistan issues”.While continuing to support the Kashmiris’ “freedom movement”, Pakistan should resume the composite dialogue with India to build trust and develop mutually beneficial cooperation, he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-army-book-focuses-on-kashmir-bajwa-writes-on-art-370-balakot/story-Zn97e8GcYZ7E7tRJqSfjTN.html

Any Indian company wanting to supply at lower rates is welcome to contact ICMR or Ms Anu Nagar, JS Health Research(011-23736222),” ICMR tweeted. Udit Raj had tweeted a screenshot of a tweet on Sunday, which claimed that the Union government granted the tender for coronavirus testing kits to a Gujarat-based company at the price of Rs 4500 per kit when the same was being offered to it by 17 other companies at the price of Rs 500. “This is being circulated on social media. It is difficult to ascertain the truth,” Raj had posted. Several other Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, have also targeted the central government over the purchase of these testing kits.Congress leader Ahmed Patel said the antibody test kits were being bought for Rs 600 per piece by ICMR even though they were being imported for Rs 245 each. He tweeted that no one should profit at the expense of the poor in the midst of a pandemic.After that, Rahul Gandhi alleged some people were indulging in profiteering while supplying rapid test kits for Covid-19 to the government and demanded that the Prime Minister take strict immediate action against them.Their comments came after Delhi High Court directed that these kits must be sold at Rs 400. The court said that a profit of 61% on the original price was more than sufficient, especially when the country was going through an unprecedented medical crisis affecting people and the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-news-icmr-responds-to-congress-leader-udit-raj-s-tweet-on-covid-19-kit/story-vnIGB1ItDvXFr8HkYrXBKO.html

Preliminary investigation suggests it could be a case of secondary poisoning,” said Jayashree Naiding, divisional forest officer, Sibsagar.  “The primary target of the poisoning could be some other species, maybe stray dogs or wolves. But the vultures fed on the poisoned carcass and it resulted in the deaths,” she added.Thirteen other vultures were rescued from the area and sent to the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) near Kaziranga National Park for treatment and rehabilitation.Two of the surviving vultures, one Slender Billed and another White Backed, died during treatment. But vets at CWRC were able to treat the others - 7 Himalayan Griffons, 3 Slender Billed and 1 White Backed.“Secondary poisoning led to vulture deaths and remains a very critical issue. We are losing this threatened and critically endangered species, also known as nature’s cleaners,” said Samshul Ali, a veterinarian with Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) working at CWRC.“We tried our level best to stabilize the two seriously ill birds, but they succumbed to death in the early hours of Friday,” he added.The cured vultures were released by a WTI and CWRC team in presence of forest officials and conservationists.Last year in March, a similar incident took place in Sibsagar district wherein 39 vultures died after consuming poisoned meat at Panidihing.The CWRC team was able to rescue 30 vultures from that incident and release them to the wild. In April 2018, the team had rescued and released 10 poisoned vultures into the wild.While Himalayan Griffons are listed as near threatened, White Backed and Slender Billed vultures are listed as critically endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eleven-poisoned-vultures-cured-and-released-into-the-wild-in-assam/story-PhfhmVxCxhj93OM2ggC3GO.html

27-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Kerala wants economic package from Centre, evacuation of expatriates||Kerala wants the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus to be lifted in a staggered manner and has asked for an exclusive Covid-19 financial package from the Centre. The southern state, with a large expat population, also wants the central government to expedite their return. This was conveyed by the state chief secretary who represented the southern state at the chief ministers’ video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the country on Monday. A government spokesperson said that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan did not attend the video conference as he had spoken in great detail at the last such meeting with the prime minister. So, this time Tome Jose, Kerala’s chief secretary, attended the meeting and submitted the state’s proposals in writing.The economic condition in the state is precariously poised and it wants an economic package to overcome this difficult situation, according to the proposal submitted. Kerala has also asked the central government to hike its borrowing capacity from the present 3% to 5%. The state has been forced to cut its employees’ one-month salary because of the situation arising out of the coronavirus mess, it said.According to data released by Union health ministry on Monday morning, Kerala has 800 cases of coronavirus infections. These include 458 active infections and four deaths from Covid-19. Another issue raised at Monday’s video conference was the return of the state’s migrant workers from Middle-East Asian countries. The southern state, which has a huge migrant population working in the Middle-East, wants the Centre to expedite their evacuation. Among 18 lakh Keralites in the Persian Gulf, there are reports that at least 2 lakh, mainly blue collar workers, women and students, are ready to come back. Twelve hours after the Kerala government opened a website, on which all those who want to return from abroad would have to register, over a lakh of Kerala diaspora have registered expressing their desire to return, when the airports open, according to news agency IANS. These registrations are mostly from the various Middle East countries and among it, the maximum registrations are from the UAE, the agency added. Another proposal on Kerala’s wishlist is Centre’s help in sending stranded migrant workers back to their states. There are at least 3 lakh migrant workers who are living in 10,000 camps in different parts of the state. The state said the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had written to the PM twice to arrange non-stop trains for them but the state is yet to get a reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-kerala-wants-economic-package-from-centre-evacuation-of-expatriates/story-VayhEFbKBWdZKdS9XndOeO.html

So, the state’s chief secretary Tom Jose attended the meeting instead.In the meeting, the southern state sought a staggered removal of the lockdown and an exclusive Covid-19 package. Another issue Kerala raised was the return of the migrant population from the Middle-Eastern countries. It wants the Centre to expedite the evacuation.Reports had said West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee would only attend the meeting briefly and then ask a senior bureaucrat to represent her.But Mamata Banerjee, who was said to be upset she was not given a chance to speak, did attend the meeting.As the nationwide lockdown is about to end on May 3, PM Modi underlined the key challenge of balancing lives and livelihood in the country. The Prime Minister has already held three such meetings with chief ministers to discuss the situation in the country as it tackles a rising number of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pm-modi-s-covid-19-meeting-with-cms-kerala-and-bengal-strike-a-different-chord/story-PbIjSsFMQGnOH4kjEaewYM.html

Many Telugu-speaking people live there. No inter-state transport or movement of people is being allowed due to the ongoing lockdown restrictions. Besides, there is an inter-state check-post between Vellore and Chittoor. In this context, the abrupt construction of these concrete structures between the two states is strange, unusual, and also unwarranted,” Markandeyulu said.Vehicles carrying essential commodities are being allowed between the two states, despite the ongoing lockdown restrictions, he said.“Emergencies are bound to arise and inter-state movement of people has to be allowed. The border check-posts are in place for this purpose. If the highway is blocked permanently by constructing walls, it’d severely affect emergency transport services,” the Chittoor joint collector said.“For instance, the cancer hospital at Vellore caters to thousands of patients from AP, who go there for treatment every year. Similarly, the Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) is another favourite educational institution for Telugu-speaking students,” he added.Markandeyulu alleged that the Vellore district authorities didn’t consult with their Chittoor counterparts before taking ‘such a strange decision’ to erect the walls on the highway.“We’d take up this issue with the Vellore district authorities to ensure that the walls are taken down soon,” he added.Vellore district collector A Shanmuga Sundaram said that the authorities erected walls only in two places of the highway of the six borders that it shares with Chittoor district. “There are also a few other rural routes between the two states, which have been closed with boulders,” he said.“We’ve sealed these areas in a bid to prevent unauthorised movement of people amid the lockdown restrictions. However, both the transport of goods and the movement of people on emergency situations are allowed through alternative routes,” he added.Contrary to Chittoor district authorities’ claims, Sundaram clarified that the walls are makeshift and not permanent structures, and they would be demolished after the lockdown restrictions are lifted.Both TN and AP have reported a high number of Covid-19 positive cases. While TN has recorded 1,885 Covid-19 positive cases and 24 deaths till Monday morning, the corresponding figure in AP is 1,177 and 31, respectively. AP has reported 80 new Covid-19 positive cases over the last 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-tn-administration-builds-wall-at-andhra-border-to-prevent-inter-state-movement/story-BmxfO9TrqtZ5elADJSideM.html
27-04-2020||India||‘Need to strengthen economic activities, combat Covid-19’: PM Modi to CMs||India is focusing on a two-pronged strategy aimed at saving lives of its citizens while also restarting economic activities that have come to a virtual standstill due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told chief ministers in a video conference on Monday.Going forward, the country needs to gradually convert its red zones (districts with high number of Covid-19 infections) first into orange zones (districts with fewer cases) and, eventually, into green zones (districts with no infections), Modi said, according to a communication released by his office after the meeting.The green zones should be treated as sacred places, he said. “These places will contribute to economic activity, but collectively practice social distancing...Our focus will be how to expand the green zone.”Watch | PM Modi discusses lockdown exit strategy with CMs: All the key details According to a government assessment in mid-April, 170 districts in 20 states and five Union Territories (UTs) were identified as red zones. Additionally, there were 207 orange zones in the country, and the rest of India’s 730-odd districts were classified as green zones.“I would like that red zones and hot spots to show extra caution...we should make special teams in those areas,” Modi said, stressing that the task will be to keep the safe zones safe.All chief ministers, or their representatives, were present during the discussions on India’s response to the deadly infection and the way ahead, but just nine of them could speak due to time constraints.While Meghalaya said it will likely extend the lockdown announced to stop the spread of the contagion beyond May 3, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh felt curbs should be in place but left the decision to the Prime Minister, according to an official aware of the developments who did not want to be named.Others — Mizoram, Puducherry, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Bihar and Haryana — who got the chance to speak in the fourth such meeting between Modi and the chief ministers since March 20 supported the lifting of the lockdown.Modi announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown that came into place on March 25. Later, he extended the curbs till May 3 as Covid-19 cases continued rising in the country.“The lockdown has yielded positive results; the country has managed to save thousands of lives in the past one and a half months,” Modi told the chief ministers.In his address, Modi underlined the key challenge India was facing — that of balancing lives and livelihood. With economic activity coming to a halt, workers in the unorganised sector are staring at a bleak future and millions of jobs are on the line in the organised sector. At the same time, India’s front line health care staff are fighting a battle to slow the rate of the deadly disease.“..on the one hand, we are challenged by how to save lives...on the other, we also have to equally focus on the financial aspect of this....That’s why we have to strengthen economic activities... (and) increase our strength to combat the virus,” he said, according to the person quoted above.Modi said areas that are hard hit by the disease will also suffer the maximum impact on the economy front. The Prime Minister said with the restarting of conditional and limited economic activities from April 20, India’s challenges have increased too. “We have to analyse whether these (the relaxations announced by the government) led to new kind of challenges in these areas,” he said.Modi reiterated that social distancing --- of at least two yards --- was the need of the hour, and authorities cannot compromise on this aspect in the fight against the fast-spreading infection. He also advocated the need for wearing masks.“This should be made into a mantra for all: ‘do gaj doori (a distance of two yards)’. We have to keep spreading this message and it should be a life lesson for all. In the same way, masks or face covers should become a major part of our lives.”Modi stressed that there will be no discrimination against states on the basis of the number of infections and all will be equally treated. “With all humility, I want to tell CMs, if there is a spike in cases, your state will not be seen as guilty. If cases are low in your state, it will not be seen as great (achievement). We don’t want this sentiment...,” he said.Modi laid emphasis on the importance of technology, and suggested that people associated with universities can be roped in for devising ways to strengthen research and innovation. “We have to be brave and bring in reforms that touch the lives of common citizens,” he said.Modi also asked the health sector to be prepared to tackle seasonal diseases despite the Covid-19 outbreak.“In June, there are particular diseases associated with the heat. We have to get our systems ready and started for this. Some doctors have shut their clinics and we have to operationalise them. All services cannot stop for coronavirus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-strengthen-economic-activities-combat-covid-19-pm-modi-to-cms/story-dZfGxkQzyexnbNgg7pxfwJ.html

Both the brothers were remanded to CBI custody till April 29. The Wadhawan’s were arrested on Sunday afternoon from their bungalow at Mahabaleshwar in Satara for their alleged involvement in the Yes Bank fraud. According to the CBI FIR, between April and June 2018, Yes Bank invested ₹3,700 crores in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). In return, the Wadhawans allegedly “paid a kickback of ₹600 crores” to Kapoor and family members in the form of loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd.The duo, along with 23 other family members, was under home quarantine for 14 days since April 23, a senior official of the agency said.The CBI had obtained an arrest warrant against the two brothers after the family was caught holidaying in Mahabaleshwar. On April 18, the brothers had obtained a stay on the execution of an arrest warrant after their lawyer pleaded that the two should not be arrested amidst the coronavirus pandemic. The special court had granted them relief and stayed the warrant. The court order protected the two from arrest till May 5.However, the CBI, which was not heard while staying the warrant, approached the special court to lift the stay. Wadhwans’ interim relief was cancelled on Saturday (April 26) and a CBI team from Mumbai reached Satara on Saturday afternoon to arrest the two bothers, a senior officer of the agency said.The agency was assisted by the Satara police. They were brought to Mumbai by Sunday evening. The CBI had obtained a non-bailable warrant against the two on March 17 but the two men had not been arrested. On April 9, the Wadhawans, with a group of 23 people, flouted the lockdown and travelled to Mahabaleshwar from Khandala after a senior home department official gave them a free pass. They were put in quarantine once the news of their lockdown violation became public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yes-bank-fraud-kapil-and-dheeraj-wadhwan-sent-to-cbi-custody-till-may-4/story-926FJT94FKJa9jEywykqDO.html

He has appealed to the Delhi government to make staying arrangement for such people there itself. “Many who work in Delhi and stay in Haryana, are ‘corona-carriers’. I appeal to Delhi CM that staying arrangements of people who work in Delhi should be made in Delhi itself. They shouldn’t be issued passes to travel to Haryana as this is increasing Covid-19 cases here,” said the minister.Coronavirus cases in Haryana rose to 296 on Sunday after nine people, according to a state health department bulletin.Nuh with 57 novel coronavirus cases, followed by Gurgaon (51), Faridabad (45), Palwal (34), Sonipat (20) and Panchkula (18) are among the worst affected districts in Haryana.The minister said it has come to light that many of the coronavirus patients in the NCR districts including Sonipat, Gurgaon and Faridabad have been found to have contracted infection from the national capital and said daily movement of the employees working in Delhi to their residences in Haryana increases the risk of Covid-19 spread.“Haryana’s Chief Secretary Keshni Anand Arora on Sunday apprised her Delhi counterpart about the situation, saying this kind of movement has to be stopped and Delhi government should not issues passes to these employees for movement,” said Vij.According to the bulletin, 199 people have been discharged from hospitals after recovery from the infection, leaving 94 active cases in the state. “First, it was Tablighi Jamaat members who led to spike in number of cases in Haryana as 120 of them were found positive. Now, it is the movement of these employees from the national capital to their residences in Haryana which is increasing the threat of infection in the state,” Vij said.As on Sunday evening, the state has a recovery rate of 67.22 per cent, fatality rate of 1.01 per cent, COVID-19 positive rate (proportion of positive cases to total tests conducted) of 1.51 per cent, the doubling rate of cases is 18 days, while tests per million being conducted are 846, the bulletin said.In another development, MNCs, BPOs and IT enabled services (ITES) in Gurgaon may have to allow their employees to work from home till the end of July, said Gurgaon Metropolitan Development Authority CEO V S Kundu.Gurgaon, which is part of the National Capital Region, is known as the millennium city and is home to many BPOs, MNCs and technology giants, including Infosys, Genpact, Google and Microsoft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-home-minister-identifies-corona-carriers-seeks-delhi-govt-s-help/story-N5NFoxHzOlWpdbhvXrBprO.html

These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus,” CDC said on its website.The body also described a set of emergency warning signs that should warrant immediate medical attention, including trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, bluish lips or face.This list is not totally inclusive—others who have experienced COVID-19 reported an array of symptoms, according to CDC.The health agency clarified that a runny nose rarely occurs with Covid-19 and sneezing is still not a symptom of the virus.The World Health Organization (WHO) and CDC had first urged people to be on the lookout for fever, dry cough and breathing difficulties. After that people reported losing their sense of taste and smell and then came sporadic cases of gastrointestinal issues, such as diarrhoea.Purple or blue lesions on people’s feet and toes, most commonly appearing in children and young adults, dubbed “Covid toes” have also been seen.

As he emphasised the importance of strengthening the primary sectors, Deb assured people of subsidised loans under different government schemes.“Since the beginning, we have focused to strengthen the primary sectors. In this present situation, we set our target to reduce the deadline by one to two years to achieve self-sufficiency in primary sectors,” Deb said in a statement on Sunday. “We have decided this to make up the loss of economy caused due to lockdown. Our goal to make Tripura a model state is fixed and we need the cooperation of people for this,” the chief minister said.Regarding fisheries, he pointed out that fish seeds are produced in the state and Andhra Pradesh procures them from West Bengal worth of Rs 150 crore.“If Tripura can meet the demand of Andhra Pradesh, the same amount can be earned by us. Hence, the income of the fish cultivators will increase. So, I appeal to work hard to meet the target by 2020. Our government has already contacted the Andhra Pradesh in this issue,” said Deb. Similarly, he said, the government is planning to introduce “one district, one fruit or one crop” formula in the block level to increase the production of jackfruit, pineapple and oranges by three times. The state has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 250 crore in the rubber sector in the last two-and-a-half months. The state earns revenue of nearly R. 1500 crore from rubber per year. Deb also asked market committees to ensure social distancing norms are followed in markets along with other rules and also laid emphasis on engaging volunteers to help people maintain the guidelines. He also said thermal screening in the markets would be started soon. The government has allowed single shops and rural markets to open in the state.There are no cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the northeastern state after two infected people recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boost-primary-sectors-to-tackle-economic-loss-due-to-lockdown-tripura-cm/story-z2eZnhFOc5BGyhDR0lk1KL.html

We were told we will get medical check-ups but nothing of that sort has happened. Everyone—doctors and administration people—is being negligent. There are no proper arrangements for food and water,” a woman is overheard saying in the second video.Agra’s district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, according to news agency ANI, they held inspection at the quarantine centre at Sharda Group of Institutions after receiving complaints about food distribution.“The top officials of the team have been asked to look into the matter and fix the responsibilities. The team has been directed to identify the loopholes and be more careful in rendering services at the Covid-19 quarantine centre,” Prabhu N Singh said, according to ANI.The city of the Taj Mahal, which was praised for the ‘Agra model’ of containment, has reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh at 372. Congress leader Akhilesh Pratap Singh criticised the treatment meted out to the people in the video.“Loo at this role model city of Agra. It is now being addressed as ‘Wuhan’ of India where people are being treated like animals in quarantine centres. Whose role model is this city? You can very well guess…,” Singh tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/video-of-water-food-being-thrown-at-people-at-agra-quarantine-centre-goes-viral/story-nr0wANtejtqD4B9M9lNNMM.html
27-04-2020||India||Global military spending saw largest increase in decade in 2019; China, India in top 3: Study||Global military expenditure at 3.6 per cent saw its largest annual spike in a decade in 2019 with China and India being the second- and third-largest spenders after the US, a Stockholm-based think-tank said on Monday, the first time the two Asian giants were among the top three countries spending more on armaments.The total global military expenditure rose to USD 1,917 billion in 2019, representing an annual growth of 3.6 per cent compared to 2018, according to a new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).The 3.6 per cent spike it said was the largest spending growth since 2010.While the US drove the global growth, China and India -- the top Asian military spenders -- were respectively the second- and third-largest military spenders in the world, the report said.China’s military expenditure reached USD 261 billion in 2019, a 5.1 per cent increase compared to 2018, while that of India grew by 6.8 per cent to USD 71.1 billion, it said.“India’s tensions and rivalry with both Pakistan and China are among the major drivers for its increased military spending,” said Siemon T Wezeman, SIPRI Senior Researcher.The total global military expenditure in 2019 represents an increase of 3.6 per cent from 2018 and the largest annual growth in spending since 2010, it said.The five largest spenders, which accounted for 62 per cent of the total expenditure, were the US, China, India, Russia and Saudi Arabia, the report said, adding that this is the first time that two Asian states have featured among the top three military spenders.In addition to China and India, Japan (USD 47.6 billion) and South Korea (USD 43.9 billion) were the largest military spenders in Asia and Oceania. Military expenditure in the region has risen every year since at least 1989.The report said that the military spending by the US grew by 5.3 per cent to a total of USD 732 billion in 2019 and accounted for 38 per cent of global military spending.The increase in US spending in 2019 alone was equivalent to the entirety of Germany’s military expenditure for that year.“The recent growth in US military spending is largely based on a perceived return to competition between the great powers,” said Pieter D Wezeman, Senior Researcher at SIPRI.The global military spending in 2019 represented 2.2 per cent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), which equates to approximately USD 249 per person.“Global military expenditure was 7.2 per cent higher in 2019 than it was in 2010, showing a trend that military spending growth has accelerated in recent years,” said Dr Nan Tian, SIPRI Researcher.“This is the highest level of spending since the 2008 global financial crisis and probably represents a peak in expenditure,” the researcher said.In Europe, Germany’s military spending rose by 10 per cent in 2019, to USD 49.3 billion, the largest increase in spending among the top 15 military spenders in 2019.“The growth in German military spending can partly be explained by the perception of an increased threat from Russia, shared by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states. At the same time, however, military spending by France and the United Kingdom remained relatively stable,” said Diego Lopes da Silva, Researcher at SIPRI.In 2019, Russia was the fourth-largest spender in the world and increased its military expenditure by 4.5 per cent to USD 65.1 billion.“At 3.9 per cent of its GDP, Russia’s military spending burden was among the highest in Europe in 2019,” said Alexandra Kuimova, Researcher at SIPRI.The average military spending burden was 1.4 per cent of the GDP for countries in the Americas, 1.6 per cent for Africa, 1.7 per cent for Asia and Oceania and for Europe, and 4.5 per cent for the Middle East (in countries for which data is available).SIPRI said that data from previous global economic downturns suggests that the economic crisis resulting from the coronavirus pandemic will probably disrupt the future military spending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-military-spending-saw-largest-increase-in-decade-in-2019-china-india-in-top-3-study/story-VYMH0qLJ0T5IlF5CTYwEoO.html
27-04-2020||India||VC with PM: Maha CM expected to demand for special trains for migrants||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is likely to demand special travel arrangements for over 5.7 lakh stranded migrant workers in the state when Prime Minister Narendra Modi chairs a crucial meet with CMs of all the states and union territories via videoconference on Monday morning. The PM is likely to seek key inputs from various states in a bid to compile a comprehensive plan regarding the lifting from the second phase of the nationwide restrictions, which were imposed on April 15 after the initial 21 days ended and extended it for another 19 days till May 3, to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Maharashtra is expected to extend the lockdown, especially in the urban areas, beyond May 3, and CM Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar have written to the central government for arranging special trains for the migrant workers’ safe passage to their respective native places, including Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar and Madhya Pradesh (MP). Thackeray is also likely to draw the PM’s attention to the non-payment of central funds, as the state, like many others, is yet to receive them.The state has lodged 5.7 lakh migrant workers in 4,620 shelter camps in various districts, especially near the interstate borders, since the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 25. Most of the migrant workers are anxious to return to their respective states, despite the state government making adequate arrangements for their food, shelter, and health services. In some camps, the migrants have displayed violent behaviour for not being allowed to go back to their native places, according to the reports received by the state government.Pawar wrote to Union Minister of Railways Piyush Goyal last week, expressing his concerns over a backlash if the special trains are not arranged for the migrants. Pawar’s fears are likely to prompt CM Thackeray to demand special travel arrangements for over 5.7 lakh stranded migrant workers during the videoconference with the PM.“The stranded migrant workers belong to at least 10 states, including UP, MP, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, and Rajasthan, and have become restless and homesick after living in these camps since the lockdown restrictions were imposed. It has become impossible to keep them cooped up in the camps after the second phase of the nationwide lockdown ends on May 3. The CM is expected to raise this issue during the meeting with the PM,” said a senior state government official.Thackeray is also likely to raise the demand for the central assistance, clarity on the central policy on the personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and their adequate supply to the state, which tops the list for both the maximum number of Covid-19 positive cases and deaths, and also suggest the extension of the lockdown in the hotspots beyond May 3.There has been a spike in the number of Covid-19 positive cases in the state over the past few days. On Saturday, 811 new cases were reported --- the highest single-day rise – after April 23 when 778 fresh cases were recorded.On Sunday, Maharashtra crossed the mark of 8,000 Covid-19 positive cases, a day after crossing 7,000 and just two days after recording 6,000.Earlier, the state had taken 30 days to cross the first 1,000-case mark on April 7, and then it doubled within six days on April 13.On Sunday, Maharashtra reported 440 new Covid-19 positive cases and 19 fresh deaths, taking the total count to 8,068 cases and 342 fatalities. Mumbai tops the state chart with 5,407 Covid-19 positive cases and 204 deaths to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vc-with-pm-maha-cm-expected-to-demand-for-special-trains-for-migrants/story-l47OZGMBXN2Dos7KKVWK0K.html

27-04-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 tally rises to 27,892, death toll at 872||India on Monday reported nearly 600 fewer cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) than Sunday even as the country’s infection tally went up to 27,892, the Union health ministry’s data showed.There were 1,396 new cases of Covid-19 and 48 deaths in the last 24 hours as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to interact with chief ministers in a video conference that is expected to focus on the next move in India’s battle plan against Covid-19.According to the Union health ministry dashboard at 8am, there are 20,835 active Covid-19 cases and 381 more people, or 6,184 so far, have been cured or discharged from hospitals in the last 24 hours. The country’s death toll so far is 872.The Prime Minister had in his Sunday’s Mann ki Baat episode hailed citizens for going beyond their call of duty and leading the battle against the disease but also warned against any complacency over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has also said India’s strategy to manage the disease won’t change and it will “aggressively look within the community for those who have been infected. Look for them, test them, isolate them, and treat them”.Also read: India should open up nowField tests to determine the reliability of the new, quick-result blood tests bought by India have been inconclusive, according to an official from India’s top medical research body.“The experts are working to find out the cause of such huge variations in test results, and until they reach any conclusion, it is advised to the states to not use rapid test kits for Covid-19 testing,” an Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) official has said.The development deals a blow to plans of many states to ramp up testing by deploying the kits that were imported less than a fortnight ago. Their use was halted within a couple of days after they returned wildly varying results, often giving false negatives.Rapid test kits were being seen as crucial in efforts to speed up Covid-19 testing, which at present is done through the RT-PCR mechanism that takes about 24-48 hours to process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-rises-to-27-892-death-toll-at-872/story-3ZNVJ3GFlKIHspHKVgkOzI.html

We are trying to ascertain the health status of all residents of Indore. For this, we are going to conduct screening of every citizen of Indore,” he said.Asked about the possibility of lifting curfew or lockdown in Indore after May 3, Chouhan said a suitable decision would be taken in the interest of the city after looking at the situation.“A decision to lift the lockdown can be taken when the risk of coronavirus infection in Indore starts decreasing, when the number of infected persons starts coming down and the situation seems to be under control,” the chief minister said.He also said that the reason for high death rate in the city is that people who came to Indore from abroad hid information about their foreign travel due to lack of awareness, insecurity and fear. These people infected others unknowingly, and the epidemic spread in the city, he said.“A large number of patients among those who succumbed to coronavirus had other serious illnesses. Such patients were brought late to hospital,” said Chouhan.Indore, having a population of more than 30 lakh, has emerged as a coronavirus hotspot, not just in the state but in the entire country. As many as 31 new Covid-19 cases were reported in Indore on Sunday, taking the total number of positive cases in the district to 1,207.News agency ANI quoted Indore’s Chief Medical and Health Officer Praveen Jadia as saying that 60 deaths have been reported in the district due to the virus. Indore’s Covid-19 death rate of 4.85 per cent is higher than the national average, according to data analysis.According to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Madhya Pradesh has 2,096 COVID-19 cases, including 210 cured/discharged/migrated and 99 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhilwara-model-to-help-indore-win-covid-19-war-says-chief-minister-shivraj-chouhan/story-JR8wJTRfwZ6XtZeu3ZdJMJ.html

He said only 127 districts in the country have Covid-19 hotspots or red zones.“In the last one week, there are 66 districts from where no case has been reported and 56 districts from where no case reported in the past 14 days,” he said.The Union health minister said this indicated that the disease has been contained largely to hotspots.The states have said there should be a continued ban on mass gatherings; educational institutions must remain closed; interstate transport prohibited, except in cases of enabling the movement of migrant workers, and social distancing must be strictly observed.However, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal indicated that ending the lockdown will not be easy and a top medical expert advising the Delhi government arguing for the extension of the lockdown beyond May 3.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope has also said the state will like to continue with the lockdown in containment zones in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Thane – the major hubs of the disease.The states are also expected to demand a financial package from the Centre, and an amendment to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act.

I urge all my Muslim brothers to continue to cooperate with the government. Do not gather for mass prayers at mosques or any other place. Stay at home and perform prayers inside,” he said.As the coronavirus cases continue to rise in Maharashtra, particularly in Mumbai and Pune region, the state is deliberating extending the lockdown put in place to stop the spread of Covid-19 for another 15 days after May 3. A decision on the issue is expected after Monday’s meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief ministers. Thackeray said the state has succeeded in slowing down the spread of the coronavirus disease because of the lockdown and he will review the situation before making any decision about relaxations. “To an extent, the situation in the state is under control if compared with other countries where cases are multiplying on a daily basis. This has become possible because of lockdown,” the chief minister said.He said the state government is considering to give further relaxations after May 3 but the decision is yet to be taken.“I will review and decide what more relaxations can be given after May 3. But one thing is for sure, we will have to avoid crowding,” Thackeray said indicating that restrictions are likely to continue in some areas of the state even after May 3 when the nationwide lockdown is going to end.Maharashtra had registered 811 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, the highest single-day spike, taking the state’s tally to 7628 cases.

Further contact tracing is on, they said.Patients who had come for chemotherapy on Saturday at the daycare facility along with healthcare staff at the hospital who had come in contact with her have been advised self-quarantine.Besides, at least six more staffers, including two from the record section, a lab attendant and the personal assistant of a faculty at the Cardio-Neuro Centre of AIIMS have also tested positive recently, the sources said.Over 70 people from various departments in AIIMS have been advised self-quarantine, they said.On Wednesday, a male nurse working in the gastroenterology department of AIIMS was found positive for COVID-19, following which around 40 healthcare staff, including doctors and nurses working in the department, were advised self-quarantine. However, all the staff who had come in contact with the male nurse have tested negative and the department is fully functional, a doctor said.Last week, two female nurses, one from the cardiology department and one posted in the Trauma Centre of AIIMS had also tested positive for coronavirus. All those who came in contact with these two nurses have been asked to go into self-quarantine.The Trauma Centre nurse’s child and husband had also tested positive for the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guard-at-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-s-osd-office-tests-covid-19-ve-report/story-nvy6q7Twb48fWe3SXpVMPK.html

SII has collaborated with scientists at Oxford University for a malaria vaccine project in the past and can say with certainty that they are some of the best scientists, he added. “We expect the (COVID-19) vaccine to be out in the market by September - October, only if the trials are successful with the requisite safety and assured efficacy. We will be starting trials in India for this vaccine hopefully over the next 2-3 weeks’ time,” Poonawalla said. SII will be manufacturing the vaccine in anticipation of clinical trials succeeding by September - October in the UK, he added. “Following that, we have undertaken the decision to initiate manufacturing at our own risk. The decision has been solely taken to have a jump-start on manufacturing, to have enough doses available, if the clinical trials prove successful,” Poonawalla said.  The company plans to initiate the trials in India for the vaccine with necessary regulatory approvals, which are underway presently. “Keeping the current situation in mind, we have funded this endeavour at a personal capacity and hopefully will be able to enlist the support of other partners to further scale-up the vaccine production,” Poonawalla said. The vaccines will be manufactured at the company’s facility in Pune. Building a new facility for COVID-19 vaccine would have taken around 2-3 years, he added. The Indian regulatory authorities are working with the company to ensure smooth procedural functioning. “We are in touch with the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and ICMR,” Poonawalla said. The company had earlier said it will not patent any COVID-19 vaccine which it develops. Asked about the decision, Poonawalla reiterated, “We will not patent Serum’s vaccine for COVID-19 and will make it available for all to produce and sell, not just in India but across the world.” Whosoever makes and develops the vaccine will need multiple partners to manufacture the vaccine, he added. “I hope that whichever company develops the vaccine does not get it patented and makes it available based on royalties or a commercial understanding to as many manufacturers across the world to make billions of dosages at a fast pace,” Poonawalla said. Death toll due to COVID-19 has crossed 200,000 globally, with the number of infections at over 2.8 million. In India, the coronavirus has claimed over 800 lives and the number of cases has crossed the 26,000-mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-pune-s-serum-institute-to-start-producing-oxford-vaccine-in-3-weeks/story-3ZbMxhbPm9Gga97hpphWfO.html

Is it possible for us to convert it into an opportunity for India.” Referring to the economic package announced by Japan for its businesses exiting China, Gadkari said, “I feel that we should think on that and we will concentrate on it. We will open the Indian scenario for that. We will give the clearances and everything to them and attract foreign investment.” Asked if India can take any action against China incase it is found to have deliberately “suppressed” information on coronavirus, the minister said this was a sensitive subject related with the Ministry of External Affairs and the prime minister, and therefore it will not be appropriate for him to comment on it.Gadkari said all government departments, particularly the Finance Ministry as well as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), are formulating policies to win the “economic war” post the Covid-19 pandemic and fulfil the prime minister’s dream of making India a USD 5 trillion economy. “At the same time, we can make infrastructure of Rs 100 lakh crore,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-should-look-to-convert-world-s-hatred-for-china-into-economic-opportunity-nitin-gadkari/story-dYbh3qAargLbBMlJ8XR8wK.html

First, the baby was cured of the deadly disease. Second, the mother managed to keep herself infection-free despite staying with the child in hospital for two weeks, breastfeeding and cleaning him regularly. Doctors said the child’s natural immunity, boosted by breastfeeding, helped him win the battle. Except for an initial dose of paracetamol for fever, no medicine was given to the baby, they said. Doctors and officials greeted the mother with cheers and applause, hailing her as a winner, as she stepped out of the Baba Raghav Das Medical College hospital’s isolation ward with the child in her lap on Sunday. Gorakhpur district magistrate K Vijyendra Pandian, divisional commissioner Jayant Narlikar and BRD Medical College principal Dr Ganesh Kumar were among those who hailed the woman’s courage in winning the Covid-19 battle for the baby and keeping herself safe by avoiding infection despite regularly breastfeeding the child. The baby belongs to the family of a 25-year-old Basti grocer, who was the first patient from UP to die of coronavirus on March 30. Thirteen contacts of the grocer, including the baby, tested positive. The mother and baby were tested twice on arrival in hospital on April 12. The woman tested negative while the infant was found asymptomatic but Covid-19 positive. He had no serious complications, except fever. “The baby tested positive while the mother was negative when they came to hospital on April 12. The major challenge before the doctors was to cure the baby while ensuring that the mother does not contract the infection. Breastfeeding posed a high risk of infection to her. Thankfully, she remains (Covid-19) negative as she took every preventive measures,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asymptomatic-three-month-old-survives-covid-mother-tests-ve/story-jjutxFP6lB1hHm4iEskFdN.html
27-04-2020||India||Govt tells states to not use rapid kits for now||Field tests to determine the reliability of the new, quick-result blood tests bought by India have been inconclusive, according to an official from India’s top medical research body who said that these kits should not be used to detect whether a person has had a Covid-19 infection for now. The development deals a blow to plans of many states to ramp up testing by deploying the kits that were imported less than a fortnight ago. Their use was halted within a couple of days after they returned wildly varying results, often giving false negatives. “The use of rapid test kits continues to remain prohibited as the result of field tests has been inconclusive. The experts are working to find out the cause of such huge variations in test results, and until they reach any conclusion, it is advised to the states to not use rapid test kits for Covid-19 testing,” said an Indian Council for Medical Research official, requesting anonymity.“Once our experts reach a conclusion, we will come out with a fresh advisory on its use, until then the status quo remains,” the official added.On April 16, the ICMR received a consignment of 550,000 of these test kits from two companies in China. On April 21, the ICMR put on hold the use of rapid testing kits after complains from several states. The first came from West Bengal, which said the kits returned ‘inconclusive results’. Soon, Rajasthan found that patients already confirmed through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were reported as negative by the rapid test kits.“After one state complained of faulty results, we checked with three other states and they had similar feedback to share. There was a variation between 6% and 71% in the test results...this was abnormal, and needed to be investigated further. So, we have decided to halt the rapid testing for a day,” Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, chief, epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR, had said while asking states to discontinue its use earlier this week. After India halted its use, both the Chinese companies that exported the kits issued a statement saying their testing kits were of optimum quality and they would cooperate with the Indian authorities to get to the cause behind the inaccurate test results. “…we will fully cooperate with the ICMR review and any re-testing arrangements. Safety and product quality are our highest priorities…,” said Wondfo in a statement on Saturday.Experts say it is high time India stops relying on China for its essential medical supplies. “...we should encourage Indian manufacturers by protecting their investments and creating a market. India has the capability ... ,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of virology department, CMC Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-tells-states-to-not-use-rapid-kits-for-now/story-XJErQ7kXCTIZkvzq3KrF2I.html
27-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: India should open up now||Hindustan Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter in Delhi and several state capitals, that on Monday, in their third video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a month, at least some chief ministers are going to recommend that the lockdown be lifted on May 3, when it comes to an end. This is very different from how all chief ministers felt ahead of April 14, when the lockdown, enforced to slow the spread of Covid-19, was originally supposed to end — there was unanimity that it be extended.That unanimity is likely to be missing on Monday.The chairman of the Delhi government’s Covid-19 committee, Dr SK Sarin, has recommended extending the lockdown in the city-state till mid-May; Telangana has already extended it till May 7; and a few other states are reported to be thinking of an extension.The easy option would be to just continue with the lockdown, but it is also an option that should not be exercised easily — the Indian economy would have been mostly inactive for 40 days by the time the lockdown ends on May 3. That’s already done enough damage — 2020 (calendar year) and 2020-21 (financial year) will be a year of recession in India, irrespective of how optimistic the International Monetary Fund or the Indian government choose to be.The country is better prepared on almost every front — testing, protective equipment, hospitals — than it was on March 25, when the first lockdown kicked in, and on April 14, but it isn’t clear whether this is enough should the number of cases rise when the lockdown ends. To use phrases from epidemiology that have now entered popular lexicon, the curve has been flattened, the peak has been pushed but whether this will prevent the health system from being overwhelmed when India reopens is anybody’s guess.Which is what makes the decision to be taken by the chief ministers and, most importantly, the Prime Minister a very difficult one. A calibrated and restricted lifting of lockdown curbs to permit manufacturing in safe areas has not taken off the way it was expected to — in one part because of the states mandating stringent norms on top of the guidelines announced by the home ministry, and in other part because of collateral issues such as lack of labour or broken supply chains. That the Centre wants an opening up is clear from the home ministry’s notification, over the weekend, on shops, although the stuttering way in which it went about this suggests that it still entertains some doubts about opening up.It shouldn’t.Testing is up — Hindustan Times reported last week that India will be carrying out up to 50,000 tests a day by the end of the month — and the protocols for screening, quarantining, and treatment are established (as well as they can be in the absence of a cure). Globally, 97% of the infections remain mild, according to worldometers.info, and in India, as many as 69% of the infected (till last week) are asymptomatic.Which is why the government should now start toting up the economic costs.People will lose jobs (some already have); many small businesses will go under; many big businesses will default on debt; consumption demand could take months to recover, as will supply chains; global merchandise trade will suffer; and all of this, and everything else that happens, will do so with the fear of a second wave looming large.The damage to the economy calls for a relief and stimulus package — one that is already long-overdue — but also a lifting of the lockdown, at least in districts with few cases or none at all.This should be accompanied by a proactive and aggressive containment protocol — neighbourhoods, cities, districts, even states where the infection rate seems to be accelerating should be locked down. And if things really spiral out of control, a national lockdown can be considered, but for now, the need is to open up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-should-open-up-now/story-SGjlQqph9l42Q4jogsx9QO.html

27-04-2020||India||Unseasonal rains damage crops as farmers battle multiple setbacks||Heavy unseasonal rains have caused damage to standing crops in a setback to farmers bracing for the busy agricultural season amid the coronavirus disease pandemic and lockdown that have already reduced the availability of farm labour and transport of their produce in parts of India.An exact estimate of the damage caused by the rain in six states – Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal --- would be available only after surveys are conducted, government officials said, expressing concern that the damage could result in less-than-expected procurement of foodgrains.Food Corporation of India had expected to procure 35 million tonnes of foodgrains from the rabi season harvest, compared to 34 million tonnes last year because of an anticipated bumper crop. It may now have to revise its procurement estimate. According to officials, the worst hit appear to be the food bowl states of Punjab and Haryana, where the harvest season was in full swing when heavy rains pounded the ripe standing wheat crop.In Bihar and West Bengal, the rain has damaged the maize crop and the soon-to-be harvested litchi and mango crops. “Around 10-15% of the wheat crop has been damaged in Seemanchal, Kosi and north Bihar,” a state government official said.Moisture worsens the quality of wheat and maize, which could mean lower price sat the wholesale markets and delays in procurement.“Moisture more than permissible limits of 12% leads to delay in procurement as the crop has to be dried first. It damages the grain, leading to its discolouration,” said Punjab’s principal secretary( food and civil supplies) KAP Sinha.Sinha said procurement had to be stalled in two districts – Moga and Ferozpur -- because the discolouration exceeded permissible limits. In neighbouring Haryana, crop loss has been reported from districts such as Karnal, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar and Kaithal, leading to the government stopping the procurement on Sunday, officials said.“Like several other farmers, I could not sell my produce as there were no buyers due to rains,” said wheat farmer Raghubir Singh of Karnal district. Officials said the procurement had been tardy because no arrangements had been made to protect the grains from rain.Mukesh Tiwari, a farmer from Bundelkhand’s Dhana village in Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh, said the traders were not offering more than Rs 1,900 to Rs 2,100 for sharbati (sweet) wheat as against the 2019 price of Rs 2,700 per quintal because of discolouration caused by the rains. “Even the government refused to buy, citing the poor quality of wheat,” he said.Farmer Devaki Nandan Pandey of Janakpur village in Sagar district said he had not even visited any government procurement market because he knew they would reject the wheat he had grown because of the moisture content. “This year’s work is gone. I don’t know the price I will get for the wheat now,” said Mohan Lal Nagda, a farmer from Rewali village in Neemuch district of southern MP. Sanjeev Singh, director of MP’s directorate of farmer welfare and agriculture, said: “We are collecting the information from the entire state about the impact of unseasonal rains on wheat and procurement. It’s only after the reports {come in} that I will be able to make any comment.”Most states have delayed procurement of foodgrains because of the lockdown that started on March 25. Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh started procurement on April 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unseasonal-rains-damage-crops-as-farmers-battle-multiple-setbacks/story-XQZx6Qshzv0tKRJIaU5KML.html
27-04-2020||India||Tree loss to be reimbursed with plantations in Dibang Valley||For the 270,000 trees that will be felled to make way for the 3,097 megawatt Etalin hydropower project in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley, compensatory plantations will be raised in 25 different fragmented lots of land n the Valley’s Anini town, according to the project proposal. The rest will be taken up on land that’s over 400 kilometres away in Tawang district.Under the Forest Conservation Act 1980, every time forest land is diverted for non-forest purposes such as mining or industry, the project developer is supposed to identify non-forest land of an equal area and also pay for planting forests over this, or when that is not available, on twice the area of degraded forest land. The project is being developed by—M/s Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture of Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited with Jindal Power Limited (JPL). The total cost of the project is approximately Rs 25,296.95 crores according to the fact sheet.The proposed project, which is yet to get approval from the environment ministry’s forest advisory committee (FAC), is located in “subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest and subtropical rain forests” and is home to outstanding biodiversity, according to the FAC’s own documents. Environmentalists and local residents are now concerned that the same ecological value cannot be recreated through artificial plantations in fragmented patches of land.Compensatory afforestation for the project has been proposed over 1,074.329 hectares at a cost of Rs 19.6 crores, according to an FAC factsheet on the project reviewed by Hindustan Times .“So far in India we haven’t seen compensatory afforestation plots providing ecosystem and biodiversity services. There is also a concern that in many places monocultures have sprung up in the name of afforestation. There is no land to do such large-scale plantations either, so often public or forest lands are used. The spirit of compensatory afforestation is missing,” said NH Ravindranath, climate and forestry expert at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.He added that the acreage earmarked for the afforestation appears too small for plantations of the scale required to compensate for the trees to be felled to make for the Etalin project. “The forests that will be diverted appear to be dense as they have thousands of trees over 60 cm in girth. A lot may be lost,” he added.FAC’s factsheet, dated April 21, states that around 141,854 trees that are above 60 cm in girth which will have to be cleared.Local people of the Idu Mishmi community are concerned about the loss of native forests and wildlife and say they may end up losing grazing land for compensatory afforestation too.“There are two dams {proposed} in this region—the Dibang multipurpose project and the Etalin hydropower project -- which will together submerge a very large area. Most families in the project affected area don’t want to speak against the project because they want to get compensation for their land,” Aito Miwu, a resident of Anini, said over the phone“People in other parts of Dibang valley are not consulted and not allowed to speak up about the ecological loss in public hearings. The vegetation and biodiversity through compensatory afforestation cannot be the same. I have seen them planting pine which has no fertiliser value and nothing grows underneath pine trees,” he said.“These patches of land selected by the government are Mithun grazing land. One of the patches is in our village and none of us has been consulted about converting common grazing land. Many villages will oppose this,” he added.There is no mention in the FAC factsheet whether locals have been consulted on carrying out compensatory afforestation on grazing lands.“The FAC’s investigations have taken at face value the process of compensatory afforestation in a landscape like Arunachal Pradesh. This project will not only submerge old growth forests on mountain slopes, the compensatory afforestation measures proposed will governmentalize forest areas that are socially and economically accessible to communities as village forest reserves.Why have they not assessed how community access will be affected by these measures,” said Manju Menon, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research.According to FAC’s factsheet, the project falls under the richest biogeographical province of the Himalayan zone and under one of the mega biodiversity hotspots of the world. The proposed project location falls at the junction of the Paleoarctic, Indo-Chinese, and Indo-Malayan biogeographic regions, having luxuriant forests and a plethora of flora and fauna. It is also a “vital tiger area.”One of the FAC’s members, responding to a query from HT, said over the phone: “I am only a member. It will not be appropriate for me to comment on this matter. The FAC minutes will be published soon.” FAC discussed the issue of forest clearance to the project on April 23, but a decision hasn’t yet been taken, according to FAC members. “We had a long discussion and all views of members have been taken on record. Most members had a favourable view because its a clean energy project, so did the subcommittee that visited the site,” said FAC member. Both FAC members requested anonymity. A sub-committee of the FAC has recommended in their report dated April 21 that Etalin Hydroelectric Project of 3097 MW be allowed with a condition that the developer deposit money for wildlife conservation in the area.“We have been eagerly waiting for this clearance which is a must for grant of forest clearance for the project. The proposal for grant of FC to Etalin project was submitted to environment ministry in 2014. The proposal has since been discussed in FAC a couple of times. In the EAC meeting scheduled to be held on April 23, the report and recommendations of sub-committee of FAC will be discussed for final recommendations on grant of FC to the project. We are hopeful that FAC will finally be recommending the proposal for grant of FC,” Bharat Rohra, MD & CEO, Jindal Power Limited had said on April 22 responding to HT’s queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tree-loss-to-be-reimbursed-with-plantations-in-dibang-valley/story-I3EldUENtAlPTL9x9WXooJ.html
27-04-2020||India||IRS officers pitch 40% tax rate plus cess, under probe||The government on Sunday rejected an “ill-conceived” suggestions by a group of Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers to increase the top income tax rate to 40%, impose a levy on the so-called super-rich tax and a 4% Covid-19 relief cess to rebuild the nation’s economy, reeling under the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown.The suggestions were made in a report titled Fiscal Options & Response to Covid-19 Epidemic (FORCE) and released to the media on the IRS Association’s Twitter handle and website. The government deemed it an “irresponsible act” by a few officers, said two finance ministry officials with direct knowledge of the development. “A departmental enquiry will be initiated against people responsible for creating panic among the public by uploading this unauthorised report on social media that could have a serious consequence for both the economy and the market. Thankfully, the market was closed,” one of the officials said. ALSO WATCH | Covid-19: Union minister denies plans to reduce pensionsThe two officials, who both requested anonymity, said the government had “summarily” dismissed the suggestions which it judged as ill-conceived.Some of the key recommendations of the FORCE report were raising the income-tax rate up to 40% from 30% for those with income of ~1 core per year, reimposing a wealth tax on those with a net wealth of ~5 crore, deemed to be super-rich, and levy of a one-time Covid-19 relief cess of 4% on those with a taxable income of ~10 lakh and above.“The proposals are against the government’s existing policy on taxation,” a second official said.In the budget this year, the government offered individuals the option of paying lower income-tax rates provided they forgo tax exemptions. It had earlier reduced corporate tax rates drastically in September, sacrificing ~1.45 lakh crore in revenue. Companies were given the choice of opting for a lower corporate tax rate of 22% (15% for newly incorporated companies) provided they didn’t seek exemptions. Those seeking exemptions would pay income tax at the rate of 30% (25% for new entities).While forwarding the FORCE report, the IRS Association on April 23 wrote to the chairman and members of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) that it had been prepared jointly by a group of 50 IRS officers. “Working from home, they have come together to leverage their combined knowledge, experiences, and commitment to building a healthy, strong and prosperous India,” the letter that was posted on its Twitter handle late on Saturday said.One executive functionary of the association, requesting anonymity, said on Sunday that this was “only recommendatory in nature”.On Sunday evening, the association tweeted, “The paper FORCE by 50 young IRS officers suggesting policy measures had been forwarded by IRSA to CBDT for consideration. It does not purport to represent the official views of the entire IRS, or the IT Dept.”A CBDT spokesperson said the board always sought direct feedback from its field formations to improve its systems and processes, but does not entertain unsolicited suggestions from the association.“Neither the IRS Association nor any group of officers, mentioned in the said report, were ever asked by the government to give any report on the subject,” the first official said.It is, on the face of it, an act of indiscipline and violation of conduct rules which specifically prohibit officers to go to media with their personal views on official matters without taking prior sanction or permission of the government, the official said.“The Chairman, CBDT, has been directed to seek explanation from these officers for writing such ‘ill-conceived views’ in public without having any authority to do so,” he said.The official added: “People should completely disregard such reports. In fact, the finance ministry is doing its best to provide relief and liquidity into the system and ease the lives of people in these trying times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/irs-officers-pitch-40-tax-rate-plus-cess-under-probe/story-dF46ZMuaHbolGIe9ZOm2iN.html
27-04-2020||India||India leading fight, must keep guard up, says PM Modi||While warning against any complacency over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday hailed citizens for going beyond their call of duty and leading the battle against the disease as he underlined that the health crisis will bring about radical changes in the way people live their lives and work.In his Mann ki Baat address, the Prime Minister emphasised that masks will now become an indispensable tool that everyone must use and called for restraint during festivals, including the ongoing Ramzan, and hoped that by Eid, the world would be rid of the pandemic.The PM also strongly defended India’s decision to provide medical supply to other countries at this time, in what appeared to be a reference to the export of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and other drugs, and underscored how India’s traditional strengths – from yoga to ayurveda – were important pillars in building immunity against the disease.While delivering the radio address on Sunday morning, PM Modi also praised the role of state governments and all other official agencies, and once again underscored the importance of “corona warriors” in the efforts to combat the disease. The remarks came a day before the PM’s meeting with chief ministers to decide on India’s strategy in dealing with the pandemic. India is under lockdown till May 3 to break the chain of infections even as top government officials weigh the option of easing some restrictions to kick-start some economic activity.Sunday marked the second time the PM spoke almost entirely on the pandemic in his monthly radio interaction; he has also directly addressed the nation four other times on the issue.The PM began his address by speaking about the role of the citizens in the national effort against Covid-19. “In India, it is the people who are fighting the Corona; it is you who are putting up a fight. Along with the people, the government and the administration are fighting as well.”He said that in the future, when the ways of battling the pandemic were studied, India’s model of a people-driven fight would find a prominent place. Tracing the instances of this effort, the PM spoke of, among others, farmers working in the field to ensure food security; citizens arranging food and ration for the poor; home owners waiving off rents; individuals donating to the PM-Cares fund; and construction workers whitewashing school buildings where they are quarantined. This, he said, tied in with the “altruistic bent of mind” increasingly visible in society.This entire effort, the PM said, will lead to fundamental changes, both at the individual and organisational level. “Our businesses, offices, educational institutions, our medical sector are rapidly advancing towards new operational changes.” There were other positive changes in work culture, daily habits, and lifestyles. In particular, the PM pointed to two important changes, which he hoped would be long-lasting.The first was with regard to masks. “In the changed paradigm due to Corona, masks are becoming a part of our lives... it does not mean that all those wearing a mask are sick… Mark my words, masks will now become a symbol of cultured society. If you want to save yourself and others from disease, you will have to wear a mask.” The second was with regard to spitting. “People now understand the damage that can be caused by spitting in public places. It had been a part of our bad habits that we would spit just about anywhere. This presents a serious challenge both to cleanliness and to health.” He hoped that this moment would lead to the total eradication of this habit.The people-led effort was also visible in the way people were celebrating festivals, by staying indoors and with simplicity. The PM tied this in with Ramzan, and while greeting citizens on the occasion, said that this was a moment to mark it as an icon of “restraint, goodwill, sensitivity and service”. Ramzan has traditionally seen congregations of the devout in mosques. The PM praised the role of community leaders in making people aware of the need for social distancing; he said he hoped administrative guidelines will be followed and that everyone prayed that before Eid, the world was rid of the disease.But this, PM Modi said, was not the time for complacency. “Let us not at all get caught in the trap of overconfidence. Let us not harbour a feeling that if Corona has not yet reached our city, our village, our street or our office, it is not going to reach now. Never make such a mistake. There should be no negligence at the local level or elsewhere.” This, the PM said, demanded that a distance of two yards – do gaj ki doori – was consistently maintained.India’s decision to export HCQ, following requests by a range of countries, including the United States, had come in for criticism from the opposition. The PM used his monthly address to speak of Indian culture, where there is empathy for the needs of others, and justified the decision within that ethos. “We took a decision in keeping with our culture. While we stepped up efforts to fulfil India’s needs, we also paid heed to the cry of help that came from other parts of the world to save humanity.” World leaders had expressed their gratitude to the PM, which he said was a matter of pride for all of India.Reiterating a theme that he has focused on in each of his address, the PM once again spoke of the role of front-line “corona warriors” as well as those in essential services. He spoke of a government website – covidwarriors.gov.in – that linked civil society volunteers, local administrations and health care workers for better coordination. The PM also underlined the importance of a recent ordinance which provides for more stringent punishment against attacks on health care workers, and how the pandemic has made citizens recognise the importance of many workers whose work otherwise went unnoticed, from domestic help to labour, from auto rickshaw drivers to those delivering goods. He also emphasised the role of different government and private sector players in the effort against the disease, from those in the aviation sector transporting essential medical supplies to railways to ensure the supply of essential goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-leading-fight-must-keep-guard-up-says-modi/story-rsejmB8NS04xTfRWakMWkI.html
27-04-2020||India||PM, CMs to discuss graded lockdown exit on video call||Several states want restrictions under the national lockdown to be eased in regions that have not witnessed local outbreaks of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), an issue that will likely be deliberated at a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief ministers on Monday, even as calls grew for curbs to remain in place in hot spots of the disease.The Prime Minister will on Monday interact with chief ministers in a video conference that is expected to focus on the next move in India’s battle plan against Covid-19, a highly contagious disease that has killed at least 205,000 people across the world. At the meeting, which could discuss a graded exit from the 40-day lockdown, the states are likely to ask for restrictions to be extended in the Covid-19 containment zones, officials from about a dozen states indicated.There is also a growing consensus among these states that notwithstanding the easing of restrictions, there should be a continued ban on mass gatherings; educational institutions must remain closed; interstate transport prohibited — except in cases of enabling the movement of migrant workers – and social distancing must be strictly observed.This is broadly the view that state chief ministers will likely present in Monday’s meeting with PM Modi. There are however exceptions, with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal indicating that ending the lockdown will not be easy and a top medical expert advising the Delhi government arguing for the extension of the lockdown beyond May 3.Monday’s will be the fourth meeting the PM and the CMs will hold on the pandemic — and possibly the last before the extended lockdown ends. All CMs are expected to be present at the meeting, in which nine of them will get to speak due to time constraints. These are chief ministers of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Puducherry, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Gujarat and Haryana. Others, however, can send their submissions in writing. At an earlier meeting, the PM pointed to the limitation of time, but urged the CMs to feel free to either write to him or call him, and promised to take into consideration their views.While the Centre has not officially offered its view on the extension of the lockdown, officials have indicated that there will be a re-examination, with an eye on opening up some sectors to revive crucial economic activity.On Saturday, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba held a meeting with state chief secretaries, in which he indicated that there is a need to focus on containment, even while relaxing restrictions further, hinting at the Centre’s broad strategy after the lockdown. A top central government official said on condition of anonymity that the sweeping national lockdown is unlikely to be extended beyond May 3. There have already been relaxations, notified by the Union home ministry, over the last 10 days — this includes allowing resumption of agriculture, construction and industrial activities in non-hot spot districts, and the opening up of neighbourhood shops in non-containment zones. The official said: “The priority is now consolidating health gains from the lockdown but also providing relief to three segments — daily wage workers, small businesses, and manufacturing districts.” A second official added that the key issue to be determined at the meeting is the extent of relaxations in Covid-19-free zones and in districts where there are no cases.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday there were 300 disease-free districts in the country and another 297 districts did not have any hot spots — defined as small areas having more than five cases. He said only 127 districts in the country have Covid-19 hot spots or red zones. “In the last one week, there are 66 districts from where no case has been reported and 56 districts from where no case reported in the past 14 days,” he said. He said this indicated that the disease has been contained largely to hot spots.This is the distinction the state governments are expected to emphasise, with a call for a hard lockdown in hot spot districts in general, and containment zones in particular. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said the state will like to continue with the lockdown in containment zones in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Thane – the major hubs of the disease. “If required, we will extend the lockdown for 15 more days after May 3 only for the containment zones, if not for the entire Mumbai and Pune,” he said.In Madhya Pradesh, officials said there was no likelihood of an immediate relaxation in lockdown restrictions in the 22 hot spot districts out of total 52 in the state — it could, in fact, see more strict enforcement, given the feedback of central teams that it had been lax in cities such as Bhopal and Indore. “Although the disease has not spread to new regions, there were no signs of improvement in the situation in the state particularly in the hot spot districts,” said health minister Narottam Mishra. He added that the state will abide by the Centre’s directions after the meeting on Monday.Uttar Pradesh has already banned public meetings till the end of June. Gujarat has called for stricter lockdown enforcement in 180 containment zones in the state. Bihar will take a call on lockdown after the PM’s meeting with chief ministers on Monday, a Bihar government official said on condition of anonymity.Congress chief ministers, according to party leaders, will urge the Prime Minister to divide the county into red zones, which are severely affected by the disease, and green zones, which are unaffected. They are expected to demand that the government consider a transition from a complete lockdown to lockdown only in disease hot spots and commencement of more activities in green zones with safeguards.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has maintained that the situation in districts, including the number of hot spots and the number of positive cases, needs to be assessed before taking a decision on the lockdown. A state government official said: “We cannot go back to life as it existed before March 24. Even in non-Covid-19 districts, we will have to learn to live more in isolation and in more hygienic ways. Social distancing is a new way of life and we have to alter all public places for this.”Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said he will go by the advice of an expert committee, set up to formulate the lockdown exit strategy. A committee member, who is familiar with the discussions and spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “The lockdown restrictions should continue in all hot spots districts till at least mid-May, by when the Covid curve would witness some flattening.”Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who had sought autonomy for states in resuming economic activities during meetings with the Centre, will once again seek relaxation in economic activities related to revenue generation in the state, according to a person familiar with the state’s approach. “He will demand exemptions in the operation of sweets shops; showrooms of vehicles, air conditioners, coolers and fridges; opening up of shops doing repair work and of all types of retail stores in all green zones with precautions,” the official said. Baghel is expected to argue that out of 28 districts in the state, not a single person has been found infected in 23 districts, while in four districts, only eight have tested positive.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa and his Andhra Pradesh counterpart, YSR Jagan Mohan Reddy, want the lockdown to be restricted to the containment areas and their buffer zones, and not entire districts, said concerned state government officials.Delhi and Telangana, however, appear to see greater benefits in extending the lockdown. Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao last Thursday extended the lockdown till May 7. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said lifting the lockdown restrictions in Delhi will not be easy.News agencies quoted SK Sarin, chairman of the Delhi government’s committee on combating Covid-19, as saying that it would be wise to extend the lockdown in Delhi, as the number of containment zones was still high. “The lockdown will have to be extended till May 16 as that is when the epidemic curve is likely to start declining, which happens after the flattening of the curve,” he said. All of Delhi’s 11 revenue districts are currently categorised as hot spots by the central government. Another key issue expected to be discussed at the meeting is a clearer policy on migrant workers and the use of public transport to enable their movement. The chief ministers of Rajasthan, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar are expected to seek relaxation on interstate transport for allowing stranded migrant labourers to return home. At cabinet secretary Gauba’s meeting, too, the theme of migrant workers came up. Several states, including Bihar, had maintained that the state can’t negotiate such tricky matters on their own and the Centre needed to come up with a clearer protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-cms-to-discuss-graded-lockdown-exit-on-video-call/story-NBmc7ewMsDNB0dEonNqtCJ.html
27-04-2020||India||Food grain distribution more than doubles since lockdown||Indian Railways has transported 5.2 million tonnes of foodgrains in the month since the country went under a lockdown on March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, more than double the quantity the national transporter carried in the same time a year ago, as the Centre tried to avert the spectre of hunger by making sure every region had plentiful food stock.With barely seven of India’s 2,067 large wholesale food markets functioning in the initial days of the lockdown, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Indian Railways went into overdrive to ferry grain stocks from food-surplus states to deficient ones. “The railways’ transportation of food stocks has played the single most important role in combating hunger during the lockdown,” acknowledged K. Mani, an economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.India’s farm output has grown consistently, helping it reach food self-suffiency. Up from barely 50 million tonnes in 1950-51 to over 257 million tonnes in 2018-19, increasing foodgrain output has helped India avoid a situation in which the pace of growth in food output lags behind population. Yet, according to economists such as Amartya Sen, it is not the lack of food output, but bad distribution that has caused previous crises in India such as the last major famine of 1943 that killed an estimated 3 million people.Indian Railways has proved to be a lifeline during the coronavirus crisis, filling the large gap left by frayed private sector supply chains and a near-collapse of the wholesale markets. “Maintaining continuity in supply chain was stiffer on account of tough working conditions due to lockdown. A constant coordination for terminal release/labour availability with DMs {district magistrates} at district level, state coordinating officers, and at apex level with MHA {ministry of home affairs} is being done by operating officers of Indian Railways,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.Meticulous prior planning with FCI on destinations to which the foodgrains must be carried had also paid off, the spokesperson said.To be sure, Indian Railways has suffered considerable losses because of the suspension of passenger trains during the lockdown as well as a decline in transport of commodities like coal and coke, the primary commodities it ferries, earnings from which dropped 48.91% to Rs 2,336.4 crore in April from a year ago.Earnings from transport of foodgrains, flour and pulses shot up by more than 90% during the same period Rs 817.96 crore, according to railway ministry data reviewed by Hindustan Times. “The first task for us was to identify surplus depots. Some depots already had railheads. Those were the first ones to be serviced,” said a food ministry official, requesting anonymity.Punjab and Haryana account for 80% of outbound freight for wheat while 60% of rice reserves came from Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, according to official data. Interestingly, with no passenger trains plying on its network, Indian Railways has for the first time in decades found the tracks decongested enough to run its freight trains at record speeds; it has also begun joining two goods trains for the transportation of foodgrains. Under this concept, two freight trains loaded from two different originating stations are clubbed at the nearest junction point and proceed to a common destination.Over 1,000 train trips have been undertaken to carry grains, pulses and horticulture produce from state to state since the lockdown. On April 22, the network saw total cargo traffic of 102 trainloads carrying about 280,000 tonnes of grains, the highest single-day movement so far. The FCI moved 158 trainloads carrying 442,000 tonnes of foodgrains (22,000 tonne of wheat and 420,000 tonnes of rice) during the first 25-day period of the countrywide lockdown to the mountainous northeastern states, double its normal average of about 80 trainloads per month.One of the landmarks was to reach over 22,000 grains to the farthest depot on the Indian side in Manipur’s Ukrul, which borders Myanmar. The northeast’s hilly terrain means states in the region have few railheads. To ferry food to Arunchal Pradesh, which shares a boundary with China, food trains have been chugging on a meter-gauge track till Mukukchaleng in Assam’s Dhemaji district, an outback from where trucks make an onward journey to the higher reaches of Pasighat, a tribal town in Arunchal. “These truck movements were undertaken in extremely challenging conditions,”said Lalrothang, an FCI official in Nagaland, who goes by one name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/food-grain-distribution-more-than-doubles-since-lockdown/story-JJN7ATFd5KKlY1CXsZhQ7J.html
27-04-2020||India||Indian firm ready to begin producing possible vaccine||Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) said on Sunday it will likely begin the production of a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine developed by Oxford University in the next two-three weeks and hopes to bring it to the market by October if human clinical trials of the same are successful. The company has partnered with Oxford University as one of the seven global institutions manufacturing the vaccine.“SII will be manufacturing the vaccine in anticipation of clinical trials succeeding by September-October in the UK… Following that, SII has undertaken the decision to initiate the manufacture at their own risk. The decision has been solely taken to have a jump-start on manufacturing, to have enough doses available, if the clinical trials work,” said Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of the Indian vaccine major, said in a statement.The vaccines will be manufactured at the company’s facility in Pune as building a new facility for Covid-19 vaccines would have taken around two-three years, he added.The human safety trial of the vaccine began in Oxford on Thursday, with the first two of the 800 healthy volunteers recruited for the study being injected with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. This is the sixth coronavirus vaccine to enter the first phase of clinical trials, raising hopes of an antidote against the virus that continues to ravage the world.If the trials are a success, scientists hope to have one million doses ready by September, and to dramatically scale up manufacturing after that.“Our team has been working closely with Dr Hill ( professor Adrian Hill) from Oxford University, and we are expecting to initiate production of the vaccine in two-three weeks and produce five million doses per month for the first 6 months, following which, we hope to scale up production to 10 million doses per month,” Poonawalla said, according to PTI.The company plans to initiate the trials in India for the vaccine with necessary regulatory approvals, which are underway presently, the news agency reported.“Keeping the current situation in mind, we have funded this endeavor at a personal capacity and hopefully will be able to enlist the support of other partners to further scale-up the vaccine production,” Poonawalla said.The trial will study whether the new vaccine is safe and can generate strong immune responses against Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and protect healthy people from infection.The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold adenovirus taken from chimps and genetically modified to make it impossible for it to infect humans.To develop the vaccine, researchers added genetic material to ChAdOx1 from the Sars-CoV-2 virus’s surface protein, spike glycoprotein (S), which helps the virus to bind to Ace2 receptors to enter human cells and cause an infection.Regulatory authorities are working with SII to ensure smooth procedural functioning. “We are in touch with the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research),” Poonawalla said.The company earlier said it will not patent any Covid-19 vaccine which it develops. Asked about that stand, Poonawalla reiterated: “We will not patent Serum’s vaccine for Covid-19 and will make it available for all to produce and sell, not just in India but across the world.”Whosoever makes and develops the vaccine will need multiple partners to manufacture it, he added. “I hope that whichever company develops the vaccine does not get it patented and makes it available based on royalties or a commercial understanding to as many manufacturers across the world to make billions of dosages at a fast pace,” Poonawalla said.

27-04-2020||India||No hike in tuition fee of IITs, IIITs this year: Govt||Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) will not increase tuition fees for the academic year 2020-21 because of the crisis triggered by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), human resource development (HRD) minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ said in New Delhi on Sunday. “After consultation with the chairman of the standing committee of the IIT Council and directors of IITs, it has been decided that these institutes will not increase the tuition fee for academic year 2020-21 for any course,” the minister said.IIT-Delhi has already said it has decided not to hike the fees for its post graduate courses. Sunday’s decision meant that all 23 IITs will stick to their fee structure followed for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the 2019-2020 academic session. “There is a view in the HRD ministry that premier institutions can step forward and take decisions which will benefit the student community as a whole...,” said a government official.A decision on the fees of undergraduate courses are taken jointly in the IIT Council, which is headed by the HRD minister, while individual IITs take a call on the fee structure of other courses such as M.Tech or MBA. For most courses, the fee structures are decided before the commencement of the academic session in June-July.Also, the centrally funded IIITs, or triple ITs as they are popularly known, will not implement a standard 10% tuition fee hike for undergraduate courses, the HRD minister said, adding that he requested these institutes not to increase fees for other courses as well. “On similar lines, I have requested the IIITs run in the public-private partnership (PPP) mode not to increase the tuition fee for the coming academic year for any of their courses,” he added.The IIIT Coordination Forum is the apex body for deciding policy and directions for 20 such institutes established under PPP. These IIITs are partially supported by government. Separately, the IIIT Council takes decisions related to the centrally funded IIITs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-hike-in-tuition-fee-of-iits-iiits-this-yr-govt/story-rQAbKp5UiY9XbUchGh3WlJ.html
27-04-2020||India||States’ revenues dip by up to 80%, seek funds from Centre||With their revenue falling by up to 80% in the Covid-19 lockdown that took effect on March 25 , several states have informed the Centre that they are almost broke and will not even be able to pay salaries unless they borrowed heavily and received interim compensation from the central government.State chief ministers are expected to raise the financial crunch they are confronting at a video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, state government officials said. Most states have already written to the finance ministry, seeking additional funds to tide over the crisis.Kerala finance minister Thomas Issac said on Saturday said that the state had been able to raise only Rs 250 crore in revenue this month. “If we include what the Centre would give us, in all we will be able to touch Rs 2,000 crore. For payment of salaries alone, we require Rs 2,500 crore,” Isaac said.“Then a way out is to draw from the ways and means {advance} and, including overdraft, it will come to Rs 2,500 crore. After that what happens would be {that} the treasury would be closed. Such is the situation that we are in,” Issac said. A ways and means advance helps states tide over temporary cash flow problems.Punjab is in a worse state. According to the state finance department, it faces expenditure of Rs 7,301 crore for April on salaries, pensions, debt servicing, power subsidy and coronavirus-related relief measures. The government budgeted for revenue of Rs 3,360 crore, including Rs 1,322 crore form the goods and services tax, Rs 465 crore from value added tax (petroleum products), Rs 521 crore from state excise, Rs 198 crore from motor vehicle tax, Rs 243 crore from electricity dues and Rs 219 crore from stamp duty.Chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said the receipts on account of GST and other states taxes were negligible and reduced electricity consumption had resulted in a drop of electricity revenue by 60%. The CM has sought Rs 3,000 crore from the Centre as interim compensation to overcome revenue constraints.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of Uttar Pradesh has experienced a decline of 70% in revenue, and the administration has frozen dearness allowance to employees until end of June and a 30% cut in salaries and allowances paid to ministers to save up to Rs 13,550 crore. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has set up a committee headed by additional chief secretary (finance) Sanjiv Mittal to study the financial impact of lockdown and suggest measures to mobilise additional resources. Uttarakhand’s secretary (finance) Amit Singh Negi said he state needs around Rs 1,500 crores for paying salaries and pensions, and Rs 700 crore to repay loans and interest on them. “Out of the total Rs 2,200 crores (approximately) needed every month, we are earning almost nothing as of now,” said Negi.He said, “We used to earn a share from the taxes earned by the Central government, which also has been reduced by 20% by the Centre due to which we are staring at a loss of another Rs 200 crores. The state government might soon take a decision on deferring salaries as earnings are very less, but nothing has been decided as of now.”The situation is no different in Bihar, whose revenue has dipped by 85% as compared to the same time a year ago. The state expects to collect around Rs 300 crore this month as against Rs 1,500 crore in April last year.Bihar’s finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi said the state government will accord top priority to payments of salary payments, pensions, loan repayments and interest payments“Unlike Kerala and few other states, Bihar government will not defer salary payment or cut salaries of state employees and also pay pension to its pensioners,” he said, adding that the state had asked the Centre to increase the borrowing limit to 4% of the state gross domestic product.In Madhya Pradesh, officials said the government would lose revenue of Rs 4,000 crore in April and would have to arrange for Rs 6,000 crore to pay salaries of employees. “As 22 districts of the state including industrial capital Indore is in the grip of Covid, I don’t see much improvement in revenue happening in May also,” a finance department official, who requested anonymity, said . Additional chief secretary,(finance) Anurag Jain said: “These are challenges due to revenue being affected but as the economic activities will accelerate the situation will improve.” West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra said he had sought immediate central intervention to repay loans because the state is expected to lose revenue of Rs 15,000 crore during the lockdown period. To earn some revenue, the state government is offering a 20% discount for e-registration with a maximum ceiling of Rs 20,000. “Seventy per cent of state’s revenue comes from GST and other taxes,” a finance department official. Himachal Pradesh is expecting a revenue loss to the tune of ₹450 crores after the nationwide lockdown. “We have suffered an estimated ₹453 crores revenue loss in the lockdown period. The industry has also suffered a major setback with the capacity down to 25%,” said chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who also holds the finance portfolio.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-revenues-dip-by-up-to-80-seek-funds-from-centre/story-Rhl4DXt9aQnjDLycntu41H.html
27-04-2020||India||Is virulent strain a worry for Indore?||With Indore in Madhya Pradesh emerging as a major hot spot for Covid-19 in the country, hospitals dedicated to fight the disease in the city sought to know whether they are up against a more virulent strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. It claimed that Indore, with its top-notch medical facilities and awareness, should not be in the crisis that it is facing currently. The MGM Medical College, which has two hospitals dedicated to fight the disease, has requested the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune to study the virus recovered from the region.As per the health department’s bulletin released on Sunday, the state’s tally of cases rose to 2,090 with 145 new cases reported in the past 24 hours; the total death toll is 103. Of the new cases, 91 were reported from Indore, which has total 1176 cases. It also accounts for more than 55% of the deaths in the state and its death rate of 4.84% is higher than the national rate of 3.06%.Dean and CEO of MGM medical college, Indore Dr. Jyoti Bindal said, “There are certain reasons to apprehend that the virus strain in Indore is deadlier. However, it’s our apprehension given the situation... The Indore belt has seen significant positive cases and fatality too. In certain parts of the world that have also seen higher fatality rate, the genetic make up of the virus too was found different, and so more virulent. That’s why we want to see if it’s a similar case in Indore belt too.””Indore has the best medical facility in the state. I don’t see any reason related to medical services behind the situation,” she added.Scientists had already flagged a mutation in the virus from a case in Kerala in a pre-print study, although it was thought that the mutation made it less efficient in transmission. Independent experts had then said that more evidence was required.Monitoring the mutation dynamics of Sars-CoV-2 is critical for the development of effective approaches to develop drugs and vaccines to contain the pathogen.Dr. Bindal said, “The NIV wants samples from other parts of the state too to compare the same with Indore’s samples. We are trying to get samples from the labs in other parts of the state before sending the same.”Dr. Salil Bhargava, professor of respiratory medicine and head of Manorama Raje TB hospital, Indore said, “Geographically, Indore in Malwa region presents a different picture. It is well connected to Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan and here there a significant presence of such people who travel abroad like the US, Sri Lanka, China and several other countries as I have seen such people in OPD (Out Patient Department).”He said, “In Indore, people are extraordinarily alert about their health. Comorbidity and lifestyle may be some issues but gravity of the situation is quite alarming. Hence, we should find out scientifically if the virus strain here is more virulent. This will help us control the situation more effectively.”Dr. Ravi Dosi , head of department of chest diseases at Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences (SAIMS), a dedicated Covid-19 hospital said, “We are giving the same treatment to Covid-19 patients that such patients are getting in other places in the country. But the results here are not as impressive as it should be. Hence, a proper study of the genome of the virus may help us find out in what direction we are going.”Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said, “If this (virus mutation) is true, then I think the World Health Organization, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and expert groups should immediately do an independent analysis of all cases not only in Indore but Ujjain, Bhopal and other divisions too.”“The MGM medical college should follow the WHO guidelines and take experts opinion on this also. Public health system is the backbone which is managing the entire pandemic in Indore but shifting patients to private hospitals more and less in government hospitals is a matter of concern and it also needs investigation. A team of doctors should decide which patient will be treated where,” said NidhiHealth minister, Madhya Pradesh Narottam Mishra said, “If the medical college is going ahead with any study it’s a welcome step. The government is for all the possible steps to control the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-virulent-strain-a-worry-for-indore/story-5VHBZi5oNmHEhAg1iCXCgM.html
27-04-2020||India||70% of Indian citizens abroad are in 6 W Asian nations, shows data||In the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic affecting Indians abroad, the government’s focus will be on six West Asian countries, which are home to seventy percent of India’s citizens who live abroad, according to data on overseas Indians maintained by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). There are 12.6 million non-resident Indians (NRIs), those holding an Indian passport but ordinarily residing outside the country, spread across more than 200 nations, according to the MEA. But 8.9 million of them live in just six countries. Among them, the largest number of Indians, 3.4 million, live in the United Arab Emirates, which is approximately 27% of all NRIs around the world. Another 2.6 million are in Saudi Arabia while Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain were home to another 2.9 million NRIs. For now, stranded Indians around the world, including workers and students, have been asked to stay where they are. A person familiar with the decision-making behind this position said, “This approach was adopted because of the suspension of international flights and the lack of adequate quarantine facilities in India following the coronavirus outbreak.”But there have been mounting calls from stranded Indians to be allowed for various reasons. Some are students facing problems with food and accommodation because their hostels have been closed; others are workers who have lost their jobs; and others who simply wanted to be with their families in these challenging times.By the third week of April, some 2,500 Indians had approached the Indian missions in Abu Dhabi and Dubai alone to seek help to return home, according to reports in local media. Authorities in Delhi have not made public the number of Indians who have sought to return from the Middle East, saying the situation is dynamic and changing rapidly.The UAE government has been pressing governments in South Asia to allow the repatriation of workers who want to return home and has even offered to fly them out. This includes workers who have been laid off because the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 crisis. Indians in the West Asian countries also account for annual remittances of over $40 billion, though most experts feel the figure will be far lower this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic coupled with the steep fall in crude oil prices. The World Bank has already estimated that remittances will shrink by 20% globally in 2020, while India, the biggest receiver of remittances, could witness a decline of 23%.Talmiz Ahmad, who served as India’s envoy to Saudi Arabia, said at the moment, it was not clear how many Indians will return. He said it was also heartening that the West Asian states such as the UAE had shown understanding for India’s inability to bring back its expatriates. “We didn’t have facilities to quarantine people in large numbers and the West Asian states agreed to our request to look after our workers,” he said. “It was also significant that external affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke to several of his counterparts in West Asia and spoke out joint efforts against Covid-19. India also assured there would be no disruptions in food supplies – we are major suppliers of items such as rice and vegetables to these countries,” Ahmad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/70-of-indian-citizens-abroad-are-in-6-w-asian-nations-shows-data/story-DEy4vc6U8g0tFtHLrkwOoN.html

27-04-2020||India||New rules to improve PPE quality issued after medics flag concerns||The ministry of textiles has rolled out a slew of new rules meant to improve the standards of coverall suits – one of the most key components of the personal protective equipment that health care workers use, announcing that manufacturers will need to declare that they are not producing for commercial gains and that the fabric used will need to meet certain specifications.The move comes after health care workers reported problems with quality, and ministry officials were alerted to instances of how their certification was misused by traders to sell untested products. The ministry has now recalled all previously issued certificates. “These changes are interim measures only and newer restrictions will be put in place. We are evolving as we go, as there was no norm earlier. Testing norms, however, do not change, only the certification process does,” said an official of the ministry, asking not to be named. The new norms, issued on April 22 for coveralls and April 24 for the fabric, say that any domestic manufacturer of a coverall or fabric applying for approval certifications will have to attach a notarised affidavit declaring they are not traders. They need to state that they are manufacturers and they will not get into commercial production of the material. The ministry has also asked the manufacturer to declare whether the fabric used is non-woven, woven or knitted, its GSM and thickness, whether it is laminated or coated, and where are they sourcing the fabric from. The ministry also issues certifications for the fabric produced.Domestic production of coveralls started in March, after India stared at a huge deficit for personal protective equipment (PPE) as the Covid-19 outbreak grew wider. Testing for new samples of coveralls is conducted by four agencies for the textile ministry, which is responsible for the supply of PPEs that require textiles. Tests such as synthetic blood penetration are conducted on these. The new norms were sent on Wednesday by the ministry to the four testing agencies: Coimbatore-based South India Textile Research Association (SITRA), the Gwalior-based Defence Research & Development Establishment, and the two Ordnance Factory Board outlets at Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur and Tami Nadu’s Avani. Officials said that the move was prompted after reports of a shopkeeper using a SITRA certification to manufacture and sell coverall made from grocery bags instead of the approved fabric. SITRA officials said that the quality control measures remain a challenge. “To make sure that there is no misuse, the certifications that we are issuing now will only be applicable for six months after which a manufacturer reapplies,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-rules-to-improve-ppe-quality-issued-after-medics-flag-concerns/story-hbEBQOCxLFyRhqv9prxaUN.html
27-04-2020||India||AK Antony writes to PM for relief to students, farmers amid Covid-19 pandemic||Senior Congress leader AK Antony has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking for a more comprehensive economic relief package that shields vulnerable sections such as students and farmers from the crisis triggered by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.A moratorium on loan payments recently announced by the government should be extended for a longer period of at least a year, he said.In a letter dated April 26, the Rajya Sabha member from Kerala suggested that interest rates on these loans be waived off during the time when the moratorium is in place. “The moratorium on existing loans would have to be extended to a longer period (at least one year) till we see signs of economic normalization especially for the ones most vulnerable during the Covid crisis like our farmers and students,” Antony’s letter said.Most of the students, especially those abroad, rely on part-time employment while they pursue their studies for their sustenance. As incomes have stopped, and exchange rates are rising, the student community abroad is facing difficulties, he said.“It would be appropriate that the credit line is offered through our Embassies and High Commission abroad without interest along with the provision of any other possible support through our foreign missions which will allow them to meet their basic living expenses,” Antony added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ak-antony-writes-to-pm-for-relief-to-students-farmers/story-nonSNk3APauRJEg0jaicNK.html
27-04-2020||India||Remove bottlenecks to ramp up Covid-19 testing: Cong||The Congress has asked the government to ramp up testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to 100,000 individuals every day, and accused it of testing at much lower numbers than capacity — either because it wants to under-report numbers or is unsure of its implications. After an hour-long meeting of the party’s taskforce on Covid-19, chaired by former prime minister Manmohan Singh, met, the party’s former president and Member of Parliament, Rahul Gandhi, tweeted, “ Experts agree that mass random testing is the key to beating Corona. In India, a bottleneck is stopping us from scaling testing from the current 40,000 per day to 1 lakh tests a day, for which test kits are already in stock. PM needs to act fast and clear the bottleneck.”Singh too suggested testing and tracing as key tools in the battle against the pandemic. “There are problems with respect to the inadequacy of testing facilities and without more aggressive facilities of testing, we are not going to conquer this menace,” Singh said during the meeting, according to a short video clip released by the party. Besides Singh and Gandhi, senior leaders P Chidambaram, KC Venugopal, Randeep Surjewala, Jairam Ramesh, Manish Tewari, and younger leaders such as Praveen Chakravarty, Rohan Gupta, Gourav Vallabh, and Supriya Shrinate were present at the meeting. Briefing reporters after the meet, Tewari accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata party of testing much lesser than its capacity. He said that testing right now are as low as 39,000 while India has the capacity of one lakh tests per day. “Is the government attempting to play down the magnitude of the problem or is it unsure of dealing with implications of random testing,” said the Anandpur Sahib Lok Sabha MP.The government has repeatedly pointed out that it has increased testing. In an interview, health minister Harsh Vardhan has said that the government plans to increase the tests up to 100,000 by the end of May. Another theme that dominated the Congress meeting was the plight of migrant workers. Members agreed that the Centre should step aside and let the states work out a mechanism among themselves to help migrants move from one state to another. In the past two days, several states have attempted to coordinate among themselves, and arrange transport to bring migrants from their states back home. Gandhi suggested that India should have a broad framework to protect migrants, and that states must be allowed to do their bit in retrieving migrants. “We must also acknowledge that state governments are actively responsible for driving this, and that different state governments might choose different methodologies to solve this problem,” Gandhi said. Former finance minister, Chidambaram, while agreeing that states will have to be at the centre of any work related to their repatriation, emphasised that a protectionist mechanism was needed for migrant workers as most of them will be stranded where they are. “The bulk will remain where they are. And they must be given immediate cash and grain,” he said, according to the same video clip. In the context of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with chief ministers, scheduled for Monday, the taskforce also discussed the lockdown, which ends on May 3. Tiwari said states can only formulate a strategy until there is a national plan to deal with the crisis. “We hope the PM puts out a comprehensive, holistic strategy in dealing with lockout exit during the meeting with Chief Ministers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remove-bottlenecks-to-ramp-up-testing-cong/story-d9C5vrj1EIvsXD5aHrgFGJ.html
27-04-2020||India||Possible post-lockdown labour shortage worries BJP in Bihar||As more and more state governments bring back migrant workers stranded in other states owing to the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have expressed concern that their return may set back efforts to restart the economy when the restrictions are eased after May 3.Party functionaries in Bihar, for instance, have apprised the central leadership that if migrant workers from the state are allowed to return home in large numbers, it may spell trouble for industry in the western region.“There are lakhs of workers from Bihar who are employed in the industrial, agriculture and construction sectors in states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan. If all of them are brought back, they may not return for three or four months, and then the festive season begins post-October; so that might add to the delay in their return {to places of work},” a party functionary said on condition of anonymity.Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have announced they are chalking out plans to bring back their migrant workers stuck in other states and Chhattisgarh said it had sought permission to carry out a similar exercise, entailing the return of tens of thousands of workers who left their places of work in distress after the lockdown.took force. In Bihar, the authorities have cited the lockdown protocol as a reason for not making provisions to bring back workers.A second BJP functionary from Bihar, where state assembly elections are due later this year, said the party unit had urged the government to ensure that economic activity picks up in areas that are not classified as Covid-19 hotspots so that the workers get an incentive to stay back instead of heading home.“Once there is engagement and activity a lot of workers who are currently under stress will not push for going back to their native places. Of course, all the work will have to be undertaken after following the required protocol,” the second functionary said, also requesting anonymity.Bihar chief minister and Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar has been critical of his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath when he sent buses to bring back students of coaching centres stuck in Kota, Rajasthan, earlier this month. An ally of the BJP, the JD(U), which has been criticised for not taking steps to bring back its own migrant workers, believes that once the workers are back in the state, a substantial number will stay on. A large number of workers from Bihar are in Punjab, Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and West Bengal.“There are many opportunities for earning in Bihar in the irrigation sector, in agriculture, road and bridge construction under MGNREGA. We are actually not facing labour shortfall in Bihar this time,” said Sanjay Kumar Jha, minister of water resources and the national general secretary of JD(U).He said that contrary to the perception that the state has not done enough for migrant workers from the state, the Bihar administration has made arrangements for providing food and shelter to the workers who had returned from other states and transferred Rs 1,000 each to the accounts of 1.4 million people.Bihar has been following the lockdown protocol specified by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Jha said, and took a swipe at other states for neglecting the safety of migrant workers and not making adequate provisions for them. “We have been following the protocol in letter and in spirit. It is ironic that people who were seen a wealth creators and were active participants in building roads and infrastructure became a liability overnight,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/possible-post-lockdown-labour-shortage-worries-bjp-in-bihar/story-Bd1VidbBm3PBUcgdE2bnPI.html
27-04-2020||India||Don’t blame an entire community for mistakes of a few: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat||Asserting that an entire community cannot be held responsible for the mistakes of a few, the Rashtiya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that the pandemic calls for national unity, and asked citizens to be aware of those who want to exploit the opportunity to “break the nation” and create tensions between communities. Bhagwat also said that the pandemic has also shown the need to create a new development model, which should have Swadeshi at its core. The RSS has long-held swadeshi, which refers to boosting domestic capabilities and production and reducing external economic dependence and inter-linkages, as a core ideological belief. He also underlined the necessity of following the government’s protocol on social distancing. “If anyone out of anger or fear does something wrong, we cannot blame the whole community and distance from them,” Bhagwat said in a televised address. This is widely being interpreted as a reference to the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, where thousands got infected. At the same time, Bhagwat warned against any attempt to disintegrate the country. He said it is incumbent on community leaders to ensure that people are not provoked by those who are “anti-India” to react with “anger or fear” to government’s instructions on physical distancing. “People don’t want any restrictions. We (RSS) stopped all programmes till June end. Some others might feel the government is trying to put restrictions ... some are creating a problem that leads to anger. The ones who will benefit from this will keep provoking” he said.The RSS chief also made a renewed pitch for encouraging Swadeshi or indigenous production and said the pandemic has given India the opportunity to become self reliant and cut dependence on other nations. He however cautioned that indigenous production will have to meet quality standards. “The PM (Narendra Modi) recently told the Sarpanches that this problem is teaching us self-reliance. We need to focus on employment. Will those who went (to their villages) come back, will people have jobs, will people be able to pay? We need to start preparing and think of self reliance,” he said. Political analyst Hari Desai said, “Bhagwat’s comments on not demonising a community and pushing for swadeshi are welcome. However it remains to be seen whether it will be followed by Swayamsevaks and BJP leaders who have been blaming a particular community for the spread of Covid-19.”Bhagwat also criticised the lynching of two Hindu religious leaders in Maharashtra’s Palgarh and said such instances should not be allowed.“…Should this (lynching) have happened, should law be disrupted, what role should the police have played? The sanyasis were beaten to death. They were people who served others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-blame-an-entire-community-for-mistakes-of-a-few-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat/story-VrtQYk3vxiG2Z8EUfKdGqM.html
27-04-2020||India||Trace, test, isolate, treat will remain our strategy: Union health min Harsh Vardhan||As India puts up a resolute fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Union minister for health and family welfare Harsh Vardhan, in a phone conversation with Hindustan Times, spoke about what lies ahead in the battle against the pandemic that has infected at least 2.92 million people and killed 200,000 globally. There will be no-let up in the fight, the minister said. Edited excerpts: There is a sense that India has managed to flatten the curve as far as Covid-19 is concerned. What will be India’s strategy now?The numbers say it all for us; as compared to other countries, we are in a better position. As for the strategy to manage the disease, it will not change. Just because things are getting better for us, it does not mean we will show laxity in our approach towards managing the situation. The strategy will continue to remain what it has been till now — to aggressively look within the community for all those who have been infected by the virus. Look for them, test them, isolate them, and treat them.What are the key areas in managing Covid-19 that need focus?Our focus largely is on actively tracing positive cases; and to do whatever it takes to successfully identify those infected. We have significantly increased our testing capacity, and are in the process of taking it to 100,000 tests in a day likely by May-end. This will help us reach out to maximum undetected cases. Logistics is not an issue at all for us as we are adequately prepared. Be it hospital beds to isolate people, ventilators for critically ill patients, personal protection gear for healthcare workers, N95 masks, medicines, oxygen supply etc., there is no shortage of anything. In fact, our preparations have been made keeping in mind the extreme situation that we could have landed in if certain measures were not taken. We are prepared to handle any situation in future also. Will you continue with rapid testing given the inaccuracies in results?The Indian Council of Medical Research is looking into the matter. It is currently in the process of studying what the problem has been, and will be validating the kits. The matter was not discussed in the group of ministers meeting as it is a technical issue that is handled by experts in the ICMR. It will be too premature to say anything right now; let them find out the cause, and then see what they advise.What are the challenges that you face?India is a huge country but we have drafted a comprehensive plan based on which we are constantly assessing the situation even till the block level. The zones have been segregated based on their risk factor; hotspots have been earmarked; and containment zones have been created to implement the containment plan. The centre is literally handholding the states to ensure all gaps are filled. Import of certain items was an issue so we built capacity to indigenously manufacture items such as personal protective equipment, masks, etc. and today we have more than 100 domestic manufacturers who have started production. Are you ensuring there are no shortages of medicines or other essential supplies?While lockdown and social distancing is an important measure in our fight against coronavirus disease, the government is working hard to ensure there is no shortage of any essential supplies, be it medicines or other items. There was an extensive review of the situation in the recent meeting of the group of ministers, and apart from talking about strengthening the contingency measures, it was also seen as a priority to ensure people did not face any inconvenience, and all essential supplies were available to them. There is no need to panic. There is a lot of misinformation doing rounds regarding the disease because of which healthcare workers and Covid-19 survivors are being stigmatised. How do you counter that?The only way to counter misinformation is by referring only to the source of information that the government is providing. We are making a lot of effort to disseminate authentic information to public; there are helpline numbers, email IDs, and fact check portals created specifically to answer queries from public, which should be made use of rather than consulting unconfirmed sources of information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trace-test-isolate-treat-will-remain-our-strategy-union-health-min-harsh-vardhan/story-QlD9UAWDPjLRprFC6GCFtJ.html
27-04-2020||India||IRS officers pitch 40% tax rate plus Covid relief cess, under probe||The government on Sunday rejected an “ill-conceived” suggestions by a group of Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers to increase the top income tax rate to 40%, impose a levy on the so-called super-rich tax and a 4% Covid-19 relief cess to rebuild the nation’s economy, reeling under the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown.The suggestions were made in a report titled Fiscal Options & Response to Covid-19 Epidemic (FORCE) and released to the media on the IRS Association’s Twitter handle and website. The government deemed it an “irresponsible act” by a few officers, said two finance ministry officials with direct knowledge of the development.“A departmental enquiry will be initiated against people responsible for creating panic among the public by uploading this unauthorised report on social media that could have a serious consequence for both the economy and the market. Thankfully, the market was closed,” one of the officials said.The two officials, who both requested anonymity, said the government had “summarily” dismissed the suggestions which it judged as ill-conceived.Some of the key recommendations of the FORCE report were raising the income-tax rate up to 40% for those with income of Rs 1 core per year, reimposing a wealth tax on those with a net wealth of Rs 5 crore, deemed to be super-rich, and levy of a one-time Covid relief cess of 4% on those with a taxable income of Rs 10 lakh and above.“The proposals are against the government’s existing policy on taxation,” a second official said.In the budget this year, the government offered individuals the option of paying lower income-tax rates provided they forgo tax exemptions. It had earlier reduced corporate tax rates drastically in September, sacrificing Rs 1.45 lakh crore in revenue. Companies were given the choice of opting for a lower corporate tax rate of 22% (15% for newly incorporated companies) provided they didn’t seek exemptions. Those seeking exemptions would pay income tax at the rate of 30% (25% for new entities).While forwarding the FORCE report, the IRS Association on April 23 wrote to the chairman and members of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) that it had been prepared jointly by a group of 50 IRS officers.“Working from home, they have come together to leverage their combined knowledge, experiences, and commitment to building a healthy, strong and prosperous India,” the letter that was posted on its Twitter late on Saturday said.One executive functionary of the association, requesting anonymity, said on Sunday that the was “only recommendatory in nature.”On Sunday evening, the association tweeted, “The paper FORCE by 50 young IRS officers suggesting policy measures had been forwarded by IRSA to CBDT for consideration. It does not purport to represent the official views of the entire IRS, or the IT Dept.”A CBDT spokesperson said the board always sought direct feedback from its field formations to improve its systems and processes, but does not entertain unsolicited suggestions from the association.“Neither the IRS Association nor any group of officers, mentioned in the said report, were ever asked by the government to give any report on the subject,” the first official said.It is, on the face of it, an act of indiscipline and violation of conduct rules which specifically prohibit officers to go to media with their personal views on official matters without taking prior sanction or permission of the government, the official said.“The Chairman, CBDT has been directed to seek explanation from these officers for writing such ‘ill-conceived views’ in public without having any authority to do so,” he said.The official added:, “People should completely disregard such reports. In fact, the finance ministry is doing its best to provide relief and liquidity into the system and ease the lives of people in these trying times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-rejects-irs-officers-report-suggesting-covid-19-cess-40-tax-on-super-rich-calls-it-irresponsible-act/story-MrFyPkmNEUkwEIqk6S37DJ.html
27-04-2020||India||Slum dwellings pose challenge as Mumbai fights coronavirus outbreak||As coronavirus situation spirals, slum dwellings in Mumbai, where more than half of the city’s 12 million population live in crammed space and unhygienic conditions, seem to be posing a daunting challenge in efforts to curb infections. Known as the ‘City of Dreams’, Mumbai is home to the largest number of billionaires as well as Asia’s largest slum Dharavi -- one of the coronavirus hotspots. While area-wise it measures just about 2.4 square kilometres (sq kms), Dharavi alone has more than one million people. Tata Group Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata’s remarks, earlier this week, that developers and architects are treating slums as residue” of the city and that was one of the reasons for the rapid spread of the pandemic highlighted the current situation. These so-called planners and builders should be ashamed of themselves for forcing a large majority of the people to live in sub-human conditions, he had said. The megacity has reported 4,870 coronavirus cases and 191 deaths. The octogenarian industrialist, also a long time resident of Mumbai, had lambasted realtors for neglecting the poor and creating vertical slums for big gains from high value housing that come up in the areas where slums stood once. Lack of proper planning, flouting of norms, land cartelisation and rising property prices, are among the factors, that have contributed to the present situation of large number of people living in slums, experts opined. The Maharashtra government and local authorities are taking measures to contain the spread of coronavirus infections and are appealing the citizens to stay home. However, with rooms measuring barely 100-200 sq ft housing 8-10 people in slums, and scores of families sharing common toilets and water taps, the possibility of coronavirus cases going up is always high, they added. “Blame it on policy paralysis and unending aspirations of both politicians as well as developers’ community for the city not becoming slum-free. And today, these slums have turned into a haven for coronavirus,” MMRDA (Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority) former chief town planner V K Pathak told PTI. Further, he said housing policies that were developed by the competent authorities did not solve the issues of ‘public housing’ but were construed as policies for real estate development. “Nearly 65-70 per cent of Mumbai’s population stays in slums. Policies like the Urban Land Ceiling Act, free housing for slum dwellers and extension of cut off dates for regularising slums led to land cartelisation and increasing property rates,” Pathak said. Over the years, Mumbai has witnessed a large influx of migrants in search of jobs. They settled in clusters by building small hutments as they could not afford to buy homes and those areas later became illegal slums. “Affordable housing and slum elimination are two surprisingly conflicting issues. We’re trying to remove slums from seemingly unsuitable living conditions by relocating them to other locations which are 20-30 miles away and where there are no jobs for these uprooted people,” Ratan Tata said earlier this week. In 1995, as part of his pre-election promises, late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray floated the idea of ‘free housing’ for slum dwellers. When the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance came to power the same year, their government launched the slum rehabilitation scheme. Under the scheme, slums were proposed to be replaced with ‘pukka’ houses on the same plot of land, construction of which was to be cross-funded by a ‘free sale component’. The latter was aimed at attracting investments from home buyers from slightly affluent financial background. However, the scheme could not address the problems in its entirety and slums kept proliferating across the city. Real estate developers’ body Naredco’s National President Niranjan Hiranandani also acknowledged that proper urban planning has “not” been done. “One acknowledges that the situation has been one where proper urban planning has not been done. The need to ensure fiscal viability of real estate projects creates a situation where over the years, we have seen real estate development happen in ways that weren’t examples of ‘sustainable living’ or in sync with the environment. According to him, a mix of acute scarcity of open spaces, restrictions on vertical growth and difficulties relating to slum rehabilitation policy confounds Mumbai’s planned development. An expert in real estate regulations, who did not wish to be identified, said faulty Floor Space Index (FSI) norms have also led to haphazard development in the city and skewed property prices. FSI is a development tool that defines the extent to which construction is permitted on a plot. For long, the permissible FSI for residential development in the island city has been 1.33 and it is 1 in the suburbs. In 2019, then state government led by BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis increased the FSI for slum rehabilitation projects across the city to 4 from the earlier 3. The index is based on a ratio between the area of a covered floor or the built up area to the area of that plot on which a building stands. The new development plan 2034 for Mumbai has proposed to increase the FSI to 2.7. “While the developers used this as a tool to build costly aspirational homes, local authorities used it as a means to generate revenues. In between, the interest of the public was ignored,” the expert quoted above said. Over the past several years, Maharashtra government has been planning to redevelop the most congested areas in the city like Dharavi and Kamathipura. The ambitious Dharavi redevelopment plan, which was conceptualised more than a decade ago in 2004, has not found takers yet as developers have found the proposal “financially unviable”. “Haphazard and in some instances, unplanned development just enhances the difficulty quotient. The slum proliferation challenge begins with open spaces reserved by authorities for future development or kept vacant as no development zones. “Given the constant pressure from new migrants looking for homes, it opens up the pathway to proliferation of slums. This is a problem not unique only to Mumbai, but certainly more acute as compared to other cities,” Hiranandani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/slum-dwellings-pose-challenge-as-mumbai-fights-coronavirus-outbreak/story-gzsdRS6fT1jvkZQZoX0R5N.html
27-04-2020||Editorials||The lockdown will end slowly, but refinance states urgently||On Monday, in an interaction with chief ministers (CMs), Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi offered broad hints about the next steps in India’s battle against the coronavirus pandemic. The most significant takeaway from his remarks, even if it was not explicitly stated, is that the exit from the lockdown after May 3 will be gradual and phased. There will be — reading between the lines of the PM’s message to the CMs — no big opening up. Mr Modi made it clear that the lockdown has saved lives; he reiterated the importance of social distancing; and he underlined that special attention needed to be paid to “red zones” — which are home to larger clusters of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. This indicates that in such zones at least, restrictions will continue after May 3. The PM also touched on the need to “give importance to the economy”, even as the fight against Covid-19 continues, an indication, perhaps, that there could be some return to what will be a new normal after the deadline for the extended lockdown ends. One possibility is that more guidelines will be eased — at least in the so-called green zones, which are not affected by the pandemic. The PM did emphasise that efforts must be made to convert red zones into orange zones and orange zones into green zones (which are not affected by the disease or are free from it). While the PM did not give a specific sense of what further relaxations will be introduced — clarity on this would have been welcome — he did talk of the need to look at each administrative unit and suggested that much would depend on the inclination of state governments. Given the inclination of at least some states to extend the lockdown, this may mean a further delay in the revival of the economic activity. The big gap in the meeting, however, was on the question of finances. Despite state CMs raising the issue of their depleted finances and the need for support, the PM did not provide a specific commitment. The government has already delayed a much-needed stimulus package for the economy, causing perhaps, irreversible harm to a range of businesses and industries. It is also now delaying the announcement of a support framework to states, which are spending more and earning much lesser than usual. This is unsustainable and will throw the entire framework of public finances into disarray. Still, a week of the lockdown remains. By the end of this period, India must have a plan on opening up — and another on shoring up state finances and reviving the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-lockdown-will-end-slowly-but-refinance-states-urgently/story-BFq7UQRMKH3GYFLoCPGw2H.html
27-04-2020||Editorials||RSS must now heed its own chief’s advice||On Sunday, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief, Mohan Bhagwat, in a video address, said that the transgressions of a few should not lead to targeting an entire community. This suggests that he had in mind the Tablighi Jamaat controversy, in which the deplorable actions of some followers of the sect, contributed greatly to the disease spreading across India. The organisers of the mass gathering were rightfully criticised. But it went beyond that when the incident was used to somehow blame the entire Muslim community for the spread of the disease in India. On social media, trolls carried out a relentless campaign against Muslims, even suggesting this was some form of jihad. There have been physical assaults in places; Muslim vendors were isolated and drummed out of business; Muslim volunteers have been set upon and prevented from carrying out relief work; and there have been reports of segregation on the basis of faith in even hospital admissions. Mr Bhagwat enjoys vast authority not just in the RSS but a wide range of Hindu organisations. Many who have been behind this targeting of Muslims plead allegiance to these outfits and derive inspiration from them. This is what makes his intervention important. He must now ensure that his advice is enforced in letter and spirit on the ground by his cadres. They must not spread falsehoods and encourage violence against any community. Muslims and other minorities are an integral part of the socio-economic fabric and the recovery process post-Covid requires the nation to pull together as one. Mr Mr Bhagwat, through his remarks, seems to suggest this and his organisation will be doing a signal service to the country if it is seen to be implementing his advice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/rss-must-now-heed-its-own-chief-s-advice/story-RCbzaIsfAsLO406FBx7fxH.html
