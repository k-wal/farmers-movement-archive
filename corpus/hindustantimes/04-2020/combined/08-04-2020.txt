08-04-2020||News||A global pandemic and globalisation||It is now evident that the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) is a systemic global event, one that will have significant consequences for people’s well-being and lifestyles, national economies, and political leaderships on every continent. It is natural for people to be considering the secondary implications of the pandemic. Some of the repercussions will be unexpected, and may not be felt immediately.One natural question is what Covid-19 will mean for globalisation. Globalisation is the accelerated flow of goods, people, capital, information, and energy across borders, often enabled by technological developments. Over the past three decades, globalising trends were assumed to be the new normal. Trade without tariffs, international travel with easy or no visas, capital flows with few impediments, cross-border pipelines and energy grids, and seamless global communication in real-time appeared to be the natural endpoints towards which the world was moving, if at different rates for different places.But the globalisation of goods and capital had already begun to plateau or stagnate since the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC). Trade as a percentage of global GDP rose from 39% in 1991 to 61% in 2008 but has remained flat over the past decade. The figure stands at 59% in 2018. Similarly, net foreign direct investment inflows, which were never under 1% of global GDP before 1989, occasionally crossed 4% over the past 30 years. But by 2018, it had dropped precipitously to 1.4%, its lowest level since 1996. Similarly, personal remittance flows, previously on the rise, flattened to around 0.75% of global GDP.There are several causes for the great stagnation in the globalisation of goods and capital. It became increasingly apparent that not all countries, societies, and people were benefitting equally from globalisation, and that soon began to be reflected in national and international politics. The United States’ (US) sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2007-08, and its spillover to the eurozone, exacerbated national sentiment in Europe, which had previously been a model of international integration. The assumption that China’s rise would result in similar development opportunities for others proved unfounded. As one business leader cynically put it to me, “China, after climbing up the ladder, is kicking it out from under everyone else.” In hindsight, the economically nationalist impulses of countries as different as the US (“America First”) and India (“Make in India”) were a natural consequence.A similar flattening has been underway in the globalisation of energy. Net international energy trade, which stood at 1.5 billion tonnes of oil equivalent in 1990, swelled to 2.5 billion by 2008 but then grew only moderately to 2.8 billion by 2018. But the drivers have been different: Increases in energy efficiency, the rise of renewables, and new sources as a result of fracking.Other aspects of globalisation have not seen as much of a plateau after 2008. In fact, the globalisation of people accelerated, although in a manner that was partial and subordinate to national interests. The stock of global migrants grew steadily from 190 million in 2005 to 243 million a decade later. The number of international tourist arrivals rose from 900 million in 2009 to 1.4 billion in 2018. Similarly, on the face of it, the globalisation of information did not slow down. The percentage of Internet users around the world more than doubled from 22% in 2008 to 50% in 2017, although the national, cultural, and corporate Balkanisation of information firmly set in.How could Covid-19 impact these trends? There will almost certainly be calls for the re-nationalisation of manufacturing, particularly for what are considered critical or essential goods. The recent bickering over personal protective equipment (PPE) and pharmaceuticals have brought this to the fore. This will further complicate trade agreements, both those in force and those under negotiation.The globalisation of people, including short-term tourist or business traffic, may face new kinds of restrictions. National governments will have to weigh the risks of contagious diseases against the benefits of ease of travel or may have to consider stronger safeguards. In turn, the globalisation of finance will be indirectly affected: Less migration and business travel coupled with incentives to invest at home will hinder transnational capital flows.The globalisation of information may confront a paradox. On the one hand, information will be more available, important, and shareable than ever. On the other hand, we may well see greater monitoring of individual information. The SARS epidemic of 2003 was a watershed for the use of mass surveillance and big data by governments in the interest of public health. Similar sentiments in a post-Covid-19 world may contribute further to the nationalisation of data.On balance, the coronavirus pandemic may further slow down (or possibly even reverse) certain globalising trends that had already decelerated. The risk of supply chain disruptions will feature to a greater degree in trade calculations. Decisions about lowering barriers to international travel will face greater scrutiny. Information may continue to become more plentiful, but will be more jealously guarded. The ongoing phase of globalisation has recovered from systemic shocks before, such as 9/11, SARS, and the GFC. But the omnipresence of Covid-19 presents a challenge of a different magnitude.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-global-pandemic-and-globalisation/story-67lC3lnxv6ZsxUFVqk9EPI.html
08-04-2020||News||In times of a lockdown, why the courts matter| Analysis||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on March 24 to put India under a nationwide lockdown was followed by a notification that contained a list of essential services that would be allowed to operate. One notable exception from this list was legal services.Nonetheless, the events of the first two weeks under lockdown have made it clear that the courts are an indispensable public service, a vital check and balance on State excesses, especially in a country where executive action is characterised by opacity and a lack of access.Regardless of the omission, the Supreme Court (SC) and various high courts (with the enthusiastic assistance and cooperation of their respective bars) have improvised and adapted admirably. Video conferences and e-filings have demonstrated that there is an easier (and more efficient) way to do things. Despite being hamstrung by omission from the March 24 list, the courts are attempting to ensure that matters of “extreme urgency” are heard and addressed. They have demonstrated that the value of the courts, especially in times of crisis, cannot be a matter of debate. There are three illustrations from the period under lockdown that support this proposition. First, the watchmen argument. That, without the fear of review or supervision, certain members of the police force may fall prey to dictatorial tendencies. Images of policemen zealously using lathis or visiting medieval humiliations on violators who have stepped out for legitimate purposes of buying medicines or groceries, have been disturbing. Some states, like Punjab, sought to take immediate corrective action when these incidents were brought to the notice of the state’s leadership, but others offered no apology or explanation. Violence has no place in a civilised society and the boundaries of State power or the interpretation of how elastic the ambit of section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is, cannot be left to the varying consciences of the political leadership in different states.Second, the courts are the last refuge for the voiceless. In the first week of the lockdown, the SC on its motion passed a far-sighted order, directing the release of undertrials in custody for non-heinous offences. Another example is that of the Delhi High Court directing (two days after the announcement) the free treatment of an 18-month-old child with a rare illness. Ensuring justice when constitutional and statutory rights are especially vulnerable is a principal function of the judiciary.Third, the review of arbitrariness in State action. In a country as large as India, policy conception often collides with implementation. There is a real temptation on the part of certain officials to choose convenience over constitutional safeguards. This concern is also what preoccupies a large part of the fields of constitutional and administrative law. The lockdown was a measure supported by all political parties, but as issues of migrant and unorganised sector workers grew in size, different states responded with measures that ranged from humane — waiving transport costs and rents and providing food — to the draconian — spraying migrant workers and excessive use of force. The SC passed detailed directions last week (before declining to intervene further in another later petition) to address these concerns, but imagine if it hadn’t. The power to make policy does not exempt the government from ensuring that it satisfies the rigours of Article 14 of the Constitution; that State action must demonstrate the application of mind that it must be free from malice, and above all, must not be arbitrary.There is an oft-cited caution attributed to Benjamin Franklin, “Those who sacrifice individual liberty to secure a temporary safety, deserve neither.” In a country of over a billion individuals battling an unprecedented epidemic, this might be a tad harsh, but it contains a relevant warning that will have a bearing on the nation that emerges from this crisis. It is not just the State that will be judged by its handling of the crisis, but also the courts whose legacy will be defined by how, even in a crisis, they ensured that the Constitution reigned supreme.On a separate, but related note, it must also be observed that the rapid Covid-19 response measures introduced by the SC and followed by other high courts have demonstrated that technology renders several of the old formalities obsolete. The SC has also come up with detailed guidelines for this to continue when normal hearings resume. Filing remotely through an online portal addresses excessive paper usage, while helping reduce overcrowding. It is also faster. The proceedings using video conferencing demonstrate the efficiency with which an argument can be concluded. True, this lacks the majesty, the pageantry and the thrill that comes with the prestige of arguing in historic courtrooms.But it is a swifter route to justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-times-of-a-lockdown-why-the-courts-matter-analysis/story-SN6EN8t3Lg09WOUrAk7n0K.html
08-04-2020||News||The coronavirus is found in bats. How did it reach us?||The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has engulfed the world within a span of a few weeks, sending billions into lockdown. Amid the confusion and scare, “patient zero” has been traced back to a wildlife market in Wuhan, China. Preliminary studies indicate that the coronavirus from bats infected humans, through a wild animal, Malayan pangolins. The genomic resemblance between the Pangolin coronavirus and Sars-CoV-2 (Covid-19 virus) is what has brought about this assumption.Bats, pangolins and humans are not cohabitants, which acts as a “species barrier”, preventing the virus naturally found in bats from jumping to other species. But environmental crimes like wildlife poaching and consumption result in the breaking of the species barrier. The presence of Malayan pangolins (natural inhabitants of Southeast Asia’s forests) in the Chinese meat market strongly points towards illicit wildlife trade and trafficking. Malayan pangolins are hunted for their skin, scales, meat and for ingredients in oriental medicine. All species of pangolins are included in Cites Appendix I, which means their international trade is prohibited.As per the World Customs Organization’s Illicit Trade Report, in 2018, customs administrations from 47 countries reported 2,727 seizures of flora and fauna – which amounts to 59,150 pieces and 3,60,495 kg of various flora and fauna. Being rich in biodiversity, the Indian subcontinent, Africa and South America are most vulnerable for wildlife crimes and trafficking. In most of the cases, the destination remains China. Wildlife animals and products such as rhino horns, ivory, live pangolins and their scales, turtles and tortoises, snakes and their skin, mongoose, sea horses, sea cucumber, crocodile skin and porcupines are trafficked in substantial quantities.Several Wuhan-type wet and dry markets are operational in China, Thailand and Vietnam that have a demand for exotic wildlife articles. In China alone, domestic wildlife farming is assessed as a billion-dollar industry. The rich and the privileged are the prime consumers of wildlife products, primarily because of the superstitions surrounding traditional Chinese medicine and false pride associated with the ownership of certain wildlife articles. Rhino horn, pangolin scales and tiger bones are used in traditional medicines, aphrodisiac recipes and in body-building tonics. Scientific studies completely condemn and disprove these beliefs. On the contrary, the Chinese wildlife market has seen an alarming rise in demand for rhino horn extract, due to a false belief that it can help treat Covid-19. Wildlife farming and consumption of wild meat in China have historical reasons such as famine and poverty. Gradually, it evolved into a tradition.Wet markets sell live meat, fish and marine products. Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai and Burmese wet markets are notorious for selling game meat and other numerous wildlife items. They keep live animals in cages, stacked one above the other. If the topmost cage has bats and those below it have turtles, civets, ducks, porcupine and pangolins, it can lead to the mixing of their excreta and fluids. It makes the entire stock a natural mixing bowl, helping the virus cross the species barrier. Such congested and stressful circumstance reduces immunity and results in the multiplication of the virus, and infection and transmission of the disease.When humans slaughter or dress the affected animals, they contract the virus. Inside the human body, the virus undergoes mutation, which can result in the pandemic of the current magnitude. The emergence of Covid-19 and the role of the Wuhan market is still under investigation. However, the 2003 outbreak of the Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pandemic was ultimately traced back to masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), traded in China’s Shenzhen wet market.In 2010, Indian customs had prevented an attempt to import over 10,000 red-eared turtles from China. Later, it was found that, according to International Union for Conservation of Nature’s classification, the seized turtles were considered as one of the most invasive species on the earth. Its potential to outnumber the native turtle population and the microbial cargo it would have brought along give an idea about the severity of the crime.A crazy pet culture poses yet another threat to the environment and global health. Many consider reptiles, turtles, wild lizards and other exotic species as new age pets. Close contact with such pets offers an opportunity for a virus like Covid-19 to cross species barriers and infect humans. Unless strictly prohibited, the illicit trade of wildlife and the new age pet culture have the potential to turn into another pandemic bomb.Anees Cherkunnath is an IRS officer posted with Indian Customs.

08-04-2020||Mumbai||Wearing masks mandatory in mumbai or face arrest: BMC||Citing several studies pointing out that wearing masks can reduce the scope of spreading coronavirus, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) made it mandatory for citizens to wear masks in public places. Failing to do so may result in offenders getting arrested under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the BMC said in a circular. Meanwhile, the BMC maintained that Mumbai has not entered stage three of the outbreak, which is community transmission, amid speculation owing to the spike in daily cases. A circular, issued by municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi, stated that the civic body has decided in public interest to make masks necessary for any person moving in public places. The circular stated that citizens must wear three-ply or cloth mask. The BMC circular read, “Any person moving around in his personal or official vehicle must be wearing masks. No person/ officer will attend any meeting/ gathering, workplace without wearing these masks.”The BMC circular said these masks may be standard ones available with the chemist or even homemade, washable masks and can be reused after proper washing and disinfecting them.The BMC circular further noted that those not wearing masks can be arrested. The circular stated, “Anybody violating these instructions will be punishable under section 188 of IPC and will be strictly penalised and arrested by police officers or officers appointed by the assistant commissioners of wards. All these officers are hereby authorised to take any actions to penalise such violators stringently.Earlier, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his address via social media, has appealed to citizens to wear masks while going out. Thackeray appealed to citizens to wear masks or even use a clean cotton handkerchief that can act as mask.According to the civic body, Mumbai reported 72 fresh cases and six fatalities on Wednesday. The city now has 714 coronavirus cases and 45 deaths.As of Wednesday, the BMC has tested around 14,000 patients for coronavirus, which is around 70% of the 20,000 tests done by Maharashtra. It has tested around 1,012 patients at fever clinics set up in 241 containment zones of the city. The BMC is also planning a drive-through sample collection plan for detecting coronavirus where patients drive in and get tested without getting out of the cars.Dharavi, India’s largest slum, saw six new cases of Covid-19 and one death on Wednesday, bringing the tally to 13 cases, including two deaths.The BMC is tracing and quarantining close contacts of the new cases, which include a 50-year-old cleaner working in KEM Hospital, a 25-year-old from Mukund Nagar slum and a 35-year-old in Dhanwada chawl.Mahim also saw its first two cases of coronavirus on Wednesday. This includes a nurse working at Breach Candy Hospital and staying in Mahim and a 43-year-old man, who has a mutton shop in Worli, which is one of the worst-affected spots in the city. In G-South Ward, which also includes Worli and Prabhadevi area, the number of cases stood at 138, and it has seen the highest spike in number of cases when compared to other wards in the city. In just one day from April 6 to 7, the cases went up from 78 to 133. Nearly 70% of the 590 coronavirus cases in Mumbai on Tuesday do not have any international travel history and were infected after they came in contact with those who travelled abroad. Dr Daksha Shah, deputy director, health department of the BMC said, “We are not in stage three of community transmission. According to the Central government, we are in the later phase of stage two. Out of 590 cases that we have detected up to Tuesday, only 20 to 25% have international travel history, and rest all are based on contact.”Shah added, “The high number of those being detected positive without any travel history is because we are doing rigorous contact tracing of those tested positive. Along with this, we are also doing community testing by setting up fever clinics.”The BMC has been tracing close contacts by classifying them as high-risk and low-risk contacts of those who tested positive. After tracing the close contacts, the BMC seals a particular area where the close contacts reside or work, and these areas are termed as containment zones. The Thane police commissioner has also issued a circular, making it compulsory for residents to wear a mask while going in a public place. Vivek Phansalkar, police commissioner, Thane, said, “People are supposed to wear a mask, while going out of their house. They will have to wear a mask even if they are commuting in their own vehicle and at place of work. They can use a mask available at chemist shop or a homemade cloth mask, which is reusable. People found not wearing a mask will be booked under section 188 for violations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/wearing-masks-mandatory-in-mumbai-or-face-arrest-bmc/story-qHRfpD5N0mi27hLge6sSnJ.html

08-04-2020||Chandigarh||Only 100 farmers to be allowed to enter Haryana mandis per day||With social distancing being the key to success of the upcoming procurement season, Haryana government’s agencies on Wednesday decided that every day, only 100 farmers will be allowed to bring their farm produce to the state mandis.The mustard procurement will start on April 15, while wheat will be procured April 20 onwards. The process will go on till June 30 at over 2,000 procurement centres for wheat and about 135 for mustard. Haryana state agricultural marketing board issued guidelines to all market committees on Wednesday, stating that only 50 farmers each will be allowed in a mandi from 8am to 2pm and 2.30pm to 6pm daily to maintain physical distance in view of Covid-19 outbreak. MUSTARD, GRAM PURCHASE CAPS LIKELY TO GET RELAXEDWhile there is no daily limit on wheat buying, there is a cap on the purchase of mustard (25 quintal per day) and gram (20 quintal per day) from one farmer.However, officials said the state government on Wednesday requested the Union agriculture minister to raise the mustard and gram purchase limit to 40 quintals per day. The increase in daily quantity would mean lesser visits to mandis by farmers.“Also, we are seeking an increase in the quantity of mustard and gram procured by Nafed from 25% to 40%,” said an official. The procurement of mustard and gram is done under the price support scheme (PSS). It comes into operation when the prices in open market fall below MSP. As per the existing norms, only 25% of the mustard and gram crop can be bought under the PSS by the procurement agencies at MSP. CENTRES TO BE ARHTIYA SPECIFICOfficials are expecting to learn from mustard procurement. “We will be able to figure out whether the 50-50 farmer model is workable or we need to modify it for wheat,” said a top official. The officials said they have worked out a system to ensure that farmers affiliated to a particular arhtiya arrive with their produce at one particular centre. “This will save the commission agents from exhausting resources since every arhtiya will have an earmarked centre,” said an official.E-GATE PASS In order to regulate and stagger the procurement, the market committee will ensure that all produce —wheat, mustard and black gram — enters the mandi on the basis of online e-gate passes available only for registered and verified farmers. However, unregistered farmers have been asked to apply for registration up to April 19 on the Meri Fasal Mera Byora portal.The market committee in consultation with the mandi association concerned will issue a daily schedule to invite registered farmers with their produce. DEDICATED 24X7 HELPLINE A dedicated 24x7 toll-free helpline, 1800-180-2060, will get operational by April 13 to address issues related to procurement, infrastructure and Covid-19. To minimise the health risk to those engaged in operations and ensure that the mandis do not become a node of transmission, market committees have been directed to follow the sanitation protocols and safety procedures such as social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/only-100-farmers-to-be-allowed-to-enter-haryana-mandis-per-day/story-MPlJim0iCUKFqfWsaFsA9H.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||Byculla zoo stocks up on its supplies for animals||Amid broken supply chain and delay in getting essential goods, Mumbai’s Byculla zoo has made preparations to keep its animals well-fed by ensuring there will be no short supply of food. The freezers in the zoo are now equipped to store fish, meat, fruits, and vegetables that will be sufficient for 10 to 12 days in case of unavailability of fresh supply if an extended lockdown in implemented in Maharashtra. Dr Sanjay Tripathi, director of the zoo, said, “We can deep freeze food in larger quantities as contingency if the situation worsens. Otherwise animals are fed fresh food.” Byculla zoo currently houses 300 animals and birds. Tigers, leopard, hyena, and jackal are carnivores who need meat while birds, sloth bear eat fruits, berries and vegetables; and penguins eat fish. Tripathi said, “During the partial lockdown in early March, the zoo bought two deep freezers of 500-litre capacity each to store meat, fish, vegetables and fruits for our herbivores and carnivores. We already have one deep freezer with 500-litre capacity. This allows the zoo to store food to last 10 to 12 days, in case of emergency.” Zoo authorities are also disinfecting the food given to animals with a safe solution diluted in water. The food is dipped in this solution for less than a minute and then thoroughly washed with fresh water. There are 20 odd zoo staffers who live on the premises to take care of the animals round the clock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/byculla-zoo-stocks-up-on-its-supplies-for-animals/story-0obruozblXYnuHkuhXxnpM.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||6 new cases in Dharavi, 1 more death||Dharavi, India’s largest slum, saw six new cases of Covid-19 and one death on Wednesday, bringing the tally to 13 cases and two deaths.A 64-year-old patient, who was admitted with fever, cough and breathlessness on Tuesday died the same day, but his death was confirmed on Wednesday. The six new cases from the slum cluster includes a couple, a 59-year-old man and 49-year-old woman; a 50-year-old cleaner, 64-year-old patient who died and two men aged 25 and 35. The cleaner used to work in KEM Hospital in Parel, while the 25-year-old resides in Mukund Nagar area and the 35-year-old is resident of Dhanwada chawl. According to BMC, none of them had travel history. The police and the civic body have also tracked 20-25 people from Dharavi, who had attended the Tabligi Jamaat event in Delhi and quarantined them. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s G north ward, said, “The police traced around 20-25 Tabligi Jamaat attendees, based on the list they received from the Centre. None has tested positive yet.’’ Meanwhile, in a statement issued on Wednesday, the BMC said it has identified a quarantine facility for around 11,000 people. The BMC has been scouting for space to quarantine those who live in small houses, where isolation is not possible. Till now, 900 such people have been identified. The 240-hectare slum pocket has 850,000 residents and a population density of 66,000 per square kilometre, making it one of the more cramped spaces in Mumbai, the world’s fifth most densely populated city. Activists and health workers had expressed concerns over how social distancing is practically impossible in an area where an average of 10-12 people stay in each of 57,000 housing units measuring around 250 sq ft.However, BMC, which runs the city’s nodal health department, said on Friday that its officers had a containment plan in place for Dharavi almost a month ago. “We ran a house-to-house survey to get the actual figure of the slum dwellers to keep our amenities ready,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC, told HT last week. “This helped us list high-risk people living with co-morbid issues such as cardiac ailments, respiratory problems, hypertension and diabetes, among others.”HT had reported on Friday that a group of 800 community health volunteers is in place. The first batch of 200 was trained by the BMC, and they are training 600 more to sensitise others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/6-new-cases-in-dharavi-1-more-death/story-WcrWI0kD6gX6JWXI7ivcsM.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||40 staffers from Bhabha Hospital under quarantine||Around 40 staff members including nurses, lab assistants and paramedical staff of KB Bhabha Hospital in Bandra (West) have been quarantined after a patient, who tested positive for Covid-19, died at the hospital, an official said on Monday. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has identified only high-risk staff for possible exposure to coronavirus as of now. However, employees of the civic-run hospital demanded that the entire staff be quarantined as precaution without further delay.“As of now, we have identified our 40 staff members who have been exposed to a Covid-19 patient, and kept them in quarantine. Swab samples of these employees have been sent for test,” said Pradeep Jadhav, medical superintendent at the hospital.Dr Daksha Shah, deputy director, the health department of the BMC, said, “It is not necessary to quarantine those who were not exposed to patient. But we are ready to do it if required.”The 45-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital’s general ward on Saturday and died on Tuesday following severe breathing difficulty.Hospital staff, however, had mixed reaction to the BMC’s move, with many disappointed as their family members have not been put in quarantine as well. On Wednesday morning, over 150 nursing staff, paramedics and other workers of hospital also staged a protest.“Yes, it is good to move to quarantine 40 staffers. But, what about the other employees and our family members? We demand immediate quarantine of all staffers,” said Bharat Katare, a medical staff who was among the protesters.Bhatia Hospital stops non-emergency servicesAfter Jaslok and Wockhardt hospitals, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has stopped all non-emergency services at Bhatia Hospital after three patients were diagnosed with coronavirus. After three symptomatic patients, admitted there, tested positive for Coronavirus BMC collected swab samples from 70 hospital employees as per protocol. BMC has also taken swab samples of around 20 staffers from Hinduja Hospital in Khar after a Covid-19 patient got diagnosed. The patient is stable and has been to Seven Hills Hospital. “The OPD and emergency services will be functional. However, we have shut down the ICU, where the patient was admitted, temporarily,” said an official from the hospital.(With inputs from Rupsa Chakraborty)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/40-staffers-from-bhabha-hospital-under-quarantine/story-ubyFEwMlgqgA83k3wc31FP.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||Why was Jamaat event permitted, asks Deshmukh||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday raised several questions over the Ijtema (international congregation) organised at Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin in Delhi last month, pointing a finger at the central government for the entire fiasco. The minister questioned why the permission was given to such a huge religious gathering even as coronavirus outbreak had begun in the country. He also questioned whether certain important persons had relations with Tablighi Jamaat, and why Maulana Saad, who is the main organiser of the programme, is absconding after National Security Advisor Ajit Doval visited the headquarters of Tablighi Jamaat at midnight of the event.Deshmukh’s remarks came in even as his party chief Sharad Pawar told the Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the focus of the government should be made on containing the epidemic rather than blaming a particular community for rise in Covid-19 in backdrop of Delhi’s Nizamuddin’s incident involving Tablighi Jamaat. He also suggested to PM Modi to put on hold his government’s central vista beautification project and also asked for release of state’s share in the central taxes.“What were the secret talks that took place between Doval and Maulana Saad past midnight (of the event last month) after the former visited the Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin. Why Maulana Saad is absconding day after their meeting and where is he now,” said Deshmukh in a statement issued on his letterhead and signed by him. In it he also questioned why both Doval and Delhi police commissioner maintained silence on the entire issue.“Most people have acknowledged the seriousness of Covid-19 epidemic. The Nizamuddin incident in Delhi raised concerns about the spread of the disease. Now, we need to focus on how to prevent the spread of the disease. It is not appropriate to blame or criticize any community,” Pawar said in his interaction with the Prime Minister held on Wednesday to discuss solutions to deal with the crisis following epidemic outbreak.The home minister had, on Tuesday, announced to take stern action against 50-60 attendees of the Tablighi Jamaat programme for not having reported to the authorities despite several appeals. He said that out of 1400 such attendees of the programme, rest have been traced out by the authorities.The group had organised a religious gathering between March 13 and 15 attended by more than 2000 people. The gathering believably led to a spike in the spread of coronavirus after the attendees went back to their hometowns across the country.Deshmukh has said that the union home ministry is responsible for this as it failed to stop the gathering organised by the religious group. Without naming anybody, Deshmukh has trained the guns believably at the union home ministry for giving permission to such a huge gathering after the outbreak of the Covid-19.Pawar also said that the central government should also look at how the state government’s income will increase. “States have not yet received their share of GST. It should be transferred immediately. Also, agriculture sector has been severely damaged. The central government should take steps to provide immediate relief to the farmers and those dependent on agriculture,” the NCP chief suggested the PM.Pawar opined that the government need take drastic steps to mitigate the financial crisis and hence non-plan expenditure will have to be reduced. “The central government has proposed to construct a new Parliament House. This plan should also be reconsidered or it could be postponed after examining the priorities,” he said.The veteran leader also objected to the orders issued by the governors directly to the bureaucracy and said that the instructions should be routed through the chief minister office or chief secretary to avoid multiple power centres. “It is heard that in some states the instructions are being issued by Honorable Governor directly to the bureaucracy. Though Hon. Governor has the authority to do so, the instructions have to be routed through Hon. @CMOMaharashtra and the Chief Secretary’s office in order to avoid multiple power centers and probable hindrances in the coordination of administration, Pawar tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-was-jamaat-event-permitted-asks-deshmukh/story-wr9oGBq64F9SA3y4dDOmBL.html

08-04-2020||Gurugram||Vegetable shops at Gurugram’s Khandsa market to follow odd-even formula amid Covid lockdown||A day after the retail sale of fruits and vegetables at the Khandsa wholesale market was suspended, the district administration on Wednesday decided to allow bulk sales from odd and even-numbered shops on odd and even dates, respectively. The step has been taken to ensure that norms of social distancing are strictly observed in the city’s largest market, which is generally crowded, said officials.Officials said that strict action would be taken against traders and visitors who don’t follow social distancing rules. Barricades would also be set up at the entry and exit points of the market. “Only those who buy in bulk, or buy to sell on their vends and carts in villages or other parts of the city, will be allowed entry,” an official familiar with the matter said.The directions were issued by Jitender Yadav, subdivisional magistrate, on Wednesday, after a spot visit in the morning. Shopkeepers and visitors who were not maintaining social distance or wearing masks were penalised.“Directions have been issued to all commission agents and shopkeepers that from April 9, shops will be opened on the basis of the odd-even formula. On Thursday, which is April 9, the shops with odd numbers will be allowed to open and on April 10, shops with even numbers will open. The decision has been taken to ensure further prevention of coronavirus,” said Yadav.The move to introduce the odd-even formula for the wholesale market comes in the wake of the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in neighbouring Faridabad, Palwal and Nuh, where the government has been forced to mark large containment zones to prevent the spread of the pandemic.Vinay Yadav, executive officer and secretary of the Khandsa Mandi association, said that there are 119 large and 53 smaller shops operating from the market. “The decision to introduce odd-even formula was taken on the direction of the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, to ensure social distancing norms are followed strictly. There would be no shortage of fruits and vegetables, as there is adequate supply and stocks in storage,” he said.Earlier on Tuesday, the Haryana Agricultural Marketing Board and Khandsa Market Committee had banned the retail sale of vegetables and fruits after large crowds gathered at different spots in the market. The committee has also decided that the market will remain operational from early morning till 9am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/vegetable-shops-at-gurugram-s-khandsa-market-to-follow-odd-even-formula-amid-covid-lockdown/story-wLzlbrDtOFd7GebM3TxI7M.html
08-04-2020||Delhi||Dr Lal PathLabs to start mobile Covid testing units||Dr Lal PathLabs, one of the leading private diagnostic laboratory networks in India, will soon start mobile units for testing people for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It is one of 65 private laboratories across the country that have been approved by country’s apex biomedical research organisation, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to test for Covid-19.“We are setting up mobile testing units. The process is currently on to make it happen, and it should start in a week or so,” said Dr Vandana Lal, whole-time director, Dr Lal PathLabs. “We have to look for safer options. In other countries, telephone booth type set-ups are used, where only the technician’s arm sticks out while testing a suspect. In these mobile units, which will be going door-to-door, only the arm of the person testing will stick out. And since the patients will not be driving around the city to get tested, this option is safer,” she added.After a private laboratory in Delhi started a drive-through Covid-19 testing site, the ICMR came out with a detailed advisory on drive-through testing of Covid-19 patients. Delhi-based Dr Dangs Lab became India’s first Covid-19 testing laboratory to have started a drive-through sample collection site in its centre at West Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh area.The ICMR’s new advisory on sample collection said safety measures must be strictly followed. “The ICMR has no objection to the adoption of establishing convenient sample collection sites (drive-through centres for sample collection, etc.) by the respective State governments. However, the following advice is provided by the ICMR: the sample collection should be done using recommended personal protective equipment; these sites should be disinfected regularly as per recommended procedures; all recommended biosafety and biosecurity precautions should be implemented; sample transport to the nearest Covid-19 testing laboratory should be ensured under proper cold-chain conditions and with triple-layered packing,” the advisory read.“All our staff is well trained, and knows how to manage the testing modalities,” said Lal. In all, 139 government and 65 private labs are testing for Covid-19 in India. To date, 121,271 samples have been tested in government labs, and 2,267 samples have been tested in private laboratories, of which 5,872 samples have tested positive. India has seen 178 deaths related to Covid-19. Since the numbers are rising, the ICMR is preparing to scale up their testing capacity and bring it up to one-lakh tests a day, if required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dr-lal-pathlabs-to-start-mobile-covid-testing-units/story-u8GmVXcwkdpg4nsvC7XZuO.html
08-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: The first time they had a proper meal since Covid lockdown||For the first time in three days, more than 100 underprivileged families in Surat Nagar slept on a full stomach, on April 2. Their food was on the verge of running out when help arrived from the Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, a citizens’ group that has been working towards providing food to labourers and migrant workers left stranded in the city since the beginning of the 21-day nationwide lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the Sars-Cov-2.The group is a collective of around 2,000 local residents who are using their resources to channelise food items and rations, reaching out to underprivileged families on a daily basis. For this, they have put in place a process to first scan appeals received personally or through social media to determine the urgency and choose recipients, pack rations, and then transport them to those in need.“We have a team of over 2,000, all regular residents of the city, each of whom contributed money for this initiative,” said Rahul Roy, a member of the Manch overlooking the operations said.Roy says the process of providing food usually begins some days before it reaches residents — the starting point is the appeals that come through “Whatsapp groups, mass organisations, NGOs and individuals.”In the hours that follow, a team of 10 verifies basic details over the phone to determine if the area indeed has a demand and whether it is getting ration supply from another volunteer group. Subsequently, a site visit is conducted by a volunteer to gauge the needs of the area, ascertain a point of local contact, the number of households in need of rations, and their addresses, along with basic identification details.Once this process is through, a procurement team works towards gathering the rations using contributions made by members of the Manch as well as residents of the city. These are then stored and packaged at a catering facility in Udyog Vihar which, prior to the lockdown, would sell food to offices and organisations.Each package given to a family by the group has five kilogram (kg) of rice, five kg flour, one litre bottle of mustard oil, one kg salt, 500 grams turmeric, some coriander and red chilli powder, one soap bar and 1.5 kg of pulses.“We volunteered to help the Manch supply food to those in need ever since the lockdown began. I have a team of six who pack all these items and when the volunteers arrive, they load the rations in their cars,” says Vipin Sharma, who runs the catering facility.It is around noon that these vehicles – usually around 10-15 in number – arrive at the facility to pick up the rations and deliver them to local contacts across the city.“It is the local contacts who are further responsible for overseeing their distribution to individual families,” said Roy, adding that the team of volunteers are divided a day in advance, as per the demand.For example, if 100 packets of ration are required in Sirhaul village then three members are allotted the task of delivering the rations in their individual vehicles. If it is a smaller number, such as 10-15 packets that need to be dropped near the Hero Honda Chowk, for instance, then one volunteer’s vehicle would suffice.On an average, members say ration is supplied to 250 to 300 families every day across areas that include Nathupur village, Khandsa road, Railway road, Sarhaul village, and Sikanderpur, which have a high concentration of migrant and daily wage workers who are out of work and hence have no money to purchase essential items for a living, and are on the brink of starvation.“Most of these slum dwellers work as daily wage earners, auto-rickshaw drivers, construction workers and domestic helps. The lockdown has left them in a lurch since they lead a hand-to-mouth existence. With no work, they do not have the money to procure food and feed their families,” said Gulaab, a member of the Surat Nagar Mahila Samiti, which coordinated the ration supply that reached the area’s residents last week.Located close to the Daulatabad flyover, sandwiched between the Dwarka Expressway and the railway tracks, Surat Nagar in Sector 104 is an area of contrast — concrete houses with winding, narrow lanes are set off against small slum clusters that appear unexpectedly, scattered across the neighbourhood.Hailing mostly from Bengal and Bihar, the migrant workers who reside in these slums say they have been struggling to find even one square meal a day ever since the 21-day lockdown was imposed, and were expecting to run out of rations by the second weekend of April.Salim Alam, an auto-rickshaw driver, said, “My earnings have come down to zero ever since the lockdown has been imposed. I cannot take my vehicle out on the roads, and there are no passengers even if I try. I have been feeding my family of five using whatever money remained, but I could not have continued in this way even until the end of this week. The rations we have received today have saved our lives.”For the volunteers engaged in distribution works, however, the task is not without its cons, with them risking themselves to infections as they visit highly congested areas to complete the job.“We take multiple precautions. The basics, of course, are that we all wear masks and gloves and carry hand sanitisers with us. In addition, the moment we enter our homes after completing the delivery, we go straight for a shower and put our clothes in the wash, to avoid any infection we may have caught from impacting our surroundings,” said Shehnaz Hussain, a member of the group who lives in Sector 5.In order to ensure that the process of delivery is smooth, the group members say they have given additional guidelines to their volunteers as well and cautioned them to ensure that they “don’t get mobbed”. Furthermore, considering the short supply of rations, volunteers have been advised to abandon the task if, while delivering, they sense that ration has already reached the people through other sources.The fight for the volunteers is, they say, not just a physical one against coronavirus as they expose themselves to risk of infection by roaming around the city and handling goods but also an emotional one, as they struggle to persuade their families on a daily basis to let them go out. Among them is Vipin, a caterer, who says leaving his house for the work is a daily struggle as he has to convince his family members that it is worth the risk.“My relatives are very concerned about me as I go out on a daily basis for this work. They keep on trying to dissuade me and tell me to stay in the house like everyone else but I cannot do that. The work I am doing is for the greater good. There are people who are not getting even one square meal a day for no fault of theirs; it is nothing short of my duty to help in any way I can,” said Vipin.HOW A PACKET OF RATION IS PROVIDED TO THOSE IN NEEDStep 1: A team of around 10 members from Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch scan Whatsapp groups, or get alerts from mass organisations, NGOs and individuals about those in dire need of rationsStep 2: The team then identifies a local point of contact in the area and verifies whether there is an actual need, and also ascertains the quantity of which it is neededStep 3: A team of volunteers then collect packets of ration — each consisting of five kg rice, five kg flour, one-litre mustard oil, one kg salt, 500 grams turmeric, coriander powder, red chilli powder, one soap bar, and 1.5 kg pulses, from a warehouse in Udyog Vihar and loads the same in their private vehicles.Step 4: They then drop off the rations with their local contact, who is responsible for overseeing the distribution||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-the-first-time-they-had-a-proper-meal-since-covid-lockdown/story-cZZgKzRSfCQsroQDY2FUTL.html
08-04-2020||Delhi||AIIMS issues clarification on usage of masks||A day after asking doctors to reuse their masks four times, authorities from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi have issued a one-page standard operating procedure for doing so on Wednesday. After using a mask for a day, it has to be numbered and kept in a correspondingly numbered “big brown bag” for four days before reusing it; “sunlight is not necessary”.“On day 1, wear mask no 1 when you step out for duty. On day 2, use mask no 2. After you return home, place the used N95 mask in paper bag no 2 and let it dry out for the next four days. Do the same for day 3 and day 4,” the standard operating procedure reads.The fifth mask is a reserve. After the masks have been reused over 20 days, they have to be brought back in the paper bags and discarded as medical waste in the hospital, according to the document, which cites the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC). Guidelines for reusing masks have been issued by the CDC keeping in mind the shortage during the Covid-19 crisis, but that has come after many American hospitals reached near-capacity. The United States leads the world in the number of Covid-19 infections with close to 400,000 cases. In comparison, India has a little over a tenth of that number.The World Health Organization rules do not address the issue of how many times an N-95 mask must be worn but advises against wearing one respirator for more than four hours since it could lead to discomfort.So far, at least 35 hospital staff have been infected in Delhi. The hospital administration, however, clarified that only staff members in the non-infectious areas of the hospital have to reuse the N-95 masks.“This is a new virus; the doctors and staff members are scared. So, the N-95 masks have been issued to allay the psychological fears and give them confidence while working in the general patient-care areas of the hospital. The masks will also protect the staff in case there is some asymptomatic patient who comes in and later tests positive for the disease,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of the hospital. He said the doctors who are in the high-risk areas such as the screening kiosk, the wards for suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases, and the intensive care unit will get different personal protective equipment. “We have created three levels of kits for those working in the screening area, the wards, and the ICU. The staff will be allotted kits according to their area of posting. These do not have to be reused, just carefully removed and thrown away as medical waste,” said Dr Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aiims-issues-clarification-on-usage-of-masks/story-eeFBCWFsBziuFaCMOofLAJ.html
08-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi police head constable posted at IGI airport immigration tests Covid-19 positive||A 38-year-old Delhi Police head constable, currently posted at the Bureau of Immigration, Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi, has tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Wednesday. Senior officials said that the man had been on leave since March 31 because the immigration department is working with limited staff as all international flight operations are currently suspended. Senior officers from the immigration said the policeman, who was attached with the Foreign Regional Registration Office (FRRO) and lives with his family in Rohini, got himself tested and his reports on Wednesday showed that he was positive for Covid-19.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pramod Kumar Mishra confirmed that the head constable has tested positive for Covid-19 and that he is currently at LNJP Hospital. With immediate effect, his family members and two of his colleagues who used to report to work with him have been asked to quarantine themselves at home, said a senior officer who did not wish to be named.“Since all international flight operations were suspended March 22 onwards there wasn’t much staff working at the immigration bureau at Delhi airport. This reduced the risk of infection to our other employees. As a precautionary measure, the medical screening of other staff members will also be carried out,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-head-constable-posted-at-igi-airport-immigration-tests-covid-19-positive/story-wbJADGR9mS7RGAtdWo3biJ.html
08-04-2020||Gurugram||New Town Heights: Locked inside, Gurugram residents cook for needy in their neighbourhood||Stay home, stay safe. But for hundreds of migrant families in the vicinity of Sector 91, staying home means staying hungry. To ensure that neither coronavirus disease (Covid-19), nor hunger claim lives in their neighbourhood, residents of New Town Heights in Sector 86 have been, through a self-motivated group of resident volunteers, sending simple meals every day by cooking a little extra in their own kitchens. “We have placed a cardboard box in the lobby of each of the 12 towers. Residents were told that the collection will be made at 12pm every day. They can wrap the food in aluminium foils and place it there. It can be anything from roti-sabzi to paratha. The residents have picked up on the initiative and we are close to doubling the number of food packets we collected on the first day when we started,” said Bikas Jha, a resident.In the past five days, since the initiative started, the meal contribution from the condominium of 3,800 residents has doubled from 70 meals to 150, as on Wednesday. The packets collected are distributed to those in need in the low-income neighbourhood of Sector 91, where a large section of the population comprises of migrants mostly employed as domestic helps or daily wage earners. Jha added that the society, which is a part of the DLF Garden City township, has also collected about ₹17,000 to be distributed among nine families of women who work in the society and have been severely hit by the 21-day nationwide lockdown to check community spread of Covid-19. NO ‘WALK IN THE PARK’ THISAmong the several stringent measures taken to ensure social distancing, the society has been maintaining a strict no-walks policy. Residents have been advised to stay inside their apartments and those disobeying are given a strict warning and educated about the deadly respiratory disease that has infected about 15,00,000 people wordwide.“Thrice a day we announce on loudspeakers that residents should not be taking walks in the condominium compound. We have been doing this repeatedly to ensure residents’ safety,” said Yatinder Bhatiya, estate manager of the society. He added that to ease the boredom of staying inside all the time, the management plays soft music throughout the day through speakers placed around the compound.RELAXATION FOR PET PARENTSFor pet owners looking to take their pets for a walk, the society has created “relief areas” outside the society gate. Only one resident is allowed to walk one pet at a time. When they return, they have to mandatorily wash their hands. STOCKING UPThe society has put in place a list of stringent norms to avoid crowding at the departmental store that caters to their daily needs and a grocery vendor who arrives twice a week. “The vendor is here twice a week and we maintain social distancing. At the store, circles have been drawn at a gap of one foot for residents to stand in so as to avoid being too close to each other and crowd,” said Jigar Shah, a resident. Medical health experts recommend a gap of at least 1 metre or 6 feet between two people to ensure the virus cannot be transmitted while sharing a common space. The store staff wears masks and gloves at all times while on duty. All door-step deliveries have been discontinued. Orders placed on e-commerce sites or applications are delivered at the tower lobby. From here, selected volunteer residents deliver them to the apartments, Shah said, adding that people do not move out of their apartments unless absolutely needed. BOARDING FOR STAFFThe society, like many others, has provided accommodation to close to 75 staff members to ensure they do not go home and risk their lives or that of their families. This staff is responsible for housekeeping, cleaning, maintenance, horticulture and other tasks. Vacant townhouses and clubhouses have been furnished with basics to ensure they can stay comfortably, and all their meals are cooked in the now-shut club house. “Mattresses, bedsheets and pillows were provided to the staff. They are provided free meals three times a day. The meals are cooked inside the club kitchen,” Bhatiya said. KEEPING TRACK Residents wishing to step outside the condominium have to sign a self-declaration form stating their reason for going out. “We are maintaining record of residents stepping outside the compound. They have to declare their reason for stepping out,” said Bhatiya.The condominium has made it mandatory for all those passing through its gates, residents and support staff, to wash their hands before entering. Wash basins have been installed at the gate and everyone also has to sanitise their hands in the tower lobby as well.PARTY’S NOW ONLINE In the absence of social gatherings, virtual interactions have come alive among residents. Online groups on messaging platforms have become information exchange centres and play a key role in keeping residents engaged.“We often have residents share games or puzzles in the chat groups to keep spirits high,” said Shah.The society also has a ladies kirtan group which kept residents engaged and cheerful during the recently concluded Navratri festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/new-town-heights-locked-inside-gurugram-residents-cook-for-needy-in-their-neighbourhood/story-WkuvUI3y9WZL9GGB7frhAJ.html
08-04-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal holds e-meeting with MPs on Covid-19, seeks suggestions||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday held a meeting with all the MPs from the national capital on the Covid-19 outbreak in the city .During the meeting, held through video conferencing, Kejriwal urged all the leaders to work collectively in Delhi’s battle against coronavirus. The government later said that all the seven Lok Sabha members — belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — and the three Rajya Sabha members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had interacted with the chief minister and suggested ways to contain the spread of Covid-19.“Discussed the issue of coronavirus with Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs via video conferencing. Several MPs have given good suggestions, which will soon be implemented by the government. We all will have to fight it together,” Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi.Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari suggested that MLAs in Delhi also could take pay cuts similar to the MPs. Tiwari also urged Kejriwal to streamline the process of distributing ration for non-card holders. “The schools where ration is being given are facing large crowds, which is defeating the purpose of social distancing. People are facing a lot of trouble in getting the e-coupons to get the ration. I request you to appoint a few officials at every centre who can facilitate coupon generation at a faster rate,” Tiwari said.AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh called the meeting fruitful and said, “The MPs suggested several things to improve our response to Covid-19, ranging from testing to sanitisation. The CM has assured he will work on every point,” he said. BJP’s east Delhi MP, Gautam Gambhir raised two issues. “Raised two issues with the CM. 1. Preparation of hospitals to deal with spike in cases and stock of equipment. 2. Waving off 2 months’ of electricity bills for small businesses across Delhi post-lockdown. Have to think about Delhi’s health and economy,” he said in a tweet after the meeting.

08-04-2020||Noida||Requests for water ROs, fans to rise with approaching summer||With the summer approaching, the demand for water ROs, fans, refrigerators, ACs, etc., and the maintenance of these electronic appliances is slated to go up in the district, even though they do not fall under the category of essential services.Residents are already coming up with individual requests for the repair of these services which are necessary for day to day life.“With most people staying at home during the lockdown and summers already here, water consumption is high. We have already received five to seven complaints about servicing or repairs of RO systems but the technicians cannot come due to the lockdown. Authorities should issue some passes at least so that we don’t face too many problems going forward,” said Amit Gupta, president, Apartment Owners’ Association, Prateek Wisteria.Residents said that these services don’t look essential at first, but are critical for life.“RO systems need periodic servicing, but mechanics have refused to come home to do so, which has forced us to use alternate methods. This in itself can become a health hazard in the long run, especially as the inherent quality of water in Noida is already poor,” said Preeti, a resident of Gaur City.The public feels that these services have been overlooked. “The Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA) is getting a lot of requests for electricians and plumbers. There were two blackouts in F block but the fault could not be sorted without a trained technician. This is a more serious issue for individual plotted houses located in several Noida sectors. All of these houses also have their own RO plants to get access to safe drinking water and they require frequent servicing. Many residents are facing issues and have resorted to bottled water, which in itself is a risk,” said Sanjeev Kumar, president, RWA, Sector 51.He also said the refrigerator of a family broke down so the residents are now pitching in with daily supplies. So giving access to technicians is important at this time, said Kumar.Residents feel that authorities should add at least authorised service centres to their essential list so that necessary precautions like social distancing can also be maintained.“For top-floor residents of a high rise, not having an AC is adding to the misery. The first two weeks of summer require all such services. Maybe different services can be scheduled sector-wise for ACs, refrigerators and ROs. Some societies have centralised RO systems. If they go down and are not repaired, the entire society may have to go without drinking water,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association.Officials said that these services don’t fall under the category of essential services. However, if the need arises, the government can take the requests under consideration.“We have been approached by an RO company already and we have sent a recommendation for allowing this particular service. As far as the other requests are concerned, summer is still some time away and the lockdown is till April 15. In case it extends, a call can be taken then depending on the situation,” said Anil Kumar, deputy commissioner, industries, Gautam Budh Nagar.The administration and police had issued necessary passes to the personnel of essential services and their supporting industries and are taking action against fraudulent people.On Wednesday, the Sector 24 police had even arrested two men roaming around in the district with fake media I-cards, which comes under essential services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/requests-for-water-ros-fans-to-rise-with-approaching-summer/story-27k7CMTrzelNyoDTBsLo2L.html
08-04-2020||Noida||News of 15 districts being sealed triggers panic buying among residents||With many misunderstanding reports about the sealing of Covid-19 hot spot areas in 15 districts for a complete sealing of the entire district, residents once more went into full panic and came out on to streets to stock up on provisions and essential items.On Wednesday afternoon, the Uttar Pradesh government announced that all 105 hot spot areas -- from where Covid-19 cases had been reported -- would be under an intensive lockdown till the morning of April 14. During this period, a thorough sanitisation exercise will be carried out in the affected areas and all essential items will be delivered to the door step so that no one steps out of home. The news triggered panic among residents and huge queues were spotted outside all major grocery shops across the district with people rushing out to buy provisions.“A news channel was showing that there will be a complete lockdown till April 30. That is why we came out to buy milk and vegetables to last us for the next few days,” an elderly woman, outside a grocery shop in Sector 75, said.People could be seen stocking up on essentials. The situation was similar to what had happened on the night of March 23, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the 21-day nationwide lockdown. Social distancing was forgotten, especially in rural belts of Barola, Harola, Salarpur and Greater Noida, as people clamoured to lay their hands on essential items.Even shop owners started panicking. A pharmacy shop owner in Sector 75 was seen urging customers to buy all they needed as his shop may also be closed.“We have even reduced the price of some commodities to clear out stocks before the shop is closed so that our produce don’t go wasted,” the owner of vegetable and fruits shop said.People blamed unverified news put up on social media for the panic situation. “I had not even switched on the TV. My wife just said that we would be out of potatoes soon so I should get some more. But when I went out, I saw this huge line of people, trying to stock up like crazy. Even if we have to go on a complete lockdown, the authorities will figure out a way to not let us go hungry. Why do people behave in this manner?” Anuj, a resident of Sector 75, said.Officials of the district later clarified that only 12 hot spots in the district will go under intensive lockdown. And while all services in their areas will be shut, online delivery of all essential goods would still be available.Video messages from senior officials in the district urged people to not fall prey to rumours and engage in panic buying.“According to government regulations 12 areas in the district have been identified as hot spots. I request all the citizens to not to resort to panic buying and maintain social distancing and stay inside homes. Even in hot spot areas, all essential items will be delivered to the doorstep. Please don’t believe rumours. The authority will continue to help citizens through its helpline and app for home delivery,” Ritu Maheshwari, CEO, Noida authority, said.Commissioner of police Alok Singh said, “People should stay at home. Daily need items will be delivered to homes and there is no shortage of any food items in the district.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/news-of-15-districts-being-sealed-triggers-panic-buying-among-residents/story-QqrghfWldRL2ggr98AXrAL.html

Interestingly, the 15-year-old golfer raised the amount by selling his 102 trophies which he had won in the past several years. Bhati has earned accolades from PM Modi for his contribution to the PM-Cares Fund. “This wonderful feeling of Indian citizens is the greatest support for the country as it fights novel coronavirus,” the PM tweeted on Tuesday night while praising the young golfer.

So, I decided to sell my trophies to raise funds. I have given away my 102 trophies to raise Rs 4.3 lakh and donated the same to PM-Cares. I feel to do more as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inspires to work for the country selflessly,” said Bhati, a class 10 student of a private school in Greater Noida.Bhati has brought laurels for the family and the country since his early age. He defeated Taiwan’s Jeremy Chen to win the FCG Callaway Junior World Golf Championship 2019 in Palm Desert, California in July last year.

08-04-2020||Lucknow||‘Youths, middle-aged more vulnerable in UP’||Young and middle aged people in Uttar Pradesh are more vulnerable to Sars-Cov-2.Addressing a press conference, principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said after analyzing the Covid- 19 patients’ data, health department experts found that people in the age group of 21-40 years and 41-60 years were more vulnerable to Sars-Cov-2 than the elderly and children.Among the 361 positive cases reported in the state, 44% were in the age group of 21 -40 years and 27% in the age group of 41-60 years. Only 13% of patients were 60 plus and 16% in the age group of zero to twenty years. Earlier, the health department had sounded an alert that senior citizens were more vulnerable to coronavirus.“It seems that senior citizens are taking precautionary measures to protect themselves whereas the youths have ignored the guidance issued by the department for protection from coronavirus,” he said.To intensify the fight against Sars-Cov-2, the health department has decided to focus on tracking, screening and testing. The testing of the samples will be increased from 700 daily to 1500 samples daily. The aim is to identify the infected people and put them in the isolation wards. The health department will collect the samples of the people suffering from influenza or respiratory problems. The samples will be sent to the laboratories for test.The health department wanted to ensure that coronavirus was not spreading in districts that had reported zero positive cases, Prasad said. Out of the 361 positive cases, 195 are members of Tabligi Jamaat. The cases in UP increased after the identification of Tabligi Jamaat members in various districts. “Majority of the Jamaatis have been identified and quarantined, we hope that gradually the cases will come down,” he said.The samples of migrant workers and those who came from foreign countries are also being collected. The health department would also carry rapid antibody tests in various district to identify the positive cases, he said. Prasad said hydroxychloroquine tablets for protection from Sars-Cov-2 had been supplied to medical colleges and hospitals for use among doctors and para medical staff. The tablets had been also stored in the hospitals for the patients, he said.The state government has decided to reserve 20,000 beds in hospitals and private buildings to set up isolation wards. The health department has decided to keep asymptomatic people in the isolation wards for treatment. It has already reserved 10,000 beds in government hospitals and health centres in 75 districts of the state for admission of positive cases. The department has decided to reserve another 10,000 beds for the admission of people who are asymptomatic. These beds would be attached to the LI category hospitals established by the department in various districts, Prasad said. EXPERTSPEAK“The elderly are vulnerable because of their low immunity, hence it is advisable to keep them at home and safe from any chance infection,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, head ,Aastha Geriatric Hospital.“We have already undergone a couple of weeks of lock-down and if similar focus remains for a few more days we shall be able to bring down the cases to zero and also help cure all those who are presently under treatment. In the state, 31 patients have recovered which means the health teams are working hard,” said Dr Sandip Kapoor, director Healthcity hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/youths-middle-aged-more-vulnerable-in-up/story-If5u9gDv8UXw8albdpT8xI.html
08-04-2020||City||Covid-19 suspects complain about lack of facilities at Gzb quarantine centre||Ghaziabad: The suspected Covid-19 patients who were shifted from the MMG District Hospital to a new quarantine facility at BBDIT College campus at Duhai, Muradnagar on Wednesday morning took to social media to complain about the lack of facilities at the centre. Following the videos made viral by the patients, administration and health officials rushed to the spot.The 10 suspected patients, including two women, were sent to the new quarantine centre on Tuesday night. According to health department officials, they readied 23 rooms for patients and 10 others for stay of staff members.“We were brought to BBDIT College campus on Tuesday night. But this hostel lacks basic facilities. There was no electricity when we arrived and we had to use torch in order to move to our rooms on first floor. The officials said that they will bring some electrician soon, and we kept sitting on stairs for about one-and-a-half hours,” said a 32-year-old woman patient from Indirapuram.“The staff gave us food which was not proper and no one had their dinner. The doors in some washrooms are broken and there is no water. During the night, there was cold and we had to wrap ourselves in bedsheets. No blankets were available,” she added.Another woman from Loni who was brought to the facility from MMG Hospital complained of uneasiness ever since she arrived at the new facility. “It is very suffocating here. I came to MMG Hospital on Sunday and we were shifted here on Tuesday night. Two patients are made to stay in one room,” she said as she broke down.The patients prepared videos and made them viral on the social media platforms. After this, officials from district administration and the health department rushed to the spot.“There are no proper facilities for hand wash and no sanitizer is available here. We have made tweets about the lack of facilities and also sent videos of the issues at the facility. The facilities at MMG Hospital were far better than what we got here,” said a 22-year-old patient from Sanjay Nagar.Another man from Loni who is a college student also had his share of complaints. “My family had come with food but they did not allow them inside. They just gave us one water bottle. I have complaints of vomiting and fever but doctors take time to attend to us,” he added.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Padney did not respond to calls made by HT. Chief development officer Asmita Lal who rushed to the quarantine facility did not take calls either.However, chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said that some shortcomings at the facility were rectified.“The patients were shifted to the facility at around 8pm on Tuesday. Around 10pm packaged drinking water was provided to them. Thirty food packets were also arranged by the Ghaziabad development authority and one bottle of sanitizer was given to each one of them. I myself listened to the patients and all the shortcomings were rectified,” Dr Gupta said.He added that the administration had made arrangement for the facility and the health department was roped in to provide health care facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-suspects-complain-about-lack-of-facilities-at-gzb-quarantine-centre/story-ySRdB1Yqb9LHx6gfMycrVI.html
08-04-2020||Noida||Lockdown causes a ₹8,000 crore setback to handicraft industries in UP||Nusrat Begum, a 45-year-old weaver living in Chhajarsi area, has no work these days. She and her four children used to earn at least ₹75,000 a month during the period from March to July every year. “From the month of March every year, our suppliers started giving us orders for embroidery and stitching work. The four months that follow are the best season to earn more as suppliers get bulk government orders at the fiscal-end. But, this time we have no work and we are going through a very tough time. Our savings are almost over and we don’t know what the future holds,” she said.Like Nusrat, Gopal Karmakar of Labour Chowk area, works as a tailor with a small garments supplier company. He says his company has been closed as it could not get any orders this year. “My average earning was ₹20,000 a month, but now I am looking for some job; any job. I am even unable to go back to my native village in West Bengal,” he said.With all the overseas orders cancelled, and movement of containers carrying handicraft products curtailed, the handicraft industry in the state has suffered a loss over ₹8,000 crore during this lockdown so far. The officials fear that unless the state government announces a special package for artisans, the handicraft industries will collapse.Rakesh Kumar, the director general of Export Promotion Council of Handicrafts (EPCH), said after the outbreak of Covid-19, almost all orders from the overseas buyers were cancelled. “Imagine the plight of exporters, who invested a lot of money to meet the orders. The orders were cancelled, at a time when the items were being packed for shipment. Even for the prevailing orders, the exporters are keeping their fingers crossed as in the present scenario, the movement of containers has become difficult,” he said.He said the cancellation of 49th International Handicrafts and Gift Festival (IHGF) Spring 2020, scheduled to begin from April 15 at the India Expo Mart in Greater Noida, has dealt another blow to the industry. “This is a huge blow to this sector as the fair is the biggest platform for artisans to get orders from big overseas buyers. The crisis has caused an estimated loss of ₹8,000 crore in this sector so far,” he said.Kumar said since the exporters can’t stop the payments to artisans, they made full payments in March. “But, if the crisis continues, how can the exporters manage payments in the coming months? If the state government does not announce a special package to meet the monthly payments of artisans, the handicraft industries in Uttar Pradesh will hit rock bottom,” he said.Rajesh Jain, a Noida-based handicraft exporter, said since most of the overseas buyers are from US and Europe --two regions that are the worst affected by the Covid-19 pandemic -- the exporters have taken a huge hit. “Over 70% orders stand cancelled. Even for the remaining orders, buyers have extended the dates by four or five months. In cases where the shipments have reached their countries, buyers are bargaining for a credit period of three months. Back home, in the absence of cash flow and mounting interest from our hypothecating banks, exporters are finding it difficult to pay artisans. In fact, 90% artisans are now jobless. The government must launch a MNREGA-like scheme, which can provide minimum wages to them,” he said.Kamal Soni, an exporter from Moradabad, said the lockdown has broken the supply chain of the handicraft industries. “The handicraft industry caters to workers from both the organised and unorganised sectors. Unless the government provides a special package for MSME artisans, the lives of over 3 crore workers associated with handicraft sector will be in peril,” he said.At present, the UP government runs a One District, One Product (ODOP) programme, to encourage indigenous crafts in Agra (leather products), Amroha (musical instruments), Aligarh (locks), Ayodhya (jaggery), Bahraich (wheat-stalk), Bareilly (zari-zardozi), Bhadohi (carpets), Bulandshahr (ceramics), Firozabad (bangles), Gautam Budh Nagar (readymade garments) and Ghaziabad (engineering products). As per estimates, nearly two crore people are directly or indirectly involved in the handicraft industry in the state. Rashid Ahmad, an artisan associated with carpet industry in Bhadohi, said the income of artisans varies between ₹10,000 and ₹20,000 a month. “The other workers like rangrej (dyers), dhunia and cart-puller get around ₹8,000 a month,” he said. The EPCH director general said in order to provide relief to the handicrafts exporters and help them withstand the challenges posed by the current crisis, the EPCH put their grievances before the Central government.“Taking cognizance of our representations, the government has extended its foreign trade policy 2015-20 by another year till March 31, 2021. This extension will boost the morale of the handicrafts exporting community,” he said.The EPCH has made a contribution of ₹25 lakh towards the PMCARE Fund and the staff of EPCH have separately contributed a day’s salary to the fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/lockdown-causes-a-8-000-crore-setback-to-handicraft-industries-in-up/story-iuM5m8UzEzDEL7RehN37EP.html

It completely shuts the movement of the common people with the authorities taking care of the essential supplies.The area and the houses in it are sanitised properly.

08-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Help students stranded in France return home, says Parents||With an increasing number of Covid-19 cases in France, city parents have requested the ministry of external affairs (MEA) and Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to help them in bringing back their children to India.A parent who requested anonymity said that his daughter, along with 20 students from the EDHEC business school, need to be evacuated. “I had booked a ticket for my daughter in March, but it got cancelled owing to the lockdown. Air India will start with the bookings only after April-end. How will the students survive there for another month, especially when the cases in France are increasing?” He also added that the students are facing some trouble getting provisions. “The Indian High Commission had already asked the stranded students and Indians to register in this regard, but there has been no development after that,” the parent said. The EDHEC business school, on its website, has also asked all its international students to return home to their families and continue studies remotely.Another parent that HT spoke to, who also requested anonymity, said, “We have been making requests to all authorities via social media to help the students come back since there have been flights from India to take French nationals back to their country,” he said.Recently, 112 French nationals in Kerala were flown out on a special Air India flight to France owing to the lockdown. As on Wednesday, France has 78,167 positive cases with the death toll crossing 10,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-help-students-stranded-in-france-return-home-says-parents/story-Wujp3zkhDVTJwbicho5dOM.html
08-04-2020||City||Lockdown: Policemen’s wish list include chatting with children, movies with family||The lockdown to restrict the spread of Covid-19 has meant an increased workload for police officers for whom there is no ‘work from home’ option. An average shift runs from 12 to 14 hours, but can go on for longer, and as part of Covid-19 duty, police officers are on the front lines of tackling the disease.In a video released by Mumbai Police on Wednesday, the police talked about what they’d do if they had the option of working from home. Since the lockdown, police officers are often working longer hours than normal. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Pranaya Ashok said of Mumbai Police’s 50,000 police personnel, half are on Covid-19 duty. “An average of 12 to 14 hours are devoted [by those on duty,” said Ashok, adding that the shifts can go on for longer. “If a crowd gathers, one cannot leave just because his shift has ended,” he said.Being on duty in the city, in daytime temperatures that are around 33˚C, police work is demanding and requires many to make sacrifices. Assistant police inspector (API) with Navghar police, Deepali Kulkarni missed her eight-year-old son’s birthday on Wednesday. “I would have celebrated my son’s birthday with him,” she said. “He sits in the balcony and calls out to his friends in the society, saying he will celebrate it post-April 14.” Kulkarni travels from Kalyan to Mulund daily and is stationed at one of the busiest entry/exit points to the city­ – the toll plaza bordering Thane. She’s sent her younger son, who is two years old, to stay with her mother. Sunil Waghmare, a police inspector at Wadala TT police station, also had to miss his son’s birthday on March 31. “ We couldn’t celebrate the birthday at home as I barely got time when I reached home. I was not able to even have lunch or dinner with my son on that special day,” he said.In some police officers’ families, there are reversals in roles. DCP (headquarters-1) N Ambika said, “At times, my daughter cooks food for me when I return these days. My son and daughter’s schedules too have changed as they remain home, but they have been extremely understanding.”Jayashree Sawant, API, Sion police station, misses her normal routine of putting her two-year-old daughter to bed now that Sawant has to man different junctions. Sawant’s husband, Sunil Patil, is an officer with Thane rural police and has a daily commute of two hours. The couple decided to send their daughter to live with extended family in Sangli, around 375 kilometres from Mumbai. “She demands to see me daily during meals and before going to bed. I use video call to stay in touch. I would have spent all the time with her had I been at home,” said Sawant.When asked what he would do if he could stay home, Dattatray P Bhargude, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Bandra division, said, “I would sit with my children, speak with them about life and share my experiences working as a cop. I would also refresh old memories with my colleagues as I am nearing retirement.” DCP, zone 10, Ankit Goyal also said he would like to reconnect with old friends if he had more down time. “I would have called my old college friends and relived those past days. Watching movies with family is also on the list. There are many books on my shelf which have been remained untouched and I would read them all. Last, I would catch up on sleep,” he said.Balasaheb Satpute, head constable, MIDC police station, said he would have liked to take over the cooking if he could have worked from home. “In this way, I would have been able to give some rest to my wife,” he said.The demanding schedules of Mumbai Police leaves most officers with little time to work on their personal projects and hobbies. “I hardly get time for myself,” said Navnath Chavan, police constable, Oshiwara police station. When asked what he would do if he could stay home, Chavan said, “I would have read spiritual books like Bhagavad Gita and Ramayana.” API Ratna Khandelwal, who travels from Mumbra to Pydhonie police station daily, said, “Had I been home, I would try out new recipes and spend time with my sister’s kids and my aging mother. Police officers overburdened with work never get enough time to do these things.”For Hriday Mishra, head constable with Mumbai Police’s crime branch, being able to relax at home would have been a good opportunity to go through old cases. “I would have revisited those cases, their written notes and study what could have been done better and what were the mistakes committed,” said Mishra. Ashok said there are initiatives to try and give officers much-needed breaks. “In a bid to ensure police personnel are not stressed, junior officers and personnel are getting a day off after working for two consecutive days at some police zones. Some police stations staff are rotated every three hours at check posts,” he said. At their individual levels, senior officers do their best to look out for their staff. Senior police inspector Lalita Gaikwad, who is in charge of Sion police station, said “As a senior police inspector, I see that my staff gets a weekly off so that they get time to spend with family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-policemen-s-wish-list-include-chatting-with-children-movies-with-family/story-YJaKDwo5ZlP7AG7GHIlfxL.html
08-04-2020||Chandigarh||With restrictions in place, Baddi medicine production dips by 80%||Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) engaged in the manufacture of medicines in Baddi, the hub of this industry in the region, say that their production has dropped by 80% to only 20% of what it was before the lockdown and the curfew. “Despite being counted among essential services, the industry is facing the problem of transport and shortage of manpower,” said Rajesh Gupta, president, Himachal Drug Manufacturers Association, adding that the impact of such low production would be felt in June, once demand picked up. According to the association, there are 300 drug manufacturing units in Baddi, of which 225 (75%) are MSMEs and have between 70-500 employees. Gupta added that the association had also written a letter to Himachal Pradesh chief minister, which says, “Trucks are not available for MSMEs and as such units have not been able to send medicines to other states. Raw material procurement is also not happening after the lockdown was announced.” The letter adds, “Members of the managerial staff have also not been able to report on duty as they have not been able to cross the borders from the tricity of Chandigarh.” Gupta added that on their appeal, a one-time pass for 14 days was issued to such staffers, but now all hotels in the town were full and most units could not accommodate required number of employees. In some areas of the town, landlords and local residents were not allowing people to move out due to the fear of infection, he claimed. “There are practical problems which need to be resolved so that units become fully functional,” Gupta said, adding that demand had also dropped due to the discontinuation of Out-Patient Department (OPD) services across hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-restrictions-in-place-baddi-medicine-production-dips-by-80/story-eAhNQ5JklcRaSHLLEWUAmN.html

Her husband, too, is a health worker. “All of us are going through the toughest phases of our lives, where we have to fulfil many responsibilities and play multiple roles. We have a fixed time to reach hospital, but when would we return solely depends on the patient load in the isolation ward,” she says.“I cannot go near my children. I have been keeping distance from them in order keep at bay the slightest possibility of infecting them,” she adds. “But, we are confident that this too shall pass. We would win this battle,” Suman saysSimilar is the story of another senior staff nurse, Meenu Purthi. “The most difficult thing is to stay away from children. After going back to our homes, we have to spend two extra hours washing our clothes, bathing and sanitising our kits,” she says. “Covid-19 has not only brought isolation to patients, but even to us,” Meenu adds. Dr Arvind Chahal, who is also posted in the isolation ward, says, “This pandemic has changed the way we used to live our lives.” “Our responsibilities have increased as a small mistake could create a big problem for patients, staff and their family members,” says the doctor who has started living in a separate room on his residence’s ground floor after shifting his family to the first floor. Doctors examining patients in the OPDs are also exposed to similar risks. “My working hours have increased. Nowadays, I examine around 200 patients. But, we are committed to doing our duty and serving the people,” says Dr Shailendra Mamgain, senior medical officer and TB specialist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/isolated-from-society-these-medics-are-committed-to-winning-war-against-invisible-enemy/story-UNbTA2R13VOvYcyt68IsQP.html

08-04-2020||Mumbai||Doctors on call, in this society in Parel||A co-operative housing society in Parel has set up a system by which its members get the medical help and medicines they need without leaving their homes. Residents have been encouraged to stay indoors and while maintaining a regular schedule for sanitising the premises, the society has cut down on its staff by 50%. The managing committee of Veda, a housing society comprising 254 flats, has a WhatsApp group for residents, which includes doctors living in the complex. “This system has helped senior citizens the most, because they are usually worried about basic medicines and even in case of routine discomforts, they don’t know whom to reach out to as most dispensaries are shut. Now they can put their request to the admin, and the doctor either calls them or visits them,” said Navin Agicha, a Veda resident.The committee also makes a list of medicines people require on a regular basis and has it delivered by a nearby pharmacy, which delivers the medicines at the complex’s gate every alternate day. Residents come down at designated times to collect deliveries and dispose waste. “By putting in all measures in place, we are trying to cut down on human interaction as much as possible,” said Pinky Parikh, chairperson of the society. Parikh said common areas, such as lifts and lobbies, are sanitised twice a day and members use toothpicks to press lift buttons.Additionally, residents are being supplied fresh, organic produce. “We get vegetables and fruits twice a week directly from Lasalgaon. At least this way, we are contributing in some way to help and aid daily wage earners and farmers in the current situation,” said Rohan Shah, a member of managing committee. A nearby vendor delivers groceries like bread and eggs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/doctors-on-call-in-this-society-in-parel/story-UPv7qJ3jnaxjt7ph2AassJ.html

08-04-2020||Lucknow||UP: Forest officers asked to be alert after tiger tests positive in US zoo||After a tiger tested positive for Covid-19 virus in a New York zoo, the union ministry of environment, forest and climate change has directed the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), UP, to ensure the well being of both forest staff and wild animals.While Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) scientists in Bareilly are still trying to understand which animals may be susceptible to the novel coronavirus, the officers here at the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) and Dudhwa National Park have swung into action to ensure compliance. “The order of the central government and the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) would be strictly implemented,” said H Raja Mohan, field director, Pilibhit Tiger Reserve. He said forest officials will monitor all animals of feline species particularly tigers and leopards. Villagers across the forest belt too had been told and asked to instantly inform forest officials if they came across any tiger or leopard outside the forest, he said.The advisory issued by Dr Vaibhav C Mathur, assistant inspector general, National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), says that groups that rescue tigers and leopards should be vigilant. If any carnivore is found dead in the forest, its samples must be collected and send for tests. Foresters must undergo check-ups to ensure that they are free of infection before interacting with villagers living around the forests. The guidelines also require that villagers avoid routes that go through the forests.Pilibhit Tiger Reserve is home to around 65 tigers. Apart from the big cats, there are a variety of leopards. According to 2019-20 estimates, the PTR has leopard 25, bear 119, deer species 5800, nilgai (blue bull) 5400 and 320 vultures. Two prominent NGOs namely the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) that regularly pitch in and provide support to foresters have also been asked by NTCA to adhere to the guidelines. “Except forest officials and support staff, with proper sanitisation, no one will be allowed to enter the forest area,” said deputy director, Dudhwa, Anil Patel. He said camera traps would be used to monitor the condition of carnivores. If any carnivore exhibits symptoms of Covid-19, it will be provided treatment. A committee of wildlife veterinarians along with range officers and forest guards will be formed to regularly monitor the condition of carnivores. “We have prepared a quarantine ward for the animals in the zoo on the instructions of our director RK Singh. In case any animal shows any symptoms of Covid-19, it will be kept in quarantine and its samples will be sent for testing. All the staff will be properly sanitised before entering the zoo and all will have to wear masks, gloves and disposable apron while feeding animals. Even the vehicles used for transporting food will be regularly sanitised with sodium hypochlorite solution. Our director has ensured that we have sufficient PPEs available at the zoo,” said Dr Brijendra Yadav, veterinarian, Lucknow zoological garden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-forest-officers-asked-to-be-alert-after-tiger-tests-positive-in-us-zoo/story-SZs3s07yruTu3fogNgWkjL.html
08-04-2020||City||Demanding fees during lockdown: Show-cause notices to two more private schools in Ludhiana||The state education department on Wednesday issued show-case notices to two more private schools in the district for defying its directions and demanding fees during the lockdown.Punjab education minister Vijay Inder Singla informed that Atam Devki Niketan Senior Secondary School, Kidwai Nagar, and Bharatam World School, Khanna, have been issued notices for the violation.The schools should also not charge transportation fees and books charges from students for the next academic session till the lockdown period is over, the minister said.On March 23, the state education department had directed all private schools to reschedule the date of depositing fee as many parents would be unable to do the needful amid lockdown. The schools were asked to provide window period of 30 days for submission of fees after the situation gets normalized. The schools were also asked not charge any late fee fine as well for the same.They were asked to abide by the orders or face disciplinary action, the cabinet minister said.“The schools have been given seven-day period to file their reply. If they fail to reply, we are going to cancel their affiliation or no objection certificate (NOC) to run the school,” Singla said in the statement.Mridhu Ablash, principal of Atam Devki Niketan Senior Secondary School, said, “We have not issued any circular regarding the payment of a fee to the parents. However, only a circular related to online classes was sent to the parents.”To ensure strict action against the violating schools, the education minister has also floated his email id, vijayindersingla@gmail.com, on which the parents can send their complaints.So far, five schools in Ludhiana— Atam Devki Niketan Senior Secondary School in Kidwai Nagar, Bharatam World School in Khanna, Delhi Public School in Jhammat village, MGM Public School in Dugri, and Green Land Convent School in Subhash Nagar,— have been issued notices for the violation.After notice, MGM Public School defers date of fee payment A day after a private school was issued a show-cause notice by the state education department for asking parents to submit the fee, the school authorities of MGM Public School, Dugri, have deferred the date of fee payment to April 30. Earlier, the school had asked the parents to submit the fee by April 10. School principal Sunita Vij said, “Keeping in mind the current Covid-19 crisis, its effect on the economy and the cumbersome pressure on parents, this decision has been taken.” Some of the parents had approached the staff members, who have been working from home, and told that they were willing to pay the monthly fee on due date, instead of a lump sum later, Vij said, adding that they have informed the parents that they can pay the fees anytime without any late fee fine. Keeping the current situation in mind, the school authorities are completely ready to cooperate with the parents. In case the lockdown continues, the payment of fee will be further deferred till normalcy revives, as per the order of the district magistrate, the principal added. The case On March 23, the state education department had directed all private schools to reschedule the date of depositing fee as many parents would be unable to do the needful amid lockdown. The school authorities were further asked to abide by the orders or face disciplinary action. Following a complaint by the parents, the state education department on Tuesday had issued a show-cause notice to two schools—MGM Public School, Dugri, and Green Land Convent School, Subhash Nagar— for the same violation. The DPI office had asked the school authorities to submit a reply as to why the school’s no objection certificate (NOC) to run the school should not be cancelled as they have violated the orders of the education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/demanding-fees-during-lockdown-show-cause-notices-to-two-more-private-schools-in-ludhiana/story-GIGkiomjzJDoT4qho6j40J.html

Six surgeries scheduled for the next three days, and chemotherapy and radiation therapy of many patients could not be not done. The institute is a constituent of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot. Doctors say that cancer patients have low immunity and should not be exposed to the virus. Parvinder Sandhu, an oncological surgeon at ACI, said, “I had to put off scheduled surgeries. Due to the lockdown, patients from nearby towns who used to visit Chandigarh, Ludhiana or Rajasthan for chemotherapy and radiation therapy are also coming to us, leading to 20% more load. Due to the covid facility, we have to shift ICU-ward patients to other rooms. For chemotherapy patients, we will have to use a dharamshala on campus.”“My 70-year-old mother is undergoing treatment for post-radiotherapy complications. Using the ACI to also treat covid patients is life-threatening,” said Munish Joshi, an attendant. ACI medical superintendent Dr Deepak Arora said, “Precautions have been put in place, but we have a single X-ray test station and coronavirus patients will also need the same facility. The movement of paramedics and other staff from cancer wards to the covid facility is also a concern,” he said. Bathinda civil surgeon Amrik Singh, “Cancer patients must be kept away from the covid facility. I will take up the issue with the deputy commissioner. Cancer patients may be shifted to the BFUHS campus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bathinda-cancer-hospital-patients-hit-as-3rd-floor-turned-into-covid-facility/story-U7xLtiw0wxsd9mjMD2djoO.html

08-04-2020||Mumbai||Way to give Covid-19 test samples without leaving the car?||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is considering a plan to set up drive-through sample collection units whereby people can drive in and submit samples to test for Covid-19 without getting out of their vehicles. The facility will have medical staff to collect swab samples which will then be sent for testing. While the BMC has finalised a standard design for the sample collection unit, the plan is to set up such facilities in tents, gazebos in isolated areas like service roads of highways, parking lots, and open grounds. A plan to change the Bandra Worli sealink tollbooth into a sample collection is being discussed but is yet to be finalised.As per the plan, the suspected patient will reach the testing facility in their car and the sample will be collected through the vehicle window. The facility will have a registration desk along with a professional to collect samples. “The speed of collecting samples will be doubled easily as it will take just five minutes per patient. It is estimated that a three-member team can collect up to 200 samples a day. The biggest advantage of such units is that they completely reduce or rule out chances of cross infections which are a major threat to medical staff,” said a senior civic official. According to the BMC, these drive-through units will be cost-effective and will require minimal assets. Another civic official working on this plan said, “Such facilities are easy to set up and operate since very minimal assets are required for running it on a full scale. The facilities will cost very less to set up and we will make sure that proper arrangements for the staff are made there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/way-to-give-covid-19-test-samples-without-leaving-the-car/story-qs2ETzu1WRe1C24z8RSDPI.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||Balbharti releases Class 12 textbooks online||Class 12 students from the Maharashtra state board will no longer have to wait to get their textbooks under the revised curriculum as the state’s publishing bureau, Balbharti, has uploaded a majority of the books in their PDF version on its official website — http://ebalbharati.in. Most of the textbooks for the commerce and science streams have been uploaded on the website while some from the arts stream have also been published. Students can download them free of cost on any device. Officials in Balbharti said that the decision was taken to ensure that students can start reading the books as colleges remain shut due to the lockdown. “We wanted to bring the textbooks in the market by the end of March. We faced hurdles due to the current situation and hence decided to at least upload soft copies so that students don’t have to wait,” said Vivek Gosavi, director, Balbharti. The state government had taken up a syllabus revision exercise over the last few years, as part of which textbooks are being gradually revised. While the Class 11 syllabus was revised in 2019, Class 12 syllabus is being revised from the upcoming academic year 2020-21. Officials from Balbharti are now working to ensure that students get access to all the textbooks soon. “A few subjects like geography are left because the committees for these subjects are yet to give a final nod to the copy only after which it can be published. We are using online messaging applications to get in touch with members of these committees and are confident that the remaining textbooks would also be made available soon,” said Gosavi.IB cancels Class 11, 12 examsThe International Baccalaureate(IB) cancelled its diploma programme (Class 11 and 12 equivalent) exams scheduled between April 30 and May 22 in a circular issued recently. Students enrolled in these programmes would be awarded their diploma grades on the basis of their coursework and overall performance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/balbharti-releases-class-12-textbooks-online/story-mKNPwmItFggI1TepAAx9sM.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||Division of patients: Way to curb spread of Covid-19||To reduce the transmission of the Sars-CoV-2 and bring down the number of cases, the state health department has come up with a new standard operating procedure (SOP) for treatment – suspected patients will be segregated into mild, moderate and severe categories and treated in facilities specifically equipped to handle those symptoms.The move comes after the department received several complaints that all suspected patients, irrespective of the nature of their symptoms, were kept only at a distance of 1ft from each other at quarantine centres. “Currently, all people, even with minor symptoms, rush to Kasturba Hospital for screening. This leads to crowding and adds to the pressure on the hospital. We have decided to bifurcate the crowd for safety,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “The facilities must have separate areas for suspected and confirmed cases with preferably a separate entry and a safe exit. The suspect and confirmed cases must not be allowed to mix, under any circumstances,” reads the SOP, a copy of which is available with HT. Under the new directive, doctors from AYUSH will be roped in to man these centres.According to the SOP, a patient will be categorised as mild, only if he/she has fever or cold. He will be taken to ‘Covid care centres’ in makeshift facilities such as lodges, stadiums, schools, hotels and hostels. The BMC has procured the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Indoor Stadium in Worli, where they are in the process of setting up a 2,000-bed quarantine facility.The second category, moderate, will include patients with pneumonia with no sign of severe diseases. Such patients will be kept in either in hospital or an extended part of hospitals which have essential medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders.Pneumonia patients with low respiratory rate will be considered ‘severe’ and undergo treatment in dedicated Covid hospitals. They will be kept under observation in the intensive care units of the hospitals. “When the virus gets into the body through the nostrils, the person develops mild fever and cold. When it goes through the throat, the patient develops moderate symptoms, depending on the comorbid issues (other ailments). At the last stage, as the virus reaches the lung, it leads to development of a severe form of pneumonia. In 60-70% of the cases, patients get diagnosed in the first stage of infection,” said Dr Om Srivastava, city-based epidemiologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/division-of-patients-way-to-curb-spread-of-covid-19/story-qG195kbAlWxV6H71eHBfaP.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Clean these 5 touch points in your building||Lift buttons, handles and iron gates of old collapsible lifts, staircase railings, all door handles and doors – these are the five main touch points that residents in containment zones in high-rises (apartments) should be aware of to control community transmission, according to the insecticide department of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). In case of containment zones in slums, the touch points are common toilets, stair handles or railings, parapets, sitting areas such as concrete platforms outside slum structures and door handles.Moreover, indoor areas of the patient’s home have to be sanitised rigorously before the 14-day isolation period and once the isolation is complete. According to the data released on Tuesday, there are 241 containment zones across all 24 municipal wards in the city. “Transmission is happening through these touch points and people are not aware of it. As on today, the focus is on cutting off the chain of transmission,” said Rajan Naringrekar, insecticide officer, BMC. “For this, not coming out of the house and ensuring touch points are sanitised daily is the key.”Twenty-four pest control officers are working across all wards under the administrative control of ward officers. The insecticide department is carrying out daily sanitisation of all containment zones. They are using 200ml of sodium hypochlorite for 10 litres of water as a solution to spray the disinfectant using motorised mist spraying pumps. “Residents of these containment zones and apartments need not bother with the sodium hypochlorite solution, and can regularly sanitise these touch points using basic disinfectants or bleaching powder solutions easily available in markets. They need to wear gloves. Bleaching powder solution made in a bowl is best for cleaning parapets and sitting areas. If everybody follows this twice daily, the chances of transmission are reduced completely,” said Naringrekar.Citizens on essential duty need to ensure the safety of their household and family members, said Naringrekar adding, they need to follow a daily process. “On reaching home, they need to first sanitise the cell phone, then their hands before entering the house. They need to immediately go to the wash basin. The foam on one’s hand (while using soap and water) needs to be used to wash the knob of the tap, which is an important touch point for households. Following this, a handkerchief dipped in disinfectant has to be used to wipe ones bag, belt, wallet, spectacles etc. followed by a shower. All clothes need to be dumped in a bucket filled with warm water and washed thereafter,” said Naringrekar.Meanwhile, societies opting for private pest control operations were worried about the solution being used by these agencies. “While the BMC operations are for free, private pest control charges are almost ₹2,000 per day. In one of the canisters during sanitisation in our society, it was 100% water and no sodium hypochlorite solution at all,” said Sudhakar Trivedi, a Mulund resident.“Pest control private bodies that are violating the insecticide department’s guidelines can lose their licence if they do not follow the exact steps identified for disinfection. If such violations are brought to our notice, we will immediately write to the state government,” said Naringrekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-clean-these-5-touch-points-in-your-building/story-4v4EaxUF1TrDdWRIesJVRM.html
08-04-2020||Chandigarh||A first: Wheat to be procured through coupons in Punjab||To avoid mass gatherings in view of Covid-19 outbreak, the Punjab government is planning a staggered procurement of wheat this season, which will begin on April 15. Besides, the farmers will be allowed to come to grain markets and other procurement centres on basis of invitation, which will be extended by the Punjab Mandi Board.A bumper wheat crop of 135 lakh tonnes is expected to arrive for procurement in the state.Agriculture secretary KS Pannu, who is chalking out standard operating procedures for procurement, said: “To ensure smooth procurement and also follow the instructions in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, no farmer can enter a mandi without invitation of the Punjab Mandi Board through the market committee.”Every day, a limited number of farmers will be issued coupons with holograms and more coupons will only be issued after the earlier produce is lifted, he said, adding that the coupon will work as curfew pass. “Each coupon will entitle a farmer to sell 50 quintals of wheat, which he will bring in his vehicle to the mandi. Arhtiyas (commission agents) will help market committees to issue coupons to farmers. The payment will be made through arhtiyas,” he said.To maintain social distance, ground space at the mandis is being divided into 30ft x 30ft lots for heaps of 50 quintals each. “We are making efforts to spread out procurement in terms of days and number of locations,” said food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.He added: “It’s a mammoth task. We also have to ensure the safety of our farmers. We are making all arrangements for social distancing and other protocols to stop spread of the virus.” 1,900 RICE MILLS CONVERTED INTO PROCUREMENT CENTRES To spread out procurement operations, the food and civil supplies department has decided to convert 1,897 rice shelling mills with large yard spaces into procurement centres.“Apart from our regular 1,864 mandis and procurement centres, we have notified 1,897 rice mills as procurement centres, taking the total to 3,761, and we are in process identifying more. With this, we can reach out to farmers’ doorsteps, giving a cluster of two to three villages a separate facility for cleaning, packing and weighing of the grain,” said additional chief secretary (development) Viswajeet Khanna, who heads the state committee on harvesting and procurement.He said the commission agents will help in bringing out the farmers turn-wise with their produce. “We are providing gloves, masks and hand sanitisers at all procurement centres.” Meanwhile, IMD regional director Surender Paul predicted unsatisfactory weather conditions with sporadic rainfall, strong winds and sudden fall and rise in temperatures during April and May, when procurement operation is expected to be at peak.Punjab Agricultural University vice-chancellor BS Dhillon suggested farmers to preserve freshly harvested wheat at their end as long as possible. SHORTAGE OF GUNNY BALES, LABOURThere is also a shortage of gunny bales required by procurement agencies for wheat storage as the jute mills in West Bengal that supply gunny bags to Punjab have stopped production. “Out of our requirement of 4.85 lakh bales, we are short of at least one lakh bales,” said food and civil supplies director Anindita Mitra.She said the state government has written to the West Bengal government to allow production of gunny bags. She added that Punjab has also sought permission from the Centre to use polypropylene bags as an alternative.“Shortage of labour is also a big concern as workers form UP and Bihar are not in Punjab now, so the state is banking on indigenous labour which is engaged in MNERGA works,” said Viswajeet Khanna, adding that harvesting and procurement requires 5 lakh work heads, who could be arranged from within the state.The authorities have instructed that all trucks and harvester combines going from one village to another will be sanitised regularly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-plans-wheat-procurement-in-staggered-manner/story-wNqo7B7o8bEzUUPAqQk47I.html
08-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab to set up task force to look into lifting of lockdown||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday announced setting up of a task force to find ways to gradually get out of the lockdown in Punjab.Addressing state’s leading industrialists through video-conferencing, the CM assured them of all support to address critical issues and challenges in this difficult time. While seeking the industry’s suggestions on the way forward, he invited them to be part of the government’s decision-making process in the extraordinary situation that is prevailing currently.Among the various issues raised by industry leaders was the demand for declaring tractors and ancillary industries as essential and allowing them reopen to meet the urgent needs of farmers in the rabi harvesting and marketing season. The demand for declaring cycles as essential commodity was also raised. Another suggestion that came up was to allow the packaging industry to resume operations, given its importance in ensuring streamlined operations of essential commodities.A major issue discussed at the meeting related to the problems faced by pharmaceutical companies, which were playing a pivotal role in tackling the Covid-19 outbreak. ‘DECISION ON CURFEW IN APRIL 10 CABINET MEET’The CM clarified that no decision had been taken on extending the curfew in the state beyond April 14.In a statement after a government notification mentioning the extension of curfew went viral, the CM said the state government was yet to take a decision in the matter and a decision in this regard would be taken after the cabinet meeting scheduled for April 10.The Chief Minister said that the speculation on curfew extension had been triggered by an advisory to employees from the General Administration department on a series of matters relating to the current situation. The said advisory had subsequently been withdrawn by the chief secretary on his directives, the CM said. The state government was continuously assessing and reviewing the evolving situation, which was changing day-to-day, and any decision would be taken in the context of the conditions prevailing around mid-April, keeping in mind the overall interest of the state and its people, said Amarinder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-to-set-up-task-force-to-look-into-lifting-of-lockdown/story-ENJgqFXmXytsXFPBpd9BmO.html

He has only visited the court twice since the courts closed. “I had to go to court because two of my cases required an urgent hearing. It is a challenge to hold a hearing in the absence of complainants and defendants. However, the judges have been really supportive. They are also entertaining us on the phone so that we can minimise our visits to court. We have also been allotted an e-mail id where we can submit bail plea request.”However, Sharma feels that video conferencing is not an adequate substitute for physical presence in court.”In many cases, where the criminal cannot be produced in the court, the video conferencing approach is adopted but I believe that it is not effective for all cases since it is challenging to show evidence, argue cases and understand the position of the complainant and defendant through a virtual medium.”“The atmosphere in court is conducive for both judges and advocates to understand every aspect of the case, which is why I think the court should only entertain urgent cases till normalcy is restored,” Sharma opines. Ask him how he plans to spend the remaining lockdown period , he says, “This week I plan to read the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2019, along with making calls to some of my clients whose cases are pending in the court,” Sharma says. Other than studying, Sharma a resident of Rishi Nagar is spending the lockdown period practicing mindfulness and watching Ramayana and Mahabharata with his family. Sharma and his family have been doing their share of humanitarian work by feeding the police staff deputed in their area: “There are eight police personnel deputed in our area. We prepare tea for them in the morning and evening and also prepare lunch for them. This is our way of showing our appreciation, gratitude and support for those on frontline,” he says. “In this time of uncertainty, it is our duty as human beings to help and support each other. The safety of ourselves, our loved ones and society at large should be our primary concern,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tough-to-hold-hearings-without-complainants-defendants/story-2iQ11AgIkIPuLBCYhPZgxM.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: High power committee seeks time to file reply on classification of prisoners||The high-power committee constituted to decide on releasing under-trials and convicts on temporary bail has sought time to file its reply with regards to the objections raised by a petition filed by two inmates. The petition has claimed that while the Supreme Court order to decongest jails had mentioned only two clauses for releasing prisoners, the high power committee has introduced additional clauses that made it almost impossible for any of the inmates to be released thus negating the very purpose of the SC directions to safeguard inmates from the Covid 19 pandemic.On Wednesday, the bench of justice R G Avachat at the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court while hearing the petition filed by two under trial prisoners who are booked under the Maharashtra Protection of Investors Depositors Act and kept at Harsul jail in Aurangabad informed the bench through advocate Pradnya Talekar that the high power committee had introduced an exception in the SC directions thus prejudicing their chance of getting interim bail.Talekar informed the court that while the sanctioned capacity of the jail was 589 there were around 1828 inmates. As a result of this it was not possible to maintain social distancing among the prisoners thus putting their lives at risk and susceptible to any outbreak of the Covid-19 if it entered the jails.Talekar further submitted that the conditions for bail by the SC only mentioned that those serving a sentence of seven or less years should be allowed interim bail to decongest the jails. However the high power committee had introduced exceptions wherein persons accused of financial frauds were not eligible for the bail even though the punishment for their crime was less than seven years.Based on the submissions by Talekar the bench sought to know on what basis did the High Powered Committee make a separate classification of prisoners and placed the matter for further hearing on April 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-high-power-committee-seeks-time-to-file-reply-on-classification-of-prisoners/story-ARMsQFbE9QeGQfcCIlmLSI.html
08-04-2020||City||CBSE tells students to focus on practical knowledge||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has suggested principals of all the schools affiliated with the board to ask students to focus on practical learning and construct knowledge through all sources around them, such as people, their vocation, nature and environment, technology, tools and equipment etc. This suggestion was made by CBSE to the school principals in a news letter, which is also published on its website (http://www.cbse.nic.in/).It also advised that textbooks cannot be the only source of knowledge and to understand how things actually work, students can have a better understanding of concepts through experiments. Giving example to understand the technology behind the household items, such as working of a pressure cooker, the students can learn how the food items can be prepared quickly by using the pressure cooker and its working with the help of their parents. The pressure cooker has a sealed pot with a valve that controls the steam pressure inside. As the pot heats up, the liquid inside forms steam, which raises the pressure in the pot which further raises the boiling point of the water in the pot and the higher level of heat cooks the food quickly. Through these experiments, children can understand the functioning of other items such as clothes iron, TV remote, wall clock.Applauding the move by the board, the school teachers of private schools have stated that students can utilise this time during lockdown in understanding the concepts through experimental learning. For instance, the concept of the stem can be learned through classification, organisation, quantities, proportions, thermal conductivity, chemical reactions, audits, optimization, hygiene, timing, nutrition etc.Punita Singh, a science teacher of a private school, said, “Apart from online classes, I have asked my students to select any household item and understand its functioning, advantages and submit it as part of their project work after the school reopens. They have been asked to take help of their parents and this project will definitely teach them important survival skills.”A student of Class 8, Ashish Singla, said, “Since April 3, I am receiving online assignments from the school teacher and two topics of science and mathematics have been covered. Today, the teacher has asked the students to write observations regarding the recent changes in environment due to lockdown as a project work. It was also advised that pictures can be clicked to support the explanation.” Ludhiana school principals were of the view that the time can be utilised in developing skills among the children. Parents can also teach them the value of yoga/pranayam and meditation in reducing cortisol levels in the body and raising immunity.Gunmant Kaur Gill, principal of Guru Nanak International Public School, Model Town, said, “Practical knowledge will give more clarity of concepts to the students and will develop confidence in them. To make the students busy in these tough times, we have assigned a task to the students of Class 10 to write advantages of this 21-day lockdown. The aim was to make them think, so that they can remain positive and can learn the most important survival skills by staying at home.”The board also suggested the students to use the kitchen as the laboratory to conduct experiments with real tools.Nankana Sahib Public School principal Harmeet Kaur Waraich said, “Parents can make the best use of this time and teach skills to their children. Students can be motivated to read books, engage in indoor games and help their parents in household works. We can also encourage the students to do projects on Indian art, language and culture to sharpen their understanding of the sustainable aspects of our culture.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cbse-tells-students-to-focus-on-practical-knowledge/story-eebcoDqZbD2k5y2aeL053O.html

As per instructions from the Centre and state government, the Pune fire brigade, PMPML and PMC’s health staff is helping relatives of the deceased carry out the cremation. In some of the cases, relatives were also not very keen to take back the bodies even as the civic administration wants bodies to be sent directly to the crematorium to avoid anyone coming in contact of the infected person.PMC health chief Ramchandra Hankare said, “In one case, all biological relatives are Covid-19 positive cases. So other relatives didn’t come to pick up the body. Therefore, the PMC staff performed the cremation. We have given training to our staff, considering that we may need to carry more such cremations, if needed in future.”Earlier last week, municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad had ordered that the final rites will be carried out in the presence of PMC health staff for Covid-19 bodies. Fire brigade department head Prashant Ranpise said, “Municipal commissioner had ordered us to provide a vehicle and driver for the body of deceased.

Even the PMPML has been asked to provide buses for dead bodies.”Even if the Covid-19 patient died at a private hospital, they have to follow rules and need to take help of PMPML or fire brigade to carry the dead bodies.PMC released a detail order on April 6 for the cremation procedure and what precautions should be taken by staffers.A senior officer on condition of anonymity accepted that there is fear among the relatives of the deceased.The vehicle which is used for carrying the body is sanitised immediately. The staffers who carrying the cremation are provided with all the precautionary equipment as per instructions given by additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agrawal.

However, he continued treating a critical coronavirus patient at the hospital’s isolation ward.“As soon as I got to know about this, I asked Lokesh to rush home for his father’s cremation.

Even they keep reminding me to take care while treating patients,” Chaudhary added.Chaudhary has been assigning duties to doctors and nurses on a rotational basis. He said while most doctors are getting weekly offs, they prefer to remain on the campus as they don’t want to take any chances with the health of their own kin.Anshul Singroha, a staff nurse who does 12-hour shifts at the isolation ward, said she has not met her children for the past many days. “I am prioritising my duty, but it is difficult for a mother to remain away from her children and family for too long,” Anshul said.Another health worker Rajesh Khatana has been working continuously and not been home since February 1. “If a soldier can patrol near the border, I can also perform my duty at the isolation ward,” he added.PGIMS superintendent nurse Ishwanti Malik said, “Over 700 nurses are combating coronavirus every day. But we are allotting duties to five nurses in a week, following which they are quarantined for 14 days,” she added.Malik said her engineer son was stuck in Delhi and daughter and son-in-law were stranded in Jaipur. “My husband is taking care of his and my mother, both aged 85, besides our 3-year-old grandson,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/these-front-line-medics-are-staying-away-from-home-to-keep-covid-19-at-bay/story-875e0ru5LJZkJkKf7LH0oK.html

On April 5, Dholani’s father had died of a heart attack in Assam.Being the only son, Dholani wanted to travel to Assam immediately to carry out the last rites but with restrictions on outstation trains and flights due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Binny had no way to go to Assam.He decided to write to the chief justice of the Bombay high court seeking directions to the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA), district collector, Pune, ministry of aviation (MCA) and ministry of road transport and highways to allow his passage on any flight going to Guwahati from Pune. On Tuesday, the bench of justice A K Menon took up the letter for hearing through video conferencing. While hearing the application of Binny Dholani through advocate Girish Menon, the bench was informed that the letter would be converted into a writ petition after the lockdown period concluded but due to the urgency, directions should be issued to the authorities to let Dholani travel to Assam by flight.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh appearing for the MHA, MCA and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) informed the court that due to the restrictions no exceptions were being made for any of them, hence Dholani’s request to fly to Assam on any flight could not be accommodated. Singh, however, submitted that if Dholani wanted to travel by road, instructions could be issued to the Pune collectorate to facilitate the same. Dholani, however, said that he would convey his decision to the authorities after consulting his family as his mother was also ailing and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.After hearing the submissions, justice Menon directed that the letter be converted into a petition after the lockdown concluded and also directed the Union to grant the required permissions if Dholani decided to undertake the journey by road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-allows-pune-man-to-travel-by-road-to-assam-for-father-s-last-rites/story-W0ImNdXHwK7AIwOJvSFgWP.html
08-04-2020||Gurugram||Tablighi Jamaat traces its origins to the Mewat region||The Tablighi Jamaat has been in the eye of a storm since last week, when hundreds of Covid-19 affected people across the country were found to have links with a congregation (ijtema) of indeterminate duration at the Jamaat’s markaz headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin Basti in March.Started as an Islamic reform movement, the Tablighi Jamaat traces its origins to the Mewat region, where it was founded by Islamic scholar Maulana Muhammad Ilyas in 1926.Till today, Meo Muslims continue to form the core of the Jamaat movement, with a large majority of Meos subscribing to its tenets.Meo Muslims are spread across the once contiguous belt of eastern Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Culturally, this area spanning the three states is known as the Mewat region. Meos embraced Islam in various phases, between the 15th to the 17th century, and some of them continue to follow syncretic practices.Siddique Ahmed Meo, community historian and author of books on Mewat’s history, said the Jamaat’s origins in Mewat could be traced back to a time when labourers from Mewat, now officially known as Nuh, commuted to Delhi in search of work.According to the 2011 Census, the Nuh district’s population was about 1.09 million, of which the majority were Meo-Muslims. According to Meo, around 80% of the present-day population of Nuh district is made up of Meo Muslims.“People from Mewat would travel to Delhi for work and halt for lunch near the masjid in Nizamuddin, before proceeding ahead with the journey. Maulana Ilyas took notice of the labourers and enquired about them one day. Through conversations with the Meos, he realised that while they were Muslims, they did not have a good understanding of Islamic practices,” said Meo.Driven by his interactions with Meos in Nizamuddin, Maulana Ilyas visited Ferozepur Namak in Mewat for the first time in 1925. He started surveying the region and over subsequent visits, he came to the understanding that Meo Muslims needed to be introduced to Islamic practices and brought back into the fold.“A panchayat was called in Nuh and a charter consisting of names of 103 people was shared. Some 31 proposals aimed at laying the groundwork for the Jamaat were passed in that panchayat. Finally, in 1926, the Jamaat started undertaking trips to reach out to people and spread the message of Islam,” said Meo.He added that more than 90% of the people in Mewat identified themselves as Tablighi and the organisation exercised considerable influence in the region. “The aim of the Jamaat is to ensure that Muslims become better Muslims. It seeks to get Muslims to adopt practices followed by the Prophet Muhammad. All Meos might not go for the chilla (40-day Islamic camp), but they owe allegiance to the Tabligh,” said Meo.Tablighi Jamaat, Meo said, was also involved in various social interventions in present-day Mewat.“Tablighi Jamaat has been a strong proponent of eradication of practices like dowry in Mewat. Whenever they hold their ijtemas (Islamic congregations), they conduct mass nikah (marriage) ceremonies for people without any involvement of dowry. The Jamaat also seeks cooperation of imams in promoting polio eradication drives or preventing alcoholism and drug abuse in Mewat,” said Meo.Shail Mayaram, author of “Resisting Regimes: Myth, Memory and the Shaping of a Muslim Identity”, which discusses the Tablighi Jamaat, said it was a non-political outfit whose foundation was laid in Mewat. “Tablighi Jamaat’s aim is not to capture political power. They are only driven by the goal of making Muslims better Muslims. They focus on religious practice, one that is often seen as being conservative in nature,” said Mayaram, who is also a professor at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies.Mayaram said the Jamaat was hugely popular in Mewat and Meos played an important role within the organisation of the outfit.“Mewatis have a significant role in the Jamaat administration. Over the years, Mewatis both in India and Pakistan have become closer to the Jamaat,” she said.Mayaram added that the support of the Meos to the Jamaat in the decades after Partition was significantly influenced by excesses that Meos faced during the Partition.“In my view, the belief in the Jamaat can also be explained by the violence that Mewatis experienced during Partition. It led to a shift in the identities and how they navigated their ways in the changing landscape. The circumstances led to a strengthening of the Jamaat’s case in the region,” said Mayaram.According to several local residents, Tablighi Jamaat supports two madrasas — one each in Nuh and Ferozepur Jhirka. It has a markaz (centre) in Nuh which coordinates activities with the centre in Delhi. Arshad, a Nuh resident, who owes allegiance to the Jamaat, said two congregations take place in Nuh every year where members of the Jamaat come together. “Earlier, the jalsa (gathering) would be a one-day affair. Since last year, a three-day gathering has started taking place. There is no fixed schedule or venue for the gathering. It takes place in different villages every year,” said Arshad, who goes by his first name.Since the beginning of this year, the Jamaat has not conducted any congregation/gathering in Mewat. “Usually, the congregation happens in April, after the harvest of crops. People are relatively free during this time. There has not been any update on that front this year,” said Arshad.However, hundreds of locals are believed to have been at the congregation in Nizamuddin last month. The police identified at least 270 of them and isolated them in Government Polytechnic College in Malab and Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati Government Medical College, Nalhar, Nuh earlier this week. According to the health department, at least seven of them had tested positive for Covid-19 by Sunday.Shahid Ali, an advocate with the Tablighi Jamaat, said that while there was no written count of the members of the Jamaat; most people in Mewat subscribed to the Jamaat. “The organisation has a loose structure and there is no recorded membership, but the Jamaat traces its origin to Mewat due to which it is widely popular in the region. There is no fixed schedule for any congregation or gathering. Members of the Jamaat travel to Mewat for prayers, just as they visit other places across the country and beyond,” said Ali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/tablighi-jamaat-traces-its-origins-to-the-mewat-region/story-A1MBdEZzFtrNLLYdDnJbyI.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||National Wildlife Board issues final nod for Mumbai-Nagpur highway amid lockdown||The National Board of Wildlife (NBWL), under the Union environment ministry, issued the final clearance for the ₹55,335-crore Mumbai-Nagpur super communication highway during a meeting held on Tuesday via video-conferencing amid the ongoing nationwide lockdown.Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar who chaired the meeting issued approvals for projects from 11 different states. He tweeted, “The proposal from the Maharashtra government for an amendment to the construction of Nagpur-Mumbai super highway was approved, which shall boost the overall growth in the region.”The 701-km Hindu Hruday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg connecting Mumbai and Nagpur covering 10 districts, 26 talukas and 392 villages, will reduce the existing travel time of 15 hours to eight hours. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) had divided the entire highway into major packages or stretches for which environment clearances had been sought separately.Maharashtra chief wildlife warden Nitin Kakodkar said, “As far as wildlife clearances are concerned, the project now has all permissions in place. The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) had proposed mitigation measures such as underpasses, overpasses etc. for major wildlife zones. They are being examined by a committee whether these measures would be sufficient or otherwise. Once that is complete, there are no other hurdles from the wildlife point of view.”The project will require felling of over one lakh trees and passes through the 10-km eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Katepurna and Karanja Sohal Blackbuck wildlife sanctuaries towards one end of the state while cutting through the ESZ of Tansa lake sanctuary closer to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The total project requires 475 hectares of forest land. Kakodkar explained that it was erroneously mentioned in the state board of wildlife minutes of the meeting and proposal from February 2018 that 2% of the total project cost had to be paid up by MSRDC for mitigation measures under package 5 passing through Tansa’s ESZ. “Whereas 2% of the project cost for only this particular package area had to be paid not the total project cost. MSRDC brought this to the notice of the state, and an amended proposal was sent to NBWL, which received clearance on Tuesday,” said Kakodkar.Environmentalists questioned the Centre’s intention of issuing clearances during the Covid-19 lockdown period. “This time is being used to facilitate environment destruction. The NBWL is not part of essential services to clear projects. They also realised their decisions cannot be challenged at the moment in courts or otherwise,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/national-wildlife-board-issues-final-nod-for-mumbai-nagpur-highway-amid-lockdown/story-c9ZtJDuLzu3uO1kq5IYYTK.html

Inmates of Amritsar Central Jail have already stitched around 6,000 face masks and will continue to do so till Covid-19 is contained, a jail official said.Among those who are spending hours on the sewing machine include Sukhdev Singh, 65, A Tarn Taran resident who is serving a 10-year jail term in a drug case and Joginder Singh, 45, a tailor convicted of murder. “Sukhdev learnt the art of stitching masks from his fellow prisoners in a short duration. He is now stitching 80 to 100 masks daily,” said the official. Sukhdev and Joginder are among the 60 prisoners, including 15 women, who are stitching masks to meet the shortage. The government has already included masks and hand sanitisers in the list of essential commodities following the outbreak of the coronavirus. “Around 60 convicts are making face masks. Apart from providing masks to all jail inmates, we have produced 6,000 face masks till now,” said jail superintendent Arshdeep Singh Gill. The jail houses 3,000 inmates — convicts and undertrials. “The double-layered face masks are made of khadi cloth and are washable. We have been getting orders from various nursing colleges and government hospitals. We will continue with this until the virus is contained,” he said. Another jail official said those engaged in making masks are paid ₹60 per day as per the rules. He said 70 stitching machines have been arranged for the purpose. “If the demand arises, we will involve more prisoners and increase the count of machines,” he said. Three separate wards for new inmatesThe jail authorities have made arrangements to separate new inmates from the ones already there as a precaution. Besides spraying of disinfectants, three wards have been earmarked for new inmates, gill said. “We are making the new inmates to spend at least 14 days in separate barracks before shifting them to other parts of the jail. Six doctors are regularly checking the inmates,” he said. 651 PRISONERS RELEASEDIn a bid to decongest the central jail, which is overcrowded, the authorities have released 651 undertrials and convicts and the process of releasing more is underway. The jail has the capacity to accommodate 2,200 prisoners, but it has around 3,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amritsar-jail-inmates-stitching-face-masks-to-meet-shortage-in-hospitals/story-yWxApargsPwDwCPs974evK.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC seeks report on 4,000 centres providing free meals to labourers and migrants||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the state and district legal services authority to verify the government’s claims that it had started around 4,000 distribution centres to provide meals to over 7 lakh migrant labourers and daily wage earners across the state.The court was hearing a petition, seeking a stay on two government resolutions dated March 29 and 30, which stated that labourers and migrants who can’t sustain themselves following the lockdown would have to pay Rs 2 and 5 for foodgrains, which was against the Centre’s announcement of free ration for such persons for three months.On Wednesday, the state government informed a bench of justice A A Sayyed that it can implement the central government’s scheme but there was an apprehension that it would lead to hoarding and black marketing of the free ration. The additional government pleader also informed the HC that the state would implement the scheme after verifying that the beneficiaries were indeed without any means to sustain themselves.The state’s counsel added that as many migrants and labourers had no means to cook after the lockdown, it had started providing them free meals, three times a day, by setting up 4,000 distribution centres throughout the state. The state added that over 7 lakh people were being benefited through the scheme. After hearing the submissions, the bench directed the state and district legal services authority, which has its presence in 350 districts and talukas, to verify the government’s claims and submit a report thereof. The court also directed the state’s food and civil supplies department to file an affidavit detailing the number of foodgrains disbursed and the number of people who benefitted from it. The matter was posted for further hearing on April 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-seeks-report-on-4-000-centres-providing-free-meals-to-labourers-and-migrants/story-QF3bBKJe0gRIoQKeu6anGL.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||HC refuses to relax burial conditions for Covid-19 victims||The Bombay high court (HC) has refused to issue any directions to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) with regards to burial of Covid-19 victims on the grounds that there were no instances wherein families of victims were turned away by any graveyards in the city. The court was hearing a petition filed by activist Anjali Patil stating that the circular issued by BMC regarding burial of Covid-19 infected persons had conditions that were not available in all graveyards in the city. The petitioner sought directions from the court asking BMC to relax the conditions.On Wednesday, the bench of justice AA Sayyed while hearing two similar petitions -- one filed by Patil and another by Riyaz Ahmed Mohammed Ayub Khan -- was informed that BMC had issued a circular which stated that persons from the minority community who died after being afflicted by coronavirus could be buried but had laid down various conditions for the same. The petitioners submitted that the conditions were stringent and were not available across all graveyards, thus forcing the families of the victim to take the body to only those graveyards which complied with the conditions.The conditions include wearing of masks by persons involved in the burial, sanitising the area where the mortal remains are kept, burying the victim in a secluded spot, among others. However, the bench sought to know of instances wherein families of victims had been turned away either by graveyard trusts or BMC. Petitioners replied that there could be such instances but they were not aware of it. They added they had an apprehension that such a situation could arise in the coming days and hence sought directions to BMC and graveyard trusts to allow burial of Covid-19 victims in all graveyards.The court then observed that it could not issue directions based on apprehensions of petitioners and posted the matter for further hearing on April 24.In an earlier hearing on April 3, the court had refused to stay the circular issued by BMC on the grounds that it did not refuse burial of Covid-19 victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-to-relax-burial-conditions-for-covid-19-victims/story-k4FmkKYvAtJYpuI7HcGnQK.html

In an interview to PTI here, he also said the state intended to relax liquor sales, stopped since the 21-day lockdown was imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19, after April 14 in a bid to increase state revenues.The chief minister said the state’s legislators would take a 30 per cent salary cut. According to officials, there were no Covid-19 cases in 12 districts of the total 30 districts in the state. As on Wednesday, there were 181 Covid-19 cases in the state, including 5 deaths and 28 discharges. If the Prime Minister suggests to states to take decision (on lock-down) based on the situation in their respective states, my position is to take a call (on roll-back) in districts free from Covid-19, Yediyurappa said.This is to allow people to go about their business and move about within the district and not from one district to another, after April 14, after taking the approval of the Prime Minister, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-in-favour-of-lifting-lockdown-in-districts-not-affected-by-covid-19-says-cm/story-6F87n5lo5MIL9Oa0clHEaN.html
08-04-2020||Kolkata||7 coronavirus hotspots identified in Bengal, says CM Mamata Banerjee||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said the government has identified seven Covid-19 hotspots in the state and is chalking out a plan to restrict the virus within those areas.The chief minister said flower growers and bidi workers, who were facing problems in doing business, can now start working.Banerjee also said that the death toll in the state has risen to five, while the number of active cases stands at 69. On Tuesday, eight new coronavirus cases were reported.“We have identified seven Covid-19 hotspots in the state,” Banerjee said without giving details about the names of the vulnerable areas.“We have to restrict this within that small place and draw a Lakshman Rekha around it so that it does not spread to other places,” she told reporters at the state secretariat.The chief minister also said that she was weighing the option of providing “limited relaxation” on the work front for unorganised sector employees, who were among the worst hit by the lockdown.“There’s no doubt that people are facing problems. So we are mulling the idea of allowing limited relaxation to some unorganised sectors so that workers can start earning. We will also allow Kisan Mandi to operate but everybody has to adhere to the social distancing norms,” she added.From Wednesday, flower cultivators, who were facing trouble in selling their produce, will be allowed by police to resume their business, the chief minister said.“Large flower markets will be made operational from Thursday and those selling flowers in local markets can start work from Wednesday. The police will not stop them,” she said.Banerjee also said that those working for the bidi industry can start working keeping in mind social distancing.“Bidi workers can start working at their homes, but only seven can sit together keeping a distance of two metres from one another. If you violate this, police will take strict action,” she said.Apparently hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party, Banerjee alleged that some political parties were trying to misguide subscribers at ration shops.Meanwhile, Nobel laureate economist Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, who is a member of the ‘Global Advisory Board’ formed to help the state government in preparing a roadmap in reviving the economy of the state post Covid-19, suggested a few steps to combat the disease here.“We can conduct rapid tests on people even if they are having normal cough and cold.

Labour woes, transportation cost, and the shortage of raw material have hit the sector in the hill state that was already reeling under the impact of the global economic slowdown.“The CII strongly recommends that the demand charges, consumer service charges and meter rent, which form the fixed charges in electricity bills, be waived for six months that may be extended in due course, depending upon the situation, from March 2020.

08-04-2020||Lifestyle||Will Covid-19 change the way we dine?||Let’s face it, this city loves to eat and mushrooming of restaurants all around was a proof of that. However with the closure of restaurants enforced by the coronavirus pandemic has brought the most important question to the fore- ‘will the culture of eating out change’? Will diners become more cautious about going out and dining with several others? And overcoming this hurdle will be the most challenging task ahead for restaurateurs.Aniesha Chaana, a digital marketing manager and a frequent diner at the Capital’s popular eateries worries about the precautions restaurants will take in the future. She says, “I used to dine out at least thrice a week. But now I will be a little apprehensive to eat out. Earlier which was the most inconsequential action like touching the menu card, will now turn into something really worrisome. Moreover, being at home actually has also given plenty the time to experiment with their culinary skills and I am sure about the hygiene.”Restaurant owners fear this and are working towards getting back their patrons. Several restaurateurs feel that, while they will take stringent preventive measures to ensure proper hygiene and safety of diners, it will be a humongous, challenging task to rebuild the trust and win the faith of customers. Akshay Anand, founder, Ophelia and Toy Room, feels that gaining the same pace as before will require patience, diligence and hard work. He says, “Once the nation gets a control over this unfortunate issue, the entire restaurant and bar will face a colossal task to re-establish themselves and gain back the glory it had before the commencement of this pandemic. We will have to ensure that all staff members are completely out of danger before starting the operations. Safety and hygiene measures will be the topmost priority.”Due to the severe negative impact on the global economy and wealth erosion, there might be a shift towards conservative spending believes Zorawar Kalra of Massive Restaurants Pvt Ltd . He says, “It will take several months for things to return to status quo. But we are hopeful. As all businesses, we are looking forward to opening our doors to welcome our patrons only when there is complete safety for our guests and colleagues and once the authorities give us a green signal. During the lockdown period we are utilising our resources and infrastructure to focus on charity by feeding the needy.”While hygiene and customer’s safety will be the topmost priority, restaurateurs are brainstorming on finding ways to get back their patrons. Amit Bagga , co-founder, Daryaganj says, “ The restaurant will be also be organising special contests and events and other activities to attract more customers when it reopens. However after the restrictions end for restaurants to open, which could be another 2 months from now, it would take a further few months after that for the restaurant footfalls to come back to normal.”Measures to ensure that social distancing is maintained even after the lockdown ends, some have started planning the seating plan to maintain it. Inderjeet Singh Banga, founder, Prankster and Pra Pra prank and also Gurgaon Chapter Head, National Restaurant Association of India. He says, “We shall first be making a social distance dining for patrons by operating every alternate table and creating more space between tables. We will be further improving the hygiene practices by including masks, hand gloves and sanitisers for staff , on priority.”Despite the tough times, there is a ray of hope for restaurants to get back into action. “The first two weeks will be the best time of business for restaurateurs, feels Priyank Sukhija, MD and CEO, First Fiddle F&B Pvt Ltd. However, he also says that when the situation gets better, restaurants are going to be the last ones to open, and further adds, “In case, the restaurants open with restrictions, it will be very difficult to survive as per the current market scenario. We can only hope that the landlords cooperate in our tough time. During that time, we will have to dedicatedly work on the hygiene level of our restaurants.”Post Covid-19 the restaurant industry will be significantly different, and many diners would prefer to go out for cocktails than food once life comes back to normal believes, Akash Kalra, MD of The United Group. He further says, “The restaurant sector will have to struggle to cope by coming up with flat discounts and deal to lure customers and patrons again.”Interact with the author on Twitter/sanchita_kalra||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/will-covid-19-change-the-way-we-dine/story-2CCiP8n7aTSbAWv20mj4KL.html

08-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus outbreak: No liquor sale during curfew, says Chandigarh administration||The administration of Chandigarh on Tuesday decided against the opening of liquor vends in the city during the ongoing lockdown.After UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida took to micro-blogging site Twitter on Tuesday morning to seek suggestions on the opening of liquor vends for a limited period during the curfew, there was a strong buzz among bacchus lovers that the administration might open up the outlets.Parida had tweeted, “One doctor has suggested allowing two-hour opening of liquor shops lest the addicts go for drugs or depression. Your views group?”Later, putting all the speculations to rest, Parida again used the social media platform to inform the public that no liquor vends would be opened. “Decision taken after consulting all, including government doctors, not to open liquor shops during curfew,” he posted in the tweet.The liquor vends are closed in the city since the curfew was imposed on April 24 in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.While the administration has allowed curfew relaxations for essential commodities such as grocery, vegetables and medicines, the sale of liquor has not been allowed. As per the central government’s guidelines and the Essential Commodities Act, liquor is not covered under such items.Responding to Parida’s call for suggestions on the opening of the liquor vends, the twitterati were divided in their views.WHAT TWITTERATI SAID“Respected sir, if you will open wine shops for two hours, movement of people will be increased in large numbers. Also, people from Mohali, Zirakpur and Panchkula will also get attracted to come to Chandigarh, so chances of the spread Covid-19 will be high,” tweeted one user.Another city resident tweeted, “I don’t agree with this. People will sit together and drink. They won’t follow isolation orders. I deal with alcoholics in PGIMER. If they feel craving that’s a bad sign, they must be treated in drug de-addiction centres. Alcohol is not a drug, it’s a toxin (slow poison).”Expressing desperation, a twitter user came in support of the sale of liquor and wrote, “Sir, you should also think about them, otherwise, they will go mad due to the break of intoxication, if not from the coronavirus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-outbreak-no-liquor-sale-during-curfew-says-chandigarh-administration/story-YPxacDKTWEtS9NpmkJyvWJ.html
08-04-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER puts plan in place for suspected patients with no travel, contact history||The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has put in place a protocol to admit patients exhibiting symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI), which are similar to those of coronavirus disease, but with no established link with positive Covid-19 patients.SARI is an acute respiratory illness of recent onset (within seven days) with symptoms like fever, cough and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing requiring hospitalisation.The protocol is in line with national guidelines for Covid-19 testing, which along with symptomatic foreign returnees and their high-risk contacts, also cover people with SARI.For this, the emergency wing’s area 22 has been converted into a dedicated SARI ward. The area also includes two orthopaedic wards and three operation theaters.“There has been difficulty in screening patients with no travel or contact history. So we have established a SARI ward, where we will admit patients according to the PGI SARI Scoring Scale and test for common etiology of acute viral pneumonias,” the protocol report states.HOW IT WORKSThe SARI scale (with scores up to 8) will shortlist a patient for Covid-19 testing based on their symptoms and X-rays.The patients will be scored for fever, shortness of breath, cough, high-risk individuals, SpO2 level (amount of oxygen in the blood) and chest X-ray.The high-risk individuals include patients aged above 60, pregnant women, and persons with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung disorders and history of steroid use.If the SARI scale count is above 5, the patient will be admitted and tested for H1N1 and Covid-19, and admitted in the exclusive Covid facility if tested positive for it.If the scale count is between 2 and 4, a chest X-ray will be conducted to determine if the patient requires Covid testing, and if the count is 1 or below, the patient will be evaluated for other cardio-respiratory diseases.So far, at least two patients, who had exhibited SARI symptoms, have died in the emergency ward of the institute and later tested positive for Covid-19. Due to no travel or contact history, the patients were not suspected for the infectious disease at the early stage. Among the two patients was a 69-year-old man from Mohali district’s Nayagaon town, and a 70-year-old Delhi woman, who was staying at a guest house in Solan, Himachal Pradesh. FOR NOW, NO PLANS FOR ANTIBODY TESTING: UTThe UT health department has no plans to introduce rapid antibody-based blood testing for deducing Covid-19 patients in the city for now.Unlike the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test that detects the virus’s genetic material (RNA) in throat and nasal swabs to diagnose a current Covid-19 infection, rapid antibody tests indicate if a person has been infected in the past and has developed immunity to the virus.UT adviser Manoj Parida said that introducing this test depends on the number of cases and their location. “If the cases are localised then we will adopt the procedure,” Parida said. So far, Chandigarh has recorded 18 cases of Covid-19, out of which seven have been treated.Another senior UT official, wishing not to be named, said that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has advised that rapid antibody testing should be introduced if a high number of cases from a particular geographical area is reported. So far, there has been no such instance in the city, he said. A simple blood test (using a finger prick) that takes 15-20 minutes to give results identifies people who were infected at least a week before the test, and also those who were infected but never diagnosed, helping map undetected infections and giving the correct extent of the spread.Director health service Dr G Diwan said the administration is waiting for guidelines from the Government of India on antibody rapid testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-puts-plan-in-place-for-suspected-patients-with-no-travel-contact-history/story-mka5F6s1lJxAl5s8bCodmO.html
08-04-2020||City||Markaz connection: Minorities at receiving end in Mohali, teen’s burial delayed, Kolkata family harassed||Concerns over Covid-19 and bad press over the Tabhligi Jamaat Markaz in Delhi could have been linked to two cases of discrimination against members of a particular community, it has been learnt.The incidents came to the fore on Tuesday, tragically so when one family was attending to an ailing relative in hospital and the other was mourning the passing away of a young girl.The burial of a 16-year-old young girl was delayed in Kharar in one instance and in the other a family that had rushed to Mohali from Kolkata to attend to a gravely ill relative had to move to a guest house in Chandidgarh after neighbours objected to their renting a house in the area.VILLAGE PANCHAYAT REFUSES BURIALAt Radiala village, a 16-year-old girl who died after an epileptic attack, was denied burial by the sarpanch, who sought proof of her not suffering from Covid-19.The 16-year-old daughter of a tempo driver choked to death after someone gave her water during a seizure. The last rites could be completed only after the Kharar sub-divisional magistrate Himanshu Jain intervened when the mother of the deceased wrote a letter to him appealing for help. Before that, however, the body had to be taken to the Kharar Civil Hospital for an autopsy.“It is unfortunate that the girl could be buried only after the team of administration officials convinced the villagers that a postmortem had confirmed the cause of her death as choking of the respiratory tract,” said Jain.KOLKATA FAMILY MOVED TO CHANDIGARH FROM MOHALI A family of seven from Kolkata temporarily renting a house in Mohali to be close to a relative, an engineer with a Bathinda thermal plant who was in hospital after brain haemorrhage, had to move to a rest house in Chandigarh. That was after neighbours called the police objecting to members of a particular community renting accommodation nearby.Police, however, said as verification of the family had not been done they were requested to move to the Chandigarh rest house till all formalities were completed. “As the neighbours had objected we have requested the family to shift to a rest house in Chandigarh. They could not have taken the accommodation on rent without verification so till then they have agreed to shift back,” said Manphull Singh, station house officer, Phase 1 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/markaz-connection-minorities-at-receiving-end-in-mohali-teen-s-burial-delayed-kolkata-family-harassed/story-yEJ4iFelskdHHmYIp7mGCM.html
08-04-2020||Chandigarh||Music to ears as Chandigarh golfer tries to make best of lockdown||As luck would have it, Ajeetesh Sandhu was already in India when the clampdown happened due to coronavirus outbreak in India. In between tournaments, Sandhu was supposed to play in Royal Cup in Thailand but once that got deferred due to Covid-19 outbreak, the golfer returned to India and shifted his focus on Indian Open. As luck would have it, Sandhu was at home when not only the event got postponed but the entire country was put in lockdown.From being a globe-trotting golfer Sandhu is very much enjoying his extended stay at home. With the course out of bound, Sandhu is spending time between a chip and putt in his backyard and some putting inside his home.“No one knows how long it will last. We are at least in it for 21 days. For me it has been dividing time between a bit of chipping, putting in my backyard and doing some sort of physical fitness. I am also a big fan of yoga and meditation and these two are also coming in handy to stay mentally fit,” Sandhu said, who won the Jeev Milkha Invitational golf at Chandigarh Golf Club last year. Sandhu playing at his home course was tied with Rashid Khan at the end of regulation play but won in playoff which lasted four extra holes at the Chandigarh Golf Club. For Sandhu it was his fourth title on the PGTI and fifth overall. Karandeep Kochhar of Chandigarh took third place at 17-under-271 after a flawless 68 in round four.He also had two second place finishes in the Bangabandhu Cup Open which also got delayed this year and tied second finish in Mercuries Taiwan Masters.While for many players disruption of rhythm is a challenge for Sandhu this break couldn’t have come at a better time. “I know this sounds strange and the whole world is fighting this pandemic. I have been on road since November last year. I was already trying to decide when to take a week off from tour as sometimes it gets too much. The good thing will be that everyone will come out refreshed once the break is over. So, I am not disappointed,” the 31-year-old said.Beating the lockdownSandhu said everyone in the world had to make this sudden adjustment with the lockdown in place. For a change he is enjoying home cooked meal a luxury he never had on the tour. “I am also learning to cook a bit. Music is one my other interest and I have joined online classes in order to learn how to read music. I have never been a fan of online games so these are few things and some quality family time that is keeping me busy,” Sandhu said. Learning to stay in touch with the game is also proving to be a challenge and Sandhu said this break has helped him work of his technique and skills something which a player can’t devote much time while on tour. “It’s is a different kind of practice. It is to do with a lot of technique. You are not on tour and not competing. You get a chance to work on technical aspects and focus on areas you want to improve,” the golfer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/music-to-ears-as-chandigarh-golfer-tries-to-make-best-of-lockdown/story-GaBRUwe1rvZzOzkfOFfbWN.html
08-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh may follow Centre’s staggered strategy to exit 21-day coronavirus curfew||The UT administration will be following the Centre’s guidelines on whether to extend the curfew or not after April 14, as the nation awaits the end of the 21-day lockdown imposed to combat the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.The administration will also take into account the number of local incidences and geographical spread of positive cases in the city before a final decision on curfew extension/withdrawal is taken.Confirming the development, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, said, “Chandigarh being a union territory, the administration will be following the Center’s directions on the lockdown withdrawal or continuation. The UT administrator will take the final decision on the issue after considering the (extent of) spread and the number of positive cases in the city. The decision will be taken on April 14.”The administration imposed a curfew in the city on March 24, a day before the 21-day lockdown was announced from March 25 onwards. As per the administration’s orders, the curfew will continue “till further orders”, which the UT officials believe will last at least till April 14.Significantly, while most states opted for a lockdown, Chandigarh like Punjab imposed a curfew. But the administration had to introduce an eight-hour relaxation after it came under criticism for failure to deliver essential commodities to people’s houses as promised. Later, it cut the relaxation period to four hours from 11 am to 3pm.CENTRE’S DIRECTIONS AND GROUND SITUATION The UT officials refused to divulge the specific number of positive cases, which will be considered as the most important factor when taking the decision on extension/withdrawal of curfew. After the initial spurt in positive cases after March 18, the situation stabilised with no new cases in the last five days in the city. Out of the 18 positive cases, seven have recovered so far, and there has been no death because of the pandemic in the city.“The ground situation regarding Covid-19 cases and central directions will determine the administration’s decision on the issue. Significantly, the cabinet secretary last week issued a clarification denying that the lockdown will be extended. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also asked to develop an exit strategy for withdrawing the lockdown. But with some of the states, particularly those most affected by the coronavirus outbreak, requesting an extension, the Centre might reconsider their decision,” said a senior UT official, who didn’t wish to be named. UTS’S EXIT STRATEGYOne of the strategies being considered is a staggered approach to lifting the curfew. “In case the number of cases increase, but are limited to a particular geographical area, the administration can opt for a staggered approach where the curbs remain imposed in the high risk zones and not elsewhere.“The administration will put in place a containment policy for such areas. Under that policy, geographical quarantines will be created around the hot zones. Strict curfew will continue in such areas with the sealing of all exit and entry points. But in other areas of the city, gradual withdrawal of curfew could be undertaken,” said the official.The continuous increase in the number of positive cases in neighbouring Mohali remains a concern for the administration. “Part of assessment of the ground situation will be the status of the cases in the neighbouring cities. In Mohali, particularly, rural and semi-urban areas, the number of patients testing positive for coronavirus has been consistently on the rise. If this trend continues, it will be difficult for Chandigarh to introduce blanket withdrawal of the curfew.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-may-follow-centre-s-staggered-strategy-to-exit-21-day-coronavirus-curfew/story-ktrHLb9GghMnYUHdoaxcdM.html

The investigating officials said the messages were defaming a particular community “by connecting them with the spread of coronavirus”. “The posts were misleading and provocative. Hence, action was initiated,” said a cyber official, privy to the matter.The two FIRs have been registered under Section 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) of the Indian Penal Code at the police stations in Sectors 17 and 34. Efforts are on to ascertain and trace the persons who sent these messages.On April 4, the cyber cell had registered two similar FIRs for communal messages on Facebook. The police action follows Union home ministry directions to states and union territories, to take effective measures against fake news in view of the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing lockdown.

08-04-2020||Chandigarh||Ready for war: Mohali gets 19 Covid Commandos in khaki||Physically fit and self-motivated, 19 Mohali police constables have been selected as members of a first emergency response team dealing with Covid-19 patients and affected areas. They are the Covid Commandos.The men will spearhead coordination and response to persons and areas affected by Covid-19 in Mohali, which has been reporting a sharp rise in cases, the last count being 26 patients.“The district will have 19 Covid Commandos, designated district Covid-19 emergency response team working within Mohali district,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Mohali.Selected for their high motivation and fitness levels from Mohali police, the constables have themselves volunteered to take up the onerous job of Covid-19 control in this moment of extreme exigency.“The commandos will be ready for deployment in a short span of 30 minutes within the entire district,” Chahal added.Having the commandos in place will mean freeing other Mohali police personnel from dealing first hand with Covid-19, reducing chances of infection in the police force.The commandos have been provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) and are trained to wear, remove and dispose these. Their go-bags include PPE for commandos and first aid supplies for response to community members.“They are trained and motivated to meet the requirement of an on-scene police presence along with health department staff. The drills for handling a non cooperative positive patient are well rehearsed. Standard operating procedures are also in place,” added Chahal.The commandos are prepared for health department and community requests to evolve and reflect the needs of Covid-19 patients, including but not limited to transport to hospitals, wellness checks, and delivery of critical items like medication. “Officers may be required to enforce revised local or regional public health ordinances, such as mandatory quarantines, isolation, or travel restrictions. Provide testing and coordinate treatment to limit the spread of Covid-19 within the district,” said Chahal. SHIELDED FROM INFECTIONCovid Commandos will be wearing PPE (personal protection equipment) that includes single pair of disposable examination gloves, disposable isolation gown or single-use/disposable coveralls, particulate respirator (N-95 or higher-level respirator) and eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ready-for-war-mohali-gets-19-covid-commandos-in-khaki/story-EBxn2rpKSykzOGcbigqlEK.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||Students in Maharashtra’s remote areas to get access to learning content on app, TV and radio||To make learning accessible for students in the remote parts of Maharashtra, the state education department has planned to roll out online educational content through mobile application, television and radio mediums. Officials said that the first phase of online learning is set to roll out from April 15 and last till May. “While students from private schools have a plethora of content and mediums available for learning, those in remote areas and those who have no access to technology are having a tough time, as there is no learning during the ongoing lockdown days. The idea is to reach out to these students through whatever ways possible,” said Madhukar Banuri, chief executive officer and co-founder of Leadership for Equity, a non-profit organisation that works in the education sector. The organisation, along with UNICEF and the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT), has worked for the initiative.In the first phase, the department plans to upload educational content on the DIKSHA app, which is an initiative of the Union human resource development (HRD) ministry. The app already consists of more than 9,000 learning modules for Class 1 to Class 8. The state is also in talks about the possible use of television and radio to air educational content for students who do not have access to smartphones. “As per our information, around 50% parents in the state have smartphones. To reach out to the remaining students, TV and radio will be useful,” added Banuri.Meanwhile, Balbharti, the state’s publishing unit, is also mulling to publish PDF copies of Class 12 textbooks as per the revised syllabus which are not yet out in the market. While the bureau has already completed the work on compulsory subjects, work on optional subjects is likely to finish soon. These textbooks are likely to be made available online before they enter markets, so that students can start studying for their board exams.In case the lockdown is extended, a second phase of online learning is being planned in June, during which teachers from across state schools will be involved and virtual classes would be conducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-in-maharashtra-s-remote-areas-to-get-access-to-learning-content-on-app-tv-and-radio/story-0SINPZsIdhreV3ukIFSvCO.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus lockdown effect:Mumbai’s air cleaner by 50% in a month||The share of harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) 10 and PM2.5 dropped by 60%, 49% and 45% respectively in the city’s air from March 1-5 to April 1-5, the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) revealed on Tuesday.  “Transport and industrial pollution contribute to more than 80% of NOx, and both the sources have reduced significantly resulting in a maximum drop for this pollutant. In case of PM10 and PM2.5, the major sources are windblown dust, transport and industries. Due to rise in temperature, dust is getting suspended closer to the surface resulting in the lesser decline compared to NOx,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune. “While assessing background pollution levels for major cities, we are witnessing unprecedented trends that have not been observed before. These studies need to be taken into account during pollution mitigation plans once the lockdown is removed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-lockdown-effect-mumbai-s-air-cleaner-by-50-in-a-month/story-yQsvT1UFCDz6flYQ0r11hM.html
08-04-2020||City||50% of Covid-19 waste disposed of unsafely, says Mumbai civic body||Almost half the Covid-19 waste generated from quarantine centres, containment zones and self-isolation centres in the city is disposed of unsafely, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) solid waste management department.According to the MPCB data, Mumbai has been generating an average of 1,500 kg of Covid-19 waste per day, which is the highest in Maharashtra as most cases are from the city. From March 22 to 31, the amount of waste ranged between 500kg and 600kg a day. On April 1, the amount of waste doubled to 1,342kg and 1,370kg on April 2. A sharp spike in Covid-19 waste collection was seen on April 3 and 4 to 2,022.1kg and 2,328kg. On April 5 again, the quantum dropped to 1,351.15 kg. “The fluctuation shows improper segregation,” said Amar Supate, principal scientific officer and head of bio-medical waste management, MPCB. “The BMC needs to make announcements and issue warnings at quarantine zones and containment centres to make citizens aware on the potential risk for others, especially the SWM staff. Our regional officers are looking into this.”The BMC’s department has now appealed to citizens to follow instructions from the urban development department and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) in order to safeguard others from contracting the infection through improper segregation “The number of quarantined centres and containment zones is increasing on a daily basis. During waste collection by our on-field staff, only one bag is being received or in some cases, waste (including Covid-19 waste) is being dumped directly outside the containment zone. Our staff is segregating this waste from source areas. At the moment, segregation of Covid-19 waste is inadequate and just about 50% of the quantity generated daily,” said Ashok Khaire, deputy municipal commissioner, SWM. “This is a serious issue as it increases the risk of transmission. Citizens are being educated on the threat posed by this.”At two major containment areas in Worli (Worli-Koliwada and Jijamata Nagar), the worst-hit areas in Mumbai, there was no waste segregation at all, said another SWM official, requesting anonymity. “Our staff is isolating the waste from collection points to ensure passers-by do not get contaminated; segregating it and sending it for incineration,” he said.As per the MPCB guidelines, Khaire explained the BMC had procured yellow bags (the official colour of all Covid-19 waste) with biohazard signs on them. Yellow bags should contain used syringes, medicines, used masks, gloves, urine bags, body fluid or blood soaked tissues or cotton etc. “This is being taken to an incinerator facility at Deonar dumping ground using a separate vehicle within three hours of collection. All other waste is being collected in black bags and taken to another section at Deonar using separate vehicles where special treatment using sodium hypochlorite solution is being done, and then discarded,” said Khaire. “Personal protective equipment (PPE) for those handling Covid-19 waste is also sent to the incinerator facility after every trip, and fresh PPE is provided.”Confusion over waste segregation began when the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on March 25 issued a circular that Covid-19 waste from quarantine camps, homes and other self-isolation units need not be collected under the new Covid-19 waste rules, but treated as general biomedical waste. However, the MPCB clarified that this was not a safe practice and did not alter the state’s guidelines. “We need to be very careful and treat all in isolation as infected to cut off transmission,” said Supate.Experts said behavioural change was needed. “Despite visible concerns related to the virus, people’s attitude does not change. The only option is stricter proactive enforcement, which is also not happening. This waste should not change hands. More hazmat suits are needed. Once the waste is removed from the hotspot, it should be disinfected from outside and incinerated as early as possible,” said Dilip Boralkar, former member secretary, MPCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/50-of-covid-19-waste-disposed-of-unsafely-says-mumbai-civic-body/story-MH8KHKIhg8rs5q5DoefHfM.html

There is also uncertainty about the commencement of the next academic year.In separate virtual meetings, the state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant clarified that examinations will be conducted later this year. All state and private universities have been requested to put together a contingency plan for examinations in summer, after the lockdown is lifted. Educationists and experts have raised concerns about the domino effect of this delay. “We have suggested the academic year 2020-21 be pushed from June 2020 to October 2020, so that colleges have enough time to conduct second-term exams for the current batch in June and finish assessment by September, in time to start a new academic year in October,” said TA Shiware, chairman of the Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges. A suggestion along these lines has already been shared with the state government and Mumbai University.The admissions process for most professional courses are also in limbo. In March, the state common entrance test (CET) cell postponed the MH-CET for engineering and pharma courses indefinitely. The entrance tests were originally scheduled to take place between April 13 and 23.Last week, the National Testing Agency (NTA) announced the second phase of joint entrance examination (JEE) Mains will now be held in the last week of May. About 9 lakh students have registered for this exam, which was originally scheduled to take place between April 5 and April 11. NTA has issued a statement saying the next possible dates will be announced after April 15. Following this announcement, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi announced that the JEE Advanced exam will also be postponed to the last week of May, hinting at a delay in admissions to engineering institutes across the country.“If the state CET cell as well as the NTA can manage to conduct the entrance exams by May 15, we can still regularise admissions to start the academic year in time. However, any further delay will lead to a bigger delay in the commencement of the next academic year,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College in Bandra.The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test NEET for undergraduate medical and dental aspirants too has been postponed and while results of NEET-PG were released in February, admissions have been stalled owing to the lockdown at present.“Whatever the decision, the government has made it very clear that students will not be at a loss. Neither will their academics be compromised, nor the exams and results. Education institutes are working very hard to ensure this,” said Abhay Wagh, director, state Directorate of Technical Education (DTE).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/chalk-out-contingency-plan-to-conduct-exams-maharashtra-government-tells-universities/story-GsZjkzyQFt5o9vPb2zMHdL.html

NO RAPE CASESWhile no rape cases have been reported, the number of burglary, snatching and robbery cases have been low. However, in the past 13 days, three murder cases have come to the fore. Of the three, two have been solved and the accused have been arrested. The unsolved case pertains to the murder of a liquor vend salesman, which took place on the intervening night of April 2 and 3. Police suspect the hand of an acquaintance in the crime. February, meanwhile, had seen major crimes, including a 30-kg gold heist from IIFL gold loan branch, besides a murder case. SNATCHINGSIn February, as many as 23 cases of snatchings were reported in city, while from March 1 to March 22, the number came down to 14.

08-04-2020||City||Maharashtra’s coronavirus death rate double than India’s||Mortality rate of patients tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 in Maharashtra is double compared to that of India, according to the data for all states available till Monday.As on Monday, the state had 868 cases and 52 deaths and thus a mortality rate of 5.98%, against India’s 2.66%, with 4,542 cases and 121 deaths. In Maharashtra, the numbers rose to 1,018 cases and 64 deaths on Tuesday.A comparison with data for other states till Monday shows that Maharashtra is fourth in terms of mortality rate. Gujarat tops the list with a mortality rate of 8.33% (12 deaths), although the total number of cases is 114. After Gujarat, Punjab’s mortality rate is 7.89% with 6 deaths and 76 cases; Himachal Pradesh’s mortality rate is 7.69% with one death and 13 cases. After Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu has the highest number of cases — 621 – but the mortality rate is 0.80% with five deaths. Delhi has third highest cases — 523 and seven deaths – and the mortality rate is 1.33%. Kerala has 327 cases, but only two deaths. Their mortality rate is 0.61%.Currently, the mortality rate of the state is higher than the world’s – 5.58% (12,10,956 cases and 67,594 deaths). However, what needs to be considered is that in India, testing is limited vis-a-vis a majority of other countries like Germany, US, South Korea and UK. This also means that several asymptomatic persons, who may be carrying the virus, have not been tested, and our numbers of total infected cases may be much higher which can have bearing on mortality rates.State officials pointed out that the fatalities in Maharashtra are more in the elderly age group and with those who have co-morbid conditions such as heart disease, kidney failure, diabetes etc. The other aspect of the deaths in Maharashtra is that in several cases, the disease manifested at a later stage.Public health experts are still trying to find the reasons behind the higher mortality rate, but they have suggested that those who show any symptoms of the virus should rush to a Covid-19 dedicated hospital, instead of waiting.For instance, the first death in Dharavi was of a 56-year-old who had no travel history. He died a day after he tested positive. Health officials retracing his history said he had visited a local clinic on March 23 complaining of cough. Following this, on March 28, the patient had complained of chest pain and underwent treatment at Sion Hospital. “The test results of the patient arrived on April 1 after which he was moved from Sion Hospital to Kasturba Hospital and died a day later. In this case, the manifestation of the disease started at a very late stage owing to which the patient could not be saved,” said a senior BMC health official. “Our analysis shows that mortality is higher in cases of comorbidities and people who are in the upper age bracket. These conditions add to the complications, leading to deaths,” said Dr Anup Yadava, director, National Health Mission (NHM) in Maharashtra. An analysis by the state medical education department and health department shows that the highest mortality rate (28.57%) is in the age group of 71-80, with 28 cases and eight deaths so far. In the 61-70 age bracket, of the total 84 cases, 19 deaths have been recorded, bringing the mortality rate to 22.62%. The 51-60 age group has 107 cases and 11 deaths. The mortality rate here is 10.28%. The state has highest number of cases — 157 — in the age group of 21-30 years, in which no death has been reported.State disease surveillance officer Dr Pradip Awate said, “A majority of patients who died had comorbid conditions. Of the total Covid-19 deaths, 78% patients had diabetes, hypertension and other such serious illnesses.”(With inputs from Shrinivas Deshpande)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-s-coronavirus-death-rate-double-than-india-s/story-W6N3fkUMg4iHHMZIbFpMFI.html

The action was taken following a complaint by the parents to the state education department. The DPI office has asked the school authorities to submit a reply as to why the school’s no objection certificate (NOC) to run the school should not be cancelled as they have violated the orders of the education department. On March 23, the state education department had directed all private schools to reschedule the date of depositing fee as many parents would be unable to do the needful amid lockdown. The school authorities were further asked to abide by the orders or face disciplinary action. Recently, state education minister Vijay Inder Singla had also instructed all private schools to not force parents to deposit their wards’ fee and reschedule the fee depositing dates. District education officer (secondary) Swaranjit Kaur said the complaint was made by the parents directly to the state education department. “We were intimated by the department that these schools have violated government’s instructions, following which the show-cause notice was issued,” she said. ‘OUR MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ASKED PARENTS TO DEPOSIT FEE’Rajesh Rudhra, director of Greenland Convent Schools, and president of Association of Private CBSE Schools in Punjab, said the show-cause notice that they have received from the state education department, does not carry their school names. “The show-cause notice has the name of Gurukul World School. Moreover, our management has not asked parents to deposit fee. Since April 1, many parents were approaching our staff, asking them about online modes to deposit the fee. So we sent them an online link for the same. We have sufficient funds to pay our staff their salaries amid lockdown,” Rudhra said, adding that the staff has been working hard to provide online study material for students at home. On Tuesday, Jyoti Pujara, principal of Green Land Convent School, Subhash Nagar, also gave the clarification to the parents after the show-cause notice was issued. “Some parents were inquiring from us about depositing fee as students are being taught online. They were asking for the online link from the class teachers as the parents were interested in depositing the fee. So, we sent the link through the message for the interested parents only. Kindly don’t misunderstand. The school management is not compelling anyone to pay (the fee) right now. They can deposit (the fee) at their own perusal. Your cooperation is solicited,” read the message to the parents. Meanwhile, Sunita Vij, principal of MGM Public School, Dugri, could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/show-cause-notice-issued-2-ludhiana-schools-ask-parents-to-deposit-fee-amid-lockdown/story-cRWBr5XDwwasgNJUoQD0AP.html
08-04-2020||City||‘Make use of technology to stay connected’||In the absence of a vaccine or a drug to cure Covid-19 diseases, the only way to prevent its spread is social distancing and not going out of homes.In view of the prevailing situation, noted city poet Gurbhajan Singh Gill, 67, has expressed the fear that isolation may have a long-term effect and people may isolate themselves from one another permanently and disconnect themselves emotionally from society.“This thought keeps bothering me to the extent that I cannot even enjoy my passion of reading literature,” Gill said.Gills said, “After waking up at 6.30am, I try to read literature regarding Partition. Then, I spend most of the time with my granddaughter and, in between, I also make calls to relatives, friends and workers of the Punjabi Sahit Academy to know about their well-being and extend moral support.”He said, “Today, social networking sites, mobile phones and internet are the only sources available to people through which they see the world and, in the absence of these modes, people might have gone crazy.”“I also spend time listening gurbani through internet and watching news. But, I feel that radio is playing a better role than TV channels as channels are more into spreading panic. I watch two-three channels to confirm whether a particular news is fake or not,” he said.Gill believed this virus outbreak was the greatest disaster of this century and, during these hard times, people are not even able to meet each and extend moral support. “Persons are also afraid of touching one another,” Gill said.“Being alone, I often take a trip down the memory lane remembering our culture of helping one another at times of need and providing moral support during difficult times. I suggest during this time of isolation, we must make best use of modern technology to stay connected with our loved ones,” the poet said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/make-use-of-technology-to-stay-connected/story-4oAqqDNmQTDOlrhJFKaolO.html

These executive magistrates will be called special executive magistrate and appointed for the maintenance of law and order amid the situation that has risen due to Covid-19, said the notification. Following the notification, around 18 part-time lectures from SCD College were appointed the duty of issuing passes. Paramjeet Singh, assistant professor of Punjabi and National Service Scheme (NSS) in-charge at SCD College, said that he has been performing his duty in ward number 2 since March 26.“None of the regular staff were asked to be on duty. We have been issuing passes and collaborating with different non-governmental organisation (NGOs) to provide food to the needy,” he said. Singh said, “Even though we have been given the charge of special executive magistrate, we face difficulty in commuting. We issue passes to vegetable vendors, grocery delivery man and others in the areas allotted to us, but we are stopped by police who don’t accept the passes given to us by the administration.”Anamika, assistant professor of English, said, “Only the part-time lecturers from our college have been asked to perform the duty. We don’t have any issue performing this duty as it is a global health emergency, but what about our rights? The government did not think about us when they announced the insurance cover.”“It’s the police’s job to maintain law and order and it is the duty of sanitation workers to maintain cleanliness, but we are lecturers who are not even regular. We have been fighting for our rights as our contribution will not be recognised because our record is not maintained like that of regular staff. We want the government to acknowledge our services, just like the police or municipal corporation (MC) staff on duty,” she said.On Saturday, the state government had announced a special health insurance cover of ₹50 lakh each for the police personnel and sanitation workers in the frontline in the battle against covid-19.Meanwhile, principal of the college, Dharam Sandhu, said, “I have not received any report from lecturers having any difficulty on duty. If I receive any such complaint, I will speak to the deputy commissioner myself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/part-time-lecturers-on-field-in-ludhiana-duty-demand-recognition/story-sRxyVA9e9H0xUJN4R2kYkM.html

However, an army man, residing in the area, helped the MC team in getting the dog out of the room and then the dog was caught with the help of a net”, said Dr Dhalla.He said that the owner of the dog can contact him at 9815091107 and get the possession of the dog after submitting a proof.Meanwhile, residents have urged the authorities to direct the pet owners to keep their dogs inside their homes and not let them roam in streets. “It has been seen that some people free their dogs to roam in the streets, but such practices should be strictly banned. As aggressive dogs roaming openly in the streets can harm anyone and the authorities should take necessary measures in this regard,” said a resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mc-looking-for-owner-of-pit-bull-caught-from-ishar-nagar-in-ludhiana-on-april-3/story-GoW0WewqqawpseGESvr0QJ.html

Twice a day, their younger neighbours check in on the senior residents and make sure they have everything they require, including groceries and medicines. Maker Tower has 150 flats and approximately 700 residents, includes some domestic helpers who live with their employers. Ten of these flats have senior citizens, who live alone, and therefore, younger members call them regularly to check in on them. “It feels like a good thing to be doing and despite maintaining social distancing, we are all still together,” said Suhani Mendonsa, who is part of the buddy system and co-ordinates food deliveries from a nearby restaurant.The society at Maker Tower has also compiled a list of vendors who will deliver supplies and switched to a virtual message board on a messaging app to keep residents informed. All deliveries are left at the gate and residents collect their parcels once they are delivered.“Around 14 days into lockdown, we realised we need to also focus on mental health,” said Aparna Gupta, a member of Maker Tower’s Covid prevention sub-committee, which is planning to organise entertainment and games for residents. “This may not be a pressing issue right now, but with everyone at home, there needs to be distraction for them during difficult times like these,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/society-adopts-buddy-system-to-check-on-elderly/story-KaXzgQJmT2M7dmk9bQY9sJ.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||23 Indians, including 7 from state stranded in Spain||Twenty-three Indians, including seven from Maharashtra, have been stranded in Spain since March 20. The Indians work on a cruise ship and were to return to India from Barcelona on March 21, but their flight was cancelled. Spain has witnessed one of the worst outbreaks of Covid-19 in Europe. “We were asked by our employer to go back to India on March 20, and were given tickets for March 21. However, the flight got cancelled and later the Indian airspace was shut due to which we are stuck here in hope of being airlifted, but with no success,” said Robin Pereira, 38, who is from Mumbai. At present, the group’s stay is being covered by their employer.Sangita Bhagwan, whose brother, Sandeep Bhagwan, is among the 23 Indians, has been in touch with the Indian embassy in Spain, which sent her an email that said the following: “Prime Minister Modi has appealed that you give your next few weeks for the sake of the country. Conditions currently do not allow your government to consider evacuation. We are confident that we shall triumph over Covid-19. Till then, please be calm.” Bhagwan said, “ We understand the fight that our country is fighting currently. However, these men are stranded in a Covid-19 hotspot.” Indian embassy in Spain told HT there are currently no proposals to evacuate Indians from Spain.In an email reply Sanjay Verma, India’s Ambassador to Spain from Indian Embassy in Madrid stated, “We have tirelessly explained to the crew and their well wishers in India that our country remains in a lock down. Also that there are currently no proposals to evacuate Indians from Spain, or anywhere else given the lock down, not to mention that our systems and personnel are engaged full time in ensuring that the lock down is a success.” Verma added, “As you may know, the crew works for a Cruise Line. Their company forced them to disembark at Barcelona and was reluctant to look after their employees interests. The Embassy was able to get in touch with the Cruise Line and ensured that the 23 Indians were provided with living arrangements in Barcelona. The Indian crew has since been provided for by their company.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/23-indians-including-7-from-state-stranded-in-spain/story-eoXWMnIQBFek15RDq45vZI.html

08-04-2020||Mumbai||Two more positive cases in Dharavi, count touches 7||Two more people were tested positive for Covid-19 in Dharavi on Tuesday, taking the total in Asia’s largest slum to seven.The father and brother of the 30-year-old woman who had tested positive on Saturday, aged 80 and 49 years, also tested positive on Tuesday, said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North Ward. “In tracing of high-risk contact it was found that they are the father and brother of the 30-year-old woman who had tested positive in Dharavi on Saturday.”All these patients are residents of Dharavi’s Dr Baliga Nagar area. The BMC had already sealed Dr Baliga Nagar where the first Covid-19 patient, a 56-year-old garment shop owner, was reported. The colony he lived in has eight buildings with 308 flats and 91 shops which were sealed. He later succumbed to the virus.All 29 high-risk contacts of both patients reported on Tuesday are being tested and essential supplies like food and medicines will be provided to them by the BMC.Considering the outbreak of the virus in slum pockets, BMC has quarantined 3,250 residents to Rajiv Gandhi Sports complex in Dharavi. On Tuesday, state health minister Rajesh Tope, and and local MLA and school education minister Varsha Gaikwad visited Rajiv Gandhi Sports complex quarantine facility center and Dharavi police station to examine the situation.

In addition to that, civic body should take all the hospitals in Dharavi and convert them into a quarantine centre,” he said. Shewale also suggested that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) should enhance their testing capacity and every person in the slum should be tested for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-more-positive-cases-in-dharavi-count-touches-7/story-Kwa5fdNdreNbgv5IizKEOK.html
08-04-2020||City||No Baisakhi celebrations at historic Uri gurdwara||Owing to the coronavirus pandemic, no Baisakhi celebrations will take place at the historic Chatti Patshai gurdwara here, the management committee said on Tuesday.“Baisakhi celebrations have been cancelled following the outbreak of Covid-19,” said Baramulla Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee chairperson Tara Singh.He said the decision was taken to prevent all risks to public health and safety. “Once the situation improves, we will issue fresh dates for the celebration,” he said.Pardeep Singh Dardi, a social activist and devotee from Baramulla who visits the shrine on every Baisakhi, said that it was necessary to call off the celebrations this time. “When the entire world is in suffering because of the deadly virus, how we can celebrate? We have to stand with others,” he said. A devotee from Srinagar, Barkat Kaur, said that the place has such a prestigious history that people from different parts of the country visit the gurdwara. “Unfortunately, everyone will be giving it a miss this time,” she said.People’s Democratic Party (PDP) youth leader Harbaksh Singh said that they will stay at home this time. “We will pray to god for peace and will do the religious activities pertaining to Baisakhi at home,” he said.Ajay Pal Singh, a doctor from Anantnag, said, “Government should restore high-speed internet on this special occasion so that we can contact our families stuck outside India.”Earlier in 2016, the Sikh community had to call off the Baisakhi celebrations here after a footbridge connecting Uri town with the gurdwara got washed away due to heavy rains. A new bridge was constructed last year only.The high priests of Akal Takht have announced that Baisakhi celebrations around the world would be held as a small-scale affair, in view of the Covid-19 outbreak.The historic significance of this shrine dates back to 1620, when the sixth Sikh master, Guru Hargobind, had toured here with Mughal emperor Jehangir. The Guru had stayed here for some time and after his move to Muzaffrabad in POK, his followers build this gurdwara on the banks of Jhelum in his honour.The Baisakhi celebrations are attended by Sikhs from different parts of J&K and other states. The gurdwara witnesses a rush of over 10,000 pilgrims every year.The festival is also celebrated at a gurdwara in Srinagar’s Rainawari area and in central Kashmir’s Budgam district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-baisakhi-celebrations-at-historic-uri-gurdwara/story-2d9h3SjWb8BlB1WTwrsUmI.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai reports 116 new coronavirus cases, 6 deaths||The city reported 116 new confirmed coronavirus cases, including six deaths, on Tuesday, taking the total tally to 642 now and total fatal cases to 40. Mumbai accounts for more than 60% of the total positive cases in the state, which stood at 1,018 on Tuesday.Out of the 116 patients who have been tested positive on Tuesday, 55 were among the high-risk contacts of patients from the containment areas. They were screened at the clinics set up at containment zones, comp doctors, nurses and a lab technician. Twenty such clinics were operational as of Monday, which screened 614 persons, and collected 185 swabs from suspected persons for testing.The two high-risk areas in the city have been identified as Dharavi and the Worli Koliwada areas, both of which are densely-populated. Dharavi recorded two new cases on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases from the area to seven. BMC has quarantined 3,250 Dharavi residents at Rajiv Gandhi Sports complex. All the 29 high-risk contacts of both the patients have also been tested and will be provided with essential supplies such by the BMC. Until Tuesday, G South ward, comprising the areas of Worli Koliwada, Janata Nagar, Adarsh Nagar and BDD chawls, recorded 78 cases. To contain the outbreak of the virus, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday barred the sale of vegetables and fruits on footpaths and in open markets in the 241 containment zones of the city. BMC has already stopped the sale of vegetables and fruits in Worli and Dharavi on Tuesday itself.Aaditya Thackeray, Maharashtra tourism minister and Worli legislator, on Tuesday took to social media and said, “5,144 people in Worli Koliwada were screened for symptoms. Twelve were found with high grade fever. Tomorrow [Wednesday] too, this drive will continue, till all the residents are covered. This is the second such drive in Worli Koliwada.” He said the city is seeing more cases as more contacts of patients are being traced and tested. “Along with supplies of essentials such as kits and separate kits for senior citizens across Worli, we are focussing majorly on the containment of Covid 19. The spike in cases is being seen as we chase each case with contact tracing, testing and isolating carriers,” he said. To safeguard front-line workers, BMC has started to administer hydroxychloroquine tablets to them. According to BMC, Mumbai has a stock of more than 1 crore such tablets. It has also airlifted around 12,000 personal protective equipment (PPEs) for all the medical staff in the city, from a manufacturing unit in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. On Thursday, around 30,000 more PPEs will be airlifted to the city.Meanwhile, 21 staffers of Jaslok Hospital have also been tested positive for coronavirus after the hospital tested its 1,005 in-house employees. None of them is in a critical state, with 19 of them being asymptomatic and two having mild symptoms, civic officials said. Four of them are undergoing treatment at the hospital, while 16 have been sent to Seven Hills Hospital. One is admitted to Kasturba Hospital. Though the hospital has stopped non-emergency and out-patient department (OPD) services for now, in a statement issued on Tuesday, the management has announced that to resume them from April 13. The hospital’s spokesperson said that last week when one of the nurses were tested positive, they began contact tracing others, after which they discovered that more staff members have been infected. “We have tested 1,005 doctors and staffers, including the high -risk and low-risk contacts of positive patients and staff . While 984 was tested negative, 21 were found positive. The existing patients were also tested for Covid-19,” he said.However, BMC has not decided to declare the hospital as a containment zone, as it is responsibly screening all its staffers for any possible transmission of the infection. “They have screened more than 1,000 staff members from their hospital. The hospital is taking proper care of the positive patients. So we have decided not to declare it a containment zone,” a civic official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-reports-116-new-cases-6-deaths/story-gVpQwgSbNXBCvKxZOwNbNN.html
08-04-2020||Delhi||We will begin pool testing trials to speed up diagnosis: Satyendar Jain||Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain spoke to Sweta Goswami about enhanced tests, new testing methods, the PPE challenge, hospital infrastructure, and community transmission, among other issues. Edited excerpts:The Delhi government has ordered 100,000 rapid test kits to detect more Covid-19 cases and take containment measures accordingly. What is the plan for conducting these tests?Till date, 9,035 tests have been conducted in Delhi. The 1 lakh (100,000) rapid antibody test kits will be used in three ways. First is the area around the Nizamuddin Markaz, second will be in and around north-east Delhi’s Nand Nagri area. The third will be on our health workers, who are the front-line workers in our fight against coronavirus. After the 18 fresh positive cases that emerged among health workers, we have decided that random rapid tests will be conducted on them. We have nearly 3,000 medical staff on Covid-19 duty. What about labs? Will they be able to take the load?We are trying a new thing -- pool testing. It is currently being done in Germany. We will begin trial runs on this in a week. Two hospitals -- Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital -- have been asked to start the trial. Once this starts, Delhi’s testing capacity will go up by about eight times with the same manpower, the number of kits and other resources. These confirmatory tests will then be run parallel to the rapid tests (non-confirmatory) for detection at a massive scale. Under pool testing, people are divided into teams of about 15. If a team tests negative, that is good. If the result is positive, they are divided into groups of three, for another round of tests.At present, we have the ILBS lab under us which is processing 250-300 tests daily. Apart from pool testing, we are working on increasing the normal testing at this institute to 500-600 a day.Do you have enough personal protective equipment (PPE) kits now? Stocking up on PPEs is one of our top priorities now as we have to keep the virus from spreading among our health workers. But the truth is that at present, we have stocks for only about five days. The Centre is giving us 27,000 kits, but that will not be enough. We need minimum 50,000 PPE kits as buffer stock at any given point of time, in addition to the kits that are being used on a daily basis. Right now, we hardly have 5,000 kits as a buffer. If an incident like Nizamuddin Markaz recurs, our five-day stock would last only for about three days.On our own, we have ordered more than 1.2 lakh (120,000) kits by now, but the problem is there are only 3-4 vendors who have been able to meet government standards and their daily delivery is merely 500-1,000 kits per company per day.Can you explain the government’s plan to tackle a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases, if such a scenario arises?Our action plan is based on projections of daily active cases. At present, the number of active cases and the rate of growth are slightly lower than our projection, which we feel is because of the lockdown. But, we have a road map ready to treat 30,000 active cases in the city.At present, we have 2,500 beds ready in three of our hospitals. Then 500 beds are available in Central government hospitals such as Safdarjung and AIIMS. Then we have beds in Max Hospital, Saket, Sir Gangaram Hospital and Apollo Hospital. Our existing quarantine capacity is also eight times the present occupancy. Do you have enough ventilators? At present, we have nearly 300 Covid-19 dedicated ventilators sourced from Delhi government and private hospitals. The number goes up to around 400 if we add the ventilators in central government hospitals. We have asked for 300 more ventilators from the central government; hope they agree to it. However, let me point out that at present there are only eight Covid-19 patients in Delhi who are on the ventilator. Even the number of cases in ICUs is as low as 35 in the city. Has community transmission begun in Delhi or at least in some parts of the city?No. I am saying this because we have analysed this by creating a heat map of Covid-19 cases in Delhi. No area other than the Nizamuddin Markaz has so far thrown up an exploding number of positive cases to conclude that community transmission has begun. Those in Markaz were living in confined premises, so the virus spread rapidly among them. If we see the data, of the total 550 positive cases in Delhi, only 219 are non-Markaz cases, that too over a period of about a month. In the Markaz case, apart from the first information report, which the police has registered, hasn’t the Delhi government found any lapses of its own officials? I know there could have been some lapses, but this is not the time for that. This is a crisis. If we order an inquiry against the officials who are key to a district, who will do the work?So, let us keep the inquiry for a time when we are free from coronavirus. But action will be taken. How is contact tracing is being done in the area and other places?We formed 11 core teams for aggressive contact tracing - one in each district. Each team has a minimum 60 people from different agencies such as medical staff, police, district administration and so on. Out of the 550-odd cases, there are about 49 cases in which we are still tracing contact history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/we-will-begin-pool-testing-trials-to-speed-up-diagnosis-satyendar-jain/story-muy5XdftNphPykZYFdXAwK.html

Additionally, they were also tasked with the responsibility of assigning duties to MCG officials in their respective zones for ensuring essential services such as sanitation, water supply, sewerage, streetlights, and garbage collection continue to operate uninterrupted.The notice directed to the accounting officer of the establishment branch on April 4 stated that repeated reminders were also sent to the staff over the phone and that work was being hampered due to the absence of the staff.“As you are aware that due to issues related coronavirus, time-to-time staff is needed and that the government asks MCG for updates and reports on the matter. It has been noticed that neither you and nor your staff members are seen in the office and your work is instead being undertaken by the MCG’s headquarters in your absence. You have two days to respond on the matter,” an excerpt of the notice issued by Mahabir Prasad, additional commissioner, MCG read.Hariom Attri, joint commissioner of zone 3, MCG, who had alerted the civic body about the absence of establishment officials, said most staff members have already come forward and recorded their statements on the matter.“We have received responses on the matter from most of the staff members. Some of the officials who work at the zone 3 (establishment) branch were stuck at their homes due to the absence of curfew passes, some had been temporarily assigned other duties and there was lack of communication. However, there are a few officials who simply did not come for duty and further inquiry will be initiated against them,” Attri said. In May last year, the MCG had marked an inquiry against 15 outsourced workers in the water supply division who had allegedly not to come to work for more than a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-issues-show-cause-notice-to-30-staffers-for-being-absent-from-work-during-lockdown/story-KAVYZdaIgH2Ur0CmpzvPkO.html

08-04-2020||Gurugram||Two men held for violating lockdown, shifted to quarantine facility||The police on Monday arrested two men, who had travelled from Gujarat, for allegedly violating lockdown orders and risking the potential spread of infection, near Wazirpur Chowk in Sector 10. The police said the men were sent to a quarantine facility in Sector 9 and their samples were sent for testing.According to the police, the men worked as drivers in Gujarat and were attempting to return to their respective villages in Arwal and Sheikhpura districts in Bihar.

08-04-2020||Gurugram||Ban on retail sale of fruits and vegetables at Haryana’s Khandsa Mandi||Retail sale of vegetables and fruits at Khandsa Mandi has been banned from Wednesday to prevent large gatherings at the wholesale market in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board and the Khandsa Market Committee —which manages the wholesale market (mandi)—took the decision on Tuesday after it was oberved that large crowds would gather at Khandsa Mandi increasing the chances of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) spreading further.The market committee said the market will remain operational from early morning till 9am for wholesale trade and a complete ban has been imposed on the retail sale of fruits and vegetables till further orders. “The market will be closed after 9am and information regarding this ban has been shared with all traders, wholesalers and commission agents. No retail sale will be allowed in the market from Wednesday,” Vinay Yadav, secretary, Khandsa Market Committee, said.

08-04-2020||Gurugram||36 villages in Haryana’s Nuh put under containment zone after 23 new cases||The district administration on Tuesday barred entry to and exit from 148 villages in Nuh, declaring 36 villages as containment zones and 112 others buffer areas, after 23 new Covid-19 patients were reported in a single day -- taking the total number of patients in the district to 37. The administration said 36 of the total patients had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in March at the Markaz in Delhi’s Nizamuddin. One affected person is a 50-year-old truck driver. Nine of the 37 are foreigners and 25 are from different states. Only three patients are locals, the administration said. Pankaj, deputy commissioner, Nuh, said 23 cases were reported from the district on Tuesday -- the highest number of cases reported in a day from anywhere in the state. He said these Covid-19 positive patients had frequently moved around in the 36 villages that have now been declared as containment zones. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“For the safety of people in and around these villages, their boundaries had been sealed and door-to-door screening and scanning of people is being done,” the deputy commissioner said. “We have identified 36 villages that had been visited by these patients before they were sent into quarantine. We have declared them as containment zones and their neighbouring 112 villages as a buffer zone. Special teams have been formed for keeping a strict vigil in and around the villages and monitoring movement of the villagers from these identified zones,” he said, adding that the administration was working in close coordination with police and medical teams.Nuh was identified as the most backward district in the country by NITI Aayog in April 2018. In an assessment on multiple parameters such as health, education, agriculture, financial inclusion, skill development, and infrastructure, Mewat scored 26% — the lowest across the country. This socio-economic backwardness of the region is likely to influence the administration’s containment and treatment efforts.“It will be challenging to maintain peace and ensure that panic doesn’t spread, especially now that the district has the highest number of cases in the state. We are focusing on two things, keeping people with a travel history in self-quarantine and identifying those who have developed symptoms of Covid-19,” said Pankaj, who goes by his first name.The administration has converted seven buildings into quarantine centres in the district. ITI college of Ferozepur Jhirka, Model School of Palla, private hostel in Rehna and Polytechnic college of Malab and a school from Ferozepur Namak have been turned into quarantines, said officials. One building in Rehna village is being used to isolate only foreigners.Four kitchen services— one government and three private— are operating in the district. NGOs are supporting the administration and delivering 8,000 food packets daily which include 1,700 from the government kitchen.“Medical teams are monitoring the food packets and ensuring that it is healthy and packed properly. We are providing free cooked food and ration to the poor and migrant labourers who are living in camps. Also, if any villager is unable to make their ends meet, we are providing them food and other essential items,” said Pankaj.In a statement released by the administration, 36 villages — Bisru, Khanpur Ghati, Umara, Devla, Bond, Akhnaka, Sidhrawat, Agon, Kameda, Nai, Malab, Dihana, Mahu Chopra, Chitoda, Raniyala, Madopur, Punhana, Rahera, Raipur, Rangad Bass, NijampurTauru, Didhana, Sevka, Sikarpur, Nuh, Untka, Muradabas, Bai, Charoda, Rithat , Shapur and four more villages are part of the containment zone. At least 112 villages share boundaries with these 36 villages. As many as 160 people were in contact with the Covid-19 patients who are currently in-home quarantine.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Nuh, told HT, “We have prepared a unique containment plan for the district and are sanitising all the villages where cases have been reported from,” said Yadav.All patients who had tested positive from Nuh and Palwal have been shifted to Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati Government Medical College, Nalhar, Nuh. The OPD services in the hospital have been cancelled and it is only catering to Covid-19 patients. All the makeshift shops and markets in the area have been shut. Only two medical shops are allowed to operate, said the CMO.According to Yadav, at least 1,201 people in Nuh who came in contact with the people who had attended the congregation in Markaz in March have been put on surveillance and 84 people who travelled to foreign countries are in quarantine. They were traced to different mosques in Nuh villages. “We had sent samples of 355 people out of which 37 tested positive, 191 tested negative and results of 134 samples are awaited. Forty-four people are currently hospitalised,” said Yadav. A 25-member team of Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHAs) and Nurse Midwife (ANMs) has also been constituted to screen every house in the identified villages.Talking to HT, Narender Bijarniya, superintendent of police, Nuh said, “At least 25 policemen have been deployed in bigger villages to prevent people from moving to other areas and to adjoining districts. This is to ensure the safety of people and prevent transmission of the virus. The boundaries of the 24 villages have been barricaded. We are also requesting people to share their travel history and inform us about anyone with symptoms of Covid-19.”The police are also tracking the travel history of the people who had attended the Markaz congregation and are taking help from the local clerics and religious leaders to identify them or people who came in close contact with the ones who attended the event.According to the police, till Tuesday 1,201 people in the district were under surveillance, out of which 60 people completed their 14 days of quarantine and 1,141 were under home quarantine. To maintain law and order in these villages, four senior government officials have been appointed as duty magistrate. An order for sanitising these villages was issued by the Nuh administration on Tuesday.In Palwal, on Tuesday, three persons tested positive for Covid-19, after which the district total has reached 28. The district has reported the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the state. The administration has declared 15 villages as containment/red zones and their surrounding 36 villages as buffer zones after 28 tested positive. They had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Nizamuddin last month. Deputy commissioner, Palwal, said public transport in these villages was being banned for containing the spread of coronavirus. The villagers under the containment area have been quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nuh-admin-puts-36-villages-in-containment-zone-after-23-cases-in-one-day/story-WOcKuhKNzDvDeLUuXLlRtM.html
08-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 update: Areas visited by Jamaat attendees to be identified from phone records, sealed||Mobile phones of around 2,000 participants in Tablighi Jamaat congregations will be tracked to ascertain areas they had visited while staying in Nizamuddin and mark them as containment zones, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday, while outlining a five-point action plan to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Kejriwal said, “Now, monitoring has to be stepped up at the hot spots. For instance, the Markaz in Nizamuddin (the venue of the Tablighi Jamaat congregations). We have provided around 2,000 phone numbers of individuals who participated in the Jamaat. We have to know areas they visited during their stay in the building and the people they came in contact with. All such areas will be sealed,” said Kejriwal said.Later, an official in the chief minister’s office said that by “seal”, Kejriwal had referred to geographical containment of the area to limit transmission of coronavirus. The capital, so far, has two identified cluster hot spots — Dilshad Garden and Nizamuddin — both of which are containment zones, ranging between two and four square kilometres. A slum in south Moti Bagh has also been cordoned off and subjected to the protocols of a containment zone, but it is officially yet to be notified as one.In the containment zones, there is strict surveillance to ensure residents do not step out of their houses, regular spraying of disinfectants, door-to-door visits by health workers to check for flu-like symptoms and provision of essentials (with all business establishments shut) by government workers. All roads to the containment zones are cordoned off by the police.“For tracking, we have started taking the help of the police. So far, we have provided them with 27,702 phone numbers to check possible violation of quarantine norms,” said Kejriwal.The police have so far registered at least 176 first information reports (FIRs) based on mobile tower records.A Delhi police officer, on the condition of anonymity, said they are working with the Delhi government and central intelligence agencies with regards to mobile phone records and travel history of the quarantined persons.“The Delhi government has been regularly giving us the contact details of home-quarantined persons. Based on that, we are checking for the violation of the home quarantine regulations. Separately, we also have our own database of those who were evacuated from the Markaz. Using that, we are checking for people they were in contact with during their stay in Delhi. We have got the records from the register of the Markaz. At the Central government level, the agencies are helping with contact details of Tablighi Jamaat participants from other states, who were in Delhi last month but left before the evacuation started,” the officer said.So far, seven people have died of coronavirus in Delhi. The virus has infected 576 people, of whom 333 are linked to Tablighi Jamaat congregations. The government had evacuated around 2,400 people from the Nizamuddin building in a four-day operation in March-end.So far, 5,305 cases of Covid-19 have been diagnosed in India, of which more than 1,000 have been traced to the congregations at Nizamuddin Markaz in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/areas-visited-by-jamaat-attendees-to-be-identified-from-phone-records-sealed/story-6mtfjwg6dA840ZfY1gPbfI.html
08-04-2020||Noida||Borrowers say EMIs debited towards loans despite them opting for 3-month moratorium||Banks are debiting equated monthly instalments (EMIs) towards home loans, business loans and auto loans even from those customers who had availed of a three-month moratorium on all such payments, a reprieve announced by the Union ministry of finance in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 21-day nationwide lockdown imposed to prevent its spread. Many borrowers such as flat buyers, businessmen and automobile owners in Noida and Greater Noida have written to the ministry of finance, highlighting the banks’ non-compliance, but no action has been taken so far.On March 27, the ministry of finance had suggested to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) a moratorium on all loan repayments, and the interest entailed, for three months. Consumers were informed by their respective banks that they have an option to either apply for the moratorium or continue to pay. The moratorium was suggested in view of the economic hardships suffered by many due to the complete lockdown of offices and businesses.“My private sector bank allowed me my request for a three-month moratorium on my home and auto loans and acknowledged the same via a text message. But even then, the EMI was debited for the month of April from my account. The government must act against such banks to ensure that they follow the government guidelines. We tried to contact the bank but we got no help,” Pushpendra Singh, a resident of Sector 135 and an employee of a private firm, said.“I had taken four business loans from four different private banks. I applied for the moratorium because I hardly have any savings in my account at present. I got a message from all four banks that my moratorium request has been approved. But now all four banks have debited instalments from my accounts. If the lockdown continues beyond the 21 days, then I will have no money to even buy essential items like milk and vegetables,” Shekhar Mahajan, a resident of Exotic housing society in Sector 16, Greater Noida West, said. Mahajan said he recently started a business dealing in AC spare parts and it is now shut owing to the lockdown.“If the customer has applied for moratorium and the bank has accepted the same, then the EMI should not be deducted. But in cases where it has been debited, customers are advised to visit the respective branches for clarity as to how that happened. It may be some technical issue. They can file a complaint in writing with the bank and also bring it to our notice. We will look into this issue,” Ved Ratan, lead bank manager, Gautam Budh Nagar, said. Many said the banks are also charging interest on the postponement of EMIs.“As all business activity is shut and income has suddenly stopped, banks should not be charging interest for the moratorium period. The government must address this issue and allow us a six-month moratorium and waive the interest for this period,” Indrish Gupta, founder member, Noida Extension Flat Owners welfare Association, said.When contacted, a ministry of finance official said the RBI would look into such cases.“The RBI handles private sector banks and it is looking into such issues. We have made it clear to all banks that they should not force people to repay loans during the moratorium period if they decide to avail of the reprieve. Public sector banks will accept repayment of loans only if a consumer decides to pay willingly,” Debashish Panda, finance secretary, department of financial services, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/borrowers-say-emis-debited-towards-loans-despite-them-opting-for-3-month-moratorium/story-EJPwGEV0wcXfr2DnKioGWI.html

Police have put up posters to this effect and are also circulating notices on social media, both in Urdu and Hindi, asking people to avoid gatherings in order to maintain social distancing. Police have also approached residents’ welfare associations and religious groups to ensure that no gathering takes place in their areas on Shab-e-Barat. Senior officers said drones and bike patrols will keep a close watch to nab violators.Shab-e-Barat, also known as the night of forgiveness, will be observed on Wednesday. On this occasion, Muslims gather at mosques and visit the graves of their loved ones. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced a 21-day countrywide lockdown from March 25 to check the spread of the Covid-19 infection. “In order to make sure that the lockdown is not violated, the Delhi Police released a notice in advance asking people to stay indoors. Posters have also been put across Delhi, especially in areas with a Muslim majority population. The notice is also being widely circulated on social media for a wider reach,” MS Randhawa, additional commissioner of police (crime), said.The notice that police have put up, reads, “This Shab-e-Barat, do not step out of your houses. Help police in their fight to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Lockdown is in place even on April 8 and 9. Do not get out on two-wheelers. Violation of lockdown will not be tolerated and strict action will be taken against the violators. Stay indoors, stay safe.”Randhawa said they are prepared for Wednesday and tight surveillance will be in place to ensure zero lockdown violations. “We will monitor the situation using drones. We have adequate deployment across the city and no one will be allowed to come out on to the streets as prohibitory orders are in place. On Wednesday, our bike patrol teams will intensify vigil in congested areas while adequate deployment will be maintained on the main roads. Violators will be strictly prosecuted,” he said.The officer said for a wider reach, they are also in constant touch with religious groups and RWAs and have requested them to make sure that people in their areas do not come out of their houses or take out any procession. “We have also made announcements on Tuesday and we will do the same on Wednesday to educate people that stepping out will put them and others at the risk of coronavirus infection,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/shab-e-barat-amid-lockdown-police-appeal-people-to-stay-indoors-drones-bike-patrols-to-keep-watch/story-WAJUCr2lhCHXVVTAim0xJP.html

According to officials, members of the housekeeping staff had asked the patients in quarantine to keep their used bedsheets and pillowcases at a designated spot.“When the complainant went to collect those, one of the men allegedly threw a pillowcase at her and then misbehaved with her when she objected,” said Kumar Ravijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.When senior members of the hospital staff came to know about the incident, they intervened. A video circulating on social media shows a member of the housekeeping staff speaking to at least four or five patients from the same group and asking them to abide by regulations. The men agreed and apologised for the incident that had occurred earlier.However, the police later came to know about the incident and the 50-year-old woman then filed a complaint with the Sector 39 police, based on which a case was registered under sections 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act.The suspect was identified as Nadeem Ashraf of Bihar.The police said that he has been in the quarantine facility for almost a week now.“This is a secondary contact group that has been here for almost a week. The incident seems to be more of a rude behaviour case. However, an FIR has been registered under relevant sections and due legal action is being taken,” said DCP, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma.The test results for the suspect are awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/patient-in-quarantine-booked-for-misbehaving-with-hospital-s-housekeeping-staff/story-ojllACBGKubDKVipatSC3H.html
08-04-2020||Delhi||Film references, documentaries: Delhi govt school classes go mobile, teachers get innovative||Kunal Singh, a class 12 student of a Delhi government school in Nand Nagri, woke up early on Tuesday, even though his school is shut. After a quick breakfast, he gathered his notebooks, switched on his tablet, and sat by his study table — waiting for class to begin.The video-conferencing app on his device flickered to life around 8.30am as the 17-year-old attended the first mathematics lecture organised by the Delhi government for class 12 students to ensure learning isn’t affected during the lockdown.“We just want to learn our lessons properly and don’t care what the medium of instruction is. The teaching was excellent and every point was being cleared by two teachers. We were taught basic matrices and have also been given homework,” he said, talking about the 90-minute session. On Monday, the Delhi government started e-learning classes for all its students in class 12. However, officials said only 9,000 of 150,000 students enrolled in Class 12 in Delhi government schools have registered for the online classes so far. On Tuesday, around 2,200 students attended the mathematics class and 385 joined the history class being organised with the support of Career Launcher, a private coaching instituteThis is in addition to the individual efforts made by government schools to build an e-learning module. Singh’s school, Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV) Nand Nagri had also been conducting online classes since April 1, ensuring that the class 12 student knew his way around the tablet and the application. The classes on both history and maths began with an introduction on the syllabus, topics to be covered throughout the year, links to download material, and a discussion on the paper pattern. To make the virtual class more engaging, Harita Arora, a history teacher at Sarvodya Kanya Vidyalaya in Pushp Vihar, weaved in references from Bollywood movie Padmaavat, a popular song mentioning 13th century traveller Ibn Battuta, and couplets written by Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, in her lecture, which began at 10.30am. The lecture also included a 22-minute documentary on Mohenjo Daro and the Indus Valley civilisation. “We had an English class yesterday and today there was our first history class of the session. All of us were so excited since the teacher used slides with pictures and videos to explain each and every topic,” said Suhani, 16, a student of an RPVV in Shakarpur. The students were also given the chance to give their feedback towards the end of the lecture through a live chat option. Teachers also conducted regular polls during the session to assess how much students had grasped the topic. If the percentage was in the lower range, teachers went through the respective section again.Teachers said the virtual classes have helped them connect with students amid the lockdown. “We have been really working hard to switch to online mode and help our students to restart their studies. Although there are logistical limitations, we need to make use of the resources we and our students have. We are putting these lectures online for those who cannot attend live classes, as well as sending the links to our school WhatsApp groups,” said Arora, who is also a member of the Delhi government’s core education committee.Some students also raised concerns over missing some parts of the lecture due to the poor internet connectivity in some instances. “I was attending the lecture using my phone as an internet hotspot, since we don’t have WiFi at home. The internet connectivity is poor here. I was really worried since I missed parts of the mathematics class today,” said Ankit Singh, a class 12 Science student at an RPVV in Paschim Vihar.While the majority of the registered students were from RPVV and Schools of Excellence, some were also from government schools in east Delhi district.“All students of RPVV and Schools of Excellence have tablets that the government had earlier distributed, whichis why it’s easy to rope them in for the online classes first. We are also contacting those who were given tablets after scoring more than 80% in class 10 and are now in class 12,” a government official said. In all, there are 17,000 government school students who have been given these tablets. Binay Bhushan, director of education (DoE), said the department is reaching out to the students directly. “We have asked for the email addresses and mobile numbers of all class 12 students from the individual schools to get an idea on how many students at least have a smartphone at home. We are planning to connect with as many students as possible by next week,” he said. Government officials said they are monitoring the numbers and are also contemplating tying up with TV channels to cover a larger number of students.Experts said that the government will have to use multiple means to address logistical limitations.Aejaz Masih, dean of the faculty of education at Jamia Millia Islamia, who specialises in Curriculum Studies said, “Most parents and students have cellphone access. So, mobile-friendly content could be developed besides online classes. Television channels could also be a good option, but one solution cannot be suitable for different groups of students enrolled in government schools. Multiple options have to be looked at to ensure all students are covered.”On Tuesday, the government also announced that it is working on e-learning programmes for the students of classes 9 onwards and are planning to tie-up with Khan Academy, an educational non-profit organisation, for the purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/film-references-documentaries-as-delhi-govt-school-classes-go-mobile-teachers-get-innovative/story-QF7LapYoLIiPhHM0ip9WRM.html

BL Verma, a resident of Greater Noida West, later apologised for spreading the rumour and withdrew his statements.Verma, an advocate, said he sent the message on his housing society’s WhatsApp group after watching a news programme in Hindi on Monday night, which claimed that cats and other zoo animals were infected with the virus and were spreading the disease. Health experts have categorically denied any such spread.Verma’s message had read, “It is advisable to pet owners to abstain from their pets or leave them out to prevent further damage from Corona to society and other people. Please take serious note of it.“I had no wrong intentions and it was only after I saw the programme on television last night that I sent this message.I apologise for spreading a message which later classified as fake,” Verma said.The district veterinary officer said the coronavirus does not spread through animals. “In situations like these, people often spread such news or WhatsApp forwards in panic. Let me assure the public that we have no such updates on the pandemic spread,” said VK Srivastava, chief veterinary officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.According to police, the PFA had approached them on Twitter.“The issue has been resolved, the violator has sent a new message correcting the older one and given a written apology to the police, the NGO and the social groups he had sent the text to,” a police officer from Bisrakh police station, who did not wanted to be named, said. According to the animal welfare organisations, at least 60 dogs of pedigree have been abandoned over past two weeks in Gautam Budh Nagar alone.“We have 60 dogs being abandoned by owners across the district. We have German Shepherds, pit bulls and labradors, to count a few. In such a situation, unverified messages must be discouraged as they create panic among people,” Kaveri Rana, president, People for Animals, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-man-asks-residents-to-abandon-pets-citing-covid-19-backtracks-after-police-intervention/story-ykJq73kXqkNzNiLdTtcaUL.html

08-04-2020||Pune||Pune embarks on aggressive cluster containment to prevent Covid-19 spread||Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) initiated cluster containment in the densely populated 16 localities of eastern Pune which included the older parts of the city, known as the ‘Peth’ areas and parts of Kondhwa, a day after the city witnessed a spike of 41 positive cases for the coronavirus. On Tuesday, the city witnessed three Covid-19 related deaths taking the toll to eight. All the deceased, were senior citizens and were on ventilators undergoing treatment for various ailments including diabetes, said Sassoon General hospital dean Dr Ajay Chandanwale. The aggressive cluster containment strategy on Tuesday stretched from Maharashinagar to the Regional Transport Office (RTO) area in Pune from Monday midnight and included Raviwar peth, Guruwar peth, Budhwar peth, Nana peth, Maharashinagar, Swargate, Shivaji road and Kondhwa areas. Civic commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said the areas would be sealed for at least a week after which a fresh review would be taken.As the news of the sealing of the eastern parts became public on Monday evening, people rushed to the Mahatma Phule Mandai to purchase vegetables. The police cordoned the Mandai area and streamlined crowds, allowing 25 people to enter at one time and maintain a physical distance from one another while making purchases.Vikram Khanna, a resident of Guruwar peth said all the inner roads were deserted with police patrolling the area. “Till yesterday, people were roaming here unnecessarily. There was panic after a few positive cases (Covid-19) were found in our area. But the people have welcomed the municipal administration’s decision to seal the area,” he said. Shivraj Sanas, a resident of Mandai area, was also appreciative of crowd control brought about by the police in the vegetable market area. A political activist said people are themselves informing the police if someone is found loitering on the road.Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar on Tuesday took a review of the areas which were brought under cluster containment in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. Police commissioner K Venkatesham; civic chief Shekhar Gaikwad; Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram; Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar and senior police officers were present for the meeting.PRECAUTIONSThe police are prohibiting unnecessary movement on the roads Vegetable, grocery and milk shops will be open for fixed time while ensuring physical distance among the peopleUse of face masks has been made compulsory for everyone stepping out of their homesPeople will not be allowed to leave these areas and outsiders won’t be allowed to enter these areasIn the case of natural, non-Covid-19 related death, police will give permission to a few people to participate in the cremationPopular shopping areas such as Laxmi road and Belbaugh chowk have been barricaded completelyIn east Pune too, people stepped out in large numbers to stock essentials On Tuesday, residents of eastern Pune stepped out in large numbers to stock essential groceries and prepare for the cluster containment that was enforced in their area from Tuesday.People said the announcement came all of a sudden and took them by surpriseSiddharth Rathi, a resident of Market Yard, said, “We got to know about our area being declared as containment zone late last night. Since this will remain for a week, I had to step out to purchase grocery as well as LPG gas cylinder.”.Many people were disappointed as a large number of shops including those selling essentials such as groceries, medicines and vegetables were completely closed. Relief work such as the foodgrains to the poor also came to a halt and former chief commissioner of Income Tax, Akramul Jabbar Khan, tweeted to Pune police saying: “immediate intervention of the police is needed and NGOs distributing foodgrains must not be stopped. The digital passes were not working.” Govt’s ‘cluster containment’ strategyThe Union health ministry’s cluster containment strategy is meant to contain the disease within a defined geographical area by early detection of cases, breaking the chain of transmission and thus preventing its spread to new areas.“Clusters have appeared in multiple states, particularly Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana and UT of Ladakh. At least 211 districts are now reporting Covid-19 cases and the risk of further spread remains very high,” the Union health ministry has said in a 20-page strategy document.The aggressive containment strategy will be scaled down, said the government document, only if no new cases of Covid-19 are reported for at least four weeks after the last confirmed test.“Based on the risk assessment and indication of successful containment operations, an approach of staggered work and market hours may be put into practice,” the document said.The cluster containment strategy would “include geographic quarantine, social distancing measures, enhanced active surveillance, testing all suspected cases, isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts and risk communication to create awareness among public on preventive public health measures”, the document stated.“The objective of this plan is to stop the chain of transmission thus reducing the morbidity and mortality due to Covid-19,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-embarks-on-aggressive-cluster-containment-prevent-covid-19-spread/story-w6xfjD1uvv7leVxLeEd8MI.html
08-04-2020||Pune||Pune’s Katraj zoo staff to undergo Covid test||Following the report of a tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York tested positive for the coronavirus thought to have been infected by an asymptomatic zoo keeper, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has issued advisory to all zoos across the country.According to the advisory issued to Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Research Centre by the apex body for all zoos in India, the animals should be under watch round the clock and the staff and employees should be screened for Covid-19 (coronavirus).“We have 440 animals, 63 species, including mammals, birds and reptiles, and all the creatures are doing well and taken care of. We are following the guidelines issued by the Central Zoo Authority and conducting first and foremost tests of the staff handling the animal cages. The animals are yet to undergo any tests, but are closely observed for any signs of the allied symptoms of the virus like dullness and respiratory distress,” said Rajkumar Jadhav, director, Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park.Jadhav said, “We have instructed staffers to focus on their personal hygiene. Our workforce of 100 includes animal caretakers, security staff and administration employees. Animal handlers have been provided with hand gloves, sanitiser and face mask. They have also been told to go near animals only when needed.”The senior official said that all staff are reporting to workplace and swab be will be done as per the advisory issued by the central body on Monday. He said that contractors are bringing in feed regularly for zoo animals. “We have spraying disinfectant solution on vehicles that enter the zoo premises with animal food and other materials. Animal handlers are also made to clean their footwear with disinfectant solutions before near cages. We have sent a request to Pune Municipal Corporation on Tuesday to begin swab test of our staff,” Jadhav said.The advisory states that ‘zoos in the country are therefore advised to remain on highest alertness, watch animals on 24x7 basis, using CCTV for any abnormal behaviour and symptoms. Keepers and handlers not to be allowed in the vicinity without safety gear preferably PPE (personal protective equipment), isolate and quarantine sick animals, and have least contact while providing feed to animals.”Regarding the care for mammals, it states: “Mammals like carnivores especially cats, ferrets and primates to be carefully monitored and fortnightly samples of suspected cases to be sent to the designated animal health institutes to initiate Covid-19 testing while following all bio-containment and safety measures required to handle this high-risk pathogen as per the national and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines.”Jadhav said, “Although we are adhering to safety and disinfection protocol issued by the government, collection of throat swabs from animals like tiger is not easy as it is a risk to put the animal under anaesthesia. All the animals are healthy and under constant observation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-s-katraj-zoo-staff-to-undergo-covid-test/story-YrJzI2J4AQAVzYdbQkHSoO.html
08-04-2020||Pune||On The Frontline: Some take out anger of being confined on us, says Shyam Mane, surveillance inspector, PMC||Shyam Mane, malaria surveillance inspector, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has been working with the civic body’s health department for the past 32 years. He is among those from the city that are on the frontline in the war against Covid-19. He talks about his work and how the PMC is working to sanitise the city. What exactly is your role in this crisis?I work with the insect control department, which follows the National vector-borne disease control programme guidelines. Under this we use sodium hypochlorite and undertake environmental cleaning / decontamination of quarantine facilities such as rooms, offices, and staircases where persons with potential exposure to the Sars-Cov-2 virus stay. We are spraying it on the walls, staircases and floors, where Covid-19 positive patients have been found. We get a list of suspicious and positive patients. I started this work on March 6, but before this my main work was to survey the mosquito breeding spots, spray insecticide and maintain a healthy environment.How does your day begin and roll out?My day begins at 5 am, where upon I exercise at home until 6.30 am. Then I leave my house early and come straight to work at 8 am. My job consists taking attendance of the workers, making everyone uses sanitiser, and each one of them is equipped with a can of sodium hypochlorite to spray in the areas as per the list given to me by my superiors. We were told by officials that sodium hypochlorite is effective and this will help kill the virus. We have 300 to 400 houses to be sprayed each day with every case takes about two-and-half hours. We usually finish work by 8 pm.What precautions are you taking?My family doesn’t want me to come home and are telling me to find another place as I often go to positive case areas. Hence, the moment I reach home, I am sent straight to the bathroom for a clean bath. I have my wife, son and my mother living with me, and they are aware of the risks. But it is also my responsibility to keep everyone at home healthy. Hence, I always use the sanitiser before entering my house or leaving for work and always wear the N95 mask. I also have use-and-throw masks in case they are needed.What is your view of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune?The PMC is doing a good job in its effort to control the spread of the virus and we are working day and night for this. The faster we control it, it will help us to work on the other problems that the city faces like the pre-monsoon work of spraying on breeding grounds for malaria and dengue mosquitoes. We are working with a positive attitude to make sure that the city is protected.Do you see any gaps in health and relief work?We face a lot of problems, with a number of housing societies calling us, using political clout or asking us to be sympathetic and spray in their areas as a precaution. But then we explain that this spraying is only done in a radius where positive patients or suspected ones were found. We also face problems in the slums, as slum dwellers don’t allow us to enter in their locality. Some use their frustration and anger of being confined to on us and abuse us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/some-take-out-frustration-and-anger-of-being-confined-on-us/story-mro3stMBntvjyE3sw6SPMN.html

Player pathway to top clubs in and outside of India. Usual evening session:In the evenings, I coach kids for an hour or two after which I head to the gym or mostly to the ground for a quick game to keep myself fit. Lockdown evening session:The evening is a good time to spend time with family now. However, I am not ignoring my fitness in the process. Working out has become a very nice bonding activity during the lockdown because my five-year-old daughter joins me every day for the workout.No gymsI normally stay with a light warm-up which includes on spot jogging followed by a few low range motion exercises for 10 minutes for the complete body to prepare for the next task. Then, I use the resistance exercises or the dynamic exercises which include jumping jacks, crunches, squats, push-ups, wall sits, burpees, lunges, plyo lunges, jump squats, triceps dips, calf raises, and plank hold. HobbiesI like watching movies, listening to music and cooking. I like watching movies in the sports genre which are based on true events. Coach Carter is one of my favourite movies. The film is based on the true story of Richmond High School basketball coach Ken Carter (played by Samuel L. Jackson), who made headlines in 1999 for suspending his undefeated high school basketball team due to poor academic results. For me, it was a very inspiring movie.Lockdown training tips for footballersEating the right kind of food. Since it’s summer, keep yourself hydrated and get good sleep. Kids between the age of 3 and 10 should hone individual skills, hence, this is a good opportunity for them to develop ball mastery at home which they can do with any kind of ball and needs only 2 x 2 yards for a maximum of 45 minutes.Kids between the age of 11 and 18 should focus on learning tactical and formation in football to adapt any formation the coach wants them to play, coupled with physical fitness. Playing a game of 60 to 90 minutes should not be a hassle for teenagers.Workout plan for footballers at home:Upper Body WorkoutMobility Drills:Modified Hindu Push-ups 15 Reps x 2 SetsCat Camel 15 Reps x 2 SetsJumping Jack 50 Reps x 2 SetsShoulder Rotation Clock/Anti 20 Reps x 1 SetScapula Push-ups 15 Reps x 2 SetsAll-rounder (Worlds greatest Stretch)Burpees 15 Reps x 2 SetsJor 10 Reps x 1 SetsMain WorkoutMain Workout:Push-up (normal / knee) to hand raise one at a timeWater Bucket front raisesBent over Bucket rowsDecline Push-upIncline Push-upBucket overhead Rotation pressCore WorkoutMountain ClimbersCross Mountain ClimbersCrunches (Partial and Bicycle)Plank Dips and Hold (Left and Right)Pelvic rotationLower Body WorkoutMobility Drills:Cat Camel 15 Reps x 2 Sets90/90 stretchAll-rounder (Worlds greatest Stretch)Frog PoseMain Workout:Squat (Deep and Pause)Lunges (Side and Reverse)Glute BridgeCalf Raises (Seated and Standing)90 Degree Squat HoldSuryanamskarStatic stretching post-exercise and meditation||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/lockdown-has-given-this-pune-football-coach-extra-time-to-review-his-sport-plan-for-school-kids/story-uHAbr3X3rGWRfB5asojMYL.html
08-04-2020||Mumbai||Will lose war against coronavirus with thali, taali, and diyas: Sena mouthpiece attacks Modi||Taking a jibe on Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s “applications” to fight coronavirus, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana stated in an editorial on Tuesday that the war against the disease will be lost with “claps, thalis and diyas”.With people coming out on the streets to follow Modi’s directions, the Sena said either they are not understanding his instructions or the PM himself wants such a “festive” atmosphere. The Saamana editorial added that not only ‘markaz’ attendees are not following the rules, the ones blaming them for spreading Covid-19 are equally indisciplined.The Sena also said that some BJP MLAs in the country lit torches and shouted slogans condemning China, burst firecrackers and Diwali was ‘celebrated’. “It seems that the message of the Prime Minister is not reaching the people properly, else Sunday’s divine incidents would not have occurred. It is true that people switched off their lights, but later crowds came on streets with torches. With this social distancing, which is crucial to fight coronavirus, was ignored,” read the editorial. It added that such actions cannot be termed as “war” but suicide.In a veiled attack on the saffron party, it said, “It is not that only those who attended Markaz [Tablighi Jamaat congregation] are not following the rules. What discipline are the ones, who are blaming the Markaz attendee for spreading coronavirus, following.”In a sharp attack on Modi’s initiatives of switching off lights and to beat thalis (plates) and ring bells, the editorial read, “US President Donald Trump sought medicines from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fight coronavirus. Trump did not seek thalis, claps, bells, conch shells, candles or diya (lamps) from India, this should be understood by our enthusiastic citizens.”Comparing the fight against coronavirus to the third Battle of Panipat, Sena said the latter was lost due to “confusion and lack of planning” and the war against the disease should not become like the Panipat battle. The editorial lauded chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s efforts to deal with the health crisis in the state. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is repeatedly appealing to people to reduce crowding. He is focusing on how to help people and on giving medical facilities to people… We need such a commander during this war against coronavirus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-lose-war-against-coronavirus-with-thali-taali-and-diyas-sena-mouthpiece-attacks-modi/story-QbWvSeAN0tS5inA7quUbxI.html
08-04-2020||Pune||Full-body disinfecting enclosures to be installed outside police lines in Pune||Taking cue from the full-body misting sanitisation enclosures outside the Naidu Hospital - a hub for Covid-19 treatment in the city - the Pune police have decided to install similar enclosures outside six police lines (quarters) in Pune, according to Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of Pune police. Additionally, there will also be more number of Sanjeevani vans - mobile enclosures - for the police officials deployed at over 120 check posts in the city. The first Sanjeevani van was put into use on the Pune city roads on Monday.“There will be these enclosures outside all six police lines and places where there is more police footfall. First such enclosure was installed at Market Yard police station and other major police stations. We are getting these made locally to reduce the cost,” said Joint CP Shisve.While the station enclosures will be installed outside the entrance of the police quarters, the Sanjeevani vans are built inside police vehicles that will reach all posts at least once a day. The interiors of the vehicle is installed with pressure fogging system which provides complete sanitation within 6-7 seconds, according to a statement issued by Sanjay Shinde, additional commissioner of police, traffic, Pune.A similar concept is being deployed at the stationary enclosures. There are multiple police quarters in Khadki, Shivajinagar and Swargate, among others . The stationary enclosures cost around Rs 30,000-35,000, according to the official.“The first vehicles came onto the streets today. The second one is also ready. We are planning for 3-4 such vehicles to be operational in the next few days,” said Joint CP Shisve.The police are in direct contact with the public as they enforce the lockdown that prohibits assembly and vehicle movement in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/full-body-disinfecting-enclosures-to-be-installed-outside-police-lines-in-pune/story-KVErkah6sgVbwO8RZMDN3H.html
08-04-2020||Chandigarh||With 7 more Covid-19 cases, Mohali count rises 26, the highest in Punjab||Seven new Covid-19 positive cases were reported from Jawaharpur village of Dera Bassi in Mohali district on Tuesday, which has now become the new disease hotspot, taking the count in the district to 26, the highest in Punjab as well as the tricity. On Tuesday, in what was the biggest daily spike in the tricity, where maximum six cases were reported on March 30, seven people from the same extended family tested positive. They included four family members of a village official, including his mother, aged 61, sister-in-law (brother’s wife), aged 35, and her children, aged 12 and 16.With this, the count in the panch’s family has also gone up to eight as he was diagnosed with Covid-19 on April 3, and his father, brother and wife, tested positive on Monday.The village head (sarpanch), aged 39, who also happens to be the panch’s cousin, her husband, aged 43, and daughter, 19, were also confirmed positive on Tuesday.All of them have been admitted at Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur.Till reports last came in, the village on the Ambala-Chandigarh highway remained sealed with Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan and civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh and a health team camping there.Dera Bassi sub divisional magistrate Kuldeep Bawa said contact tracing of others who came in contact with the two families was being done. “The panch owns a tent house and was in touch with eight labourers. It has been learnt that on March 31 he came in contact with a Muslim factory worker who is suspected of having met a Tablighi Jamaat attendee. Efforts are on to trace the factory worker.”Three villages sealed, 118 samples takenBesides Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi, the district administration also sealed the neighbouring villages of Devigarh and Mehmudpur. In Jawaharpur, officials directed all the villagers to stay indoors until health department teams checked each and every household. About 522 homes were inspected with 2,460 people examined. A fire tender was also brought in to sanitise the village.The health department took 118 samples on Tuesday of villagers in Jawaharpur who were in direct contact with the families of the panch and sarpanch. Four samples were also taken from Shakti Nagar in Dera Bassi where four close associates of the sarpanch live and sent to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research for further evaluation.Panchayat members violated curfew, no checks on Markaz attendeesJawaharpur, a nondescript village in Dera Bassi, which has turned into Punjab’s Covid-19 hotspot, could have been spared had the village sarpanch and panch not violated the curfew imposed in the state to prevent transmission of the disease. Officials could also have acted quickly to trace the source of the virus, say villagers.Today, as 11 members of the two village officials’ families remain hospitalised after being diagnosed with Covid-19, other villagers are questioning why they defied the curfew to move around unrestricted and serve community meals to labourers and the poor.Locals also blame officials, who they say failed to act in time to trace the primary source of the virus and retest the samples of 10 attendees of Tablighi Jamaat Markaz event at Nizamuddin in Delhi who stayed at the village’s mosque from March 19 to 29. They had tested negative in Delhi and Haryana earlier.Dera Bassi sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Kuldeep Bawa said the 10 Markaz attendees were medically examined. Their samples taken in Haryana and Delhi had tested negative. When asked why their samples had not been taken, Bawa said the Jamaat issue was not in the spotlight when they were in the village.When questioned how they left the village during the lockdown, he said they left during the exodus of the migrants and no passes had been issued to them.The panchayat members and their families, local villagers say, did not follow precautions while socialising with others in the village. They also confronted others who objected to this.The police visited Jawaharpur twice after the family members had altercations with other villagers, said a local, Balwinder Singh.Another village resident, Sukhwinder Singh, also questioned why the samples of the 10 Markaz attendees were not taken.The district administration, he alleged, was responsible for the spread of the virus in the village. Had the panchayat members’ social interactions been stopped the story would have been different, he said.Congress leader Dhillon quarantined tooCongress incharge of Dera Bassi, Deepinder Singh Dhillon, who actively participated in distributing community meals with the sarpanch and panch in Jawaharpur village, was home quarantined on Tuesday at his residence in Chandigarh for 14 days.Concerns over others getting infected grew as Dhillon was found to have held several political meetings in the past two weeks. He had reportedly come in contact with nearly 250 people. Dhillon’s samples were taken today and reports will come in tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-7-more-covid-19-cases-mohali-count-rises-26-the-highest-in-punjab/story-oXIYeXJ8rLTAFyRjJpbf7O.html
08-04-2020||Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat chief sent second notice with three more questions||The Delhi Police’s crime branch, which is probing the Tablighi Jamaat chief and his associates, has sent a second notice to Maulana Saad seeking answers to three more questions related to the religious gatherings in mid-March at the group’s six-storey headquarters in Nizamuddin Basti, which has emerged as the largest hot spot of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the country.Saad and six other top Jamaat functionaries have been booked for violating several prohibitory orders issued to stop the spread of the disease (Covid-19) under sections of The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. Saad also faces charges of criminal conspiracy. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Jamaat headquarters, also known as Markaz, has been linked to over 1,445 infections so far, or about 35% of the total cases in India across 17 states and union territories, as per details made available by the Union health ministry. Saad’s counsel, advocate Fuzail Ayyubi, confirmed that the police have sent a second questionnaire to his client.“The investigating officer (IO) has sought some information in the second questionnaire. We filed our reply to most of the questions in the first questionnaire and told them that for some questions, we needed time. We could not get access to some of the records they have sought because of the lockdown. They have asked for some clarifications in the second notice,” he said.While crime branch officials declined to comment on the progress of the investigation, a police officer, who did not wish to be named, said the three questions seek details of the persons who attended the congregation inside the Markaz. The officer added that some of the documents and records that the Markaz provided in response to the first notice were in Urdu because of which they needed clarification. On Sunday afternoon, a team of five experts from the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) of Delhi government visited the Markaz building. “Delhi Police officers said they will send us the exhibits later. Our personnel who went inside the building have been advised to go in self-quarantine as a precautionary measure,” a forensic officer said, adding that no electronic device was recovered from the building.In the first notice, which had 26 questions, sent on April 1, the IO sought details of CCTV cameras inside the building, and asked Saad to preserve all CCTV footage. Other information sought included the original register/data/records maintained by the building management with details of those who participated in gatherings after March 12. The police also sought details of all people, including foreigners, who were present in the building last month. There was also a question about the steps taken by the management to disperse the gathering after the government’s prohibitory orders were issued.Police have accused Saad of ignoring the Delhi government’s March 13 and March 16 orders that put a ban on religious congregations, and restricted all gathering to not more than 200 people. The police have said that there were about 2,300 people inside the building despite the curbs.Saad’s lawyer denied reports that the Tablighi chief was absconding. “We have not been summoned yet. The Maulana is in self-quarantine on doctors’ advice. He will cooperate with the police when they summon him,” Ayyubi saidThe police have put barricades on all lanes leading to the Markaz. A total of 2,361 people, including about 250 foreigners, were evacuated from the building with the help of health department officers in an operation that began on March 29 and ended on March 31.The evacuees were either sent to hospitals for tests, or to government-run quarantine centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jamaat-chief-sent-second-notice-with-three-more-questions/story-EtenzGjwhgCHnyZ7OsBIZK.html
08-04-2020||World||Coronavirus Update: US toll nears 13,000, African Americans hit hardest by Covid-19||The novel coronavirus is killing a disproportionately higher number of African Americans than other racial demographics, US president Donald Trump and his top public health experts said Tuesday, acknowledging an emerging concern as the country recorded its highest single-day fatalities of nearly 2,000.The US toll stood at 12,991 Wednesday morning and reported confirmed cases were up to about 399,000, as officials expressed cautious optimism that some of the severely-hit areas may have stabilized. New York, the worst hit state with nearly 5,500 fatalities (more than 4,000 in New York City alone), is looking at a “projected plateau” in hospitalization numbers.The disproportionately high death rate among American Americans has emerged as a new worry. “We’re seeing tremendous evidence that African Americans are affected at a far greater percentage number than other citizens of our country,” President Trump said at the daily White House briefing by the coronavirus task force.Nation-wide figures are not available yet, but the evidence is unmistakable from some state numbers. African Americans comprise just 14% of the population in Michigan but account for 40% of the fatalities; they are 32% of the population in Louisiana but 70% of all deaths. Black Americans make up 30% of Chicago but 68% of fatalities. These numbers are based on data published by states and news media outlets; there is no nation-wide data available yet, but the White House coronavirus task force is expected to release a compilation shortly.Public health officials and experts have blamed the high death rate to the high incidence of underlying conditions such as blood pressure and heart ailments, diabetes, asthma and obesity among African Americans, linked to poverty and the comparative lack of healthcare facilities among some communities.US Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who is African American, and 45-years-old, addressed the underlying issues speaking about himself. “I and many black Americans are at higher risk for COVID (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus). That’s why we need everyone to do their part to slow the spread,” he told CBS.He is pre-diabetic, has high blood pressure and suffers from asthma. “So I represent that legacy of growing up poor and black in America,” Adams said.As the president acknowledged for the first time the growing concerns about African Americans being most at risk, he said, “We are doing everything in our power to address this challenge, and it’s a tremendous challenge,” Trump said. “It’s terrible.” He added that Anthony Fauci, country’s premier epidemiologist and member of the task-force, is “is looking at it very strongly.”Deborah Birx, coordinator of the task force, added, “We don’t want to give the impression that the African American community is more susceptible to the virus; we don’t have any data that suggests that. What our data suggests is they are more susceptible to more difficult and severe disease and poorer outcomes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-us-toll-nears-13-000-african-americans-hit-hardest-by-covid-19/story-oTDQuJsc5SintE4Q4Hj4VN.html
08-04-2020||World||Pak skips virtual Saarc meet on overcoming Covid-19 impact on regional trade||Pakistan on Wednesday skipped a video conference of senior trade officials of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc), which discussed ways to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on regional trade.The virtual meeting of the trade officials was a follow-up to a video conference of leaders of the eight Saarc states that was convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 15. At that time, Pakistan was the only country not to be represented by its head of government.The external affairs ministry said in a statement that all Saarc countries, except Pakistan, participated in Wednesday’s video conference discussed the impact of travel restrictions and the larger Covid-19 situation on intra-regional trade.All the countries present during the video conference contributed to discussions on a wide-ranging trade-related agenda in the spirit of “shared interest and a problem-solving approach”. They recognised that the pandemic is “likely to have a considerable adverse impact on trade in the Saarc region”.The trade officials stressed that new ways should be identified to sustain and expand intra-regional trade until normal trade channels are restored. “The imperative need to maintain essential trade within the Saarc region was viewed as an important thrust area for favourable consideration,” the statement said.Specific issues addressed during the conference included facilitation of trade through pragmatic solutions such as provisional clearance of imports at preferential duty with suitable conditions, provisional acceptance of digitally signed certificates of origin, acceptance of scanned copies of documents for clearing imports by customs and release of payments by banks, and resolving issues related to exports and imports at land customs stations.The impact of health issues such as Covid-19 on regional trade and measures to mitigate it emerged as a new focus area for discussion within the larger framework of trade facilitation under Saarc, and the need to enhance the quantum of intra-Saarc trade was highlighted, the statement said.The seven states that joined the conference proposed to remain in touch through a designated focal point in each country, and the Indian side offered to coordinate this exercise, the statement said.This will also enable further interaction on ideas and proposed actions for the early restoration of normal trade in the region after movement restrictions related to Covid-19 are lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-skips-virtual-saarc-meet-on-overcoming-covid-19-impact-on-regional-trade/story-sFYPp0o2Egi4jebCseT06J.html
08-04-2020||World||Bernie Sanders suspends 2020 Democratic presidential campaign||Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign for the White House on Wednesday during a conference call with staff, making former Vice President Joe Biden the presumptive nominee to face Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election.Sanders plans to address supporters during a livestream at 11:45 ET (1545 GMT), a statement said.The U.S. senator from Vermont, a democratic socialist whose progressive agenda pulled the party sharply to the left, shot to an early lead in the Democratic race but faded quickly after losing South Carolina in late February as moderate Democrats consolidated their support behind Biden’s campaign.The departure of Sanders, the last remaining rival to Biden, sets up a battle between the 77-year-old former vice president and Trump, 73, who is seeking a second four-year term in office.Sanders’ decision to step aside came with the country in the grip of a coronavirus outbreak that upended the nominating elections schedule, with some primaries postponed and others up in the air. Sanders had been his party’s front-runner just a month ago.Sanders, who also mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge in 2016 to eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, had been under pressure to halt his campaign after Biden won resounding victories in primary contests on March 17 in Florida, Arizona and Illinois.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bernie-sanders-suspends-2020-democratic-presidential-campaign/story-aWJvsyJVbdsWbwtlchNx3N.html
08-04-2020||World||Britain’s Johnson ‘responding to treatment’ but remains in intensive care||Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson was “responding to treatment”, his spokesman said Wednesday, as the 55-year-old leader spent a third day in intensive care battling the coronavirus.The disease has struck at the heart of the British government and infected more than 55,000 people across the country and killed nearly 6,200.“The prime minister remains clinically stable and is responding to treatment,” his official spokesman said. “He continues to be cared for in the intensive care unit in St Thomas’ Hospital. He is in good spirits.”Earlier, junior health minister Edward Argar told Sky News the Conservative leader was “not on ventilation”.The latest update came as newspapers urged Britons to keep their stricken leader at the forefront of their minds, with the country in lockdown to try to stem the spread of COVID-19 in its third week.“He stayed at work for you... now pray at home for him,” The Sun tabloid splashed across its front page. “Boris ‘will pull through’“ said the Daily Express.Deputising for Johnson, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the PM “a fighter” and predicted “he’ll be back, leading us through this crisis in short order”.Johnson is the most high-profile government leader to become infected with COVID-19 and messages of support flooded in from across Britain and the world.He was admitted to intensive care on Monday evening after spending Sunday night in hospital following concerns he still had a cough and high temperature 10 days after being diagnosed with COVID-19.His transfer to intensive care is unprecedented for a prime minister during a national emergency.For many people, it brought home the seriousness of the disease that has so far seen 6,159 deaths in Britain, with a record 786 more reported in a daily update on Tuesday. Fresh figures are expected later on Wednesday. ‘Work goes on’ Despite the record daily death toll, there was more encouraging news with the number of new daily cases remaining at a roughly stable 3,643.Downing Street also said on Wednesday that it was still too soon to say whether stringent social distancing measures introduced on March 23 for an initial three-week period would be eased at all.A review is expected take place next week as planned, despite suggestions of a power vacuum at the top of the British government given the PM’s hospitalisation.“We’ve set out that we would make a further announcement in three weeks and there’s no change to that, no change at all to the timeline,” Johnson’s spokesman said.The country does not have a formal constitutional role of deputy prime minister, and experts said Raab would need the support of the rest of the cabinet to make any big decisions.‘Enormous shock’ Johnson announced on March 27 that he had coronavirus and went into self-isolation in a flat above his Downing Street office.But on Monday evening he was moved to intensive care in London’s St Thomas’ hospital after his condition worsened.The prime minister has received messages of support from around the world, with US President Donald Trump sending best wishes to his “very good friend” while Russian leader Vladimir Putin said Johnson’s “energy, optimism and sense of humour” would see him through.For some, Johnson’s larger-than-life personality has made his hospitalisation all the more shocking.His biographer Andrew Gimson said Johnson always made him feel upbeat, and “now here he is the stricken one”.“This is an enormous shock, completely unfamiliar territory for all those who know him,” he told BBC radio.Experts said it was not uncommon for coronavirus patients to move to intensive care, but said it showed Johnson’s condition was serious.“There is no doubt this turn of events means Boris Johnson is extremely sick,” said Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London.Still shaking hands The British government was criticised for initially refusing to follow other European countries in requiring people to stay home as the virus spread rapidly across the globe.Johnson himself said in early March that he was still shaking hands with people.Two weeks ago, he ordered a nationwide lockdown, but parliament continued to sit for several days after and Westminster became a hotspot for the virus.Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, have both been infected, although they have since recovered.Johnson’s pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, moved out of Downing Street after some staff fell ill.Meanwhile, Number 10 also revealed on Wednesday that it expected its chief Brexit negotiator David Frost to “speak early next week” to his European Union counterpart Michel Barnier to agree a timetable for “remote” talks in April and May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-s-johnson-responding-to-treatment-but-remains-in-intensive-care/story-WUxh7uTeV7TywcreZrr5yI.html

All citizens and residents other than those in essential services require a permit to leave their homes.Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the country, has come to a virtual halt with its famous mega-malls and sprawling hotels shuttered.Life under the lockdown has raised many questions among anxious citizens. One Emirati man contacted police to ask whether he needs a permit to visit his second wife, the Gulf News daily reported, without saying what the answer was.Polygamy is allowed in the country, with men allowed to have four wives at the same time, in accordance with Islamic law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-suspends-marriage-and-divorce-during-virus-lockdown/story-stgBde5P0dItlPTbNaS9TJ.html

China contributed $44 million, it said.“We are still in the acute phase of a pandemic so now is not the time to cut back on funding,” Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, told a virtual briefing when asked about Trump’s remarks.Dr Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to the WHO Director-General, also defended the U.N. agency’s relationship with China, saying its work with Beijing authorities was important to understand the outbreak which began in Wuhan in December.“It was absolutely critical in the early part of this outbreak to have full access to everything possible, to get on the ground and work with the Chinese to understand this,” he told reporters.“This is what we did with every other hard-hit country like Spain and had nothing to do with China specifically.”Aylward, who led a WHO expert mission to China in February, defended WHO recommendations to keep borders open, saying that China had worked “very hard” to identify and detect early cases and their contacts and ensure they did not travel.“China worked very, hard very early on, once it understood what it was dealing with, to try and identify and detect all potential cases to make sure that they got tested to trace all the close contacts and make sure they were quarantined so they actually knew where the virus was, where the risk was,” he said.“Then they made it very clear that these people would not and could not travel within the country, let alone internationally,” he added.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been lavish in his praise of China from early in the outbreak, praising President Xi Jinping’s “rare leadership”.David Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who led WHO’s response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, said that any U.S. funding cut would be a huge blow.“If the WHO loses its funding it cannot continue to do its work. It works on a shoe-string budget already,” Heymann said in London. “Of course it would be disastrous for the WHO to lose funding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-rejects-china-centric-charge-after-trump-criticism/story-4nihzogYdeu2blG3ocv24O.html

I can also tell you that he has been sitting up in bed and engaging positively with the clinical team”, Sunak said.“The Prime Minister is not only my colleague, my boss but my friend; my thoughts are with him and his family. The news about the PM reminds us how indiscriminate this disease is”, he added, as the UK entered the third week of the three-week lockdown.Concerns continued to swirl in Westminster of a power vacuum at the top of the government with foreign secretary Dominic Raab deputising for Johnson “where necessary”, with the extent of his powers limited.New figures showed the biggest rise so far in daily deaths by 938 to 7,097. The number of cases in hospitals also rose to 60,733, but health officials said the data showed that the number of the patients needing critical care is flattening.Sunak announced £750 million for the charity sector and also promised to match pound-for-pound the money raised by BBC’s Big Night to raise funds for the National Emergencies Trust on April 23, committing a minimum of £20 million.He has previously announced over £330 billion pounds to help the economy, besides picking up 80 per cent of the salary bill of the employed and self-employed sector affected by the pandemic.Officials said Raab will not have the prime minister’s weekly audience with Queen Elizabeth, will not be able to appoint or dismiss ministers, nor take major decisions unless with the concurrence of the cabinet. Security-related questions have also been raised.The business of government continues, officials say, with Raab chairing meetings related to the coronavirus response. The immediate major decision the new arrangement will need to take is whether the current lockdown needs to extended.The Guardian said in an editorial: “The government now finds itself in uncharted waters, as the epidemic in Britain moves towards an anticipated peak roughly a week from now. Unfortunately, the arrangement the prime minister leaves behind is murky and potentially unstable”.“This lack of clarity over leadership matters…But if a leadership vacuum does begin to emerge, some form of cross-party arrangement may need to be considered to ensure continuing public consent for tough decisions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/questions-over-uk-power-vacuum-as-pm-boris-johnson-stays-stable/story-gDxGqOxHRasnIZx6bICtTM.html

The masks are being returned, and the vendor has committed to a full refund,” a statement from the Mayor’s office said.These masks were meant for health care workers and carers at long-term care homes where the most vulnerable demographic, the elderly, are looked after. The city is investigating whether any employees had “possible exposure to COVID-19” due to the faulty masks.Toronto is now scrambling to identify an appropriate grade masks for purchase on “a priority basis, as the loss of this inventory makes for a significant shortfall of surgical masks for the city.”This news from Toronto comes even as Canada received eight million face masks from China. Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said that more masks are expected from there, while the government has found various sources for over 230 million masks.Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the government will collaborate with Canadian companies for speedily manufacturing 30,000 ventilators. Trudeau said during his daily media briefing that, “To keep our frontline workers safe and care for Canadians with COVID-19, we need a sustainable, stable supply of these products, and that means making them at home.”These efforts come even as groups representing frontline healthcare workers blasted the government for its ineptitude in proving personal protective equipment or PPE to those treating and caring for coronavirus patients. These statements came during a virtual Parliamentary committee hearing. According to the national broadcaster CBC, Dr Sandy Buchman, president of the Canadian Medical Association told MPs that they felt “betrayed.”“Asking health care workers to be on the front lines of this pandemic without the proper equipment is unacceptable. Shortages must be addressed immediately and information about supplies must be disseminated. People’s lives are on the line,” Buchman said. His views were echoed by Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions. “”Front line workers across the country who are directly involved in the care of presumed and confirmed COVID-19 patients are not being provided with the PPE they need to do their jobs. That’s simply outrageous and unacceptable in a world-class health system like ours,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-shortage-of-masks-in-canada-s-toronto-after-city-returns-substandard-chinese-import/story-Yb9zhiNOX52arpGSKYNoSI.html
08-04-2020||World||‘Painful lesson’: how a military-style lockdown unfolded in Wuhan||As the world grapples with the escalating coronavirus pandemic, China reopened the city of Wuhan on Wednesday, allowing its 11 million residents to leave for the first time in over two months, a milestone in its effort to combat the outbreak.But while the operation to contain Wuhan’s coronavirus outbreak has been hailed as a success by China and many international health experts, it didn’t come easy.Using virus case data, official reports and over a dozen interviews with officials, residents and scientists in Wuhan, Reuters has compiled a comprehensive account of how the military-style quarantine of the city unfolded.SCIENTIST TOURWuhan health authorities reported the first case of what turned out to be the new coronavirus in December, and the first known death linked to the virus in early January.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicCity officials insisted the situation was under control for the first two weeks of January, downplaying the possibility of human-to-human transmission as they focused on a seafood and wildlife market where the outbreak was believed to have started.But troubling signs were emerging.Hospital respiratory wards began reaching capacity by around Jan 12, and some people were being turned away, a half dozen Wuhan residents told Reuters.But at least up to Jan. 16, Wuhan’s government said that no new cases of the disease had occurred for about two weeks, and the city continued as normal. Diners packed restaurants, shoppers flocked to commercial districts, and travellers headed to train stations and airports for their Lunar New Year holidays.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakMinimal measures were put in place to take the temperatures of residents in public places, or encourage them to wear protective masks, residents said.“We ordinary people did not know that we needed to take protective measures,” said Wang Wenjun, whose uncle died of the coronavirus on Jan 31.But that changed after Jan 18, when a team of scientists sent by the central government in Beijing arrived in Wuhan.Leading the group was 83-year-old Zhong Nanshan, an epidemiologist credited with raising the alarm in China about the spread of another coronavirus, SARS, in 2003. Over two days, the team investigated the source and scale of Wuhan’s outbreak, inspecting the seafood and wildlife market and other sites.As the scientists toured Wuhan, their mood darkened as the scale of the crisis became clear, said a source familiar with the trip.A day before the scientists arrived, four new cases were confirmed in Wuhan, none of which had apparent links to the market.That cast doubt over local authorities’ previous assertions that there was no substantial evidence of human-to-human transmission, which would have required them to impose drastic containment measures on the city.The scientists’ visit was the third by an expert group since the end of December as suspicion in Beijing grew that the virus was transmissible and local officials had concealed the challenges they faced containing the disease, according to an academic on the Jan 18 trip and a scientist who visited on Jan 2. Another trip took place on Jan 8.During the Jan 18 visit, the team made several discoveries that had been previously undisclosed to the public by local officials.Over a dozen healthcare workers had been infected, efforts to track close contacts with other confirmed cases had dwindled, and hospitals had not conducted a single test before Jan. 16, Zhong and other experts on the team announced a few days after their trip to Wuhan.On Jan 19, the group of about a half dozen scientists returned to Beijing, where they reported their findings to the National Health Commission, which formulates China’s health policy.The experts recommended that Wuhan be put under quarantine and that hospital capacity be rapidly expanded, according to two sources who were briefed on the discussions. Zhong himself had suggested the lockdown measures, they said. Zhong and the commission did not respond to requests for comment.One of the sources said the proposal was initially rejected by Wuhan government officials because they feared the economic impact, but they were overruled by the central authorities.On the evening of Jan 20, the central government set up a taskforce in Wuhan to spearhead the fight against the epidemic.The lockdown of Wuhan had been put in motion.Ye Qing, deputy chief of the statistics bureau in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, said it was only when Zhong announced his findings that he began to realize the seriousness of this epidemic.Wuhan officials, he said, reacted far too late. “If the government had sent out a notice, if they had asked everyone to wear masks, to do temperature checks, maybe a lot fewer people would have died.”He added: “It’s a painful lesson with blood and tears.”Later tracing of virus patients showed that people confirmed to have the virus travelled from Wuhan to at least 25 provinces, municipalities and administrative regions across China before the lockdown plan went into action.The Wuhan government and the National Health Commission in Beijing did not respond to requests for comment.LOCKDOWNThe ripple effects of events in Beijing were soon felt in Wuhan.On Jan 22, senior officials in Wuhan received a written government notice telling them not to leave the city, or report their whereabouts if they had, according to two local government sources.The directive offered no further details, but at about 8 p.m. that night, some officials received notice by telephone that the city would be shut off the next morning, the sources said.The lockdown was publicly announced at 2 a.m., sending thousands of Wuhan residents scrambling to find a way out.But access into and out of the city was quickly closed off, with public transportation shut down and the use of private cars banned. Residents were soon after restricted to their homes.Having seized control of the crisis, Beijing also removed a number of key officials from Wuhan and Hubei province.Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, who kept his job, made a frank admission in an interview with state media a few days later that party-reporting mechanisms had stifled early action.“Information should have been released more quickly,” he said. The process had been slowed by officials in Wuhan being “obliged to seek permission” before fully disclosing information to the public, he said.‘NEW NORMAL’Almost two months after the lockdown was imposed, China has started allowing residents to leave the city, as well as permitting domestic flights and inter-city trains. Wuhan has reported just one new case in the past week, and around 93% of all cases have recovered, according to official data.As other countries consider Wuhan-style quarantines, those numbers have come under increased scrutiny, however. U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that China’s numbers were “on the light side,” drawing the ire of Beijing.China has also only just begun reporting data on asymptomatic cases – those in which carriers can transmit the disease without feeling symptoms - in the past week. That followed a public backlash on social media in China that the key numbers had been omitted from the official tally, raising concerns that such cases could lead to a second wave of infections.Xue Lan, a professor at Tsinghua University who is a member of a government coronavirus task force, said precautions put in place for the lockdown – like social distancing - would likely become a part of life in the future in China.“From now on our social lives will enter a new normal,” Xue said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/painful-lesson-how-a-military-style-lockdown-unfolded-in-wuhan/story-0lCTWrhrttw9AjI6bSodyH.html

08-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: Is the world anywhere close to ‘flattening’ the Covid-19 curve?||The trajectory of coronavirus outbreak differs from country to country, however, the trend shows that the virus multiplies and rapidly touches a peak. After peaking, the Covid-19 curve begins to flatten before it takes a downward course similar to that of China.According to the data exhibited by Johns Hopkins University, some of the countries that have reported the highest number of cases and fatalities related to Covid-19 now seem to be flattening the virus curve. What does ‘flattening’ the curve mean?“Flattening the curve involves reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases from one day to the next,” as mentioned on the University’s data centre page for Covid-19. Last month, China had declared that its coronavirus peak is finally over. The total number of cases in the country have not crossed 82,000 for over a month now. The rate of fatalities also seems to have hit a plateau. Countries and the Covid-19 curveSo, when exactly does a country begin to flatten its coronavirus curve? The answer is when it starts seeing a drop in the number of fresh cases and maintains the trend.Italy, for example, seems to be levelling off its number of new cases but is still struggling to contain the number of fatalities. “When a country has fewer new COVID-19 cases emerging today than it did on a previous day, that’s a sign that the country is flattening the curve,” Johns Hopkins University describes. What data showsThe University’s map of a 5-day moving average of top 10 Covid-19 affected countries suggests the coronavirus curve could be flattening. The numbers are calculated by averaging the values of that day, the two days before, and the two next days. According to the University data, 6 out of 10 highly coronavirus-affected nations seem to be reporting a drop in the daily number of fresh Covid-19 cases. These include Italy, Spain, the United States, Iran, Netherlands and Germany. According to the estimates, the UK, France, Belgium continue to report more Covid-19 cases on a daily basis but not at a rate as before. China reported 39 new coronavirus cases as of Sunday, up from 30 a day earlier.Crucial stageThe United States and the UK are at a crucial stage with respect to their coronavirus trajectories. The cases in the US and the UK are still rising but not at a pace like before, therefore, there emerges a chance for these countries to flatten the curve if the rate of new cases stabilises without new spikes. US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the country might be getting to the top of the “curve” of the coronavirus outbreak and said he did not see an early written warning about the pandemic from a top White House aide. The president said he was reluctant to talk about it but that the country might be on track for far fewer deaths than projected. What could upend the ‘flattening’?However, this is just with respect to the top 10 most affected countries in the world. Nations like India, Pakistan and Indonesia have begun to report a rapid rise in the number of coronavirus cases.The coronavirus curve flattened when the Chinese outbreak peaked and the contagion had not reached the West and other countries. Even when the top 10 most affected countries manage to flatten the curve, it may get upended if the virus reaches new regions or gets out of control in densely populated countries like India.More than 80,000 people across the globe have lost their lives to Covid-19. The virus has infected over a million people worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-is-the-world-anywhere-close-to-flattening-the-covid-19-curve/story-CRsjszAsksvICaQOFjmbtI.html

Out of over a million Covid-19 cases across the globe, nearly 4 lakh come from America. More than 80,000 people across the globe have lost their lives to Covid-19. The contagion hasn’t even spared world leaders like UK PM Boris Johnson.  Italy, Spain, France and Germany also grapple with the rise in coronavirus cases and fatalities. New York City in the US, continues to be one of the biggest Covid-19 hotspots in the world. Here are the key Covid-19 developments from across the globe:1. Spain’s daily deaths rose on Tuesday for the first time in five days, with 743 people succumbing overnight compared with 637 in the previous 24 hours. Total cases rose to 140,510 and the death toll was at 13,798.2. Total infections in Germany rose by 4,003 in the past 24 hours to 103,228, climbing for the second straight day after four previous days of drops. The death toll rose by 254 to 1,861.3. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was set to spend a second night in intensive care on Tuesday, while his foreign minister led the government’s response. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said he was self isolating as a family member has symptoms.4. In the Swiss Army’s biggest call-up since World War II, thousands of soldiers have been sent to support health workers, while hundreds have been confined to barracks after potential exposure.5. France has officially registered more than 10,000 deaths from coronavirus infections on Tuesday, becoming the fourth country to go beyond that threshold.6. US President Donald Trump said the United States might be getting to the top of the “curve” of the coronavirus outbreak and reiterated that he wants to get the US economy reopened soon.7. New York state is nearing a plateau in the number of patients hospitalized, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, while total infections in the country rose to 374,329, with the death toll reaching 12,064.8. US President Donald Trump sharply criticized the World Health Organization on Tuesday, accusing it of being too focused on China and issuing bad advice during the outbreak and saying he would put a hold on US funding for the agency.9. Covid-19 is killing African-Americans at a higher rate than the US population at large, according to preliminary numbers from Louisiana, Michigan and Illinois that officials say point to disparities in health and healthcare access.10. The Chinese city where the coronavirus epidemic first broke out, Wuhan, ended a two-month lockdown on Wednesday, but a northern town started restricting the movement of its residents amid concerns of a second wave of infections in mainland China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-army-s-biggest-call-up-since-world-war-ii-amid-covid-19-wuhan-reopens-10-points/story-G59aOumhSteaf1lwhYaz0N.html

It is very sad. There is nothing we can do about it right now except to give them the best possible care to avoid complications,” Fauci said.Trump also said that the White House would release data on coronavirus cases by race in the near future.US Vice President Mike Pence said the “risk of tragedy” is “very real.”“It is a reminder that we have to be very careful with people with underlying health conditions,” he added.Los Angeles County released a partial racial breakdown of coronavirus fatalities for the first time on Tuesday, showing African-Americans are more likely to die from COVID-19.“When we look at these numbers by the total population of each group, African Americans have a slightly higher rate of death than other races,” said L.A. County Health Director Barbara Ferrer.The number of COVID-19 cases in the United States has topped 396,223 as of 20:00 on Tuesday (local time), with 12,722 deaths, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-rakes-up-racism-in-us-donald-trump-says-infections-in-african-americans-higher/story-Ab8yptgDuEgcRKeDprpQSM.html

Over 50,000 people in Wuhan caught the virus, and more than 2,500 of them died, about 80 per cent of all deaths in China, according to official figures.Watch: Wuhan lockdown lifted after 76 days, huge crowds seen at airport Restrictions have eased in recent days as the capital of Hubei province saw just three new confirmed infections in the past 21 days and only two new infections in the past fortnight.“You have no idea! I was already up around 4 am. I felt so good. My kids are so excited. Mum is finally coming home,” 39-year-old Hao Mei told news agency AFP as she waited to board a train. Mei, a single parent from the nearby city of Enshi, said her two children had been home alone since she got stuck in Wuhan, where she works in a school kitchen.Up to 55,000 people are expected to leave Wuhan on Wednesday just by train, according to government estimates.Buses and cars were also on roads out of the city on Wednesday morning, after barricades on its outskirts were dismantled with the ban on outbound travel being lifted at midnight.“Wuhan has lost a lot in this epidemic, and Wuhan people have paid a big price,” a 21-year-old man surnamed Yao, who was heading back to his restaurant job in Shanghai, told AFP.“Now that the lockdown has been lifted, I think we’re all pretty happy.”“Wuhan deserves to be called the city of heroes,” blared an announcement over the passenger announcement system at one of the city’s train stations on Wednesday.But even as people leave Wuhan, new imported cases in the northern province of Heilongjiang surged to a daily high of 25, fuelled by a continued influx of infected travellers arriving from Russia, which shares a land border with the province. Suifenhe City in Heilongjiang restricted the movement of its citizens on Wednesday in a similar fashion to that of Wuhan.Residents must stay in their residential compounds and one person from a family can leave once every three days to buy necessities and must return on the same day, said state-run CCTV.In Jiaozhou City in the eastern province of Shandong the risk level had risen from low to medium, according to a post on an official website, but it gave no details why. The state-run People’s Daily newspaper warned on Wednesday that opening up of Wuhan “does not mean releasing control”.Wuhan residents have been urged not to leave their neighbourhood, their city and even the province unless absolutely necessary. People from Wuhan arriving in the Chinese capital Beijing will have to undergo two rounds of testing for the virus. China maintains strict screening protocols, concerned about any resurgence in domestic transmissions due to virus carriers who exhibit no symptoms and infected travellers arriving from overseas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-felt-so-good-joy-relief-as-lockdown-in-city-of-heroes-wuhan-ends/story-Evj3g1T03qVNcRN19dcJZM.html

Over 50,000 people in Wuhan caught the virus, and more than 2,500 of them died, according to official figures.But restrictions have eased in recent days as new infections dropped to a trickle. Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, saw just three new confirmed infections in the past 21 days.

More than 10,000 travellers have left the city by plane so far as flights resume at Wuhan Tianhe airport. Flights to Beijing and international locations have not been restored.“I’m very happy, I’m going home today,” migrant worker Liu Xiaomin told Reuters as she stood with her suitcases inside Wuhan’s Hankou railway station, bound for Xiangyang city.Wuhan residents have also been urged not to leave their neighbourhood, their city and even the province unless absolutely necessary. People from Wuhan arriving in the Chinese capital will have to undergo two rounds of testing for the virus. China maintains strict screening protocols, concerned about any resurgence in domestic transmissions due to virus carriers who exhibit no symptoms and infected travellers arriving from overseas. IMPORTED CASESAsymptomatic patients and imported infections have become China’s chief concern.Mainland China’s new coronavirus cases doubled in 24 hours as the number of infected overseas travellers surged, and new asymptomatic infections more than quadrupled.New confirmed cases rose to 62 on Tuesday from 32 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said, the highest since March 25. New imported infections accounted for 59 of the cases.The number of new asymptomatic cases rose to 137 from 30 a day earlier, the health authority said on Wednesday, with incoming travellers accounting for 102 of the latest batch.Chinese authorities do not count asymptomatic cases as part of its tally of confirmed coronavirus infections until patients show symptoms such as a fever or a cough.As of Tuesday, 1,095 asymptomatic patients were under medical observation in China, with 358 of them travellers arriving from abroad. To stem infections from outside its borders, China has slashed the number of international flights and denied entry to virtually all foreigners. It also started testing all international arrivals for the virus this month.Screening of travellers arriving overland was also recently tightened.As of Tuesday, the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 81,802, including 3,333 fatalities, the National Health Commission said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-wuhan-lockdown-ends-but-local-coronavirus-cases-rise-across-country/story-u4dj6jytplLmtLjVnRDRaO.html
08-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: British PM Boris Johnson battles Covid-19, spends second night in intensive care||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was spending a second night in intensive care battling the coronavirus which has infected more than 55,000 across the country and killed nearly 6,200.“He stayed at work for you... now pray at home for him,” The Sun tabloid splashed across its front page Wednesday while the Daily Express said: “Boris ‘will pull through’.”Deputising for Johnson, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he was “confident he’ll pull through, because if there’s one thing I know about this prime minister, he’s a fighter and he’ll be back, leading us through this crisis in short order”.In an update Tuesday evening, the prime minister’s spokesman said his “condition is stable and he remains in intensive care for close monitoring.” He earlier said the 55-year-old Conservative leader was receiving “standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any other assistance” and had not required a ventilator.Johnson is the most high-profile government leader to become infected with Covid-19 and messages of support flooded in from across Britain and the world.He was admitted to intensive care on Monday evening after spending Sunday night in hospital following concerns he still had a cough and high temperature 10 days after being diagnosed with Covid-19.His transfer to intensive care is unprecedented for a prime minister during a national emergency.For many people, it brought home the seriousness of the disease that has so far seen 6,159 deaths in Britain, with a record 786 more reported in a daily update on Tuesday.Despite the record daily death toll, there was more encouraging news with the number of new daily cases remaining at a roughly stable 3,643.In a round of broadcast interviews, senior minister Michael Gove insisted the “work of government goes on”.He later said he was now staying at home after a family member displayed mild coronavirus symptoms.Raab chaired the daily coronavirus meeting in the prime minister’s place on Tuesday.“There is a clear plan... the government and the cabinet are working together to implement that plan,” Johnson’s spokesman said when asked if there was a power vacuum in Britain.The country does not have a formal constitutional role of deputy prime minister, and experts said Raab would need the support of the rest of the cabinet to make any big decisions.The most pressing issue is a review expected next week on whether to continue the nationwide lockdown introduced on March 23 to try to stem the spread of Covid-19.Johnson announced on March 27 that he had coronavirus and went into self-isolation in a flat above his Downing Street office.But on Monday evening he was moved to intensive care in London’s St Thomas’ hospital after his condition worsened.The prime minister has received messages of support from around the world, with US President Donald Trump sending best wishes to his “very good friend” while Russian leader Vladimir Putin said Johnson’s “energy, optimism and sense of humour” would see him through.For some, Johnson’s larger-than-life personality has made his hospitalisation all the more shocking.His biographer Andrew Gimson said Johnson always made him feel upbeat, and “now here he is the stricken one”.“This is an enormous shock, completely unfamiliar territory for all those who know him,” he told BBC radio.Experts said it was not uncommon for coronavirus patients to move to intensive care, but said it showed Johnson’s condition was serious.“There is no doubt this turn of events means Boris Johnson is extremely sick,” said Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London.The British government was criticised for initially refusing to follow other European countries in requiring people to stay home as the virus spread rapidly across the globe.Johnson himself said in early March that he was still shaking hands with people.Two weeks ago, he ordered a nationwide lockdown, but parliament continued to sit for several days after and Westminster became a hotspot for the virus.Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, have both been infected, although they have since recovered.Johnson, who has been prime minister only since July last year, is not known to have any underlying health issues, although he has struggled with his weight.Johnson’s pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, moved out of Downing Street after some staff fell ill.But she said on Saturday she had just spent a week in bed with symptoms, although she has not been tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-british-pm-boris-johnson-battles-covid-19-spends-second-night-in-intensive-care/story-qN8rTWN9AmLefKAAtlPqDN.html
08-04-2020||World||Who is Dominic Raab?||The man deputising for coronavirus-stricken UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a 46-year-old former lawyer, an ardent Brexiteer and a black belt in karate, who until three years ago was not in government but now leads the UK from Downing Street.Educated in Oxford and Cambridge, Dominic Raab was first elected in 2010 from Esher and Walton in Surrey and held a junior ministerial role in the governments led by former PMs David Cameron and Theresa May, before being promoted as the Brexit secretary by May.He resigned in protest against May’s Brexit deal in December 2018 and returned as the foreign secretary when Johnson became the prime minister in July 2019, dealing with India in his key role, particularly during the violence outside the Indian High Commission in late 2019.Raab then interacted with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, deploring the violence outside the mission but also telling MPs in the House of Commons that the Kashmir dispute has implications for human rights.Before entering politics, Raab, son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938, was a lawyer for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and appeared for various clients in international and competition law.He ran against Johnson to become the leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister in 2019, criticising his personality style as ‘bluff and bluster’, but was eliminated in earlier rounds. He is married to Brazilian marketing executive Erika Ray and the couple has two sons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-dominic-raab/story-0eY8Y7MONTSDILO0aWAMNL.html
08-04-2020||World||Covid-19: ‘Wuhan virus’ no more, US and China in truce||Suddenly, it’s no longer the “Wuhan virus.”The United States and China have reached a truce in a vitriolic feud over the coronavirus pandemic, with the two powers each seeing at least a tactical interest in cooling down.President Donald Trump, hardly known for the delicacy of his word choices, has dropped his provocative term “Chinese virus” and held back from criticizing Beijing’s response since a telephone call, on March 26 US time, with his counterpart Xi Jinping.And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- who so insisted on saying “Wuhan virus” that the Group of Seven foreign ministers could not issue a joint statement -- has been talking of cooperation.“We know that this is a global pandemic, and this is the time for every country to work together to resolve that,” Pompeo told reporters Tuesday when asked about China.Beijing infuriated the United States last month when a foreign ministry spokesman spread a conspiracy theory that US troops brought the virus to Wuhan.Cui Tiankai, China’s gentlemanly ambassador to Washington, struck a highly different tone in an op-ed in The New York Times in which he spoke of his affection for Americans and promised China would do “whatever it can to support the United States.”State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus welcomed Cui’s remarks but called, civilly, on China to share virus data and allow free speech.“True cooperation requires transparency and real actions, not just rhetoric,” she said.Not time for ‘blame game’ Whatever the faults in China’s response, many observers saw Trump’s blaming of Beijing as a political ploy as he faces criticism for not acting sooner to stop COVID-19, which has killed more than 12,000 people in the United States.But with medical supplies in dangerously short supply, Trump also needs China, which produces half of the imported masks in the United States.“Washington certainly does not want to alienate Beijing to the point that it bans the sale of medical equipment to the United States,” said Elizabeth Economy, director of Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.“It also reflects a broader sentiment within much of the United States that this is not the time to play an international blame game -- the priority should be on saving American and other lives.”Economy said the Trump administration may also feel that it no longer needs to be as upfront, especially when other countries have also stepped up criticism of Beijing.She doubted that the newfound tone would improve the rest of the relationship, which was already tense before the pandemic.The Trump administration has vowed to confront China on multiple fronts, including on its human rights record and military buildup, with the State Department just Monday criticizing Beijing over the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing trawler.Goal to ‘keep Trump calm’ From China’s standpoint, the friction also has limited benefits, especially when Beijing is seeking to cast itself around the world as a pandemic benefactor.The State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which tracks foreign propaganda, says Chinese state social media have already phased out conspiracy theories blaming the United States.For China, the goal is to “keep Trump calm and to try to prevent unnecessary damage from taking place, and keeping that channel open between you and Trump,” said Douglas Paal, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Paal, a former Asia adviser to presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said that China also had an eye on US elections in November.China’s top priority is to revive global demand for its exports and initially thought that Trump’s re-election would be its best outcome, fearing that the rival Democrats would intervene more forcefully on human rights as well as on trade, Paal said.But Paal was struck by an overall positive portrayal in Chinese state media of Joe Biden, the likely Democratic nominee.Biden as vice president invested heavily in building a relationship with Xi, China’s most powerful leader in decades.China also sees a “historic strategic opportunity” to expand its power as Trump has weakened US alliances, Paal said.“My reading of the official media suggests that they’re less committed to getting Trump re-elected than they were a year ago,” Paal said.“And therefore they don’t have as many ambitions for doing things with Trump. They can stand back and just take care of their own interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-wuhan-virus-no-more-us-and-china-in-truce/story-ET9lBVwvp4WgH8DdE9DzXP.html
08-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Hydroxychloroquine saved life of Michigan state lawmaker, says Donald Trump||A Democratic party’s state legislature from Michigan has credited hydroxychloroquine for saving her life from coronavirus, US President Donald Trump said Tuesday, adding the politician has thanked him for promoting the malaria drug. Amidst an intense debate on side effects of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19, Trump has been actively promoting the drug as an option when there is no viable treatment for the dreaded virus which has so far taken more than 12,800 Americans’ lives, including a record over 2,000 in just one single day on Tuesday.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  Michigan State Representative Karen Whitsett has said she and her husband could save their lives from coronavirus only after they started taking hydroxychloroquine. She asked her doctor to prescribe this after she saw President Trump touting for this drug on a news channel.“This is a woman I thought she was going to die. I mean, she is a Democrat representative, highly respected woman, African-American woman. ...the way she told the story was beautiful. I asked my husband to go and get it. He got it. She is now okay. I mean, she was interviewed last night on television, and she thanked me,” Trump told reporters at the White House.Also read: India partially eases restrictions on export of anti-malarial drug“She thanked me even in a tweet. She said I want to thank President Trump. He saved my life. Look, I don’t say that happens with everybody, but that’s a beautiful story. There are many of those stories. And I say try it (hydroxychloroquine),” he said in response to a question.The US Food and Drug Administration has given temporary approval of the malaria drug in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. It is being experimented on more than 1,500 coronavirus patients in New York. Anticipating it will work, the Trump Administration has procured more than 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine. It has also placed a major order from three Indian companies. After an initial hold on its export, the Indian government has now allowed its export to the US.Responding to questions, Trump said he has been hearing great results about it.But the drug has to be prescribed by a doctor, he added.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“Doctors have to recommend it. I’m not a doctor. I’m just saying we hear great results. And some people say let’s go to a laboratory, let’s test it for a couple of years. No. We got people dying in this country and all over the world right now, not in a couple of years. They’re dying. As we speak there are people dying,” Trump asserted.In an interview to Detroit Free Press Journal, Rep Whitsett said she was tested for the coronavirus and learned Monday her results were positive. She said that “less than two hours” after taking hydroxychloroquine, she began to feel relief, the daily reported. When asked by the Free Press if she thinks Trump may have saved her life, Whitsett said, “Yes, I do” and “I do thank him for that.” “I appreciate that woman. She was great. You have to see it to believe it, the way she spoke. It was like a miracle. And this was not a fan of mine, but she’s a fan of mine now and I’m very honoured by it,” Trump told reporters.

08-04-2020||World||Donald Trump upends coronavirus oversight, removing key official||President Donald Trump is moving aggressively to challenge the authority and independence of agency watchdogs overseeing his administration, including removing the inspector general tasked with overseeing the $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue package that passed Congress with bipartisan support.In four days, Trump has fired one inspector general tied to his impeachment, castigated another he felt was overly critical of the coronavirus response and sidelined a third meant to safeguard against wasteful spending of the coronavirus funds.The actions have sent shock waves across the close-knit network of watchdog officials in government, creating open conflict between a president reflexively resistant to outside criticism and an oversight community tasked with rooting out fraud, misconduct and abuse.The most recent act threatens to upend scrutiny of the $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue effort now underway, setting the stage for a major clash between Trump, government watchdogs and Democrats in Congress who are demanding oversight of the vast funds being pumped into the American economy.“We’re seeing since Friday a wrecking ball across the IG community,” said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a government watchdog group.The latest broadside came Tuesday when the Defense Department revealed that Trump had removed acting inspector general Glenn Fine, an experienced watchdog official, from his role as head of a coronavirus spending oversight board. It was unclear who might replace Fine, who also lost his title as acting inspector general.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Fine’s abrupt removal “part of a disturbing pattern of retaliation by the president against independent overseers.” Trump, she said, is attempting to “disregard critical oversight provisions that hold the administration accountable to the law.”Trump himself shed little light on the decision as he spoke to reporters Tuesday evening, saying he doesn’t know Fine, but had “heard the name.”A day earlier, Trump had asserted without evidence that an inspector general report warning of shortages of coronavirus testing in hospitals was “just wrong” and skewed by political bias. The report surveyed more than 300 U.S. hospitals.“Did I hear the word inspector general? Really?” Trump said when pressed about the Health and Human Services watchdog report.“Give me the name of the inspector general,” Trump demanded, before asking, “Could politics be entered into that?” The acting Heath and Human Services inspector general, Christi A. Grimm, is a career employee who took over the position early this year in an interim capacity. Most dramatic of all was Friday’s late-night firing of Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general who drew Trump’s disdain for notifying Congress of an anonymous whistleblower complaint on Ukraine. The complaint led to the president’s impeachment.Trump defended the firing by complaining that Atkinson had never spoken with him about the complaint, even though Atkinson’s job is to provide oversight independent of the White House.The dismissal prompted an unusual, sharply worded statement from Justice Department watchdog Michael Horowitz, who chairs a council of agency inspectors general and who last month had announced Fine’s appointment to the pandemic oversight board. Diverging from Trump’s condemnation of Atkinson as “terrible,” Horowitz called Atkinson’s handling of the whistleblower complaint an example of “integrity, professionalism, and commitment to the rule of law.” And he pointedly noted that the inspector general community will continue to do its job, including oversight of the more than $2 trillion in coronavirus aid.The role of the modern-day inspector general dates to post-Watergate Washington, when Congress installed offices inside agencies as an independent check against mismanagement and abuse of power. Though inspectors general are presidential appointees, some, like Horowitz, serve presidents of both parties. All are expected to be nonpartisan. Over the years, inspectors general have exposed grave problems through their investigations and humbled, or even embarrassed, agency leaders and presidential administrations. Monday’s Health and Human Services report that angered the president chronicled long waits for tests and supply shortages at hospitals across the country. Horowitz, meanwhile has identified significant flaws in the FBI’s surveillance during the Russia investigation. Trump has praised Horowitz’s findings even as he’s attacked his credibility for not finding evidence of political bias in the Russia probe, pejoratively describing him last December as an Obama appointee. Former Justice Department inspector general Michael Bromwich said Trump perceives inspectors’ general offices to have a “uniquely threatening function within the executive branch, which is to provide independent oversight of governmental functions.” “It’s just something that doesn’t compute for him,” Bromwich added. “He understands the value of loyalty. He doesn’t understand the value of independence because that can conflict with loyalty.” Even before this week, Democrats and good-government advocates feared that Trump was using the coronavirus rescue package to reward loyalty. He generated consternation by selecting Brian Miller, who works in the White House counsel’s office, to a new Treasury Department position overseeing $500 billion in coronavirus aid to industry. Miller has worked at the Justice Department and was inspector general for nearly a decade at the General Services Administration, which has a $20 billion annual budget and oversees thousands of federal contracts. Though he is respected in the oversight community, Miller’s role in the White House counsel’s office is troubling, watchdog groups said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump for nominating “one of his own lawyers,” and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer questioned whether someone who worked for the president could be independent. Those concerns were accelerated Tuesday with word that Trump was replacing the respected inspector general selected to oversee the pandemic board.“The president now has engaged in a series of actions designed to neuter any kind of oversight of his actions and that of the administration during a time of national crisis, when trillions of dollars are being allocated to help the American people,” Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff told The Associated Press.But Trump has made clear his willingness to flout that system, perhaps foreshadowing the chaos of the last week. As lawmakers were in the final stages of drafting what became the $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue package, he declared, “I’ll be the oversight.” And even when he signed it, he attached a statement that says some of the oversight provisions in the law “raise constitutional concerns” and may not be followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-upends-coronavirus-oversight-removing-key-official/story-c3Pey0y1JHdQTflPXQO9tM.html

08-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Boris Johnson listened to his scientists about coronavirus but they were slow to sound the alarm||It was early spring when British scientists laid out the bald truth to their government. It was “highly likely,” they said, that there was now “sustained transmission” of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.If unconstrained and if the virus behaved as in China, up to four-fifths of Britons could be infected and one in a hundred might die, wrote the scientists, members of an official committee set up to model the spread of pandemic flu, on March 2. Their assessment didn’t spell it out, but that was a prediction of over 500,000 deaths in this nation of nearly 70 million.Yet the next day, March 3, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was his cheery self. He joked that he was still shaking hands with everyone, including at a hospital treating coronavirus patients.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “Our country remains extremely well prepared,” Johnson said as Italy reached 79 deaths. “We already have a fantastic NHS,” the national public health service, “fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease.”Alongside him at the Downing Street press conference was Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser and himself an epidemiologist. Whitty passed on the modelling committee’s broad conclusions, including the prediction of a possible 80% infection rate and the consequent deaths. But he played them down, saying the number of people who would be infected was probably “a lot lower” and coming up with a total was “largely speculative.”Also read: British PM Boris Johnson stable, in ‘good spirits’ in ICUThe upbeat tone of that briefing stood in sharp contrast with the growing unease of many of the government’s scientific advisers behind the scenes. They were already convinced that Britain was on the brink of a disastrous outbreak, a Reuters investigation has found.Interviews with more than 20 British scientists, key officials and senior sources in Johnson’s Conservative Party, and a study of minutes of advisory committee meetings and public testimony and documents, show how these scientific advisers concluded early the virus could be devastating.But the interviews and documents also reveal that for more than two months, the scientists whose advice guided Downing Street did not clearly signal their worsening fears to the public or the government. Until March 12, the risk level, set by the government’s top medical advisers on the recommendation of the scientists, remained at “moderate,” suggesting only the possibility of a wider outbreak.Also read: UK mood more sombre as world leaders wish PM Johnson recovery from Covid-19 “You know, there’s a small little cadre of people in the middle, who absolutely did realise what was going on, and likely to happen,” said John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling and a key adviser to the government, known for his work on tracking Ebola. Edmunds was among those who did call on the government to elevate the warning level earlier.From the outset, said Edmunds, work by scientists had shown that, with only limited interventions, the virus would trigger an “overwhelming epidemic” in which Britain’s health service was not going “to get anywhere near being able to cope with it. That was clear from the beginning.”But he said: “I do think there’s a bit of a worry in terms you don’t want to unnecessarily panic people.”Johnson, who himself has sickened with the virus, moved more slowly than the leaders of many other prosperous countries to adopt a lockdown. He has been criticised for not moving more swiftly to organise mass tests and mobilise supplies of life-saving equipment and beds. Johnson was hospitalized on April 5 and moved to intensive care the next day.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage It is too soon to judge the ultimate soundness of the UK’s early response. If history concludes that it was lacking, then the criticism levelled at the prime minister may be that, rather than ignoring the advice of his scientific advisers, he failed to question their assumptions.Interviews and records published so far suggest that the scientific committees that advised Johnson didn’t study, until mid-March, the option of the kind of stringent lockdown adopted early on in China, where the disease arose in December, and then followed by much of Europe and finally by Britain itself. The scientists’ reasoning: Britons, many of them assumed, simply wouldn’t accept such restrictions.The UK scientists were also mostly convinced - and many still are - that, once the new virus escaped China, quarantine measures would likely not succeed. Minutes of technical committees reviewed by Reuters indicate that almost no attention was paid to preparing a programme of mass testing. Other minutes and interviews show Britain was following closely a well-laid plan to fight a flu pandemic - not this deadlier disease. The scientists involved, however, deny that the flu focus ultimately made much difference.Now, as countries debate how to combat the virus, some experts here say, the lesson from the British experience may be that governments and scientists worldwide must increase the transparency of their planning so that their thinking and assumptions are open to challenge.John Ashton, a clinician and former regional director of Public Health England, the government agency overseeing healthcare, said the government’s advisers took too narrow a view and hewed to limited assumptions. They were too “narrowly drawn as scientists from a few institutions,” he said. Their handling of COVID-19, Ashton said, shows the need for a broader approach. “In the future we need a much wider group of independent advisers.”Michael Cates, who succeeded Stephen Hawking as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, is leading an initiative by the Royal Society, the UK’s leading scientific body, to bring modellers in from other scientific disciplines to help understand the epidemic.“Without faulting anyone so far, it’s vital, where there is such a lot at stake, to throw the maximum possible light on the methods, assumptions and data built into our understanding of how this epidemic will develop,” he told Reuters.In a statement to Reuters, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the government was delivering “a science-led action plan” to contain the outbreak. “As the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans and what we learned from previous exercises has helped us to rapidly respond to COVID-19.”A LOW RISK TO THE PUBLICWhen news came from China in January of a new infectious disease, Johnson had reason to believe his country was well prepared. It had some of the world’s best scientists and a well-drilled plan to deal with potentially lethal pandemics. Perhaps, some scientists say in hindsight, the plan made them slow to adapt.For many years, the Cabinet Office - a collection of officials who act as the prime minister’s direct arm to run the government - took the threat of pandemics seriously. Presciently, it rated pandemics as the Number 1 threat to the country, ahead of terrorism and financial crashes.At the centre of planning was a small group of scientists, among them Edmunds. His research group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine runs one of the two computer modelling centres for epidemics that have mostly driven government policy. The other is at nearby Imperial College. Edmunds remembers that early in the outbreak, the data from China were sketchy, in the period “where the Chinese were trying to pretend that this wasn’t transmissible between humans.”Edmunds and his colleague at Imperial, Neil Ferguson, were part of an alphabet soup of committees that fed advice into the Cabinet Office machinery around the prime minister. Both were founders of the flu pandemic modelling committee, known as SPI-M, that produced the March 2 report warning of more than 500,000 deaths. This committee had met together for nearly 15 years.Ferguson did not respond to a request to be interviewed for this article.Edmunds and Ferguson were also part of NERVTAG, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group. Both too were members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as SAGE, that advises the government in times of crisis. SAGE reports directly to Johnson and the government’s main emergency committee, COBRA.At first, when NERVTAG met on January 13, it studied information from China that there was “no evidence of significant human to human transmission” of the new virus, according to minutes of the meeting. The scientists agreed the risk to the UK population was “very low.”The evidence soon changed, but this wasn’t reflected in the official threat level. By the end of January, scientists in China began releasing clinical data. Case studies published in the British medical journal, The Lancet, showed 17% of the first 99 coronavirus cases needed critical care. Eleven patients died. Another Chinese study, in the same magazine, warned starkly of a global spread and urged: “Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.”Edmunds recalled that “from about mid January onwards, it was absolutely obvious that this was serious, very serious.” Graham Medley, a professor of infectious diseases modelling at the London School and chairman of SPI-M, agreed. He said that the committee was “clear that this was going to be big from the first meeting.” At the end of January, his committee moved into “wartime” mode, he said, reporting directly into SAGE.Dr Jon Read, a senior lecturer in biostatistics at the University of Lancaster, also a member of SPI-M, said by the end of January it was apparent the virus had “pandemic potential” and that death rates for the elderly were brutal. “From my perspective within the sort of modelling community, everybody’s aware of this, and we’re saying that this is probably going to be pretty bad,” he said.But the scientists did not articulate their fears forcefully to the government, minutes of committee meetings reveal.On January 21, scientists on NERVTAG endorsed the elevation of the UK risk warning from COVID-19 from “very low” to “low.” SAGE met formally for the first time the following day about the coronavirus threat. So did COBRA, which was chaired by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who would contract the virus himself in late March. He told reporters after the meeting: “The clinical advice is that the risk to the public remains low.”In response to questions from Reuters, the government’s Department of Health declined to clarify how the risk levels are defined or what action, if any, they trigger. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “Increasing the risk level in the UK is a belt and braces measure which allows the government to plan for all future eventualities.”Two days later, China put the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, into a complete lockdown. Hubei, the surrounding province, would follow. But already, 17 passenger flights had flown directly from Wuhan to Britain since the start of 2020, and 614 flights from the whole of China, according to FlightRadar24, a flight-tracking service. That meant thousands of Chinese, some of them potential carriers, had come to Britain. On April 5, scientific adviser Ferguson said he estimated only one-third of infected people reaching Britain had been detected.As they watched China impose its lockdown, the British scientists assumed that such drastic actions would never be acceptable in a democracy like the UK. Among those modelling the outbreak, such stringent counter-measures were not, at first, examined.“We had milder interventions in place,” said Edmunds, because no one thought it would be acceptable politically “to shut the country down.” He added: “We didn’t model it because it didn’t seem to be on the agenda. And Imperial (College) didn’t look at it either.” The NERVTAG committee agreed, noting in its minutes that tough measures in the short term would be pointless, as they “would only delay the UK outbreak, not prevent it.”That limited approach mirrored the UK’s longstanding pandemic flu strategy. The Department of Health declined a request from Reuters for a copy of its updated pandemic plan, without providing a reason. But a copy of the 2011 “UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011,” which a spokesman said was still relevant, stated the “working presumption will be that Government will not impose any such restrictions. The emphasis will instead be on encouraging all those who have symptoms to follow the advice to stay at home and avoid spreading their illness.”According to one senior Conservative Party politician, who was officially briefed as the crisis unfolded, the close involvement in the response to the coronavirus of the same scientific advisers and civil servants who drew up the flu plan may have created a “cognitive bias.”“We had in our minds that Covid-19 was a nasty flu and needed to be treated as such,” he said. “The implication was it was a disease that could not be stopped and that it was ultimately not that deadly.”While the UK was prepared to fight the flu, places in Asia like China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea had built their pandemic plans with lessons learned from fighting the more lethal SARS outbreak that began in 2002, he said. SARS had a fatality rate of up to 14%. As a result, these countries, he said, were more ready to resort to widespread testing, lockdowns and other draconian measures to keep their citizens from spreading the virus.Scientists involved in the UK response disagree that following the government’s flu plan clouded their thinking or influenced the outbreak’s course. The plan had a “reasonable worst case” scenario as devastating as the worst predictions for Covid-19, they note.Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, and a member of the SPI-M committee, said Covid-19 did behave differently than an expected pandemic flu - for example school closures proved to be far less effective in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. But, broadly, “the government has been consistently responsive to changing facts.”By the end of January, the government’s chief medical adviser, Whitty, was explaining to politicians in private, according to at least two people who spoke to him, that if the virus escaped China, it would in time infect the great majority of people in Britain. It could only be slowed down, not stopped. On Jan 30, the government raised the threat level to “moderate” from “low.”The country’s medical officers “consider it prudent for our governments to escalate planning and preparation in case of a more widespread outbreak,” a statement said at the time. Whitty did not respond to questions from Reuters for this article.A TIME TO PREPAREOn the evening of January 31, Boris Johnson sat before a fireplace in 10 Downing Street and told the nation, in a televised address: “This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama.”He was talking of finally delivering Brexit, or what he called “this recaptured sovereignty.” Until that moment, Johnson’s premiership had been utterly absorbed by delivering on that challenge.With Brexit done, Johnson had the chance to focus on other matters the following month, among them the emerging virus threat. But leaving the European Union had a consequence.Between February 13 and March 30, Britain missed a total of eight conference calls or meetings about the coronavirus between EU heads of state or health ministers - meetings that Britain was still entitled to join. Although Britain did later make an arrangement to attend lower-level meetings of officials, it had missed a deadline to participate in a common purchase scheme for ventilators, to which it was invited. Ventilators, vitally important to treating the direst cases of Covid-19, have fallen into short supply globally. Johnson’s spokesman blamed an administrative error.A Downing Street aide told Reuters that from around the end of January, Johnson concentrated his attention increasingly on the coronavirus threat, receiving “very frequent” updates at least once per day from mid February, either in person or via a daily dashboard of cases.In the medical and scientific world, there was growing concern about the threat of the virus to the UK. A report from Exeter University, published on February 12, warned a UK outbreak could peak within four months and, without mitigation, infect 45 million people.That worried Rahuldeb Sarkar, a consultant physician in respiratory medicine and critical care in the county of Kent, who foresaw that intensive care beds could be swamped. Even if disease transmission was reduced by half, he wrote in a report aimed at clinicians and actuaries in mid-February, a coronavirus outbreak in the UK would “have a chance of overwhelming the system.”With Whitty stating in a BBC interview on February 13 that a UK outbreak was still an “if, not a when,” Richard Horton, a medical doctor and editor of the Lancet, said the government and public health service wasted an opportunity that month to prepare quarantine restriction measures and a programme of mass tests, and procure resources like ventilators and personal protective equipment for expanded intensive care.Calling the lost chance a “national scandal” in a later editorial, he would testify to parliament about a mismatch between “the urgent warning that was coming from the frontline in China” and the “somewhat pedestrian evaluation” of the threat from the scientific advice to the government.After developing a test for the new virus by January 10, health officials adopted a centralised approach to its deployment, initially assigning a single public laboratory in north London to perform the tests. But, according to later government statements, there was no wider plan envisaged to make use of hundreds of laboratories across the country, both public and private, that could have been recruited.According to emails and more than a dozen scientists interviewed by Reuters, the government issued no requests to labs for assistance with staff or testing equipment until the middle of March, when many abruptly received requests to hand over nucleic acid extraction instruments, used in testing. An executive at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford said he could have carried out up to 1,000 tests per day from February. But the call never came.“You would have thought that they would be bashing down the door,” said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. By April 5, Britain had carried out 195,524 tests, in contrast to at least 918,000 completed a week earlier in Germany.Nor was there an effective effort to expand the supply of ventilators. The Department of Health told Reuters in a statement that the government started talking to manufacturers of ventilators about procuring extra supplies in February. But it was not until March 16, after it was clear supplies could run out, that Johnson launched an appeal to industry to help ramp up production.Charles Bellm, managing director of Intersurgical, a global supplier of medical ventilation products based outside London, said he has been contacted by more than a dozen governments around the world, including France, New Zealand and Indonesia. But there had been no contact from the British government. “I find it somewhat surprising, I have spoken to a lot of other governments,” he said.Countering such criticism, Hancock, the health minister, said the government is on track to deliver about 10,000 more ventilators in the coming weeks. One reason Britain was behind some countries on testing, he said, was the absence of a large diagnostics industry at the outbreak of the epidemic. “We didn’t have the scale.”GAME OVERIt was during the school half-term holidays in February that frontline doctor Nicky Longley began to realise that early efforts to contain the disease were likely doomed.For weeks now, doctors and public health workers had been watching out for people with flu-like symptoms coming in from China. Longley, an infectious diseases consultant at London’s Hospital for Tropical Diseases, was part of a team that staffed a public health service helpline for those with symptoms. The plan, she said, had been to make all effort to catch every case and their contacts. And “to start with, it looked like it was working.”But then, bad news. First, on Wednesday the 19th of February, came the shock news from Iran of two deaths. Then, on Friday the 21st, came a death in Italy and a bloom of cases in Lombardy and Veneto regions. Britain has close links to both countries. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy that week.“I don’t think anybody really foresaw what was happening in Italy,” Longley said. “And I think, the minute everybody saw that, we thought: ‘This is game over now.’“Until then, Longley said, everyone felt “there was a chance to stamp it out” even though most were sceptical it could be done long-term. But after Iran and Italy, it was obvious containment would not work. The contact tracing continued for a while. But as the cases in London built up, and the volume of calls to the helpline mushroomed, the priority began to shift to clinical care of the serious cases. “At a certain point you have to make a decision about where you put your efforts as a workforce.”Edmunds noted that Iran and Italy had hardly reported a case until that point. “And then, all of sudden you had deaths recorded.” There was a rule of thumb that, in an outbreak’s early stages, for each death there were probably 1,000 cases in a community. “And so it was quite clear that there were at least thousands of cases in Italy, possibly tens of thousands of cases in Italy right then.”Amid the dreadful news from Italy, the scientists at NERVTAG convened by phone that Friday, 21st February. But they decided to recommend keeping the threat level at “moderate,” where it had sat since January 30th. The minutes don’t give a detailed explanation of the decision. Edmunds, who had technical difficulties and couldn’t be heard on the call, emailed afterwards to ask the warning to be elevated to “high,” the minutes revealed. But the warning level remained lower. It’s unclear why.“I just thought, are we still, we still thinking that it’s mild or something? It definitely isn’t, you know,” said Edmunds.A spokesman for the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, didn’t directly respond to Reuters questions about the threat level. Asked whether, with hindsight, the scientists’ approach was the right one, the spokesperson said in a statement that “SAGE and advisers provide advice, while Ministers and the Government make decisions.”HERD IMMUNITYOn Sunday, March 1st, Ferguson, Edmunds and other advisers spent the day with NHS public health service experts trying to work out how many hospital beds and other key resources would be needed as the outbreak exploded. By now, Italian data was showing that a tenth of all infected patients needed intensive care.The following day, pandemic modelling committee SPI-M produced its “consensus report” that warned the coronavirus was now transmitting freely in the UK. That Thursday, March 5, the first death in the UK was announced. Italy, which reached 827 deaths by March 11, ordered a national lockdown. Spain and France prepared to follow suit.Johnson held out against stringent measures, saying he was following the advice of the government’s scientists. He asserted on March 9: “We are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice.”Indeed, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, SAGE, had recommended that day, with no dissension recorded in its summary, that the UK reject a China-style lockdown. SAGE decided that “implementing a subset of measures would be ideal,” according to a record of its conclusions. Tougher measures could create a “large second epidemic wave once the measures were lifted,” SAGE said.On March 12 came a bombshell for the British public. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, announced Britain had moved the threat to UK citizens from “moderate” to “high.” And he said the country had moved from trying to contain the disease to trying to slow its spread. New cases were not going to be tracked at all. “It is no longer necessary for us to identify every case,” he said. Only hospital cases would, in future, be tested for the virus. What had been an undisclosed policy was in the open: beyond a certain point, attempts to completely extinguish the virus would stop.The same day, putting aside his jokey self, Johnson made a speech in Downing Street, flanked by two Union Jacks and evoking the spirit of Winston Churchill’s “darkest hour” address. He warned: “I must level with you, level with the British public - more families, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.”For most Britons, it came as a shock. Several of the next day’s newspapers splashed Johnson’s words on their front pages.Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, who chaired SAGE, said in a BBC interview on March 13 that the plan was to simply control the pace of infection. The government had, for now, rejected what he called “eye-catching measures” like stopping mass gatherings such as football games or closing schools. The “aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not to suppress it completely.” Most people would get the virus mildly, and this would build up “herd immunity” which, in time, would stop the disease’s progress.But by now, the country was rebelling. Major institutions decided to close. After players began to get infected, the professional football leagues suspended their games. As Johnson still refused to close schools and ban mass gatherings, the Daily Mirror’s banner headline, summing up a widespread feeling, asked on March 13: “Is It Enough?”The catalyst for a policy reversal came on March 16 with the publication of a report by Neil Ferguson’s Imperial College team. It predicted that, unconstrained, the virus could kill 510,000 people. Even the government’s “mitigation” approach could lead to 250,000 deaths and intensive care units being overwhelmed at least eight times over.Imperial’s prediction of over half a million deaths was no different from the report by the government’s own pandemic modelling committee two weeks earlier. Yet it helped trigger a policy turn-around, both in London and in Washington, culminating seven days later in Johnson announcing a full lockdown of Britain. The report also jarred the US administration into tougher measures to slow the virus’ spread.Ferguson was now in isolation himself after catching the virus. Testifying by video link to a committee in Parliament, he explained why he and other scientific advisers had shifted from advocating partial social-distancing measures to warning that without a rigorous shutdown, the NHS would be overwhelmed. The reason, he said, lay in data coming out of Italy that showed large numbers of patients required critical care.“The revision was that, basically, estimates of the proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, which is only done in a critical care unit, roughly doubled,” he said.Edmunds had a different explanation for the policy shift.What allowed Britain to alter course, said Edmunds, was a lockdown in Italy that “opened up the policy space” coupled with new data. First came a paper by Edmunds’ own London School team that examined intermittent lockdowns, sent to the modelling committee on March 11 and validated by Edinburgh University. Ferguson’s revised Imperial research followed.Woolhouse, the Edinburgh professor, confirmed the sequence.Edmunds said these new studies together had demonstrated that if the British government imposed a lengthy period of tougher measures, perhaps relaxed periodically, then the size of the epidemic could be substantially reduced.Still, without a vaccine or effective treatments, it’s going to be hard to avoid a substantial part of the British population getting infected, said Edmunds. “Until you get to a vaccine, there is no way of getting out of this without certainly tens of thousands of deaths,” he said. “And probably more than that.”Now subject to intense public scrutiny, the modelling teams at universities across Britain continue to work on different scenarios for how the world can escape the virus’s clutches. According to Medley, the chairman of the SPI-M pandemic modelling committee, no one now doubts, for all the initial reservations, that a lockdown was essential in Britain.Medley added: “At the moment we don’t know what’s going to happen in six months. All we know is that unless we stop transmission now, the health service will collapse. Yep, that’s the only thing we know for sure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-boris-johnson-listened-to-his-scientists-about-coronavirus-but-they-were-slow-to-sound-the-alarm/story-ixQ75DIBt1zP0YxZaGiSWO.html
08-04-2020||World||New York coronavirus deaths exceed 4,000, topping toll for 9/11 attacks||New York City’s death toll from the coronavirus rose past 4,000 on Tuesday, eclipsing the number killed at the World Trade Center on 9/11. In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson lay in intensive care, believed to be the first major world leader hospitalized with the virus.The twin developments came even as the crisis seemed to be easing or at least stabilizing, by some measures, in New York and parts of Europe, though health officials warned people at nearly every turn not to let their guard down. After 76 days, China finally lifted the lockdown on Wuhan, the city of 11 million where the outbreak began.COVID-19’s toll in New York City is now more than 1,000 deaths higher than that of the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil, which killed 2,753 people in the city and 2,977 overall, when hijacked planes slammed into the twin towers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001.New York state recorded 731 new coronavirus deaths, its biggest one-day jump yet, for a statewide toll of nearly 5,500, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.“A lot of pain again today for many New Yorkers,” he said.But in an encouraging sign, the governor said hospital admissions and the number of those receiving breathing tubes are dropping, indicating that measures taken to force people to keep their distance from one another are succeeding.And alarming as the one-day increase in deaths might sound, the governor said that’s a “lagging indicator,” reflecting people who had been hospitalized before this week. Over the past several days, in fact, the number of deaths in New York appeared to be leveling off.“You see that plateauing — that’s because of what we are doing. If we don’t do what we are doing, that is a much different curve,” Cuomo said. “So social distancing is working.”Still, 6-foot social distancing has become impossible at times in the city’s subway system.With service drastically reduced, essential workers are encountering some busy trains as they head to their jobs. Photos taken in Brooklyn showed riders sitting or standing within a few inches of each other, some not wearing face masks.Across the U.S., the death toll topped 12,000, with around 380,000 confirmed infections. Some of the deadliest hot spots were Detroit, New Orleans and the New York metropolitan area, which includes parts of Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut. New Jersey recorded over 1,200 dead, most of them in the northern counties where many residents commute into New York City.In London, the 55-year-old Johnson was in stable condition and conscious at a hospital, where he was receiving oxygen but was not on a ventilator, officials said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was designated to run the country in the meantime.“For all of us in Cabinet, he is not just our boss. He’s also a colleague and he’s also our friend,” Raab said. “And I’m confident he’ll pull through because if there’s one thing I know about this prime minister, he’s a fighter.”Deaths in Britain reached nearly 6,200, after a one-day increase of almost 800.President Donald Trump trained his anger at the World Health Organization and threatened to freeze U.S. funding for it, saying the international group had “missed the call” on the pandemic and that it was “very China-centric.”Throughout his presidency, Trump has voiced skepticism toward many international organizations and has repeatedly heaped scorn on the WHO. In its most recent budget proposal in February, his administration called for slashing the U.S. contribution to the WHO from an estimated $122.6 million to $57.9 million.Trump suggested the WHO had gone along with Beijing’s efforts months ago to minimize the severity of the outbreak. The WHO has praised China for its transparency on the virus, even though some public health experts regard the country’s figures with suspicion.“They should have known and they probably did know,” Trump said of WHO officials.On Wall Street, a strong rally propelled by signs that the outbreak may be leveling off in some of the hard-hit parts of the world evaporated after the price of crude oil suddenly fell. Stocks ended the day slightly lower.Elsewhere around the globe, Chinese authorities ended the lockdown on Wuhan, allowing residents to travel in and out of the sprawling industrial city. Residents must use a cellphone app showing that they are healthy and have not been in recent contact with anyone confirmed to have the virus.China, which officially recorded more than 82,000 infections and over 3,300 deaths, listed no new cases on Tuesday.In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a month-long state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures because of a spike of infections in the country with the world’s oldest population. The order will close hostess bars and other night entertainment.“My lifestyle will change. These are difficult times” said Yoshiyuki Kataoka, 44, a nightlife industry worker. “Maybe I’ll become a recluse.”In some European hot spots, as in New York, authorities saw signs that the outbreak was turning a corner, based on slowdowns in new deaths and hospitalizations.In Spain, new deaths Tuesday rose to 743 and infections climbed by 5,400 after five days of declines, but the increases were believed to reflect a weekend backlog. Authorities said they were confident in the downward trend.In Italy, with over 16,500 deaths, authorities appealed to people ahead of Easter weekend not to lower their guard and to abide by a lockdown now in its fifth week, even as new cases dropped to a level not seen since the early weeks of the outbreak.“Finally it seems we are beginning to see a lessening of new cases,” said Giovanni Rezza, director of the infectious-disease division of Italy’s national health institute.In France, the number of dead passed the bleak milestone of 10,000, climbing to more than 10,300, said Jerome Salomon, national health director.“We are in the epidemic’s ascendant stage,” he said. “We have not yet reached the peak.” But he offered a glimpse of hope, saying the virus rate is ”slowing a little.”U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said that if Americans continue to practice social distancing for the rest of April, “we will be able to get back to some sense of normalcy.”“I want the American people to know there is a light at the end of this tunnel, and we feel confident that if we keep doing the right thing for the rest of this month, that we can start to slowly reopen in some places,” he said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”One lockdown exception in the U.S. was Wisconsin, which asked hundreds of thousands of voters to ignore a stay-at-home order to participate in its presidential primary Tuesday.Lines were particularly long in Milwaukee, the state’s largest city and a Democratic stronghold, where just five of 180 traditional polling places were open. Many voters across the state did not have facial coverings in line with public health recommendations.Worldwide, about 1.4 million people have been confirmed infected and over 79,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The true numbers are almost certainly much higher, because of limited testing, different rules for counting the dead and deliberate underreporting by some governments.For most people, the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia. About 300,000 people have recovered worldwide, by Johns Hopkins’ count.One of the main models on the outbreak, from the University of Washington, is projecting about 82,000 U.S. deaths through early August, with the highest number on April 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-coronavirus-deaths-exceed-4-000-topping-toll-for-9-11-attacks/story-ecHv90S0gttCtMZBdG2IjI.html
08-04-2020||World||Paris bans daytime jogging as coronavirus deaths hit new high||Paris on Tuesday banned daytime jogging to keep people from bending anti-coronavirus lockdown rules as France breached 10,000 deaths due to the outbreak.Other cities also announced stricter restrictions, some controversial, on the day top health official Jerome Salomon told journalists 10,328 people had died of COVID-19 in France since March 1.Of these, 7,091 had perished in hospitals -- 597 in the last 24 hours -- and 3,237 in old age homes, Salomon said, warning “the epidemic is continuing its progression.” “We are in the ascending phase of the epidemic, even if it is slowing a bit,” he said, adding “we have not yet reached the peak.” Senior government officials warned it was too early to think of lifting the nationwide lockdown which entered into force on March 17 and is set to run until April 15, for now.Interior Minister Christophe Castaner has urged municipal officials to toughen restrictions on movement if necessary, and Paris announced it would enforce a ban on individual outdoor sports between the hours of 10:00 am and 07:00 pm starting Wednesday.Under the nationwide orders, people can leave home only for essential purposes, which include a solo walk or run within a one-kilometre (0.6-mile) radius of home.But amid a spell of sunny spring weather, large groups of Parisians were seen running, walking and congregating over the weekend, even as police stepped up patrols and already overstretched hospitals grappled with an influx of patients.“Every excursion avoided aids the fight against the epidemic,” Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and police chief Didier Lallement said in a statement Tuesday announcing the partial jogging ban.Paris and other cities have already closed public parks and gardens as part of the nationwide lockdown that requires people to carry a document justifying any excursion from the home.Those caught without the document risk a fine starting at 135 euros ($147).In the north of France, the mayor of Marcq-en-Baroeul has made spitting in public, coughing or sneezing without covering one’s face, and throwing used masks and gloves in the street punishable by a fine of 68 euros.But France’s Human Rights League said Tuesday it would take the mayor to court for what it considered a violation of fundamental human liberties.And the Atlantic coastal resort city of Biarritz on Tuesday overturned a two-minute limit it had set for people to spend on public benches after widespread criticism.Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told parliament, meanwhile, that “the period of confinement will continue.” The lockdown “is difficult for many French people, I am fully aware of this. But it is essential if we do not wish to find ourselves in an even worse situation than the one we are experiencing today,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-bans-daytime-jogging-as-coronavirus-deaths-hit-new-high/story-QzO5YyDZaYBvhTFeIr7TPL.html

According to Trump, the WHO “seems to be very biased toward China. That’s not right.” His comments built on an earlier statement on Twitter in which he accused the WHO of being “very China centric.” Trump asked why the WHO had given “such a faulty recommendation,” apparently referring to the UN body’s advice against curtailing international travel to stop the virus which first spread from China.Also read| Blood transfusion from those who have recovered from Covid-19 may help“Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on,” Trump wrote, referring to his decision to ban travel from the country. China faces criticism in Washington, particularly from Republicans, over the way it handled the pandemic and Trump has expressed doubt over the accuracy of Chinese statistics for cases and deaths.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayHowever, Trump himself has been widely criticized for initially downplaying the virus, which he likened to an ordinary flu and said was under control in the United States, before later accepting that it was a national emergency.More than 12,000 Americans have now died from Covid-19.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-donald-trump-accuses-who-of-bias-toward-china-threatened-to-put-hold-on-us-funding/story-m1N59D5SbtFeiNs6I80bAP.html

Pakistan has to comply with the 13 remaining items in the action plan that cover eight key categories. It has to demonstrate that relevant authorities are cooperating to identify and take enforcement action against illegal money or value transfer services and also prove the implementation of cross-border currency controls, the report said.It also has to demonstrate that law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terror financing activity and that such investigations and prosecutions target designated individuals and entities, the report added.Outstanding action areas also include effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all terrorists designated under UN Security Council resolutions 1267 and 1373, including preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets, and prohibiting access to funds and financial services.Pakistan will also have to show it is acting against violations of the UN sanctions by depriving sanctioned terrorists of their resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-meet-in-beijing-pakistan-s-action-on-terror-funding-to-be-reviewed/story-A8ahjUwxznPrNS99UrjpbJ.html

08-04-2020||India||Abrupt end to curbs not possible: PM||“It’s not possible to lift the lockdown abruptly,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a meeting with the floor leaders of political parties in Parliament in the strongest message yet from the government that the nationwide, three-week lockdown it clamped to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will not be lifted in its entirety when it ends on April 14. “Nobody is saying that lockdown should be lifted. I will talk again to CMs. But as of now, the mood is that entire lockdown lifting is not possible. For us, lockdown is the only way to save our people,” Modi added in the video conference. The Prime Minister is scheduled to have a video conference with chief ministers on Saturday, his third such meeting with the heads of state governments since India declared the lockdown starting on March 25. Over the past 72 hours, several chief ministers have called for at least a partial extension of the lockdown; and the group of ministers headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh that is leading India’s response to the pandemic has also recommended that even if the lockdown was lifted, the travel bans must remain.The floor leaders who attended the meeting were Congress’s Ghulam Nabi Azad and Adhir Chowdhury, DMK’s TR Balu, Trinamool’s Sudip Bandopadhyay, Samajwadi Party’s Ramgopal Yadav, Shiv Sena’s Vinayak Raut, Lok Jan Shakti Party’s Chirag Paswan, CPI (M)’s Elamaram Kareem, Biju Janata Dal’s Pinaki Misra, among others. In his meeting with the floor leaders, Modi also said that while there is tremendous pressure on resources (during this lockdown period), India is one of the few countries where the spread of the coronavirus is still under control. India ended Wednesday with 5,885 infections and 178 deaths. “I am regularly talking to chief ministers , district magistrates and experts. Nobody is telling me to lift the lockdown. We need strict rules to maintain social distancing.”“India has a social emergency-like situation. In this situation, we have to take unprecedented decisions from time to time. And today, I am grateful to all of you for taking all the decisions in a positive approach, keeping in mind the requirement of the country. In the future too, we may have to take such hard decisions,” Modi added. Floor leaders present in the meeting raised the issue of the suspension of the MP Local Area Development Scheme for two years, suggested setting up a task force comprising Union ministers and chief ministers, give financial packages to the states, scrap the ₹25,000 crore central vista redevelopment and said that food should also be available to those who do not have Aadhaar or ration cards.The suspension of the scheme has become politically controversial, with opposition MPs saying that this will prevent aid from reaching those who need it most in their constituencies. Trinamool Congress floor leader Sudip Bandopadhyay said, “We are ready to forgo our salaries. But the MPs get a very good opportunity to work at the grassroot level through the MPLAD fund.”On Monday, the Union Cabinet suspended the scheme for two years, and said the amount (roughly ~5,900 crore) would be transferred to the Consolidated Fund of India and spent on India’s effort to fight Covid-19. Several floor leaders demanded that the government must pump in money to the states as they are in the forefront of the fight against Covid pandemic. While Bandopadhyay requested Modi to release the dues including those from the GST collection and sought a higher fiscal limit under the FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) act, CPIM’s Elamaram Kareem demanded an increase in the debt ceiling as a % of states’ GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product). Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, called for a special financial package for the most affected states.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar raised the Nizamuddin Markaz issue and insisted that it is not appropriate to blame any community.DMK leader TR Baalu said the financial measures announced by the central government so far were inadequate and urged Modi to release ₹10,000 in two equal instalments for all the BPL families. The CPIM wanted ₹5,000 distributed in all Jandhan accounts to help the poor.Azad also suggested that top priority should be accorded to providing adequate personal protection equipment (PPE), ventilators and masks besides insurance cover for doctors, nurses and health workers who are facing acute shortage of such gears.The Prime Minister also hailed the unprecedented unity that has emerged across the political spectrum over the crisis. “I want to thank the state governments once again. Centre and states are working in tandem keeping in mind the requirements and that is the reason that the states, the Centre and the political parties are working together without any prejudice.”“The Prime Minister told the meeting he is happy that parties have risen above politics and come together in national interest in this hour of crisis and assured that he will try and implement the suggestions put forth by various leaders,” Azad said.Modi said: “Be it the person in lowest or the highest strata of the society, everyone is doing their bit to fight against corona. It’s a big thing in this country of 130 crore people. The sense of belonging which the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi used to speak of, today, we can see its deep impact in our daily lives.” We have been trying to take quick decisions and today India is one of the few countries in the world where spread of this virus is still under control. We also have to keep in mind that every day, situations are changing,” he said.“As per our communications with the districts and also the experience of the global situation teaches us that for us, lockdown is the only way for us to save the lives of our citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abrupt-end-to-curbs-not-possible-pm/story-shmJk7uLRjkgoIrWXTgumM.html
08-04-2020||India||Bengal’s beedi-making hub reels from lockdown shock||Berhampore: A day after chief minister Mamata Banerjee exempted the state’s beedi industry from lockdown, saying it was question of livelihood for millions, nothing changed in Murshidabad district, Bengal’s biggest beedi-making hub.The ongoing 21-day lockdown has hurt the 1.5 million people in the district who depend, directly or indirectly, on the bidi industry . They have been living off their savings, and food provided by the state and non-government organisations. In certain pockets of Murshidabad, entire families depend on beedi making. Workers are paid Rs 152 for every thousand beedis they roll. The raw material are supplied by factory owners through ‘munshsis’ (agents). The munshsis also collect the beedis. There are around 100 factories in the district’s Jangipur sub-division alone. On Wednesday, the munshsis were nowhere to be seen, said beedi makers who were enthused by Banerjee’s announcement. Anwar Hussain, a beedi maker at Uttar Chachonda village said: “We thought things would change after the chief minister’s announcement. But today we came to know that production will not start. I don’t know how I will run my family.”Approximately 2.2 million people in West Bengal are directly associated with beedi making and 95% of the total production is sent to other states, said people in the beedi trade. With no way to transport beedis across borders, most factories remain shut. Abul Hasnat Khan, president, West Bengal State Beedi and Tobacco Labourers Federation said, “The chief minister’s announcement will help less than 1% of the bidi makers. She did not consider the fact that all big factories send their products to other states. With no trains and interstate transport, the consignments cannot be sent.”“Moreover, the big factories employ around 250 people. It is not possible to start production maintaining social distance,” Khan added.Niponjeet Biswas, owner of Jeet Bidi Factory sees another problem.  “Most of the factory owners have adequate tobacco and leaves of kendu trees (in which the tobacco is rolled) in stock but we need regular supply of coal to toast the beedis. We need packaging labels, thread. Also, it is literally impossible to store the beedis for a long time. If we can’t sell what is the point in starting production?”Trinamool Congress Lok Sabha member from Jangipur , Khalilur Rahaman, who is in the beedi trade said, “If we cannot sell in other states it is impossible to start production. We are trying to find a solution to honour the initiative of our chief minister and help the poor labourers.”Nazir Hossain, a munshi, said, “We were optimistic about Banerjee’s announcement. After talking to several factory owners I have realised that production will not start till the Union government allows movement of trucks from West Bengal to other states.”“Several beedi-laden trucks from West Bengal are stranded in other states due to the lockdown. No beedi merchant with sizeable business will start production till the Centre gives its nod,” Hossain added.Secretary of Aurangabad-Dhulian Beedi Merchants Association Raj Kumar Jain said: “We welcome the much needed initiative of our chief minister. A lion’s share of Murshidabad’s beedis are sent to Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi, Assam, Haryana and states in south India but neither the Centre nor any of these states have allowed any exemption for production or transportation of beedis. Also, the state administration has not issued travel passes for munshis and labourers. Without passes they cannot move even inside the district.”Minister of state for labour Jakir Hossain, who owns a beedi factory said, “Our chief minister has taken a humanitarian decision for the sake of millions. I will appeal to the Centre to reduce the goods and services tax (GST) on beedis and allow consignments to be transported to other states.” The GST on total sale value of both beedis and cigarettes is 28%, Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-beedi-making-hub-reels-from-lockdown-shock/story-2cbA9FLOEhjIbjdfr7zVWK.html
08-04-2020||India||Cannot decide trends on absolute numbers, says ICMR||New Delhi: The higher number of deaths related to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reported from Maharashtra could be a “chance event” as the number of overall fatalities is small, and a trend cannot be decided merely on the basis of mere absolute numbers, said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Wednesday.As of Wednesday Maharashtra had reported 1,135 cases and 72 deaths while the second worst-hit state Tamil Nadu 738 infections and eight fatalities. Overall India has recorded 178 deaths and 5,872 cases. “You cannot merely decide on the basis of absolute numbers. That is not the right way,” said Dr RR Gangakhedkar, the chief of epidemiology and communicable diseases wing of the ICMR, which is India’s top medical research body.The Union health ministry separately said the government is taking aggressive measures wherever required in Maharashtra in view of a large number of cases being reported. “In Pune and Kolba region, door-to-door screenings are being conducted. About 35 square kilometre area is being covered to look for people with co-morbid conditions and those with any travel history. The same screening strategy is being used in Kerala’s Pathamuttom village. The government has come up with a detailed technical plan for different stages of Covid-19 management,” said the ministry’s joint secretary, Lav Agarwal.He added if the number of cases is rising, the government’s preparations are also increasing proportionally to break the chain of Covid-19 transmissions. “Our technical war room is monitoring the situation very closely, and is equipped to track even ambulances on a real-time basis, apart from keeping a watch on people under home quarantine etc.”Agarwal denied reports about the shortage of the anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, in the country, calling them untrue. “There is no shortage of the drug in the country. It will be made available to whoever needs it. Those being given the medicine currently by the government is just a section of people. It is not recommended for everyone, and should not be taken without prescription,” said Agarwal.India has approved the use of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis to protect health workers and close contacts of Covid-19 patients. A small placebo-controlled clinical trial in China demonstrated the anti-malarial drug shortened the duration and reduced the severity of cough, fever and pneumonia in patients with mild and moderate forms of the Covid-19 disease. This has majorly boosted the global demand for hydroxychloroquine of which India is the world’s biggest producer. India has partially eased restrictions on the export of hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol to fulfil existing orders and to meet the needs of neighbouring countries but only after building its own stockpile. The Union human resource development ministry has also developed training modules to orient doctors, nurses, paramedics, technicians, volunteers being deployed for the Covid-19 related surveillance and management. “All these people will be provided with necessary resources on field. This is a part of the government’s larger preparedness plan,” Agarwal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-decide-trends-on-absolute-numbers-says-icmr/story-gVJQcItzLUVGPE7hcYfVZI.html
08-04-2020||India||CII calls for fiscal support worth ₹4.5 lakh crore for Indian industries||New Delhi: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has called for a fiscal support package equivalent to 2-3% of gross domestic product (GDP), or around Rs. 4.0-to- 4.5 lakh crore for industry in addition to the Rs 1.7 lakh crore the government has earmarked to ease economic distress caused to the poor by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The industry grouping asked the government not to expend its firepower all at once given the likelihood that the crisis will not go away anytime soon. CII, which also addressed ways to restart the economy after the national lockdown imposed to check the spread of the pandemic ends, urged the government to set up an empowered group of ministers to plan, review and address implementation challenges. Inter-departmental task forces led by the chief secretaries should be formed at the state level too for the same job, it said in recommendations submitted to the government . “Since we are not going to see the end of the crisis soon, the government should not spend all its firepower at once. The coronavirus pandemic has been the biggest disruption to the world economy ever since the 2008-09 global financial crisis,” CII director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said. “While India entered the 2008 crisis coming off years of strong growth, the story is different this time around, with the economy going through a slowdown pre Covid. It is our considered judgement that the impact is severely adverse and the best estimates of GDP growth for the current fiscal would be no more than about 2% with a downward bias,” Banerjee said.Banejree said the government should extend additional support to “people at the bottom of the pyramid” thorough cash transfers and . Support to industry could come through the banking system, he said. The Covid-19 outbreak and the three-week nationwide lockdown enforced to promote social distancing and prevent its spread is expected to take a heavy toll on Asia’s third-largest economy, which had already been in the midst of a slowdown when the pandemic hit. In the annual budget presented on February 1, the government estimated that economic growth in the year to March 2020 would slow to 5%, the slowest pace in 11 years, from 6.8% the previous year  The economic crisis will affect the lowest strata and the informal sector in the economic pyramid disproportionately, the CII said in its report to the government. The industry grouping asked the government to provide cash transfer amounting to Rs 2 lakh crore to Jan Dhan account holders “Considering the size of the population and very little social security for the unorganised sector, the impetus required will be much larger than 2% of GDP,” said Sandeep Shah, partner, NA Shah Associates LLP,. “Countries like the UK are talking about +10% of GDP impetus. The impetus will have to be in areas of making goods and services cheaper in the hands of consumers by substantially reducing the GST {Goods and Services Tax}, excise duty on petroleum/ electricity. The state governments will also have to chip in by reducing the stamp duty and fees for real estate.” “The impetus cannot be incremental but something which will allow all round economic activities. Any lopsided growth will accentuate the problem of unemployment,” he added..To address the immediate economic distress in the wake of the lockdown, and ensure food and cash reaches the marginalised segments of society, the government announced Rs 1.7 lakh crore package last month,under a new scheme called the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana (PMGKBY).Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a series of measures, which focused on additional food transfers at no cost, additional cash for vulnerable segments, concessions on government schemes aimed at helping households reduce their expenditure, and support those in the frontline of the battle against the pandemic. The primary beneficiaries of these measures include those below the poverty line, farmers, women, elderly citizens, the physically challenged, and workers in both the unorganised and organised sectors.The CII has undertaken a contact programme with over 8,000 member-companies, directly and indirectly, to assess the issues faced by them and the overall economic impact of the pandemic and the consequent shutdown that started on March 25.“Our estimates are that the economy would need a credit expansion of 14-15 %. Additionally, support through banks would allow the government a leverage of 5-6 times, mitigating the fiscal impact,” Banerjee said. The support should include working capital enhancement and support for payment of wages to all industry and special reconstruction terms loans for micro, small and medium enterprises(MSMEs) and stressed sectors.The CII has also asked the government to ensure safeguard measures for the migrant workforce to return to work. For the re-start to be organized, safe and sustainable, various issues related to health and safety, logistics, migrant workers and coordination between various agencies of the government also need to be addressed, it said.To get the migrant workers, who have left the cities and gone back to their homes in the countryside, back to their places of work, the government should undertake an aggressive messaging campaign on the preparedness of the official machinery and industry for the restart, the CII said. It should facilitate their return through issue of e-passes and by arranging special transport. It has also recommended a Covid-19 insurance scheme for migrant workers for three months, saying a part of the cost for it could be borne by the government and part by industry.For addressing supply hurdles, the CII said that the government needs to facilitate the seamless movement of goods and services across the country and key interventions need to be taken. Seamless transportation of goods and material across the country is a prerequisite for a smooth restart, it said. This is also harvest time and the logistics sector has a key role in transporting farm produce across India. “Drivers and other workers engaged in the sector should be issued e-passes by local authorities, those with e-passes should be allowed to travel to their place of work. Special transport could be arranged from clusters from where large number of workers come, to clusters where they come to work, with all the safety protocols in place. Dhabas on highways should be allowed to open, so that the required basic amenities are available to the truck drivers en route,” it said. Hindustan Times reported that nearly 600,000 truck drivers transporting supplies had been stranded en route since the first week of the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cii-calls-for-fiscal-support-worth-4-5-lakh-crore-for-indian-industries/story-UBMxw1SPMloQxb2QLpomXN.html

When I asked them to wear masks to as a preventive measure to avoid spread of Covid-19, they threatened me of with dire consequences. Around 9 pm, Sandeep’s father Sunil alias Sunila and Manjeet Kumar of our village intercepted me on the outskirts of the village and Sunil pumped bullets into my chest,” he said. Sadar Jind SHO Dinesh Kumar said Deepak was undergoing treatment at PGIMS, Rohtak.“We have registered a case of attempt to murder against Sunil, Manjeet, Sandeep and Deepak Kumar. A hunt is on to nab the accused,” he said. Haryana has so far reported 147 positive cases of coronavirus.On Wednesday, the Uttar Pradesh and Delhi governments ordered residents to compulsorily wear masks while going out of their houses. In Maharashtra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) made wearing masks mandatory for citizens of Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-haryana-s-jind-man-shot-at-for-telling-sarpanch-s-son-to-wear-mask/story-Sha2b9JIK3BFzyYXDWZ8xK.html
08-04-2020||India||IIL-Hyd joins in as Indian scientists race to developCovid-19 vaccine||Indian scientists are scrambling to develop a vaccine against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with the Hyderabad-based Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL), a subsidiary of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), joining the frantic global race. IIL has partnered with Australia’s Griffith University to develop the vaccine through an “approach” that looks promising, according to the organisation.“This is a significant cross-continental collaboration,” the chairman of the NDDB and IIL Dilip Rath told HT. Scientists from IIL and Griffith University will jointly develop a “live attenuated Sars- CoV-2 vaccine” or Covid-19 vaccine using the “latest codon de-optimization technology”A live-attenuated vaccine is one where the target virus is considerably weakened but still alive, just enough to trigger immunity but cause no harm. “Codon de-optimization technology” is a popular method of developing vaccines that allows manipulation of the constituents of a virus’s genetic code called “codons”, according to the US Centers of Disease Control. IIL is a major entity in the human vaccine market in the country, supplying human paediatric and rabies vaccines. IIL is also a supplier of paediatric vaccines to the country’s state-run universal immunization programme.In India, vaccine manufacturer Bharat Biotech is working on developing an intra-nasal drop vaccine against Sars – CoV-2 in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin-Madison and vaccine firm FluGen. The Pune-based Serum Institute is also working on a coronavirus disease vaccine.Public institutions and private firms in the US, China and Europe are already conducting early trials on a vaccine. “Development of a Covid-19 vaccine has become a matter of national pride. It’s conceptually not a very difficult thing to achieve but takes time,” said Dr Ashok Kayal, a former professor of neurology at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. According to Rath, IIL is looking at the “codon de-optimization technology” because scientists from both India and Australia see it to be promising for developing a vaccine for “prophylactic, active, single dose immunization against coronavirus in humans, with an enhanced safety profile”. The vaccine is expected to provide long-lasting protection, he said.In an email response, Professor Suresh Mahalingam of Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, said: “As this vaccine will be a live attenuated vaccine, it is expected to be highly effective by providing very strong cellular and antibody immune responses against the virus.” A live-attenuated vaccine has a proven track record for economical, large-scale manufacturing and a well-known regulatory approval pathway, Mahalingam added.Most scientists agree that the coronavirus crisis will come to an end either with a costly so-called “herd immunity” or with a vaccine. Herd immunity occurs when a population develops collective immunity against a disease by simply battling it but this stage comes after the disease strikes about 80% of the population, potentially causing thousands of deaths. New technology in genomics and greater international coordination have resulted in speedier discovery of vaccines. Yet, it remains a long-drawn out process because vaccines undergo rigorous testing in animals and humans. After completing the research, the vaccine strain will be transferred to IIL and the vaccine maker will work with India’s drug regulator, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, to conduct clinical trials.IIL is already working with Griffith University for development of a Zika virus vaccine, which is currently at pre-clinical toxicology testing stage. The codon de-optimization technology has been successfully employed to reduce the virulence of several RNA viruses including Enterovirus C (Poliovirus), HIV type 1 and Zika virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iil-hyd-joins-in-as-indian-scientists-race-to-developcovid-19-vaccine/story-kzBFEMpebB8vVrBLf7i59K.html

08-04-2020||India||As UP seals 105 Covid-19 hotspots in 15 districts, Noida residents resort to panic buying||As news began to trickle in that 15 districts in Uttar Pradesh were going to be sealed to check the spread of coronavirus, long queues began to form outside major grocery shops across the Gautam Budh Nagar district with people rushing to stock up essential items on Wednesday.In the afternoon, the UP government ordered that 15 district which have reported most cases will be sealed to contain any further spread of Covid-19.However, even before the terms of ‘complete lockdown’ could be clarified by officials, people began to rush to the nearest grocery shops in another round of panic buying.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.“A news channel was showing that there will be complete lockdown till April 30. That is why we came here to buy at least enough milk and vegetables to last us for the next few days,” said an elderly woman outside a grocery shop in Noida’s Sector 75.People could be seen stocking up on essentials. The situation was similar to what had happened on the night of March 23 when the Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the 21-day lockdown. Social distancing took a backseat particularly in rural belts of Barola, Harola, Salarpur, Gheja etc and Greater Noida where people rushed out as soon as the news came.Without any guidelines, even shop owners started panicking. A pharmacy owner in Sector 75 was seen urging customers to buy all they needed as the shop will also be closed during the period the district will be sealed.“We have even reduced the prices of some commodities to clear out stocks before the shop is closed so that our products sell out and are not wasted,” said the owner of a vegetable and fruit shop.People also blamed the spread of unverified and uncirculated news on social media for the panic.“I had not even switched on the TV. My wife just said that we would be out of potatoes soon so I should get some more. But when I came down, I saw this huge line and people stocking up like crazy. I mean even if we go on a complete lockdown, the authorities will figure out a way to not let us go hungry. Why people panic in this manner is beyond comprehension,” said Anuj, a resident of Sector 75.Photos from outside various supermarkets and grocery shops started circulating on social media soon afterwards. They showed people defying all rules of social distancing and clamouring to get as many goods as possible.Officials of the district later clarified that only 12 hotspots in the Gautan Budh Nagar district will go under complete lockdown. And while all services in their areas will be shut, online delivery of all essential goods would still be available.Video messages from senior officials in the district urged people not to fall prey to rumours and resort to panic buying.“According to government regulations 12 areas in the district (Gautam Budh Nagar) have been selected as the hotspots. I request all the citizens not to resort to panic buying and maintain social distancing and stay inside their homes. The lockdown will be implemented effectively in the hotspots while all essential services will be delivered at the door step,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO, Noida Authority. “Apart from this essential services in other areas will continue as they had been earlier. So please don’t believe in rumours. The Authority will continue to help through its helpline and app for home delivery,” she said.The commissioner of police, Alok Singh, also said that people need not panic. “People should stay in their homes. Goods of daily need will be delivered at home and there is no shortage of any food items in the district,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-up-seals-104-covid-19-hotspots-in-15-districts-noida-residents-resort-to-panic-buying/story-8K4mGR0b75vXROTMk8b8qK.html

Shringla made the request in a telephone conversation with his counterpart US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen E Biegun, people familiar with the development said.Shringla’s phone call is a follow-up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s conversation with US President Donald Trump on Saturday last. Foreign Minister S Jaishankar had touched base with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on April 6.Officials did not elaborate on the equipment that India seeks to access.“There was an exchange of views on the current situation with respect to the spread of Sars-CoV-2 and the associated challenges,” a person aware of the development said.“Both sides discussed ways to further enhance their cooperation to counter and control the pandemic including through the development of novel therapies and prophylactics against Covid-19,” the person said. They also spoke about ensuring availability of essential medicines, diagnostic and medical equipment, and sharing of best practices and information.India had this week eased restrictions on the export of hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol to fulfil existing orders. The relaxation was made after New Delhi received requests from nearly 20 countries including the United States and Brazil.India has approved the use of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis to protect health workers and close contacts of Covid-19 patients.

On Tuesday night, army, police and the CRPF had launched a joint operation in Gulabad Arampora locality in the main Sopore town after the forces had received an input about presence of terrorists in the area.As the operation began late last night, the area around the locality was completely sealed and army and police had installed lights to prevent militants from escaping under the cover of darkness. In the morning, forces and terrorists began to exchange fire which continued till late afternoon. One militant was killed in the initial gunfight and was identified as a local who lived barely three kilometers away from the encounter site.A police spokesman said that Sajjad Nawab Dar was neutralized in the gunfight. “The operation was launched on a credible input the operation was launched at Arampora, two to four terrorists were present in the area.’’Dar (23), who was the commander of Jaish-e- Mohammad had joined terror group two years ago, the spokesman said.The Jaish leader had allegedly threatened and intimidated peace loving citizens of Sopore and nearby areas, he said.“He explored the opportunities to assault security forces and VIP rallies through his overground workers (OGWs) and also motivated local youth for grenade attacks against security forces in return of monetary benefits,” he said.In the morning mobile internet was also suspended in the area and people were prevented from going near the encounter spot. One house in which militants were hiding was completely damaged in the encounter.This is the third encounter in Kashmir in less than a week including one on the Line of Control (LoC) in which five para commandos died and five terrorists were killed at Keran. The bodies of the militants have been buried at Jumgund forests after the DNA samples were taken. Three families in south Kashmir have claimed that among the five slain militants in Keran operation three are their kin who went missing in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaish-commander-killed-in-encounter-in-sopore-in-kashmir/story-O9dgrhVIwjL5Dp3fkypSsI.html

Of the 117 new cases reported on Wednesday, 72 are from the capital city Mumbai. The death toll in the state has reached 72 with eight deaths being reported today.“With the new 117 cases, the state’s tally is 1,135 now. The death toll has also increased to 72 with 8 new deaths,” the health minister said.Mumbai city has reported 72 cases followed by 36 testing positive in Pune. A 64-year-old male patient from Dharavi died at KEM Hospital today due to coronavirus, marking the second death from Asia’s largest slum, a statement from BMC said.The number of coronavirus patients in the country touched 5,274 with Union health ministry data revealing that 773 fresh cases had been reported across states in the last 24 hours. As many as 149 people have died so far after testing positive for the deadly pathogen.Talking about strategies initiated in Maharashtra, which has also registered the highest number of deaths so far, Lav Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry said a door-to door survey is being conducted in a 35 square kilometer area in Pune Central and Kondhwa region as part of which teams of health workers are checking on people with co-morbidities like diabetes and hypertension and if they had contact with an infected patient or any history of travel abroad.“In Pune district, the central region of Pune and Kondhwa area has been sealed effectively and a door-to-door survey of homes located across 35 sq km area is being carried out. The team is also checking people with co-morbidity like diabetes and hypertension apart from travel history and contact tracing,” a state health ministry statement read.Maharashtra has reported the most coronavirus deaths at 72, followed by Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh at 13 each and Delhi at 9.

08-04-2020||India||With no transport, lockdown exemption a damp squib in Bengal’s bidi hub||A day after chief minister Mamata Banerjee exempted the state’s bidi industry from lockdown saying millions out of job needed help, there was no sign of euphoria or activity on Wednesday in Murshidabad district, Bengal’s biggest bidi-making hub.Ever since the government announced lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 15 lakh people linked directly or indirectly to the district’s bidi industry are dependent on their paltry savings and food provided by the state and non-government organisations. In certain pockets of Murshidabad, entire families depend on bidi making. The workers are paid Rs 152 for rolling a thousand bidis. Raw materials are supplied by factory owners through ‘munshsis’ (agents). The munshsis also collect the bidis and distribute in markets. There are more than 100 factories in the district’s Jangipur sub-division alone. On Wednesday, the munshsis were nowhere to be seen, said bidi makers who had seen a ray of hope in Banerjee’s announcement from the state secretariat. Anwar Hussain, a bidi maker at Uttar Chachonda village said, “We thought things would change after the chief minister’s announcement. But today we came to know that production will not start. I don’t know how I will feed my family.”Approximately 22 lakh people in West Bengal are directly associated with bidi making and 95% of the total production is sent to other states, said insiders in the industry.Abul Hasnat Khan, president, West Bengal State Bidi and Tobacco Labourers Federation said, “The chief minister’s announcement will help less than 1% of the bidi makers. She did not consider the fact that all big factories send their products to other states. With no trains and interstate transport, the consignments cannot be sent.”“Moreover, the big factories employ around 250 people. It is not possible to start production maintaining social distance,” Khan added.Niponjeet Biswas, owner of Jeet Bidi Factory, said, “Most of the factory owners have adequate tobacco and leaves of kendu trees (in which the tobacco is rolled) in stock but we need regular supply of coal to toast the bidis. We need packaging labels, threads etc. Also, it is literally impossible to store the bidis for a long time. If we can’t sell what is the point in starting production?”Trinamool Congress Lok Sabha member from Jangipur and a renowned bidi merchant, Khalilur Rahaman said, “If we cannot sell the bidi in other states it is impossible to start production. We are trying to find a solution to honour the initiative of our chief minister and help the poor labourers.”Nazir Hossain, a munshi, said, “We were optimist about Banerjee’s announcement. After talking to several factory owners I have realised that production will not start till the Union government allows movement of trucks from West Bengal to other states.”“Several bidi-laden trucks from West Bengal are stranded in other states due to the lockdown. No bidi merchant with sizeable business will start production till the Centre gives its nod,”Hossain added.Secretary of Aurangabad-Dhulian Bidi Merchants Association Raj Kumar Jain said, “We welcome the much needed initiative of our chief minister. A lion’s share of Murshidabad’s bidi is sent to Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi, Assam, Haryana and states in south India but neither the Centre nor any of these states have ordered any exemption for production or transportation of bidi. Also, the state administration has not issued travel passes for munshis and labourers. Without passes they cannot move even inside the district.”Minister of state for labour and a factory owner, Jakir Hossain said, “Our chief minister has taken a humanitarian decision for the sake of millions. I will appeal to the Centre to reduce the goods and services tax (GST) on bidi and allow consignments to be transported to other states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-no-transport-lockdown-exemption-a-damp-squib-in-bengal-s-bidi-hub/story-gpKLBlbCtd2824cTc1D1ZJ.html
08-04-2020||India||Cops, states duty-bound to protect medical professionals fighting Covid-19, says SC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the states to provide adequate security to medical professionals engaged in combating coronavirus pandemic and said that the police and the state administrations were duty-bound to protect the healthcare professionals who were likely to be unnerved and fearful after the recent incidents of attack and misbehaviour, said a news agency.The direction from the country’s apex court came following a string of such incidents where medical personnel were either attacked or misbehaved with. At least two such incidents involved the members of Tablighi Jamaat. Uttar Pradesh government had slapped cases under the stringent National Security Act or the NSA against the offenders in one such case of ill-treatment of nurses by patients at a Ghaziabad hospital.In another case in Indore, seven people were arrested for attacking health workers that resulted in injuries to at least two female doctors. Another case was reported from Bihar’s Munger where police and medical personnel were attacked with stones by locals while on a visit to collect samples from suspected patients.The court also asked to maintain necessary security at all places where patients diagnosed with Covid-19 were kept either for treatment, isolation or quarantining purposes and were frequented by the medical staff. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Recent reports have cited several challenges being faced by the health care professionals, who are bravely carrying out their duties running the risk of contracting a highly contagious and deadly virus. Apart from threats from uncooperative patients, they have also complained of a lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs).In one of the most recent cases, over 150 nursing staff, paramedics and other workers at the KB Bhabha Hospital at Mumbai’s Bandra staged a protest on Wednesday fearing exposure to the disease and also citing lack of PPEs among the reasons for their protest.The BMC, however, denied there was any shortage of PPEs. The apex court observed that doctors, nurses and healthcare workers were the real warriors while hearing a bunch of petitions seeking direction to the central government to ensure that all healthcare workers across India have access to masks, hazmat suits and other personal protective equipment (PPE).Also Read:Private labs can’t charge people for Covid-19 tests, orders Supreme Court||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-states-duty-bound-to-protect-medical-professionals-fighting-covid-19-says-sc/story-4FZ5LHEXOuw5cfpCPP5YLO.html
08-04-2020||India||Centre warns against disclosing identities of Covid-19 patients||The central government in an advisory on Wednesday said that those affected by coronavirus or under quarantine, should not be identified.“Never spread names or identity of those affected or under quarantine or their locality on the social media. Avoid spreading fear and panic. Do not target healthcare and sanitary workers or police. They are there to help you,” it said.“Do not label any community or area for spread of COVID-19. Avoid addressing those under treatment as COVID victims. Address them as ‘people recovering from COVID’,” the advisory added.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.The advisory comes following a spike in coronavirus cases after a Tablighi Jamaat meet at the group’s headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area last month that led to instances of people taking to social media social media to blaming the Muslim community for the spread if disease.It said cases have been reported of people affected with Covid-19 as well as healthcare workers, sanitary workers and police, who are in the frontline for management of the outbreak, facing discrimination on account of heightened fear and misinformation about the infection and that there is a need to counter such prejudices.Last week, the Odisha government broke its own norms of not revealing the identity of coronavirus patients as it named the fifth person in the state who tested positive.The one-off announcement was made over fears that the patient who is mentally challenged might have triggered community transmission of Covid-19.The revelation of the identity of the patient has come at a time when the Odisha government has lodged cases against people for trying to reveal the identity of infected persons. In Bhadrak district last week, police arrested 3 persons for revealing the identity of a 29-year-old chef working in Dubai who tested positive on March 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-warns-against-disclosing-identities-of-covid-19-patients/story-o1oYjCFGK9nIGXnfELoYWP.html
08-04-2020||India||Indian scientists at IIL join global race to develop Covid-19 vaccine||Indian scientists are scrambling to develop a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus, with the Hyderabad-based Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL), a subsidiary of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), joining a frantic global race. The IIL has partnered with Australia’s Griffith University to develop the vaccine through an “approach” that looks promising to both institutions, according to the organisation.“This is a significant cross-continental collaboration,” the chairman of the NDDB and the IIL Dilip Rath told HT. Scientists from IIL and Griffith University will jointly develop a “live attenuated SARS – CoV-2 vaccine” or Covid-19 vaccine using the “latest codon de-optimization technology”.A live-attenuated vaccine is one where the target virus is considerably weakened but still alive, just enough to trigger immunity but cause no harm. “Codon de-optimization technology” is a popular method of developing vaccines that allows manipulation of the constituents of a virus’s genetic code called “codons”, according to the US Centers of Disease Control. IIL is a major player in the human vaccine market in the country, supplying human pediatric and rabies vaccines. IIL is also a major supplier of pediatric vaccines to the country’s state-run universal immunization programme.In India, vaccine manufacturer Bharat Biotech is working on developing an intra-nasal drop vaccine against SARS – CoV-2 in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin-Madison and vaccine firm FluGen. The Pune-based Serum Institute is also working on a coronavirus vaccine.Public institutions and private firms in the US, China and Europe are already conducting early trials of a vaccine. “Development of a Covid-19 vaccine has become a matter of national pride. It’s conceptually not a very difficult thing to achieve but takes time,” said Dr Ashok Kayal, a former professor of neurology at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. According to Rath, the IIL is looking at a new “codon de-optimization technology” because scientists from both India and Australia see it to be promising for developing a vaccine for “prophylactic, active, single dose immunization against coronavirus in humans, with an enhanced safety profile”. The vaccine is expected to provide long-lasting protection, he said.In an email response, Professor Suresh Mahalingam of Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Australia said: “As this vaccine will be a live attenuated vaccine, it is expected to be highly effective by providing very strong cellular and antibody immune responses against the virus.” A live-attenuated vaccine has a proven track record for economical large-scale manufacturing and well-known regulatory approval pathway, Mahalingam said.Most medical scientists agree that the coronavirus crisis will come to an end either with a costly so-called “herd immunity” or with a vaccine. Herd immunity occurs when a population develops collective immunity against a disease by simply battling it but this stage comes after the disease strikes about 80% of the population and potentially causing thousands of deaths. New technology in genomics and greater international coordination have resulted in speedier discovery of vaccines. Yet, it remains a long-drawn out process because vaccines undergo rigorous testing in animals and humans. After completing the research, the vaccine strain will be transferred to IIL and the vaccine maker will work with India’s drug regulator, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, to conduct clinical trials.The IIL is already working with Griffith University for development of a Zika virus vaccine, which is currently at pre-clinical toxicology testing stage. The codon de-optimization technology has been successfully employed to reduce the virulence of several RNA viruses including Enterovirus C (Poliovirus), HIV type 1 and Zika virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-scientists-at-iil-join-global-race-to-develop-covid-19-vaccine/story-0o3fLVFwClcup0SpM568zO.html
08-04-2020||India||Centre praises Pune and Pathanamthitta’s Covid-19 containment measures||The health ministry on Wednesday recognised the containment efforts in coronavirus hotspots like Pune in Maharashtra and Pathanamthitta in Kerala as best practices adopted by states that were worthy of emulation. The ministry also lists several webinars conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi to better arm medical care workers to deal with the unique challenges presented by the coronavirus outbreak.The health ministry said that both Central and the state governments had taken a series of measures to break the chain of transmission and have successfully scaled up their responses as per the ongoing increased cases noted across the country.It then added that several districts have taken measures which have emerged as best practices. It showers rich praise on Pune for its containment efforts.“Pune district sealed the central region of Pune and Kondhwa area effectively and carried out door-to-door survey of homes located across 35 sq. km area. The team is also checking persons with co-morbidity like Diabetes and Hypertension apart from travel history and contact tracing,” the health ministry said while recognising the additional measures like the door to door survey and monitoring of patients with co-morbidity, which is considered to be fatal in combination with cornavirus.It also cited the example of Pathanamthitta district in Kerala to highlight that the district administration had gone beyond the standard procedure for the containment of the deadly virus.“Pathanamthitta district ensured surveillance, gathering travel history, contact tracing, ensuring quarantine facilities and providing essential & psychological support,” the ministry said,Next, it lauded a training module launched by the Central government for management of COVID-19. The module named ‘Integrated Govt. Online training’ (iGOT) portal is for the capacity building of frontline workers including doctors, nurses, paramedics, technicians, ANMs, State Govt Officers, Civil Defence officials, National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS), Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) and other volunteers. Finally, the ministry notes that AIIMS, New Delhi, has been conducting several webinars to build the capacity of different categories of healthcare professionals for Covid-19 management. It specifically mentions online training of physicians for antenatal care and labour management of pregnant women who are suspected or confirmed coronavirus patients.As of now, the health ministry has reported 5194 confirmed cases of the disease including 149 deaths and 402 cases where the patient was discharged after recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-praises-pune-and-pathanamthitta-s-covid-19-containment-measures/story-yEkmZc72x4lRKZoGRoZDTL.html
08-04-2020||India||Centre should provide financial packages to states based on number of COVID-19 cases: Sachin Pilot||To ensure a “comprehensive victory” over the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centre should provide financial packages to states in proportion to the number of coronavirus cases and the propensity for further spread of the infection, Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot said on Wednesday.Pilot also said a decision on whether the lockdown should be lifted or not following the 21-day period should be taken after consultation with the states, medical experts and scientists, and if it is lifted, it should be done in stages.The lockdown across the country was imposed from March 25 to prevent the spread of the virus.In an interview to PTI, he said Rajasthan managed to have limited success in containing the virus as it acted fast and reached out to people not just in cities and towns, but also in villages.Pilot, who holds the rural development and panchayati raj portfolio, said Rajasthan was one of the first states to get sodium hypochlorite sprayed in rural areas and so far, 38,000 villages out of a total of 46,000 have been disinfected.“Every single panchayat has been given Rs 50,000 to procure masks and hand sanitizers. This was done early to prevent panic buying and stopping the rural population from rushing to urban areas to procure them,” he said.The Rajasthan deputy chief minister said in order to ensure that the most vulnerable sections of society are able to sustain themselves, it is important that states are given dedicated financial packages.“For us to be able to have a comprehensive victory over the coronavirus challenge, states will have to be assisted with dedicated financial packages,” he said.“I think what should be done is that every state-specific resource allocation should be done in proportion to the spread of the infection, according to the propensity for further spread and the states present capacities to meet the crisis. We can extrapolate the data scientifically. Every state government must be given a package as the economic activity has almost come to a halt,” Pilot said.State-specific financial packages depending on resources, capacity, infection rate and future roadmap is the need of the hour, he said Asked about the Rs 1.7-lakh-crore relief package that the central government had announce last month, Pilot said that was a pan-India relief and a national announcement, but states have to be given the wherewithal to take care of patients and fight the pandemic.“If you look at any country in the world, the percentage of GDP deployed to fight this virus, India is still behind in that,” he said.He said the Centre’s package was a macro level announcement, but states need to be given financial support to combat and defeat the COVID-19.On whether the lockdown should be extended, Pilot said a “one size fits all solution” was not possible as India is a very diverse country with different geographical and social conditions.“So, what might work in Meghalaya or Manipur may not work in Puducherry or Kerala,” he said.Noting that there was still a week to go for the 21-day lockdown to end, he said there was time to take a considered and a well thought out view on it.“It is a tough decision to make, it boils down to lives versus livelihood and both are important. I don’t think the infection has peaked and we cannot afford to make the same mistakes like the US or western European countries have made,” he said.“I think that the decision should be taken with full consultation from all the states, scientific community and medical experts must be involved and whatever decision once we take, all of us should stand by it. We must fight this challenge as one nation and one people,” Pilot said, adding that there was no point speculating on it.Pilot, who is also the Congress state unit chief, said the party workers have been on the ground and using technology to reach out to vulnerable sections in the state.“We have a control room at my residence in Jaipur and in every district headquarter, DCC chiefs from their own homes are serving as a bridge between the administration and the government and all those who have been left out, Congress office bearers are trying to help them,” he said.Pilot said it was the state’s quick response that is helping it contain the pandemic as seen in Bhilwara and other areas.“We were the first state in India to go in for a lockdown. We moved quickly and that is why we were able to get some initial success in containing the virus, of course the numbers are now more than 300, but we have worked on many fronts simultaneously,” he said.He said on one hand the state government deployed doctors, paramedics, health workers, and on the other ensured that the supply chain for essential commodities was maintained.“We were quite strict in enforcing the curfew. So wherever there was an infection – we imposed curfew in the 2km radius. As of now we have 38 places where there is a curfew in Rajasthan besides the lockdown in the entire state,” he said.

08-04-2020||India||Private labs can’t charge people for Covid-19 tests, orders Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday barred private laboratories from testing patients for coronavirus disease. The judges said they were satisfied that there was a case for not charging patients for the tests and would decide later if they were entitled to any reimbursement from the government.“The private hospitals including laboratories have an important role to play in containing the scale of the pandemic by extending philanthropic services in the hour of national crisis. We thus are satisfied that the petitioner has made out a case for issuing a direction to the respondents to issue necessary direction to accredited private Labs to conduct free of cost COVID-19 test,” the bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Ravindra Bhat said.The court said allowing private labs to charge Rs 4,500 for screening and confirmation test of Covid-19 may not be within means of a large part of population of this country. No person should be deprived of the test due to the person’s inability to pay for the test.The judges had indicated that they were inclined to accept the petitioner-lawyer Shashank Deo Sudhi’s request early in the day. He had submitted that government hospitals are packed to capacity and it has become difficult for the common man to get himself/herself tested in the government labs.Private labs had been roped in India to conduct tests for Covid-19 since government facilities are not sufficient in the face of increasing case counts. According to the Union health ministry website, India reported 5,194 cases and 149 fatalities as of Wednesday afternoon.Incidentally when the Indian Council of Medical Research had earlier spoken of allowing private labs to conduct tests, the government had underlined that it appealed to them to conduct the tests free of charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-labs-can-t-charge-people-for-covid-19-tests-orders-supreme-court/story-4DCa5pljRLXCP9Rre9sefP.html

She said it could have been stopped. Breaking her silence on the issue, Banerjee also said that at least 177 Tablighi Jamaat members, including 108 foreigners, who attended the congregation, have been ‘quietly and secretly’ quarantined in Bengal.“Around 10 to 12 days ago we had quietly quarantined 108 foreigners and 69 people from Bengal who had attended the Delhi congregation. The foreigners had come from countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Myanmar. All 177 have been kept in a quarantine facility developed at the Haj Centre,” Banerjee said.The BJP on Wednesday had accused Mamata Banerjee of indulging in vote bank politics after the West Bengal Chief Minister refused to share any update on those who attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi.BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya hit out at Banerjee alleging that she was trying to appease minorities over the issue.“Jamaat cases have exploded across the country, but there is no clarity on the latest numbers in Bengal. How many of them traced and tested? Results? No update at all. Has she made it about vote bank?” Amit Malviya wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.“Those who are saying these things are responsible for this. External affairs and home affairs do not come under state’s jurisdiction. Several people, including foreigners, had gathered at Nizamuddin. They were allowed to gather. Had steps been taken from the beginning it would not have happened. I don’t want to play politics in these times,” Banerjee said, while reacting to the allegations. Last month, the Tablighi Jamaat group had organised a massive congregation at Delhi’s Nizamuddin area which has now emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot.At least 1,445 positive cases out of a total 5,274 coronavirus cases in the country, have been linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event, the government said. More than 1700 Jamaat members have been blacklisted so far.“It is the union government and not the state government which keeps information about foreigners who enter India with valid documents. How can we know if they (union government) don’t provide information to the state? When we got the information we did it very quietly within a span of just six hours. We did our task. We had to maintain secrecy so that it doesn’t trigger panic. What can we do if we are not provided with information? When we got the information we acted within six hours,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-accuses-centre-of-allowing-tablighi-jamaat-meet-says-it-could-have-been-stopped/story-ezgajGCOGuxDCuUttHnZyO.html
08-04-2020||India||Four of seven coronaviruses that infect humans are seasonal||New Delhi: Out of the seven coronaviruses known to infect humans, four are seasonal and cause common respiratory infections that transmit similar to influenza, according to a new paper by public health researchers at the University of Michigan. The authors of the study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases on April 4, say that their findings may help investigators better prepare for the Covid-19 pandemic. But it is not possible to say that SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, will also behave as the four do, they say. The researchers used data from an ongoing 10-year household influenza vaccine evaluation study based on hundreds of individuals infected by the four mild coronaviruses: OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63. The rest of the three are SARS-CoV, MERS or EMC, and SARS-CoV-2.The researchers from the epidemiology department of the University of Michigan School of Public Health found that 9% of adult cases and 20% of cases in children associated with these four coronaviruses involved doctor visits. During year-round surveillance, most coronavirus cases were detected between December and May with a peak in January-February. Only 2.5% of cases were seen between June and September.The highest infection frequency was among children under five. Of 993 infections, about 260 were acquired from an infected household member. The transmission window for the infection acquired from a household member ranged from 3.2 to 3.6 days. Cases in children under five and adults over 50 were more likely to manifest themselves as severe disease.Coronaviruses have long been recognised as human respiratory pathogens manifesting as mild respiratory illnesses. But when animal coronaviruses spill over to humans, they are known to cause severe diseases as in the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012.“Even though the seasonal coronaviruses found in Michigan are related to SARS-CoV-2, we do not know whether that virus will behave like the seasonal coronaviruses,” said Arnold Monto, a professor at the University of Michigan and co-author of the study, in a statement.Amit Singh, an associate professor at Bengaluru’s Indian Institute of Science, said based on the clues from other coronaviruses that infect humans, it is possible that Covid-19 will eventually become seasonal. “A 10-year-old study conducted in the UK on three coronaviruses isolated from humans showed marked winter seasonality. Several unpublished observations seem to suggest that higher temperatures are linked to lower incidences of Covid-19. However, without data assembled over a number of seasons, the relation between Covid-19 and seasonality is mostly a prediction.”Singh said if the incidence of Covid-19 reduces over the coming months, it could be due to a number of reasons: effective lockdown, the build-up of immunity, or high temperatures. “Since the virus is new, we do not have immunity against it. However, once infection happens and people recover, we are likely to grow immunity against the pathogen,” he said. He added most of the pathogens like to persist in the host to maintain the reservoir. “If Covid-19 mutates at a much slower rate, then the ongoing wave of Covid-19 will generate immunity in the population, which eventually reduces the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the virus.”Dr T Jacob John, a former head of virology at Vellore’s Christian Medical College, said the future is very predictable. “At the end of 21 days, the government may extend the lockdown [imposed to check the spread of the disease]... lifting the lockdown would mean opening the floodgates. The initial spread of the infection will be very slow; a few cases here and there. Then cases will increase...like an avalanche. Maybe the speed of transmission will slow down in summer and then catch up again when the temperature falls. For prevention, people should continue to exercise physical distancing of about six feet but continue with social life and relationships.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-of-seven-covid-19-are-sharply-seasonal/story-o5asNy6ANaqrZHbCiuhzaI.html
08-04-2020||India||Covid-19 Latest: Uttarakhand cops appoint civilian police officers for local monitoring||Uttarakhand Police has decided to appoint Special Police Officers (SPO) from among the civilian population to monitor cases of home quarantine and to work closely with the local police to boost Covid-19 containment efforts in the state, said officials.The appointment of SPOs also shields the police personnel from exposure to the people suspected of carrying the virus. Several areas in the state have been sealed for non-essential movement after some members of the Tablighi Jamaat living in those areas tested positive for Covid-19.The sealed areas include Bhagat Singh Colony, Kargi Grant, some villages in Doiwala and Suddhowala areas, entire Dehradun district, Banbhulpura area in Nainital district and a village in Banbasa town of Champawat district. Extra police force has been deployed in all these areas for the strict enforcement of the restrictions. “Police have decided to appoint some residents of those areas as SPOs who will work in co-ordination with local police concerned to implement the lockdown and restrictions. They will also be keeping an eye on the people put in home quarantine there and inform the administration on finding any person hiding in the area or entering there discreetly,” said Ashok Kumar, director general (law & order), Uttarakhand police. Kumar added that locals are likely to be more amenable to requests for compliance made by their fellow residents who will perform the duties of an SPO.“However, the police will also be present there and won’t be withdrawn. The SPOs would assist them and not take police’s duties,” Kumar clarified.Till Wednesday afternoon, total Covid-19 positive cases in the state stood at 32 including 25 members from the Tablighi Jamaat, who have emerged as the biggest cluster of infection across the country. The senior police official also said that all the policemen on duty were taking required measures to protect themselves from the infection. “Our personnel on the ground are taking precautions like wearing masks and gloves, using hand sanitizers and maintaining social distancing,” he said.Kumar said that eight policemen were in quarantine.“So far only eight policemen have been put in quarantine as a precautionary measure as they were in the team that caught 13 Jamaatis trying to discreetly enter the state on April 1 in US Nagar district. Three of the 13 Jamaatis were later tested positive for Covid-19,” he said. Many police personnel said they were a bit apprehensive while serving near the sealed areas. “Of course we are a little worried about our own lives as we, too, are humans and are out in the open while on duty. With reports of some cops testing positive in Madhya Pradesh and Delhi after coming in contact with the Jamaatis, we are now extra vigilant,” said a head constable deployed near Bhagat Singh Colony in Dehradun, which has been put under restrictions by the administration. Earlier today, the state government again warned the Jamaat members of strict action if they didn’t present themselves for medical examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-latest-uttarakhand-cops-appoint-civilian-police-officers-for-local-monitoring/story-ewF1bMarCL72nhfDEePjsO.html

There have been a series of posts on Twitter, which called for “a standing ovation by clapping for five minutes” for PM Modi on April 12 at 5 pm.But if it is out of goodwill and love for him, PM Modi said, he would rather have people take up the responsibility for one poor family as long the coronavirus crisis exists.“There would be no greater honour for me than this,” PM Modi tweeted on Wednesday, shortly after his video conference with political parties on the Covid-19 challenge.Watch: PM Modi chairs all-party meet via video conferencing on COVID-19 situation People working in the unorganised sector and the marginalised sections have been hit the hardest by the nationwide lockdown ordered by the central government to slow down the coronavirus disease from spreading. Tens of thousands of people, migrant labourers and others, headed back to their villages from cities in the days after the lockdown was ordered. In many cases, people said they had difficulties feeding their families because of the employment opportunities that disappeared when the country, and the economy came to a halt.Soon after, the government stepped up opening of relief camps and community kitchens to feed the poor. In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the Centre told the judges that the 54 lakh people had been given food since the lockdown started. Another 30 lakh were being fed by NGOs.Employers and factory owners were giving shelter and food to another 15 lakh people.An additional 60,000 people had taken refuge at relief camps, mostly by the nonprofit sector. The number of relief camps and shelters run by various governments is 22,567 and by NGOs 3,909, the affidavit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sounds-mischievous-pm-modi-disses-campaign-to-honour-him-slips-in-a-request/story-2nImM0tSWbdvsR1fvZlrEJ.html
08-04-2020||India||We must look at mass antibody testing for a calibrated exit from lockdown: T Jacob John||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has steadily scaled up his government’s response to the coronavirus disease pandemic, starting with the screening of international passengers on January 17; following up with a three-week nationwide lockdown on March 25; and forming 11 high-level empowered groups to reinforce health care facilities, bring the economy back on track, and mitigate problems faced by citizens.On April 4, Modi underlined the need for more hospitals, isolation and quarantine facilities, training of personnel for testing and critical care, medical equipment and personal protective gear for health care workers, and on April 6, sought suggestions from the council of ministers on a “calibrated” exit from the lockdown. In this context, outlined below an innovative strategy for lifting the lockdown. India’s health management system is ready to begin antibody testing. Biomedical companies can upscale the manufacturing of kits under the supervision of, and quality certification by the Indian Council of Medical Research. People with IgG antibodies, found in the blood and lymph fluid, whether or not they had suffered Covid-19, are immune, and, they can safely return to normal activities. They will not get infected, and cannot transmit infection to others. Antibodies are of two kinds, IgM and IgG. In simple terms, IgM antibody signals current infection and IgG antibody records past infection and immunity. The experience everywhere is that a large proportion of people with infection have no illness or only very mild symptoms, not fulfilling the clinical criteria of Covid-19 diagnoses. Unless tested with a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test or IgM antibody test, they will remain undetected and not be counted as infected. The mainstay of my strategy is systematic, well-designed, and widespread antibody testing of individuals, and certifying those who are antibody positive as exempted from lockdown. This is one form of “calibration.”Testing can be initiated in foci of selected geography, and centrifugally expanded. The field methodology can be designed by the responsible empowered group. This exercise can be continuous and ongoing. In communities already tested, it must be repeated periodically, say at intervals of 2-3 weeks, targeting those who were previously antibody-negative. Antibody-positive persons are the newly recruited workforce in rebuilding economic activities. All data must be captured, stored, and made available to the concerned authorities of local and state governments.A registry of antibody-positive healthy adults who are willing to be plasma donors must also be established along with antibody testing. Their plasma is an additional therapeutic item in the health care armamentarium for treating those at risk of severe illness with Covid-19. Medical experts can develop the criteria for selecting such patients. The empowered group concerned with health care can design the modus operandi from A to Z, without delay.Let me add that universal mask-wearing ought to be a necessary condition for lifting of lockdown. Ideally it should have preceded the lockdown. There are still a few days left under lockdown, and the policy of universal mask-use must be mandated as soon as possible. If the Union government delays action, state governments must take leadership. As families stay confined in their own homes, they can stitch masks using old clothes. You do not need sewing machine; hand stitching with needle and thread is good enough.The antibody testing survey has another major benefit. If designed well, it will inform us of the magnitude of the prevalence of Sars-CoV-2 infection. That is an invaluable piece of information that will guide future war tactics.(Dr T Jacob John is a former Professor of Virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-must-look-at-mass-antibody-testing-for-a-calibrated-exit-from-lockdown-t-jacob-john/story-OSLL5kdHSnSVeYeB6hlMYI.html
08-04-2020||India||Covid-19 deaths can’t be decided only on the basis of absolute numbers: Health ministry||The high number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) deaths --- 64 until Wednesday morning --- reported from Maharashtra could be a chance event, as the number of overall fatalities is still low and a trend cannot be decoded on the basis of absolute numbers, said Dr Raman R. Gangakhedkar, chief of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in a media briefing on Wednesday.“You can’t merely decide on the basis of absolute numbers, that is not the right way,” said Dr Gangakhedkar.The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) said that the government was taking aggressive measures wherever required in Maharashtra from where 1,078 Covid-19 cases were reported until Wednesday morning. “In Pune, door-to-door screenings are being conducted. About 35 square kilometres are being covered to look for people with co-morbid conditions and those with any travel history. The government has come up with an elaborate technical plan for different stages of Covid-19 management,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, MoHFW.“If the number of cases is rising, the government’s preparations are also increasing proportionally to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission. Our technical war room is monitoring the situation very closely, and is equipped to track even ambulances on a real-time basis, apart from keeping a close watch of people under home quarantine, etc.,” he added. A total of 139 ICMR laboratories are conducting Covid-19 tests, and another 65 private ones have been approved by the research organisation. Since January 24, 121,271 samples have been tested across India. And 2,267 samples have been tested in private laboratories, which were given approval on March 21. Agarwal refused reports about the shortage of the anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, in the country.“There is no shortage of the drug in the country. It’ll be made available to whoever needs it. Those being given the medicine currently by the government are just a section of people. It’s not recommended for everyone, and should not be taken without a prescription,” said Agarwal.To train the workforce on the field, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development has developed modules to train doctors, nurses, paramedics, technicians, volunteers, etc who will have to be deployed on the ground for surveillance and management purposes.“All these people will be provided with necessary resources on the field. This is a part of government’s larger preparedness plan,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-deaths-can-t-be-decided-only-on-the-basis-of-absolute-numbers-health-min/story-gnRb3F5otJ3cLLWxKnxFqK.html

08-04-2020||India||E-commerce expenditure records17% hike on utilities, 8.3% dip on travel||Indians spent 17.5% more on utilities and essentials on e-commerce sites during the lockdown, than they did before it. An analysis of spending patterns showed a change in the way Indians spent, with online transactions on travel, food and beverages and business services showing a dip. Spending on shopping, however, continued to grow. A study released by digital payments company, Wibmo, revealed that while 55% of the spend on e-commerce sites were on essentials before the lockdown, it shot up to 72.5% during the lockdown. Shopping, too, saw a hike and went from 10% of total e-commerce spends to 12.2%. Games and entertainment, which accounted for 12% of all spending on e-commerce sites earlier, went down to 9.4% during the lockdown. Travel-related transactions saw a huge dip -- it accounted for 9% of all spending earlier and went down to 0.7% during the lockdown. Transactions on Indian e-commerce sites at large saw a dip of 30% during the Janta Curfew, called for by Prime Minister Modi on March 22. In the week after that, Indian consumers returned online with spending making a recovery of 50%. In the week after the Janta Curfew, RuPay spend climbed back to about 98% of normal volumes but continued to fluctuate between 87% to 98%, the findings said. Later in the week, RuPay saw a further rise of 10%. Visa and Mastercard purchases, however, could match up to only 86% of their normal volumes and remained between 70-86%. Average ticket size during the lockdown dropped by 25%.“We process over 2.2 billion transactions annually giving us unique insight into consumer behavior and spend patterns. The shift in online purchases was inevitable as our consumers stayed at home during this tough period,” Wibmo CEO Govind Setlur said in a release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/e-commerce-expenditure-records17-hike-on-utilities-8-3-dip-on-travel/story-i5wj0gxOIi38BoWGNGFeeJ.html

Some of them are unwilling to return home while others are unable to return to their hometowns in Haryana, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh due to the ongoing 21-day lockdown.Those who have been ordered to be released were serving sentences for cases, under which there is a maximum term of seven years. The orders were issued to decongest the Rohini, Mandoli and Tihar jails, to ensure social distancing amid the Covid-19 pandemic.As many as 48 undertrial prisoners (UTPs) are also languishing at the jail, chiefly due to lack of transportation, as per the information provided by the Tihar jail authorities to the Delhi government’s committee to decongest the prisons.The director general (DG), prisons, told the committee, headed by justice Hima Kohli, that 261 more cases are under process. He said that so far, 775 of the 823 UTPs have been released after receiving orders for the same.The committee also discussed and resolved that the next set of prisoners who would be released on a 45-day interim bail would include UTPs who are senior citizens in custody for six months or more, facing trial in a case which prescribes a maximum sentence of 10 years, UTPs aged less than 60 years of age in custody for one year or more, facing trial in a case which prescribes a maximum sentence of 10 years and UTPs/remand prisoners (who are yet to be chargesheeted) in custody for 15 days or more, facing trial in a case which prescribes a maximum sentence of seven years.However, the committee excluded foreigners, those undergoing trials for intermediary/ large quantity recovery under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act), those charged under sections 4 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and rape accused.Kanwal Jeet Arora, member-secretary, Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) informed the committee that advocates empanelled with DSLSA, visiting jail premises on daily basis, had drafted and filed 1,475 applications, as on April 4, 2020, for grant of interim bail.The committee was informed that out of these bail applications, interim bails have been granted in 823 cases and expected to be granted in 100 more cases on the basis of applications filed/pending for consideration, at the courts concerned.The court said that in the last meeting, held on March 28, the DG (prisons) had informed them that the number of convicts who can be released on parole for eight weeks is 1,500, of whom 650 have been released.The chairperson cautioned the DG (prisons) and principal secretary (home) that any delay in the release of the eligible convicts on “emergency parole”, so as to complete the exercise of decongesting jails, will render the entire Covid-19 fight futile. The DG and PS assured the chair that they would expedite the process and mentioned that preventive measures are being taken up by jail authorities.The DG told the committee that bathing areas, kitchen and the telephone bays are being cleaned and sanitised regularly. He said that inmates are being apprised about the necessary precautions, i.e., dos and don’ts through public address systems installed in the jails.He also said that 25-30 new male inmates, aged 21 and above, have been kept at separate wards in Tihar’s jail number two and Mandoli’s jail number 13. Separate wards have been created in jail number six for new women inmates, while men aged between 18 and 21 years would be kept at jail number five in Tihar.The DG said that as per the resolutions adopted in the previous meeting, adequate quantities of soap cakes, liquid soaps, phenyl, masks, and sanitisers, manufactured in-house, have been sent to juvenile justice boards and observation homes, as per the requirements. They have been put to use in the jails as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/36-convicts-48-undertrials-remain-in-city-jails-despite-interim-bail-orders/story-aL90S5uR7JWP6MWxLewF1L.html

The country has been forced to take tough decisions and must continue to remain vigilant. He said that several state governments, district administrations and experts have asked for an extension of the phase of Lockdown,” the release from PMO said referring to the content of the discussions.BJD’s Pinaki Misra had earlier confirmed that Prime Minister Modi had remarked during the meeting that removing the lockdown provisions didn’t appear to be possible at this stage. Congress’ Ghulam Nabi Azad also told news agency PTI that over 80% of political parties represented in the meeting had spoken in favour of extending the lockdown.The Central government has, however, not taken any official stance on the matter and a final round of deliberations with chief ministers of all states and Union territories is likely to be held on April 11, three days before the end of the 21-day lockdown period that began on March 25.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19PM Modi called the present situation as one causing a grave impact on mankind’s history and added that we must evolve to “counter impact”, said the release.Modi also praised the efforts of the states as they worked together with the Centre in the fight against the pandemic while underlining the “resource constraints”.Prime Minister Modi, however, added that “India has been among the few nations to control the pace of spread of the virus till now.”Also Read: PM Modi said pre-corona and post-corona life won’t be same, says BJD MPHe also warned that the situation keeps changing continuously and one needs to maintain vigil at all times, said the release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-priority-is-to-save-every-life-as-india-prepares-for-extended-lockdown/story-OOOwdLHSqnwfEEWswoWhWN.html

He also asked why Tablighi Jamaat head Maulana Saad was absconding after Doval visited its headquarters.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.He also wanted to know why Doval and the Delhi Police Commissioner have been silent on the issue. “What were the secret talks that took place between Doval and Maulana Saad past midnight after the former visited the Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin? Why Maulana Saad is absconding day after their meeting and where is he now?” the statement reads.On Tuesday, Deshmukh who belongs to the nationalist Congress Party (NCP), warned 50 to 60 Jamaat members who attended the Nizamuddin event programme of stern action against for not reporting to the authorities despite several appeals. He said that out of 1400 such members who attended the programme, the others have been traced by the authorities.The Tablighi Jamaat had organised a religious gathering between March 13 and 15 which was attended by more than 2000 people, including many foreigners.

The 45-year-old woman who died Tuesday night tested positive for coronavirus.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.They said the woman was admitted to the hospital’s general ward on Saturday and died after serious breathing difficulty on Tuesday night.“We all are at serious risk because we were handling a Covid -19 patient for the last four days. We were totally unaware about her Covid-19 history and hence we are demanding to be quarantined for our own safety,” said Bharat Katare, one of the medical staff who was among the protesters.Another staffer Vaibhav Kharat said, “Not only us but our immediate family members should also be quarantined. Why should we put the life of our near and dear ones in danger? Already two private hospitals in the city have been sealed after possible exposure of medical staff members, so the civic body should at least quarantine us.” Health staffers also demanded that such suspected patients should be treated separately considering possible exposure of Covid-19 to all medical staffers.They also complained that they are working without adequate precautions.

In a letter to PM Modi, President Bolsonaro compared India’s move to allow export of hydroxychloroquine to reach his country to Lord Hanuman and Sanjeevani booti (herb) in the epic Ramayana.“Just as Lord Hanuman brought the holy medicine from the Himalayas to save the life of Lord Rama’s brother Laksmana, and Jesus healed those who were sick and restored the sight of Bartimeu, India and Brazil will overcome this global crisis,” President Bolronaro said in his letter to Prime Minister Modi.India is the largest manufacturer and exporter of hydroxychloroquine in the world.Also read: India eases hydroxychloroquine, paracetamol export restrictionsBut on Saturday, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade notified a ban on exports of hydroxychloroquine and any formulation containing the miracle drug from special economic zones (SEZs) and export-oriented units too.President Bolsonaro, who was in the country this January to be chief guest at India’s Republic Day celebrations, spoke with PM Modi the same day. He followed up the conversation with a letter on Tuesday that underscored the important role that he expected hydroxychloroquine to play in the fight against Covid-19.President Bolsonaro is also learnt to have emphasised that the drug was required by his country’s pharmaceutical companies, not just for the coronavirus disease but also for other illnesses.“India and Brazil will overcome this global crisis by joining forces and sharing blessings for the sake of all peoples,” he said in the letter.The empowered committee of top bureaucrats later overruled Saturday’s ban order after which the Ministry of Commerce informed Indian Customs to allow export of hydroxychloroquine and honour previous contracts.“We will issue no fresh notification. Instead we have asked the Customs to allow shipments of HCQ .

08-04-2020||India||India could learn from China’s smart Covid-19 move||As India gears up for a surge in Covid-19 cases, policymakers in New Delhi could do well to take a look at China’s “fangcang” shelter hospitals, which according to a new study in medical journal Lancet, played a critical role in controlling the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in the country.Simply defined, the “fangcang” shelters for Covid-19 patients in Wuhan, the first epidemic epicenter, were public spaces like stadiums, convention centres, exhibition centres, gymnasiums, factories, and warehouses that were remodelled to become temporary large-scale health-care facilities.These shelters had their job defined to act as buffers or mass quarantine spaces under medical supervision for patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 but showed mild symptoms and did not need urgent treatment. They were only transferred to a hospital if their condition worsened.These shelters helped in a major way by freeing up the heavily burdened medical infrastructure in Wuhan in February and early March by taking in and isolating the positive patients with mild or moderate symptoms who would have ended up spreading the infection if allowed to stay in contact with family and community members. It was one reason why home isolation for Covid-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms wasn’t allowed.“They served to isolate patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 from their families and communities, while providing medical care, disease monitoring, food, shelter, and social activities,” the study by experts from China, the US and Germany, titled “Fangcang shelter hospitals: a novel concept for responding to public health emergencies” said.The study said that early epidemiological evidence showed that more than half of Covid-19 patients in China had at least one family member with the disease, and 75 percent to 80 percent of clustered infections were within families.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The shelters had three key characteristics: rapid construction, massive scale, and low cost; and five essential functions, -- isolation, triage (order of treating a large number of patients), basic medical care, frequent monitoring and rapid referral, and essential living and social engagement.“Early descriptive evidence suggests the Fangcang shelter hospitals were a major reason for the successful Covid-19 control in China. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan steadily declined from February 18, 12 days after the first Fangcang shelter hospitals started admitting patients,” the paper said.Wuhan authorities built 16 such shelters in three weeks in February.“By March 10 (when all the shelters were shut down), the 16 hospitals had provided care to about 12,000 patients. In caring for and sheltering such a large number of patients who would otherwise have been confined to their homes, these shelter hospitals effectively supported China’s Covid-19 policy of leaving no patient unattended or untreated,” the authors said.According to the paper, in Wuhan, the bed vacancy rate in traditional hospitals designated for the care of Covid-19 patients increased from 4 percent on February 4 to 16 percent on February 22, when 16 makeshift hospitals had started admitting patients.Are other countries emulating the experiment?“Other countries facing the Covid-19 pandemic should consider using Fangcang shelter hospitals as part of their public health response,”says the study.It also recommends that the future design and construction of large public venues (eg, stadiums, convention centres, exhibition centres, gymnasiums, factories, and warehouses) should integrate features facilitating the conversion of these infrastructures to Fangcang shelter hospitals, such as interior equipment that can be rapidly removed, entrances that are large enough for hospital beds, and ventilation systems that reduce the risk of cross-infection.”Some countries are already following the example.Serbia is building Fangcang shelter hospitals by converting public venues into health-care facilities to isolate and treat patients with mild to moderate Covid-19.Iran, the USA, the UK, and Spain are implementing measures that are similar to Fangcang shelter hospitals.The authors said: “It was likely that many other countries, including in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia will also need to adopt such measures to ensure sufficient capacity to both effectively isolate and care for the large number of people who will experience mild to moderate Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-could-learn-from-china-s-smart-covid-19-move/story-22GFMJScbX2GVDijbxADaO.html
08-04-2020||India||What life in Odisha’s containment zone looks like amid lockdown||What is it like to live in a containment zone? Ask the residents of an area in Odisha’s capital Bhubaneswar, that has emerged as the biggest site of coronavirus outbreak in the state.On the evening of April 3, the city’s municipal corporation announced it is creating a “containment zone”, a nearly rectangular area with 1.5 km length and 800 metre width that centred on a housing complex, the epicentre of the local outbreak with 18 positive cases of Covid-19. On Twitter, the municipal corporation released a map showing a black dotted line along the busy Cuttack-Puri road indicating the contours of the zone which it said no one can enter or exit as long as the containment orders were on.Though I live in Bomikhal, I missed being a part of the zone by about a hundred metres. But hundreds of families have not been that lucky as they came within the zone announced under Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005.The first casualties of containment have been supply of essential commodities like milk, vegetables, groceries and medicine. Though Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) listed a few telephone numbers that can be contacted for ordering essential commodities, the supply has been anything but smooth.With provisions exhausted, Arun Mohanty on Monday tried the numbers, but not one BMC official picked up. Mohanty, who runs a travel agency in the containment zone of Bomikhal, then decided enough was enough and he better find a way to buy provisions. “I took a chance and sneaked out of the containment zone to come to the road. Luckily, no cop saw me or else they would have beaten me to pulp. I walked for 4 km under hot sun to buy milk, flour and other groceries,” he said.On Wednesday morning, Trinath Padhi ventured out of his home in Bomikhal area to get some medicines for his 48-year-old wife who has to undergo dialysis once every two days. Padhi’s wife had last undergone dialysis on Monday and her next dialysis was due on Wednesday. But the moment he reached the bamboo barricades at the bylane to get medicines, he was stopped by the policeman. “You can’t exit. Call up the helpline numbers,” the policeman said. “But no one picks up the phone number given for health requirements. I don’t know how I would take my wife for dialysis today?” said Padhi, as he requested the cop to allow him to go to the chemists shop across the road.Businessman Mukesh Goenka who deals in supply of newsprints to local dailies and a resident of the Bomikhal containment zone too complained of lack of response from the BMC helpline numbers in getting essential supplies. “Most of the times the person at the other end does not pick up. The government perhaps did not think through while announcing containment,” said Goenka.In Surya Nagar area of the city, where eight people, including a 60-year-old man, tested positive from one particular house, a roadside snacks vendor who stayed in that house has been among those who have been hit the hardest by the containment. The snacks vendor’s mother, wife and sister tested positive and are now being treated in hospital in Cuttack meant exclusively for Covid-19 patients. As the snacks vendor and his daughter have been home quarantined, getting food has been problematic as no one would visit them. “My daughter has a malfunctioning pancreas since her childhood and her food is restricted. One of my cousins can cook for her, but how would she get the food at the home as no one is being allowed inside the zone?” he asked.In one of the containment zones, the doctor who was assigned to take the calls of people with health issues, did not pick up calls for first three days till people started complaining. He finally fell in line when he was told of possible departmental action due to negligence. With chemist stores in the localities closed, BMC has formed medical teams for the conatinment zones to supply medicines through these teams. But officials admitted that it has not been a smooth exercise as they have to visit hundreds of households everyday for active surveillance.The lockdown, now in its 15th day, has paralysed life in the city of 1.1 million people, and the containment may have made it worse for people sitting at home. Many people said they venture out to balcony to peek at the deserted road, but get bored soon.Suketh Chinchela, who lives in Surya Nagar area of the city with his family said there is a certain eerie feeling in living in a containment zone. “Albeit, the fear, is more that the dreaded disease has come to our doors. Surya Nagar is an area full of retired serviceholders and old people, thereby heightening the fear,” said Chinchela.“There are no dogs to be seen. The whole area seems like a graveyard even during the day and one can hear the rustle of the leaves of trees. It’s unbelievable,” said a housewife in Surya Nagar area.With Odisha reporting its first death due to coronavirus on Tuesday when a 72-year-old retired government servant died in AIIMS Bhubaneswar, the authorities have stepped up surveillance and testing. After Surya Nagar and Bomikhal, the officials added Jadupur, Kapilaprasad, Sundarpada and finally Satya Nagar as conatinent zones. Ten villages in Kendrapara district, a gram panchayat in Bhadrak district and a village in Jajpur district have also been declared as containment zones.Is containment working to slow down our outsized local outbreak? The health department officials said they are hoping it would.“We are containing certain areas to protect the health of the people and prevent the spread of Covid-19. We understand it causes inconvenience to some people. It has to be appreciated that containment is necessary to prevent community transmission,” the department said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-life-in-odisha-s-containment-zone-looks-like-amid-lockdown/story-oePg7894KxXpNvLxBFSKIN.html

Figures show that the Pakistan army violated the cease-fire 685 times in 2019 and 627 times in 2018 for the period January to March.The armed forces issued a string of advisories last month that put a bar on several activities till April 15. These included conferences, seminars, temporary duties, courses, foreign assignments and even annual medical examination of personnel. Another senior officer said the advisories will be reviewed in the coming days on the basis of how the overall Covid-19 situation unfolds in the country.Last month, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said contingency plans were in place and spread of Covid-19 will not affect the core efficiency of the army. He said the temporary phase of postponing the army’s routine activities will soon be overcome by rescheduling them as and when the situation stabilises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-defers-conclave-of-top-brass-amid-covid-19/story-2ehaQtwf9E5onsW9Qj1iPO.html

He added that these workers are being housed in hotels, and the government will continue taking steps to ensure their physical protection.The court suggested setting up nodal centres at district level for receiving suggestions and complaints. Mehta said a central control room drawn from Home and Health departments has been set up at state level. These control rooms are getting calls with suggestions and complaints, he added.The Solicitor General also denied claims that salaries of the doctors involved in treating Covid-19 patients are being cut. If this is being done anywhere, government will penalise such actions, Mehta said. He said that the government will write to the states and ask them to ensure that salaries of healthcare personnel are not cut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-treating-covid-19-patients-warriors-need-to-be-protected-supreme-court/story-gurDqVf1a14WRutUuXYFRL.html

The important directive comes at the time when private laboratories are allowed to charge people to test for Coronavirus, though the price is capped at Rs. 4500.A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Ravindra Bhat asked the government to explore the feasibility of a mechanism to reimburse private labs for Coronavirus tests so that citizens don’t have to pay for it.“Don’t allow private labs to charge a high amount for tests. Create a mechanism for reimbursement (of private labs) from the government”, justice Bhushan suggested.Solicitor General, representing the central government told the court that he will take instructions in this regard.Currently, private labs have been roped in to conduct tests for Covid-19 to augment the testing capacity available with the government facilities.Coronavirus live updates The petitioner, advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi submitted that government hospitals are packed to capacity and it has become difficult for the common man to get himself/herself tested in the government labs.With no alternative in sight, they are forced to pay money to get the tests done at private labs.

08-04-2020||India||3 out of 5 terrorists killed in Kupwara Op from J&K; 2 went to Pak via Attari in 2018||At least three of the five terrorists gunned down by the army’s Special Forces in the April 5 Keran sector encounter belong to Jammu and Kashmir. Investigations into the encounter have revealed the three terrorists had been missing since 2018 when they crossed over to Pakistan for training in arms and explosives.Five AK-47 rifles, grenades, GPS and wireless sets were recovered from the encounter site at Shalbatoo, Jumgund area of Keran sector, Kupwara in north Kashmir.The group had infiltrated across the Line of Control (LoC) on April 1 from Qasim-II post in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. They were on their way to the army’s Gulab Post when a squad of the Special Forces went after them.According to security agencies, the three terrorists have been identified as Sajjad Ahmad Hurrah of Daramdora, Shopian, Aadil Hussain Mir of Mallapora, Liver, Anantnag and Umar Nazir Khan of Liver, Anantnag.The J&K Police records show that missing reports were filed over the disappearance of Sajjad and Aadil at local police stations.It was further revealed that the two left for Pakistan separately via the Attari-Wagah border. Sajjid (passport number N 6689233) crossed over on April 12, 2018 and Aadil (passport number P9403541) later on April 27, 2018. Travel history of Umar Nazir, who belonged to the same village as Aadil, is being probed.According to security agencies, the needle of suspicion for radicalising these youth and recruiting them into terrorism points at Ghulam Nabi Khan, who is currently deputy leader of Hizbul Mujahideen and based in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. Nabi Khan also belongs to Liver Village in Anantnag.The encounter, and the multiple intelligence reports of Pakistan-based terror groups - Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed — assembling at launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir suggests Islamabad is focused on fomenting trouble in Kashmir, a security official said. For one, by radicalising the Kashmiri youth and then, getting them to cross over for training with jihadist groups like Lashkar-e-Tayebba, Jaish-e-Mohammed or the Hizbul Mujahideen and then infiltrate back to Jammu and Kashmir.Besides, the Pakistani establishment is also trying to smuggle assault rifles across the LoC in order to supply to foreign and local terrorists already in the Valley. This assessment is also backed by the recent seizure of 13 AK-47 rifles, hand grenades and ammunition in Keran sector, Kupwara on March 23.Apart from the Pakistani attempts to increase the level of violence in Kashmir in the coming months, Islamabad is also propping up indigenous armed groups like the Resistance Front and JK Pir Panjal Peace Forum to get back at India for nullifying the Article 370 in August 2019.The renewed attempts at infiltration are an attempt to boost the terrorist strength in Kashmir where 50 terrorists have been neutralised in the last three months.According to an estimate by the security establishment, there are, however, no less than 242 active terrorists in the Valley. About 100 of them are foreign terrorists belonging to the Lashkar and Jaish-e-Mohammed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-out-of-5-terrorists-killed-in-kupwara-op-from-jk-2-went-to-pak-via-attari-in-2018/story-0lHV9xH6QZVdIBfaLYUGiK.html

At a high-level meeting he chaired to review the coronavirus situation, Kumar noted that 3.80 lakh requests for aide have been received from migrant workers stranded in other states and financial assistance of Rs 1,000 each has been provided to 1.42 lakh by way of direct cash transfer.Besides, efforts were being made to ensure that such people were provided with items like rice, pulses and edible oil wherever they were and messages of gratitude have been received from many such beneficiaries, most notably some residents of Vaishali district in Tamil Nadu who have sent videos on WhatsApp, sources in the Chief Ministers office said.The chief minister also directed that seeding of ration cards with Aadhar be completed at the earliest so that the state governments resolve to reach out to every poor family with a financial assistance of Rs 1000 was achieved.“We are treating the pandemic as an aapada (disaster) and it is a stated policy of our government that those affected by a disaster shall have the first claim on the governments resources”, Kumar said. He also took stock of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) which has afflicted a few children in some north Bihar districts and claimed one life. He issued instructions for taking preventive measures to halt in its tracks the spread of the brain fever which had killed nearly 200 children last year. Instructions were also issued by the chief minister for putting a check on bird flu and swine flu of which a few cases have been reported. Besides, officials were directed to ensure that compensation be expeditiously paid to those who have suffered crop losses on account of untimely rainfall and hailstorm.A sum of Rs 518.42 crore has been allocated for the aforementioned purpose, the chief minister underscored.Meanwhile, several religious, social, medical and business organizations came out with contributions to the chief ministers relief fund from which money is being drawn for providing relief to those suffering economically on account of lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-calls-for-speeding-up-disbursement-of-aide-to-those-affected-by-lockdown/story-mGOjcz1OsSbJNxfNZvxBRN.html

Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla wrote to all state chief secretaries asking them to invoke provisions of the Essential Commodities Act 1955.Bhalla said the Centre has allowed manufacture, production, transport and other related activities in the chain of supply of food, medicine and medical equipment.“State/Union Territory governments are advised to take urgent steps to ensure the availability of essential goods, by invoking provisions of the Essential Commodities (EC) Act 1955. These measures include fixing of stock limits, capping of prices, enhancing production, an inspection of accounts of dealers and other such actions,” Bhalla said in his letter.He pointed out that offences under the essential commodities act may result in imprisonment of seven years or fine or both. The state governments and Union territory administrations may also consider detaining people under the Prevention of Black Marketing & Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980.The Centre also said that there are reports of loss of production due to various factors, especially reduction in labour supply.“In this situation, there is a possibility of inventory building/hoarding and black marketing, profiteering, and speculative trading and the resulting price rise of essential goods cannot be ruled out,” he said.India is currently in the last week of a 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease in the country. The Centre is likely to consider an extension of lockdown by the end of the week with several states requesting it not to withdraw the restrictions immediately. The number of Covid-19 cases in India crossed the 5000 mark with nearly 150 deaths, according to the Union health ministry data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-essential-goods-are-available-during-lockdown-prevent-hoarding-centre-to-states/story-woSUrZYYu24YgsY462nPhP.html
08-04-2020||India||Govt mulls extending lockdown as Covid-19 cases in India cross 5,000: Report||The nationwide tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases neared 5,200 on Tuesday amid hectic discussions for a possible extension of the 21-day lockdown beyond April 14 as several states announced plans to ramp up their testing infrastructure and put in place strong ‘cluster containment’ plans in areas identified as hotspots of the outbreak. There were also indications about possible relaxations from a complete lockdown for some sectors, including agriculture and unorganised labour sector, at least in some states, while there were also talks about even stronger area-specific restrictions in some places. A PTI tally of figures reported by various states as on Tuesday 9.45 PM showed 5,192 testing positive across the country and at least 162 deaths. The Union Health Ministry’s evening update, however, showed 4,789 confirmed cases and 124 deaths.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here More than 400 have so far been cured and discharged, while nearly 1.1 lakh tests have been conducted so far in the country, as per official announcements. Also, while some states including Maharashtra reported a significant increase in the numbers, several states did not report a single additional positive case. Officials said that the lockdown and social distancing measures have helped contain the pandemic in a big way in India. Citing an ICMR study, the Health Ministry said just one Covid-19 patient can infect as many as 406 people in 30 days in the absence of preventive measures such as social distancing and the lockdown. With the preventive measures, the possibility of the infection can be reduced to an average of just two-and-a-half persons per patient in the same period, Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said in the central government’s daily briefing on Covid-19.Also read: Donald Trump reverses course, supports India’s position on hydroxychloroquine He said social distancing works like a “social vaccine” in management of Covid-19, but refrained from commenting on whether the ongoing nationwide lockdown would be extended or lifted after April 14. “Whenever a decision is taken, it will be informed. Till a decision is officially communicated, please refrain from speculation,” he said. Government sources, however, said many state governments and experts are requesting the Centre to extend the lockdown and the central government is thinking in that direction. There has been a nationwide lockdown since March 25, though some states had initiated such measures a few days earlier, to check the pandemic that has claimed more than 75,000 lives worldwide since its emergence in China last December. Over 13 lakh people have tested positive for the virus across the world so far. Some states, however, indicated that the lockdown conditions could be relaxed for some segments.Also read: Covid-19 cases in India breach 5000-mark, death toll at 149 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said some relaxation on work front for unorganised sector workers was on anvil. She, however, made it clear that all must practice social distancing. The state government has identified seven Covid-19 hotspots in West Bengal. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, however, said his government will extend the lockdown if needed, while his counterpart in Rajasthan, Ashok Gehlot, said the state cannot withdraw the lockdown immediately and it has to be done in a phased manner. A Karnataka government minister said it’s too early to take a call now on lifting the nation-wide lockdown but appeared favouring an extension by at least two weeks. Addressing his ministers through video conferencing on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also indicated towards a graded approach to lift the lockdown. The Prime Minister had also asked the ministers whether the restrictions should be lifted sector-wise or district-wise, a source said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  Modi has also asked the ministers to lay out plans to contain the economic impact of the pandemic. Rating agency ICRA on Tuesday forecas a GDP forecast of just 2 per cent for the current fiscal and said the Indian economy is estimated to have contracted by 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of FY20 ended March 31. Industry body Retailers Association of India on the other hand warned that around 80,000 jobs were expected to be cut by various retailers due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. It had conducted a survey of 768 retailers, which employ 3,92,963 people across India, to gauge their view on the impact of Covid-19 on their business and manpower. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) also said the Covid-19 crisis has the potential to push around 40 crore informal sector workers in India deeper into poverty, with the lockdown and other containment measures affecting jobs and earnings. The stock market, however, witnessed a sharp rebound on Tuesday with a 2,476-point rally in the benchmark Sensex, while the investors’ wealth measured in terms of market value of all listed companies rose by nearly Rs 7.7 lakh crore. Shares of pharma companies especially saw a lot of surge after India decided to partially lift a ban on export of paracetamol and anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. The decision came a week after a telephonic conversation between Modi and US President Donald Trump, who sought supply of hydroxychloroquine to the US to treat coronavirus infected people. Trump on Monday said he would be surprised if New Delhi did not relent to the request as it has good relations with Washington and warned India of retaliation if it did not export the anti-malarial drug despite his personal request. Indian pharma companies said there is enough stock of hydroxychloroquine in the country, and drug firms are ready to ramp up the production to meet domestic as well as export requirements. Agarwal said cluster containment strategies are producing required results in some areas like Agra, Gautam Budh Nagar (U.P), Pathanamthitta (Kerala), Bhilwara (Rajasthan), East Delhi and Mumbai and similar strategies are being adopted in other coronavirus-affected districts. Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary R K Tiwari said, “There is still time for the lockdown and we will review the situation and then decide” on lifting it. Several states, including Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, also announced plans to ramp up the tests, while numerous leaders across the country urged the people to strictly follow the lockdown and social distancing measures including for religious rituals. Gehlot, the Rajasthan chief minister, said the state will start rapid testing within a week and that it has ordered 10 lakh testing kits from China. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a five-point action plan of “five Ts -- testing, tracing, treatment, team-work and tracking -- and monitoring” to contain the virus spread and said one lakh random rapid COVID-19 tests will be conducted in the city’s hotspot areas. He said arrangements have been made to deal with as many as 30,000 cases. Gujarat government has also decided to implement a cluster containment plan across 15 localities in four cities, which involves a complete lockdown of these areas. Fresh cases were reported from Delhi, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana, Kerala, Jammu & Kashmir, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu among other states, while Maharashtra reported at least 150 more testing positive to take the state’s tally to 1,018. Maharashtra is the only state to have crossed the 1,000-mark in terms of positive cases while 12 more died in the state on Monday to take the toll to 64.

08-04-2020||India||Air pollution raises risk of Covid-19 deaths: Study||Air pollution is likely to be a major risk factor for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) mortality, scientists have concluded.Prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory response even among the young and healthy which makes people living in polluted areas more susceptible to developing chronic respiratory conditions. This theory is borne out by the high Covid-19-related death rates in northern Italy compared to the rest of the country, environmental scientists and physicians in Italy have concluded.In a paper titled “Can atmospheric pollution be considered a co-factor in extremely high-level of SARS-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy?” published in Elsevier’s journal of Environmental Pollution on April 4, the scientists pointed that the mortality was 12% in Lombardy and Emilia Romagna, as compared to 4.5% in the rest of the country. This region is one of Europe’s most polluted based on data from Ozone Monitoring Instrument on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Aura satellite.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe data indicates that there is stagnation of pollutants in the region because of geographical and climatic factors. A review of air quality index (AQI), which is calculated based on concentrations of particulate matter and other gases, is also the worst for this region in Italy.“Air pollution represents one of the most well-known causes of prolonged inflammation, eventually leading to an innate immune system hyper-activation,” the study by scientists at the rheumatology unit of the University of Siena and departmental of environmental science at Arhaus University said. The authors explained how pollutants impact the human immune response.In a small cohort of mice exposed for three months to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) showed a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines in both serum and lung parenchyma. High systemic inflammation impairs heart function as well. A high correlation has also been seen between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM in inducing 1L6 (an inflammatory cytokine) hyperexpression.“Our considerations must not let us neglect other factors responsible of the high lethality recorded: important co-factors such as the elevated medium age of the Italian population, the wide differences among Italian regional health systems, ICUs (intensive care units) capacity and how the infects and deaths have been reported have had a paramount role in the lethality of SARS-CoV-2, (which causes Covid-19) presumably also more than pollution itself,” cautioned environmental scientist Dario Caro in a statement.The paper has concluded that pollution impairs the first line of defence of the upper airways called cilia (microscopic hair-like structures or organelles) which is why people in polluted areas are more likely to develop chronic respiratory conditions due to an infective agent like SARS-CoV-2.This was seen during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 too. A study by scientists of the Fielding School of Public Health analysed five regions with 100 or more SARS cases which showed that the fatality rate increased with the increment in AQI or air pollution levels. Moderate AQIs had an 84% increased risk of dying from SARS compared to those from regions with lower AQI.“When a population is chronically exposed to high levels of air pollution, the lung is compromised. The lung develops an inflammation. In short, the lung becomes ready for external attack. Those living in areas with cleaner air are more battle-ready. There have bee high cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), rhinitis and other conditions, which have manifestations similar to Covid-19. Indian population is extremely vulnerable to rhinoviruses but we’ve grown immunity and come out of it within four to five days. But the unique feature of SARS-CoV-2 is that it can be fatal for some people. This is a great opportunity to study how the impact of a new virus is influenced by air pollution,” said Dr Manas Ranjan Ray, former assistant director of Kolkata-based Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute.India has some of the most polluted cities in the world, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) region. People living in the IGP region are expected to lose seven years of their life because of severe air pollution, according to an analysis conducted by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) released last year. The analysis said there has been a 72% increase in pollution between 1998 and 2016 in the region which accounts for 40% of the country’s population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-raises-risk-of-covid-19-deaths-study/story-yOAxKJwpJSVezxgfdIKOLJ.html
08-04-2020||India||Donald Trump reverses course, supports India’s position on hydroxychloroquine||US President Donald Trump today changed course and supported the Narendra Modi government stand on hydroxychloroquine and ended up praising India’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.In an interview to Fox News, Trump said: “ I bought millions of doses. More than 29 million. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi, a lot of it comes out of India. I asked him if he would release it? He was great. He was really good. You know they put a stop because they wanted it for India. But there is a lot of good things coming from that. Lot of people looking at it and saying, you know I don’t hear bad stories, I hear good stories. And I don’t hear anything where it was causing death. So it is not something like….You know we are doing vaccines. Johnson and Johnson, they need to test that. It seems malaria affected counties are unaffected where it is common.”While President Trump had talked about possible retaliation against India on Monday on hydroxychloroquine, fact is that India had already informed the State Department about the change in drug policy much earlier.Also Watch | Donald Trump hints at ‘retaliation’ if India withholds hydroxychloroquine exports “We don’t want to be bracketed with China when the world is facing the pandemic. We have commitments and responsibility to countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and all those who are dependent on Indian drugs,” said a senior government official.Even as he praised the Indian stand on hydroxychloroquine, President Trump has gone after both WHO and China, virtually accusing them of keeping the world in dark about the epidemic. The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?He was joined by Senator Jim Risch, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who called for an independent investigation into the WHO handling of the COVID-19 response. He said : “ The WHO has failed not only the American people, it has failed the world with its flagrant mishandling of the response to COVID-19. Dr Tedros Adganom Ghebreyessus’ apparent unwillingness to hold the Chinese Communist Party to even the minimum stand of global health and transparency hindered the world’s ability to blunt the spread of this pandemic. It is completely unacceptable that the world’s global health organization has become a political puppet of the Chinese Government.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also asked for a rebuilding of the WHO in his speech at the G-20 last month as he felt that the 20th century organization needed serious overhauling.India’s decision to permit export of hydroxychloroquine and other drugs has also been cheered Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. In a letter to PM Modi, President Bolsonaro compared India drug supply to his country as Sanjeevani Booti brought by Lord Hanuman to save life of Lakshman, brother of Lord Ram on Hanuman Jayanti Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/donald-trump-reverses-course-supports-india-s-position-on-hydroxychloroquine/story-Gcunil3N9ZA3s0nvisl9kO.html

The recommendation from MEA came after a request from the Japanese mission in Delhi for sending their citizens back to their home country in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak.“The only condition was that none of such foreigners should have symptoms of coronavirus infection. We got all the seven Japanese citizens thoroughly checked by the doctors here and no symptoms of Covid-19 were found in any of them. Subsequently, they were sent to Delhi on a chartered flight arranged by Japanese mission in India. From Delhi, another chartered Japanese flight will take them home,” Shukla said, adding that more such Japanese citizens would reach Delhi from Surat, Rajasthan and other states.As per available information, four of the seven Japanese citizens evacuated from Jamshedpur worked in a Tata Steel-Nippon Steel joint venture company, two in Tata Refractories and the other Japanese citizen was supervising the overall operation of Nippon Steel in Jamshedpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-japanese-sent-back-from-jamshedpur-during-covid-19-lockdown-after-request-from-japan/story-YbKessFeGZvQpCmWaHt9LI.html

Remaining 270 sample results are awaited. The CM had earlier said that stern action would be taken against anybody who tried to identify a particular community with the spread of the virus.On Tuesday, Karnataka government said 12 new Covid-19 positive cases have been recorded in the state, taking the total to a cumulative 175 which includes four deaths and 25 discharges after successful treatment. Among the 12 new cases, six are those who have had a travel history to the Delhi event. All of them have been quarantined at isolation facilities of designated hospitals in respective districts.Meanwhile, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee President DK Shivakumar opposed any move to cut the salaries of the government employees.

The stringent action was taken by the Uttarakhad Police after 24-hour ultimatum given to the Jamaatis to present themselves before the administration for medical examination ended.Uttarakhand’s director general of police (DGP), Anil Kumar Raturi, had released a video message on Sunday evening asking all the Jamaatis to come out of hiding by Monday evening and present themselves before administration for required medical examination and quarantine for checking the spread of Covid-19 virus. He had warned the Jamaatis would be booked under attempt to murder or murder charges in case anybody gets infected from the deadly virus due to their negligence or dies after getting the infection.“After the deadline ended on April 6 evening, we found two Jamaatis - one each in Roorkee and Haridwar - hiding. They were then tracked down on the basis of their call details record and nabbed before being booked for attempt to murder under Section 307 of the IPC,” said Ashok Kumar, director general (law & order), Uttarakhand Police.“After being nabbed, they have been now put in institutional quarantine for required medical examination,” Kumar added.He also said that 180 Jamaatis presented themselves before administration before the 24-hour deadline ended.“Of these 180 Jamaatis, maximum 151 were from Haridwar, followed by 12 from Nainital, nine from Dehradun and seven from Pauri Garhwal districts. All of them have been quarantined and are being examined for possible Covid-19 infection by the health department officials,” said Kumar.He further said, “Police are keeping an eye on about 300 Jamaatis from Uttarakhand who are in other states to ensure that they don’t enter here discreetly and get into hiding. As warned, anyone found doing so will be booked under attempt to murder.”Uttarakhand Police have so far identified 708 members of various Jamaats or congregations - 383 were residents of the state who had gone to other states and 325 from other states had come to Uttarakhand to attend congregations after March 1. Kumar informed that the police had also booked four people in Laksar, Haridwar for “giving shelter to Jamaatis in their home despite the warning given”.“Earlier we had booked 41 Jamaatis for trying to enter the state discreetly through jungles along the railway tracks. We have also booked 44 people for spreading rumours on Covid-19 on social media in the state,” said Kumar. Of the 31 Covid-19 positive patients in Uttarakhand, 24 are Jamaatis. Following the significant number of positive cases among Jamaatis, the administration has put restrictions on people’s movement in certain areas of the state, where they are living.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-police-start-booking-jamaatis-in-hiding-under-attempt-to-murder-charge/story-cdKQvvwPjoGTU7dD8ClG4O.html
08-04-2020||India||Kashmir hospital uses innovative way to collect swabs from suspected Covid-19 patients||A hospital in Jammu and Kashmir’s Baramulla district has started using an innovative method inspired by other countries to collect swabs from suspected Covid-19 patients.The facility was started only two days ago at the hospital affiliated with the Government Medical College in Baramulla and doctors and virologists have already collected 45 samples from suspected patients.A small aluminium and glass cubicle is used by a trained doctor or virologists to collect the swabs from the suspected Covid-19 patients in the open air rather than inside a laboratory. Dr Masood, the hospital’s medical superintendent, said the new testing method was adopted after they saw some of their peers doing the same in other countries.“For the safety of our staff, it was mandatory to devise a new technique for the collection of swabs as while collecting the samples, the doctors and paramedics are at the most risk,’’ Masood said while speaking with HT.He added that after looking at the design of the collection cubicle in other countries, the doctors got the plan and then a cubicle was made at the local level using aluminium and glass which keeps doctors and virologists at an arm’s length from the Covid-19 patients and “Thankfully, it has been a success,” he said.Also read: Spike in ceasefire violations by Pakistan amid Covid outbreakMedical superintendent Masood said that doctors and paramedics are taking special care and precautions.“We have 18 Covid-19 patients admitted in the hospital and other 19 are under isolation. This new technique of collection of swabs will help us saving doctors and paramedics and also the PPEs,” he said.He said that they have decided to collect swabs in the open at an isolated place within the hospital premises as it is more secure there than taking swabs inside any room.“Our main focus is to go for innovative things. We just saw the design on social media and got it prepared at the local level and fortunately it’s working,’’ he said adding that hospital is the only health institute in entire J&K to use this method.“Hope others will follow for the safety of doctors and paramedics.”Baramulla is one of the biggest centres in the Valley where Covid-19 patients are admitted.But the hospital is not designated as a separate Covid-19 hospital and other surgeries and patient care is also being conducted posing risk to other patients and attendants there.Also read: Spike in Covid cases in J&K due to intensified contact tracing, testing, says GC Murmu“The government should either dedicate this hospital as an exclusive Covid-19 hospital or designate any other neighbouring hospital as Covid-19 hospital and god forbid if one doctor or paramedic turns positive this hospital which caters to the entire north Kashmir will get defunct,’’ said a senior doctor.Only a year ago, the Baramulla hospital was attached to the medical college and has the infrastructure of that of a district hospital.Jammu and Kashmir has reported 125 coronavirus disease cases and three deaths—two from Baramulla district and one from Bandipore.

Claiming that the Goa government was itself going through an economic crisis, the chief minister said people should not wait in anticipation that it will be able to offer relief. “Because of Covid-19 everybody’s business is in a loss.

08-04-2020||India||Podcast: Pallavi Raghavan on an Alternative History of India-Pakistan Relations||When it comes to the matter of relations between India and Pakistan, you’ve heard all of the familiar tropes. Two nuclear-armed rivals with hundreds of thousands of troops amassed along a contested border. A Hindu-majority India pre-destined to be at odds with a Muslim-majority Pakistan. A vibrant democracy in the east, a military-dominated polity in the west. A new book by the historian Pallavi Raghavan offers a very different account about relations between these two South Asian rivals in the immediate aftermath of Partition in 1947. Contrary to the conventional doom-and-gloom narrative, Raghavan’s book “Animosity at Bay: An Alternative History of the India-Pakistan Relationship, 1947-1952” shows how amity and a spirit of cordiality infused relations between India and Pakistan in the first five years of their independence. This week on the podcast, Milan Vaishnav (Director of the South Asia programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace) speaks with Pallavi about her book and the lessons it holds for today. The two discuss why yet another book on India-Pakistan relations was necessary, how India and Pakistan developed constructive relations in the wake of the traumas of Partition, and why the declining power of the state explains the difference in bilateral ties between the 1950s and today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pallavi-raghavan-on-an-alternative-history-of-india-pakistan-relations/story-sQhprrMjLWTOqLfebUubJK.html

The move is aimed at intensifying the fight against coronavirus.Addressing a press conference in state capital Lucknow, principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that during management of Covid-19 positive patients, health teams detected that several people were asymptomatic. But when their swab and samples were sent for laboratory tests, the reports confirmed that they were coronavirus positive. The relatives and close contacts of the positive patients, too, had no symptoms but tests confirmed that they too were positive for the virus, he said.The health department has now decided to keep asymptomatic people in the isolation wards for treatment. It has already reserved 10,000 beds in government hospitals and health centres in the 75 districts of the state for admission of positive cases. The department has decided to reserve another 10,000 beds for the admission of people who are asymptomatic.The district magistrates have been directed to acquire lodges, hotels and guest houses near hospitals for admission of such cases. The plan is to reserve 10,000 beds in hotels, guest houses and private premises to set up isolation wards. The state government has issued an order to the district magistrates to start acquisition of such premises in their districts, Prasad said.During the lockdown, a large numbers of people are facing mental tension and loneliness. The health department has appointed 100 counsellors to help such people. It is already providing health advice to people on its helpline - 1800-180-5145.The health department has also amended its strategy in relation to coronavirus positive cases in 37 districts. In some districts merely one or two positive cases have been reported. Rather than starting a 30-bed hospital for a single patient, the department has decided to assemble the patients in a single hospital.Treatment of patients in a single hospital will ensure better management of human resource and equipment, Prasad said.He said 137 hospitals in the state were ready to treat coronavirus patients. These hospitals include medical colleges of Prayagraj, Meerut, Jhansi, BRD Medical College Gorakhpur, SGPGI, Lucknow, Saifai Medical Institute in Etawah and Jhansi.The 750 beds in the hospitals have ventilators. At present, around 300 patients are admitted in the hospitals but none of them are on ventilator, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hotels-lodges-to-be-part-of-up-govt-s-20-000-bed-plan-to-fight-covid-19/story-CmXJPltRLfIiuwyIaeZj7K.html

08-04-2020||India||Spike in ceasefire violations by Pakistan amid Covid outbreak||There has been an unusual spike in ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army on the Line of Control (LoC) this year to help infiltrators sneak into Jammu and Kashmir compared to border violations in the previous years, two senior officers familiar with the matter said on Tuesday on condition of anonymity.The neighbouring army has carried out more ceasefire violations during January-March this year compared to the corresponding periods of the previous two years. Local recruitment of terrorists in J&K, however, has declined this year, figures show.Pakistan violated the ceasefire 1,144 times between January and March, with the highest number of violations (411) being recorded last month when Covid-19 cases started peaking globally, said the first officer cited above. It has carried out 53 cease-fire violations this month (as of April 6).Figures obtained by HT show that the Pakistan army violated the ceasefire 685 times in 2019 and 627 times in 2018 for the period January to March.The world is fighting the Covid-19 outbreak using all available resources but Pakistan is focused on pushing in terrorist infiltrators into the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir to foment trouble, said the second officer cited above. Pakistan carried out 1,629 cease-fire violations in 2018 and 3,168 violations in 2019, compared to 1,197 this year.The army has been dealing with an increase in infiltration attempts by Pakistan-backed terrorists looking to stir trouble in J&K since the Centre’s move revoking the special status of the state on August 5, 2019. Experts said Pakistan was trying its best to reinvigorate the terror machinery in J&K to destabilise the border region.Five commandos belonging to an elite army Special Forces (SF) unit were killed in action along the LoC in Kashmir’s Keran sector on Sunday during an intense close-quarters battle with an equal number of terrorist infiltrators who were all eliminated.Lieutenant General Satish Dua (retd), a former commander of the Srinagar-based HQs 15 Corps, told Hindustan Times on Monday that this is the first summer after the removal of Article 370 and Pakistan army will surely step up efforts to push in terrorists to create trouble.An Army officer said on Monday that Pakistan and its army are fomenting terrorism in India to hide its failure to fight Covid-19. “The Indian Army is not only fighting Covid with utmost professionalism both in India and in neighbouring countries but it is also concurrently defeating Pakistan’s evil designs along the LoC and in Jammu and Kashmir,” he said, asking not to be named.The security forces have killed 41 terrorists in J&K this year so far compared to 152 terrorists in 2019 and 215 in 2018, according to official figures. Local recruitment of terrorists has shown a declining trend this year -- only six joined terror outfits as of April 7 (compared to 119 in entire 2019).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spike-in-ceasefire-violations-by-pakistan-amid-covid-outbreak/story-cj0XCSuUGTqWv7WEf2jf1O.html
08-04-2020||India||Mehbooba Mufti moved from jail to home, still in detention||Mehbooba Mufti, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) head, has been shifted to her residence in Srinagar, where she will continue to remain under detention, an official order issued on Tuesday said.The government order said the Peoples Democratic Party leader is being moved from a subsidiary jail on MA Road in Srinagar to her Fairview residence that will serve as a subsidiary jail.According to an official order issued by the home department of the Union Territory, “The government hereby orders the change of place of lodgement of Ms Mehbooba Mufti... to subsidiary jail, Fairview, Gupkar Road, Srinagar, with immediate effect.” Mehbooba Mufti, who was charged under the Public Safety Act, has been under detention since August 5 last year, when the Constitution’s Article 370 was scrapped and Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two Union territories.Mufti’s daughter, Iltija Mufti, tweeted to thank the media and ask for privacy.“My gratitude to the media in Kashmir for their concern & well wishes. May I please humbly request that you give the family privacy as we wait for her to come home today. Please remember this isn’t a release & the house has been declared as a subsidiary jail,” she said.While two other former chief ministers and National Conference leaders, Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, were released earlier, Mufti continues to remain under detention.Reacting to the development, former CM Omar Abduallah said that his political rival should be released and the PSA slapped on her should be revoked.“@MehboobaMufti must be set free. Shifting her home while continuing to keep her detained is a cop out (sic),” Abdullah tweeted reacting to the news of her being shifted.Mufti’s daughter Iltija Mufti, too, has moved the Supreme Court challenging her mother’s detention and leaders across the political spectrum in J&K have sought the release of Mufti and a host of other political leaders including Bilal Lone, Shah Feasal and Naeem Akhtar.The Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference (JKPC) chief spokesperson Junaid Azim Mattu also commented on the same and said the continued detention of Mufti, and JKPC chairman Sajad Lone - who is under house arrest - and other mainstream politicians was “authoritarian”.A three-judge bench had issued a notice to the Jammu and Kashmir administration seeking its response on the plea and posted the matter for a hearing on March 18. However, the petition was not taken up for hearing due to the coronavirus outbreak.Habeas corpus is a writ seeking production of a person supposed to be in illegal detention before a court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-moved-from-jail-to-home-still-in-detention/story-sPI4mSzE4e6CN1Ty598eQK.html
08-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: India partially eases restrictions on export of anti-malarial drug||India has partially eased restrictions on export of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol, cited by some as key to the fight against Covid-19, to fulfil existing orders and to meet the needs of neighbouring countries, but only after building its own stockpile of the drug. The move came late on Monday, hours ahead of a conference by US President Donald Trump, who spoke of “retaliation” if India didn’t do so. People familiar with developments, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said existing orders from other countries, including the US, for hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol will be cleared only after meeting all domestic requirements.The external affairs ministry said the two drugs will be supplied in “appropriate quantities” to all neighbouring countries dependent on India’s capabilities.India, the largest producer of hydroxychloroquine, initially banned exports of the drug on March 25 to ensure adequate domestic supplies. Rules were tightened on April 4 by barring exports from special economic zones (SEZs) and export-oriented units (EOUs), where such bans don’t usually apply.However, Trump and Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro called on India to permit the supply of the drug to cope with Covid-19 cases in their countries. Early on Tuesday, Trump spoke about “retaliation” if India didn’t lift its hold on US orders.But even before Trump warned India of retaliation, the Modi government had communicated to all countries, including the US, the change in policy to facilitate supply of critical drugs through institutionalised channels. The empowered committee chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided on Monday to lift export restrictions on 14 drugs and to licence the export of hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol after reconciling with domestic demand.One of the people cited above, who declined to be named, said: “There has been a partial lifting of the ban, but (export of) hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol exports will continue to be restricted. Depending on availability of stocks of hydroxychloroquine after meeting domestic requirements, existing orders will be cleared.”The department of pharmaceuticals under the ministry of chemicals and fertilizers and the external affairs ministry will decide on allocations on a case-to-case basis in view of the humanitarian situation related to the pandemic, the people said.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said paracetamol and hydroxychloroquine “will be kept in a licenced category and their demand position would be continuously monitored”. He added, “However, the stock position could allow our companies to meet the export commitments that they had contracted.”Srivastava said India had decided to “licence paracetamol and hydroxychloroquine in appropriate quantities to all our neighbouring countries who are dependent on our capabilities”.Explaining the government’s move, a senior South Block official said: “It is not only about hydroxychloroquine or the US. The Indian pharmaceutical industry supplies HIV drugs to South Africa, paracetamol to the UK and 80% of all drugs to the neighbourhood and it will supply hydroxychloroquine to the US, Spain, Germany and Brazil.”Behind Modi’s decision on easing the export ban is also the message that India won’t walk out of commitments on critical drugs.The Indian Council of Medical Research has said: “Hydroxychloroquine is found to be effective against coronavirus in laboratory and in-vivo studies.” India’s National Taskforce for Covid-19 has recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for infections among “asymptomatic health care workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19” and “asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-partially-eases-restrictions-on-export-of-anti-malarial-drug/story-61CoIkZoJrk5sRwqjaoahM.html
08-04-2020||India||Test, trace, treat in Delhi’s 5T plan||New Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday laid out a five-point blueprint to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), declaring that testing will be ramped up and the scope of treatment widened – an indication that the Capital was bracing for the possible ballooning of the pathogen that has ravaged several metropolises across the world.Fifty one new cases were reported in Delhi on Tuesday, taking the total in the Capital to 576, out of which 333 patients are linked to the mid-March congregation of a Muslim missionary group, Tablighi Jamaat, in Nizamuddin that has now become the country’s largest hot spot for Covid-19 infections. At a news briefing, the chief minister said that Delhi has formed a “5T plan” — testing, tracing, treatment, teamwork, and tracking — and that his government was prepared to scale up resources to treat up to 30,000 active Covid-19 patients at the same time, if needed. “The first T is testing. If you don’t test, you won’t be able to find out which houses have been affected. It will go on spreading. South Korea identified every single individual through large scale testing. We are now going to do mass testing like South Korea,” Kejriwal said.He said the countries that did not conduct wide testing before infections climbed were unable to control the imminent spiraling of the disease. “We have ordered kits for the testing of 50,000 people. The kits have started arriving. We have also placed orders for the rapid test of 100,000 people. The deliveries of kits will begin by Friday. Random tests will be done at hot spots. Detailed tests will also be done.”On Monday, Kejriwal said rapid testing will be doubled from next week – from around 500 samples per day to 1,000 samples per day.Several public health experts have said that aggressive testing is the mainstay in the battle against the highly contagious disease that has killed at least 77,000 people globally because the infection often spreads undetected.South Korea and Germany have led the charge in mass testing, which has helped control the spread of new infections over time, and more importantly, kept the fatality rate low.“The second T is tracing,” Kejriwal said. “Tracing is being carried out at a very good level in Delhi and now we have started taking help from the police as well to check if the people who have been traced are staying under self-quarantine.”Kejriwal said that the government has so far given contact numbers of 27,702 people for tracing to the Delhi Police. A person’s movement can be tracked through their phone, he added. “Today, we are going to give 2,000 phone numbers of people who were brought out of Markaz to find out if they roamed in the area around Markaz. The areas they went out to, will be sealed and monitored.”The recent spike in infections has largely been propelled by the detection of hundreds of patients who attended gatherings of the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi’s Nizamuddin Basti last month in a violation of several restrictions. Cases linked to the meet have been reported across two dozen states and Union Territories so far. “Our third T is treatment,” Kejriwal said. “If someone gets infected with Covid-19, then we will have to provide that person with treatment. Delhi has 525 positive Covid-19 cases so far and we have made arrangements for 3,000 beds.”He said the Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (1,500 beds), GB Pant Hospital (500) and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (450) have been declared as dedicated facilities to treat the new disease. The government has also earmarked 400 beds at three private hospitals – Max Saket (318 beds), Apollo (50 beds) and Sir Ganga Ram Kolmet Hospital (42 beds). “At present, there are 2,950 beds reserved for Covid-19 cases. If the number of patients crosses 3,000, we will use 1,500 beds at GTB (Guru Tegh Bahadur) hospital, following which we will have arrangements for 4,500 cases,” Kejriwal said.“In this manner, we can go up to 30,000 beds if needed. We will have 8,000 beds at hospitals,12,000 hotel rooms will be taken over, and around 10,000 patients will be kept in banquet halls and dharamshalas. Most serious patients with heart, liver, cancer, diabetes and above 50 years of age will be kept in hospitals. Patients below 50 years and with minor symptoms will be kept in hotels and dharamshalas, but with all medical facilities,” he added.A spokesperson at Max Healthcare said: “We believe that to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, it is essential for us to have dedicated hospitals. We are working closely with the Govt of Delhi and have established a dedicated COVID 19 facility at Max Hospital Saket, East Block.”A review of Delhi’s preparedness by a five-member expert panel recently showed that Delhi’s current facilities would be able to handle 100 cases of Covid-19 every day. While detailing the findings of the review, Kejriwal had said that the Capital needed to be ready for the worst scenario and that his government was in the process of ramping up the health care infrastructure.Experts maintain that it important for Delhi to massively upgrade its infrastructure to pre-empt a crisis similar to the one that has befallen New York, which has in the past boasted of hi-tech hospitals. With the Covid-19 cases skyrocketing, New York’s health care system is overwhelmed and teetering on the brink of collapse.Late in March, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said that the strained health care system had the personnel and supplies to make it through only one more week, but beyond that, things appeared uncertain.In Delhi, Kejriwal said that 400 ventilators and 1,200 oxygen beds will be needed if there are 30,000 active patients in Delhi and arrangements were being made.“Calculations have been done regarding PPE (personal protective equipment) kits. It has been an area of concern. We have received help from the Centre and we have placed an order for the kits which we’ll start to receive from next week. The Centre will be providing 27,000 PPE kits to us,” said Kejriwal.The CM said that the fourth T was teamwork, and stressed on cooperation between the Centre and state governments, and the public and health care professions.The fifth T, he said, is tracking and monitoring. “I have spoken so much, but these things need to be tracked and monitored as well and it’s my responsibility to track the moment-to-moment plan we have prepared. I am tracking it 24 hours. We can win this battle as a team if we remain three steps ahead of Covid-19,” he added.A senior official in the chief minister’s office said that Kejriwal’s first briefing every day is scheduled through a conference call with the health department at 10am. It is compulsory for the health minister, the chief secretary and the health secretary to be part of it. Usually, he prepares his briefs and joins the lieutenant governor’s meeting after that through video-conferencing. Later in the day, the CM heads review meetings with representatives of the state task force that he heads, the official said on condition of anonymity.Health experts and private hospitals welcomed the action plan presented on Tuesday.Nevin Kishore, head of the bronchology department at Delhi’s Max Hospital, said: “Random tests are important to understand the burden of the disease and the severity of the patients who are positive. Such understanding helps in designing predictive models for prevention, something very crucial in the next 7-10 days.”Vikas Maurya, head of the pulmonology at Delhi’s Fortis Hospital, said: “Rapid antibody tests result is a faster diagnosis. It is faster, cheaper and accurate – a smart way strategy in dealing with a large number of potential patients in cluster hotspots. There is one issue. This test is more accurate when dealing with a person who is infected for at least 8-9 days. Negative results may require repetition of tests after certain intervals.”Charu Hans, former head of the microbiology department at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, said: “We have limited resources, so we need a smart strategy. One has to have a clear protocol on what nature of individuals is to be tested under the said strategy. At this juncture, it is recommended to conduct tests only among symptomatic individuals in hot spots.”Jugal Kishore, head of the department, community medicine, at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “Simple random sampling is a scientific method and can provide a signal on possible community spread. But, when there is a resource constraint; the government should explore the possibility of conducting snowball sampling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/test-trace-treat-in-delhi-s-5t-plan/story-sot7eq17egdVuZsyTwhEZL.html
08-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Centre considering pleas by states to prolong lockdown||The Centre is considering extending the three-week nationwide lockdown over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak after some states favoured its enforcement beyond April 14, while also weighing the option of lifting the restrictions in a staggered manner, officials said on Tuesday, when the number of cases in the country crossed 5,000.Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka have informed New Delhi that the threat of Covid-19 would be easier to handle if the lockdown, which took effect on March 25, remains in force for a longer duration, an official said on condition of anonymity.Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, too, have favoured an extension of the lockdown. Even states such as Punjab, which haven’t been as forthcoming, favour maintaining the restrictions, the official added. The number of Covid-19 cases in India on Tuesday reached 5,305 and 160 have so far died of the highly infectious disease. There is concern that once the lockdown is lifted and free public movement is allowed, it could lead to a spike in the number of cases of the disease, frittering away the gains from the lockdown.At the same time, however, there are worries that continuing with a strict lockdown could cause long-term damage to the economy -- in terms of personal finance, the administering of states, and business activity in key sectors that are already reeling from the sudden halt in economic activity.One of the big questions will be lives versus livelihoods, according to Niti Aayog member Dr Vinod Paul, who is also the head of one of the empowered groups on the matter. “We are assessing the cost of the lockdown economically with the lives that need to be saved,” he said.A decision on what to unlock, and when to unlock it, will also be driven by the numbers and how India stands in terms of the Covid-19 spread towards the end of this week, a second official said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 announced the lockdown aimed at breaking the chain of infections, halting flights, trains and road transport, shutting all but essential services, and stressed the need for social distancing to be strictly observed to curb the spread of the disease.On Tuesday, a Group of Ministers led by defence minister Rajnath Singh met at his residence to discuss the various factors that would need to be considered once the lockdown was lifted. “The ministers were very clear that even if the lockdown is lifted, travel restrictions will remain,” said an official.The meeting is the fourth held by the GoM. Home minister Amit Shah and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman attended Tuesday’s meeting along with 14 other ministers, who discussed in what form travel should be allowed. “Trains and buses will not be back to normal,’’ an official aware of the developments said on condition of anonymity. “Air traffic will also be disrupted. The public should expect a slow, staggered return to a new normal.’’The government was also considering the option of lifting the lockdown only in phases, with those districts where no cases have been reported likely to be the first to see resumption of some services.One key concern that was flagged in the meeting was that the farm sector is still struggling. The sector has been particularly hit hard by a disruption of the farm-to-fork supply chain in the absence of workers, mainly migrants who have returned home in the aftermath the lockdown, to harvest the winter-sown rabi crops and transport to carry the produce to agricultural markets.The ministers were briefed that some concessions extended to agriculture were “not filtering down”, another second official said. For instance, on March 28, the government exempted farm work from the lockdown and said that activities such as sowing of crops and harvesting should be allowed, and fertiliser and pesticide shops could stay open. However, more than a week later, it doesn’t seem to have helped. “The labour who would have worked on the fields were too scared and were not going back to work,’’ said this person.This was an issue that the ministers were hoping to troubleshoot with the home ministry and other officials soon.In the same way, the lack of labour is also affecting the supply of medicines. While there is no shortage of drugs, said the official, there was a shortage of people to transport them.The official said the substance of the ministers’ discussion would be conveyed to Prime Minister Modi, who is expected to shortly decide whether or not to extend the lockdown.Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, when asked about the extension of the lockdown, said at a daily briefing: “The chief secretary has already given a statement. Once a decision is taken on this, we will convey it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-considering-pleas-by-states-to-prolong-lockdown/story-iv73GIWJIXPMZeHIfSC0KI.html
08-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Tuesday, India removed some restrictions on the export of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which some people, including US President Donald Trump, believe to be the miracle cure for Covid-19. There’s no scientific evidence of this yet, but that hasn’t stopped some countries from trying to source more of the drug.India is the world’s largest manufacturer of hydroxychloroquine. It is also the world’s largest exporter of it. As interest around the miracle drug soared, India, on March 25, banned the exports of hydroxychloroquine and any formulation containing it — including exports from special economic zones. That blocked pending orders, including one from the US.Over the weekend, Trump spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asked for the ban to be removed for US orders. On Monday, in usual fashion, he threatened “retaliation” if India didn’t do this, and also threw in a bit about how India has had the better of the US on the trade front (by then, India had already removed some of the restrictions). Hindustan Times learns that India has received requests for hydroxychloroquine from 20 countries, an indication of just how desperate governments around the world are to explore any possible cure for the pandemic that has infected 1.39 million people and killed over 79,000 around the world.On Tuesday, India said it would stockpile enough of the drug for domestic use, and then, depending on availability, allow exporters to start servicing open orders. The decision on who to export to (and how much) will be taken by the department of pharmaceuticals.India is the world’s generics factory — and it doesn’t get enough credit for this, something not entirely explained by the fact that some Indian pharma companies have had regulatory and quality issues. Cipla’s Yusuf Hamied made AIDS drugs affordable, helping, among other countries, South Africa, but he did so after a bruising fight with Big Pharma.Even as it does its duty as a responsible power by helping other countries, India should use this opportunity to drive a hard bargain (or two) — for instance, there are key drugs, including those for cancer, that it should see to bring under the purview of either compulsory licensing or voluntary licensing, something that would make them accessible to millions of Indians. Indeed, India’s strong research and manufacturing base for generics, healthy vaccine development and manufacturing ecosystem, and natural advantages when it comes to clinical testing stand to give it an advantage (and a bargaining chip) in the post-Covid world.Speaking of demand for hydroxychloroquine, India’s health ministry itself wants to build a stockpile of 100 million tablets. This is part of its planning for a worst-case scenario.Our growing understanding (it’s still limited) of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, suggests that it makes sense to prepare for the worst. New research at the University of Texas at Austin seems to suggest that, in the US, even one case in a county could mean a 51% chance of an outbreak in that area. The researchers assumed that only a tenth of the cases are tested and reported — because many infections are mild, and many of the infected, asymptomatic (today’s opportune moment to remind everyone why masks are a must).Our growing understanding of Sars-CoV-2 is also beginning to help us understand that this virus is more virulent, more dangerous, and, worryingly, much more evasive than its predecessor (in terms of vintage as well as terminology), Sars-CoV-1, the virus which caused a Sars outbreak in 2002-04. Like Sars-CoV-2, that virus too originated in China, and infected over 8,000 people in around 30 countries, killing 774.Sun Tzu said it. As did Green Day.

08-04-2020||India||Approved PPE kits to have unique code and stickers||Manufacturers of personal protective equipment (PPE) will now need to mark their products with a unique code and tamper-proof stickers, the textile ministry has said. This comes after reports emerged that unapproved products were being sold in the market.Healthcare workers are at most risk of infection as they come in close contact with Covid-19 patients. With a global shortage of PPE that is supposed to protect them, the demand for such equipment has grown exponentially in hospitals and among sanitation workers who are called on to disinfect high risk areas.The move, ministry officials said, was to tighten the production of PPE among Indian manufacturers and producers in line with the specifications of the World Health Organisation and the union ministry of health and welfare.The ministry, in a notification issued on April 6, said the Unique Certification Code (UCC-COVID19) will apply to PPE garments and fabric which pass the laboratory tests laid down by the South India Textile Research Association (SITRA) as well as the the Defence Research & Development Establishment (DRDE). The Code will record the type of garment, its test procedure, date of test. The certification will be valid for a certain time period and both SITRA and DRDE will preserve the sample sent by the producer, said the notification, accessed by HT.Approvals for the manufacturing of PPEs and the fabrics used in making them are given by the Coimbatore-based SITRA, an autonomous body under the textiles ministry and the Gwalior-based DRDE.Another directive was that in the case of coveralls, the manufacturer will print in indelible ink or in a tamper-proof sticker details such as name of producer, code, test standard, batch number, order details.A ministry official, on the condition of anonymity, told HT that the move was prompted by news reports of some of those rejected by SITRA and DRDE supplying their units to private hospitals. The directives have now been sent to states, too.Nihar Ranjan Dash, joint secretary at the textiles ministry said that the certification mainly concerns coveralls and fabric provided by certain manufacturers to producers of PPEs. “The directive does not concern masks, as they are certified by the Bureau of Indian Standards. All this while, as we relied on imports, the specifications were of international standards,” said Dash.He added that the tightening of norms will also help Indian manufacturers prepare for the global market. The current capacity of the Indian industry is 12,000 units per day, but Dash said that in about three months, India has the production capacity of 300,000 PPEs per day.An official of one of the testing agencies told HT, on the condition of anonymity, that the two specific tests that are applied are the synthetic blood penetration test in the case of coveralls and the bacterial efficiency test in the case of masks. “A severe shortage of N95 masks has been a concern as there are just a handful of producers,” said the officials.Since India began domestic production of PPE in March, these two testing agencies have approved 28 manufacturers with non-woven textiles such as masks and coveralls, and additionally approved 22 manufacturers of the fabric that is supplied to some of these producers.The official of the testing agency said that in the beginning, only 50% of manufacturers passed the test. “The success rate now is over 80 percent,” the official said.M Rajaa of Coimbatore-based Saastha Textiles, one of the approved manufacturers of waterproof, laminated thermoplastic polyurethane and thermoplastic elastomers fabric in knitted, woven and non-woven fabric used in PPE units, told HT that the fabric needs to have a certain type of lamination to ensure that blood and virus do not contaminate a healthcare worker. “We also need to use only polypropylene virgin material to ensure that the material is protective and some manufacturers are also using reprocessed materials,” said Rajaa.Parag of Sai Synergy, a producer of PPEs, said that their products have been ordered by the Indian Navy before and hence their products carry a sticker. “The sticker has to be put during the manufacturing process and cannot be put there after,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/approved-ppe-kits-to-have-unique-code-and-stickers/story-ERWavSWn1Fdvrw1xNyW03J.html
08-04-2020||India||Oppn may raise MPLADS issue at all-party meet with PM Modi||An all party meeting called by the Prime Minister on Wednesday may see opposition parties pushing back against the central government’s decision to suspend the Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) scheme for two years, transferring the funds to the Consolidated Fund of India to help with the fight against Covid-19. Some opposition MPs have already gone public with their criticism of the move, but members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party say they are merely politicising the issue. MPLADS money usually goes towards development work in the constituency of MPs, each of whom receive Rs 5 crore a year towards this. On Monday, the union cabinet decided to suspend the scheme for two years and transfer the amount, around Rs 7900 to the CFI. While Congress president Sonia Gandhi was silent on the issue in her letter to the Prime Minister, many of her party’s leaders have expressed disappointment at the suspension of the scheme. Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari on Tuesday shot off a letter to the Prime Minister, requesting him to reconsider the decision.Many MPs said the funds helped them provide immediate relief to people in their constituencies and said they will not be able to fulfil their duties as elected representatives if the scheme is suspended.Sonia Gandhi on March 27, offered her MPLADS fund to the Rae Bareli district magistrate towards fighting the coronavirus in her constituency. . CPIM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that if the government diverted MPLADS money to the Consolidated Fund of India, “it will be used to clean up the economic mess”.“The states and the MPs at the local level need the fund as they know where to use it. The government is denying the states and the MPs the opportunity,” he said, adding that the issue will be raised in the all-party meeting.Trinamool Congress’ Sudip Bandopadhyay said that in addition to raising this, his party’s MPs would demand more funds be given to the states and the clearance of the dues the Centre owes the states. “We will also talk about the MPLADS order as it hampers important work at the ground level against Covid-19.” Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president MK Stalin termed the move “undemocratic” and argued that MPLADS is not an allowance for parliamentarians but funds for projects that are needed by the people in a constituency.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Supriya Sule expressed the hope that the entire amount of MPLAD funds contributed by all Maharashtra MPs of both houses will be used for the welfare of the people of the state.Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena said the Prime Minister should have consulted the leaders of all political parties before taking such a decision.Two BJP MPs said all ruing party MPs support the decision to donate MPLADs as well deductions from their salary for the PMCARES Fund.BJP leader Prabhat Jha, whose term as a Rajya Sabha MP ends this week, said the Congress was politicising an issue that concerns all. “This is a global war and everyone has to fight it. The issue of not donating their MPLADS funds is inappropriate at the moment..”Another BJP MP from Chhattisgarh who did not wish to be named said the bickering over the funds is misplaced: “When the country is fighting an enemy that has brought the whole world to its knees, what can be more important; small works using the MPLADS funds or the bigger necessity of building hospitals, researching vaccines and helping people?”...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-may-raise-mplads-issue-at-all-party-meet-with-pm-modi/story-CalpmVUYNYMEAjCBWsEtwL.html
08-04-2020||India||5-point plan to tackle worst case||New Delhi: India’s health ministry has ordered 107 million tablets of hydroxychloroquine, 16.6 million units of personal protective equipment (PPE), and 48,000 ventilators, and hopes to have everything in place by May 31 -- it’s deadline for scaling up health infrastructure to fight Covid-19.The orders are part of a plan detailing a rapid scale-up that will be required to fight the spread of the pandemic caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus that has infected 5,305 people in the country, and killed 160.The plan also includes enhanced testing -- up to 100,000 a day at the peak -- and drafting final year students of medicine and nursing.Some parts of this plan were already known, but HT spoke to health ministry and other officials engaged in the fight against the pandemic to capture granular details of what the government thinks India needs to fight the pandemic. They described this as a plan that prepares for the worst case scenario, which India may not actually face.There’s a caveat, especially on the equipment front. A country can count international orders in its stockpile only when it gets them in hand in these times, said a consultant with a multinational consulting firm who spoke on condition of anonymity. And while “some of the ventilators being turned out are very good, at least some are being made by companies that do not have much experience in this”, he added.Still, even internationally, companies such as Ford Motor and GM that have no experience are working on a war footing to produce ventilators. The health ministry’s plan has five components.The first is people.India has about 70,000 students in the final year of their MBBS course; about 2.5 lakh final year nursing students; 30,000 in final year dentisty, about 1.8 million registered Ayush (ayurveda, siddha, naturopathy, unani, and homeopathy -- all alternative systems of medicine) practitioners and allied health professionals such as paramedics, technicians and helpers in the field, and an estimated 10,000 physiotherapists. The idea is to involve all of them.The fight against Covid-19 also requires feet on the ground to screen hundreds of thousands of people, and monitor others who are in quarantine. The field surveillance will be done by students of Ayush streams, volunteers from National Service Scheme, Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan, Indian Red Cross Society, National Cadet Corps, workers of sate-owned firms, ambulance drivers, gram panchayats, urban local bodies, rozgar sevaks (workers under MGNREGA in villages), members of resident welfare associations, and observers used during general elections, according to the plan, parts of which were reviewed by HT.“People with medical knowledge can be used for screening , while others can be used for surveillance, which is the mainstay of our Covid-19 management strategy,” a senior health ministry official said on condition of anonymity. The field workers will be supervised by Ayush practitioners, dentists, physiotherapists, veterinarians, and doctors working at the primary health centres in villages, this person added. For testing, local lab technicians and even BSc and M Sc microbiology students will be drafted for collecting, packing, and transporting samples.The states will be involving this workforce as per their requirement.“It’s an excellent idea to list out possible volunteers beforehand because you don’t know which way this pandemic will go. The doctors would also need help -- as the numbers rise they could get tired -- so this is a good way of managing the situation,” said K Sujatha Rao, former health secretary.The plan is to also use medical interns and final year MBBS and nursing students, alongside doctors and other medical staff drawn from the defence forces, the paramilitary and the railways at isolation facilities (hospitals) where confirmed positive cases are being treated.“If the numbers rise, every single medical professional and student will count,” the official added.“Any knowledge workforce is useful in a situation like this, so involving medical students will definitely help. There is a section of doctors trained in intensive care, and post graduate students of fields like anesthesia who can come in handy at this time,” says Dr Devi Prasad Shetty, senior cardiac surgeon, and chairman and founder, Narayana Health.Meanwhile, retired doctors, as well as health care staff above the age of 60 or with known medical conditions will be used to treat non-Covid patients.The second dimension is testing.Since January 24, government and private laboratories approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have tested only around 1,09,536 samples for Covid-19. The plan is to take this up to 100,000 a day (the current daily total is 9,000-11,000).“One lakh tests a day is the worst case scenario; it may or may not be required, but we should be able to perform these many tests, if it’s required, and which is what our labs are staying prepared for.” said an ICMR spokesperson.ICMR has approved at least 200 labs (both public and private) for testing through RT-PCR machines and is in the process of identifying other government and private labs, research institutions and medical colleges that have the capability and infrastructure to undertake testing for inclusion into the Covid-19 testing network.The plan also envisages the laboratories working 24x7 and re-deploying automated and manual RT-PCR machines already in the country, and optimising in-lab processes such as RNA extraction to reduce turnaround time between the time a sample is received and it is tested.ICMR is also procuring 500,000 rapid testing (blood test) kits for mass testing, to be deployed in the worst-affected states. The first lot of these kits, which test for antibodies, is expected this week. However, it is not yet open for everyone, and has been allowed only in large clusters, evacuation centres and migrant worker camps. Experts say a more widespread use of the antibody test will also help scale up testing efforts.“The currently used test – PCR tells us who are currently sick. We are seeing only the tip of the iceberg. The antibody detection blood test will identify people who already have been infected, even those with mild or no symptoms. It will help us to know how many have been able to fight off the infection and have become what is called ‘corona-blocker’,” says Dr Lalit Kant, a senior infectious disease expert.“These tests are expected to be very economical, simple and give results within 15-20 minutes. Indian companies would be able to produce them easily and at massive scale,” he added.The third is hospitals.The centre on Monday released close to ₹3,000 crore under its National Health Mission (NHM) to be distributed among states and UTs. Earlier, about ₹1,100 crore was released for the purpose of Covid-19 management. All states and Union territories have been asked to earmark at least one hospital dedicated to Covid-19 patients. The states have also been given a free hand to procure ventilators, personal protection equipment, masks, gloves and other consumables as per their requirements over and above what the centre is providing them.As of now, about 15,000 ventilators have been identified in various hospitals across the country and set aside for Covid-19 patients.Some states have been temporarily taken over small private hospitals in the districts from where a large number of cases have been reported to be used as dedicated isolation facilities. And many of the big corporate hospitals have already began admitting Covid-19 positive patients, and also are testing samples.“All states have followed the directive, and have been creating dedicated Covid-19 facilities even till district level. These hospitals will only be used to manage positive cases, and we are working with state governments to ensure all these hospitals are equipped with facilities to also handle critical patients such as intensive care unit beds and beds with ventilators,” says Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health and family welfare ministry.Hostels, hotels and lodges are being converted into quarantine facilities to place asymptomatic people under watch for the mandatory 14 days, and if any of them shows symptoms then they are moved to a health care facility for testing, and disease management.“Infrastructure scale up is our focus as now the strategy is to strengthen processes for disease management and surveillance,” said Agarwal.The fourth is drugs, medical devices, and protective equipment.The problem area in terms of medicines is the anti-malaria drug (hydroxychloroquine) that has shown promise in treatment of the disease. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently being given to health care workers, and close contacts (family) of Covid-19 positive patients as part of a demonstration study by ICMR, to know whether it works as a prophylactic drug. And Covid-19 patients in ICUs are being given this medicine along with antibiotic erythromycin . There are about 1.5 million health care workers who have received around 7.5 million HCQ tablets.To meet the shortage of supply, the government has restricted the drug’s export currently and also booked supplies from the two manufactures in India. “We have booked all their supplies- about 107 million tablets, and once they supply this to the government then they are free to export,” said a government official familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.The health ministry has placed orders for 8 million PPEs from Singapore, and is expecting to receive at least one million per week. In all, it has ordered 16.5 million PPEs from global and local firms (some 20 domestic manufacturers have been identified with the help of ministry of textiles).The ministry has also placed an order for 48,000 ventilators and is likely to add more, depending on the requirement. “In China the capacity to produce these items in a day is huge; it is difficult to match up to their level of production; however, our indigenous manufacturers have risen to the occasion. Some from other fields are also chipping in,” the government official added.And the fifth is shortening the time it takes to get innovations related to treatment to the market.The department of science and technology (DST) has set up a Centre for Augmenting WAR with Covid-19 health crisis (CAWACH) at a total cost of Rs 56 Cr to scout for, evaluate and support the innovations and start-ups that address Covid-19 challenges.The Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE), a technology business incubator at IIT Bombay supported by DST has been identified as the Implementing Agency of the CAWACH, and has been asked to encourage innovations in the manufacture of ventilators, diagnostics, therapeutics and informatics.CAWACH aims to identify up to 50 innovations and start-ups that are in the area of novel, low cost, safe and effective ventilators, respiratory aids, protective gear, novel solutions for sanitizers, disinfectants, diagnostics, therapeutics, informatics and any effective interventions“We have been having meetings every day and have come up with strategies to prioritise our research work. The focus has been on developing improved diagnostic kits, looking for novel molecules or re-purposed drugs for the treatment of the disease, and also developing a vaccine,” says Dr Renu Swarup, secretary, department of biotechnology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-point-plan-to-tackle-worst-case/story-KXny1z2wHp3GmAiRjfLDKI.html
08-04-2020||India||In absence of lockdown, one patient can infect 406: Govt study||A person carrying the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is capable of infecting 406 people in 30 days in the absence of a lockdown, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) experts have estimated.That is based on the assumption that  R-naught, or R0, a virus’s basic reproductive number (meaning the number of persons an infected patient can potentially infect) is 2.5.“ICMR has done a study and based on that, if the social exposure is reduced by 75% then an infected person will only infect 2.5 others in a matter of 30 days, telling us about the effects of better implementation of the lockdown and social distancing,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry. India has implemented a total lockdown since March 25, and according to experts, it takes about two weeks to demonstrate the results of such an emergency measure. India has reported 4,421 positive cases of the coronavirus disease, and 117 deaths. In the past 24 hours, 354 new cases were reported from across the country, and as the numbers are rising, healthcare facilities are being assigned to deal with different categories of patients. To streamline coronavirus disease management, and make optimum use of available infrastructure, health facilities have been divided into three crucial groups: Covid Care Centres, Covid Health Centres and Dedicated Covid Hospitals.The Covid care centres will be offering care only for cases that are clinically mild or very mild, or are suspected cases.These could either be makeshift facilities, or can be set up in hostels, hotels, schools, stadiums, lodges and so on., both public and private. The existing quarantine facilities could also be converted into Covid care centres, if required.However, this facility must have separate areas for suspected and confirmed cases, with preferably a separate entry and exit. Suspected and confirmed cases must not be allowed to mix under any circumstances, according to the detailed guideline issued on the functioning of these facilities.This facility will also need to be linked with either a hospital or a health centre to ensure a patient will receive quick treatment in case he or she develops symptoms or mild symptoms turn severe. For the purpose of transportation it will have a dedicated Basic Life Support Ambulance (BLSA) equipped with sufficient oxygen support on a 24X7 basis.The second category is of dedicated Covid health centres that will be proper hospitals meant to admit clinically moderate cases. This will either be a full hospital or a separate block in a hospital with preferably separate entry, exit, and zoning, and would also include private hospitals.These hospitals will have beds with assured oxygen support. Each of these hospitals will be linked with one or more dedicated Covid hospitals so that any patients whose symptoms progress from moderate to severe can be immediately moved.The third category is of dedicated Covid hospitals that will treat only critically ill patients. This will either be a full hospital or a separate block in a hospital. These hospitals, including the private ones, will have fully equipped intensive care units, ventilators and beds with assured oxygen support.All states have been directed to set up separate fever clinics so that there is no intermingling of other patients. The patients will also accordingly be categorized into three categories-- mild, asymptomatic or suspected cases, positive cases with moderate symptoms, and critical cases.The ICMR’s testing capacity has also seen a jump over the past few weeks. Of the total 107,006 samples tested, 11,795 samples were tested between Monday and Tuesday. One hundred and thirty six government labs are currently testing for Covid-19. The 59 approved private laboratories have conducted 2,530 tests so far.Among the cluster containment measures, Agarwal shared some success stories. “Agra (Uttar Pradesh), GB Nagar (Uttar Pradesh), Bhilwara (Rajasthan), East Delhi and Pathanamthitta (Kerala) clusters have been contained due to the proactive measures taken by the states at the ground level. We have put out detailed containment strategies for small clusters and large outbreaks amenable to management,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-absence-of-lockdown-one-patient-can-infect-406-govt-study/story-WoBS4trNhEGckMWLMy1ORP.html
08-04-2020||India||Covid-19: States reel from revenue loss, salary delays likely||Most Indian states witnessed a decline in revenue of between 30% to 60% for March, and are estimating a bigger dip in April, multiple state government officials said, even as some states want an extension of the national lockdown beyond April 15 to save lives by containing the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The fall in revenue may lead to a delay in disbursement of salaries to the state government employees, and payments to external borrowers including government institutions, if the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is extended, the officials cited above added.Irrespective of these losses, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh suggested on Monday that the lockdown continue beyond April 15, and Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan indicated on Tuesday that they would be in favour of an extension if required.Two major sources of income for the states are value added tax (VAT) on petroleum products and excise duty on liquor. While fuel pumps are open through the lockdown period, demand has fallen drastically because only emergency services vehicles are allowed ti be on the roads. Liquor shops have been shut since the lockdown was imposed on March 25. Tourism, a third major source of revenue for some states -- particularly Rajasthan, Kerala and Uttarakhand -- is also in the red because most hotels and monuments are closed.Officials across several states said that the Covid-19 pandemic comes at the time when the revenues were already down. In their budget documents for 2020-21, most states had recorded a 7% to 22% shortfall in annual revenue on account of lower collection of Goods and Sales Tax (GST), and falling receipts due to the economic slowdown, according to a discussion paper prepared by PRS Legislative Research.Kerala reported 22% less GST revenue in 2019-20 than the previous fiscal, Odisha 10%, and West Bengal 7%.The paper also said that the GST compensation shortfall for states in 2019-20 was expected to be around Rs 1.01 lakh crore; and the debt burden of about 10 states -- including Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan -- increased because of the farm loan waiver, which would reach a cumulative Rs 1.08 lakh crore for the 2019-20 fiscal.CURBS AND CUTSOnce the Covid-19 pandemic struck, leading to curbs and eventually a lockdown, the stress on state revenues became visible within a few days, with Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh announcing cuts in government salaries between 10% and 60%. “We somehow paid March salaries. If the present situation continues, paying salaries for month of April and May will be difficult,” said a senior official of Andhra Pradesh government who asked not to be named.According to a document prepared by Punjab’s finance department on the fiscal impact of the lockdown, the state revenue shortfall in the first quarter of 2020-21 financial year is expected to be of Rs 10,309 crore (2.46% of the Rs 418,868 crore GSDP) if the lockdown ends on April 15.The Punjab government has, meanwhile, already indicated that the curfew imposed in some areas will be extended. “In case the national lockdown is extended, the financial impact will be severe. We are taking a hit of Rs 120 crore daily in our tax and non-tax revenues,” said a finance department official who asked not to be named.States that rely heavily on industry -- including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu -- are taking a bigger hit.Andhra Pradesh’s principal secretary (finance) SS Rawat told HT that he expected the March revenue to come down by at least half as compared to the year-on-year (YoY) revenue for March. Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao on Monday said in a press briefing? the state was losing Rs 400 crore a day. “In the first six days of April, we got just Rs 6 crore revenue as against the expected revenue of little over Rs 2,400 crore,” he said.The Maharashtra government has estimated a loss of Rs 25,000 crore, or about 50% YoY in March. In April, finance department officials expect to collect revenue of Rs 4,500 crore as against the normal Rs 20,000 crore. “We are hoping things will improve by May onwards,’’ said state finance secretary (expenditure) Rajiv Mittal.An Uttar Pradesh finance department official estimated the revenue shortfall of 15-20 % for March. “We managed to pay March salaries. But will have to devise ways to mobilise funds for coming weeks,” said a senior official on condition of anonymity.Madhya Pradesh finance department has estimated revenue loss of 25% on taxes from petroleum fuels, one of the biggest revenue sources for the states; Uttarkhand is estimated a loss of Rs 980 crore in March, which is 0.3% of the GSDP, said the state’s finance secretary Amit Singh Negi; while Jharkhand’s additional chief secretary (planning and finance), KK Khandelwal said the revenue March has dipped by abound 60%.CALL FOR HELPMost states have announced austerity measures and banned spending on new projects for the next three months, and some are diverting funds from non-essential departments to health care. But almost all state governments have sent SOS messages to the Centre seeking help.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot wrote twice to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the lockdown period (March 30 and April 7) asking for one-time grant of Rs 1 lakh crore to all the states to implement measures to overcome the Covid-19 challenge.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said they want the Centre to allow the fiscal deficit to increase from the present 3% of the state GDP to 4% for the next financial year, and to let states to borrow more money from the market to meet expenditure such as salaries, pensions and interest payments in the April-June period.Other state such as Chhattisgarh and West Bengal have asked for an immediate release of Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) funds, and allowing the payment of an unemployment allowance to already enrolled workers. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has formed a task force to suggest ways to reactivate the economic.Haryana’s deputy CM Dushyant Chautala and UP finance minister Suresh Khanna, however, stuck optimistic notes, saying this was a temporary phase because the economic impact of the Covid-19 was being felt worldwide and their states could not be isolated from it.Telangana CM KCR summed up the worries of most state governments when he said that “very tough decisions” will have to be taken in the coming days if the Central does not come.One hope the states are holding out for is that the first installment of the devolution of central funds is expected by April 20. One fourth of Rs 2,00,447 crore is expected to be disbursed in April. “The money could come handy in meeting the day-to-day financial needs of the state governments, for now,” said a Rajasthan government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-reel-from-revenue-loss-salary-delays-likely/story-avv2n36f3S51rDfBzOLC3J.html
08-04-2020||India||T’gana, Andhra see sharp spikes in cases||The twin Telugu states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have been witnessing a steep rise in the number of positive cases only after March 26, when the details about large scale congregation of people at Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin in New Delhi came to light.Both the states have accounted for nearly 15 deaths; 11 in Telangana and the rest in Andhra, and 700 positive cases for Covid-19 till now. Telangana reported 13 cases, its first double figure tally, on March 18, when as many as eight Indonesians, who came to Karimnagar town after attending the Tablighi Jamaat meeting, tested positive.Andhra Pradesh reported 11 cases, its first double digit tally, on March 26, when the state government began tracking Jamaat returnees and admitting them to hospitals.According to the bulletins issued by the Telangana health department, there were only five cases of locals who had come from countries like Dubai, London, Switzerland and the US and tested positive. The number went up to 13 on March 18, when the Indonesians tested positive.The number of positive cases in Telangana was gradually increasing by a maximum of five to six cases every day between March 18 and March 26, when it suddenly shot up by 14 cases. Since then, it has been on the rise as the government began tracing the Tablighi Jamaat returnees. By April 1, it crossed 100 and reached 364 on Monday evening.Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao told reporters on Monday night that out of the total number of positive cases recorded so far, only 50 cases pertained to locals, including 30 foreign-returnees and the remaining 20 of their family members. Of these 50, 35 people had been discharged and the remaining, too, will be discharged shortly, he said.However, KCR said, the state witnessed huge number of cases after the Nizamuddin incident. As many as 314 people tested positive in this second phase, after March 26, apart from the deaths of 11 people. “Of these 314 people, 308 are still undergoing treatment and the remaining six have been discharged,” he said.The chief minister said as many as 1089 people who had attended the Nizamuddin meeting had been identified so far and another 30-35 were in quarantine in Delhi. Besides, another 265 people, including 93 family members of these Markaz returnees, were also traced and tested. “It was found that over 1,000 of them are not infected. The results of the remaining, too, will be out in a couple of days,” he said.Besides, the authorities were also on the lookout for another 3,017 persons who might be indirectly connected with these cases are being traced, he said.Andhra Pradesh, too, witnessed a similar trend. After reporting he first double digit number of 11 Covid-19 positive cases on March 26, the state crossed the three-figure mark within six days on April 1, when it reported 113 cases. By Monday night, the number of cases were at 309, including five discharged patients.At a high-level review meeting held by Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday afternoon, the health department officials disclosed that out of 304 active Covid-19 patients taking treatment in hospitals, 280 patients had been associated with the Tablighi Jamaat meeting and their primary contacts.Out of 1085 persons who were identified to have attended Jamaat meeting, tests were conducted on 997 patients till now and 194 of them turned out to be positive. “Another 2,400 people were identified to have come in contact with them, including their family members, relatives, friends and others who travelled with them from Delhi to Andhra Pradesh. Of them, 84 persons tested positive,” the officials told the chief minister.Among others, tests were conducted on 205 people who came from foreign countries. Of them, 11 tested positive. Among another 120 persons who came in contact with these foreign returnees, six tested positive. As many as 134 locals got themselves admitted with symptoms of cold, cough and fever; of them, seven tested positive, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/t-gana-andhra-see-sharp-spikes-in-cases/story-ig64rDu1f5XsYTAW2GmwZI.html
08-04-2020||India||Lawyer moves SC seeking evacuation of daughter stuck in UK||New Delhi: A lawyer has moved the Supreme Court seeking the evacuation of her daughter and other Indian students stranded in the UK because of the ban imposed last month on international flight operations as part of measures taken to check the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.Madhurima Mridul, the lawyer, filed a public interest litigation days after her husband, Delhi high court judge Siddharth Mridul, recused himself when a plea came before him on March 20 seeking the evacuation of a student from Scotland. The judge said his daughter was stranded in London while recusing himself. Siddharth Mridul heard a matter on March 27 regarding evacuation of Indians from Kazakhstan.“Many such students are exposed to a greater risk of contracting COVID-19 due to being crammed into packed hostels with shared kitchen and bathroom facilities during the current lockdown imposed in the UK and are fighting for their survival,” the lawyer said in her petition.The Supreme Court heard the petition on Tuesday and directed the Centre to respond to it by Monday.The petition said India is probably the only country to have stopped the return of its citizens while other countries are making “all possible efforts” to repatriate theirs stranded abroad. “It is also pertinent to note that countries with far greater incidence of mortality like China, Spain, Italy, Iran, South Korea and United States of America, too, have not imposed any embargo on the return of their nationals from foreign shores,” the petition said.India has evacuated hundreds of its citizens from countries like Iran and Italy, which are among the worst-hit by the pandemic. The petitioner cited data she has collected and said there are about 20,000 Indian students in the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to intensive care in hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened. The pandemic has killed over 5,000 people in Britain. The petition said the students were finding it hard to survive on their limited available resources even as the threat of contracting the virus looms large. “Given the present circumstances, the students’ lives are at great risk without the basic necessities to sustain themselves. Many of these students are running out of finances and facing shortage of food and water. They have not been able to access any protective masks, gloves or sanitizers and are worried about contracting the deadly virus while miles away from their loved ones in India.”Advocate Sunil Fernandes, who argued the petition, said a golden opportunity was lost recently when Indian flights were chartered by the UK and Germany this month to evacuate their citizens stranded in India. The last of these flights returned from London empty on Tuesday. As of now, about 380 students are stranded at the Indian High Commission in London.A bench of Chief Justice of India S A Bobde and justice L Nageswara Rao, which heard the matter, sought to know the number of Indian students stranded and asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre through video conferencing, about any alternate evacuation plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawyer-moves-sc-seeking-evacuation-of-daughter-stuck-in-uk/story-UTZfWH7YUJ3cgmqjtE036O.html
08-04-2020||India||Joint Parliament committee slashes MPs’ allowances||After a 30% salary cut and no access to the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) fund for two years, Members of Parliament will now forfeit ₹27,000 per month from their constituency allowance and office allowance as well.This is the first time in the recent history of Parliament that the allowances of MPs, which have seen a steady rise in the past, have been reduced. While all MPs have supported their salary cut as the country grapples to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), many have raised questions about cutting off access to the MPLADS fund.The Joint Committee of Parliament, which looks into salaries and allowances of MPs, has recommended a 30% cut in constituency allowance and office allowance.An MP is entitled to ₹ 70,000 per month to meet constituency-related expenses and another ₹60,000 as office allowance. An MP is also entitled to ₹2000 as daily allowance for attending Parliament sessions or committee meetings apart from official accommodation, water and electricity supply and a special allowance to buy laptops or computers.The Committee has decided to deduct ₹21,000 out of each member’s constituency allowance and ₹6,000 from the office allowance. These deductions will be applicable from April 1, along with their salary deductions.While the MP will now get ₹14,000 towards stationery as against ₹20,000 earlier, there will be no cut, however, in the remaining ₹40,000 of the office allowance, which is meant for engaging personal assistants.On Tuesday, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla accepted the recommendations of Joint Committee for the cut.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi tweeted in support of the decision. “I welcome Gazette notifications issued from LS & RS Secretariats regarding 30% reduction in Constituency Allowance & Stationary allowance for MPs & 30% reduction in constituency Allowance for Ministers. Initiative is a good beginning for augmenting resources for fighting COVID-19,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joint-parliament-committee-slashes-mps-allowances/story-a0DyUnqckh98blZnmJzA6M.html
08-04-2020||India||Monitoring worst-hit districts: Smart City war rooms for affected areas||The Union government has discovered a new use for the Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCCs) designed for the Smart Cities Mission -- surveillance and monitoring of Covid-19 affected districts across the country. According to government officials familiar with the matter who asked not to be named, these centres have been converted into war rooms for real-time data monitoring and to provide the latest information through a central dashboard. Their mandate is to track suspected cases, monitor people under quarantine, and keep an eye on clusters and containment zones. The Smart Cities Mission was launched in 2015 to modernise 100 cities by 2020. Under the mission, setting up of integrated command and control centres (ICCC) for each city is a vital step. The ICCCs are designed to enable monitoring of amenities and utilities in real-time.States with a high number of Covid-19 cases such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan are using these centres for CCTV surveillance of public places, geographic information system (GIS)mapping of Covid-19-hit areas, and GPS tracking of health care workers. “The Centre is coordinating with the states through our central command centre at Nirman Bhawan in New Delhi,” a government official said on condition of anonymity. Nirmal Bhawan houses the offices of the urban development ministry which oversees the smart city initiative. The official added that the states are also using the centres for predictive analytics .”We are also doing real-time tracking of ambulances and disinfection services.”In every city with such a network, the Centre has found that it is a good way to collaborate with the district administration and city administration. States are also using the system for providing virtual training to doctors and health care professionals as well as medical services through video conferencing. “Leveraging technology, the smart cities are collaborating with medical practitioners... to provide online medical consultations to citizens.” In Maharashtra, the Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited (PSCDCL) has collaborated with the Pune Municipal Corporation to develop an integrated Covid-19 data dashboard. “Each [Covid-19] case in the city has been mapped using geospatial information systems and the city administration is monitoring the [affected] areas and creating buffer zones,” said a second official familiar with the mater who too did not wish to be named.Using heat-mapping technologies and predictive analytics, the city administration is developing a containment plan , with the containment zones get reflected on the dashboard.Smart City dashboards also monitor quarantine facilities and tracks the health of patients and their contacts placed under home quarantine.Tamil Nadu has deployed teams of doctors at its Smart City centre to monitor people under quarantine. “In Chennai, 25 doctors are engaged in the ICCC. They have been assigned 250 people in quarantine each ...,” the second official said.In Uttar Pradesh, the command centres are being used for tracking the delivery of health services across the state. The ICCC is being used as a helpline and tele-counselling centre for citizens. Medical officers are stationed at ICCCs in different shifts to assist during any situation. “ In centres like Kanpur Smart City, Aligarh, Varanasi, etc., health services are being tracked from the ICCC. Telemedicine is offered through the video conferencing facility launched by the city administrations. In Aligarh, doctors are deployed at Aligarh Smart City ICCC from 11am to 8 pm to enable telemedicine and video conferencing facility through a dedicated Whatsapp number,” the official said. “Smart cities were designed with inbuilt emergency healthcare support in the modules. The command centres have been designed keeping emergency scenarios and that can be used with some customisation for battling Covid-19. Features of the command centres including data analytics and artificial intelligence can be leveraged with additional pandemic data from the health ministry. It already has a multi-layered GIS map of various districts and wards ready which can be used to zero down on specific localities,” said Arindam Guha, partner and lead government and public sector, Deloitte India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monitoring-worst-hit-districts-smart-city-war-rooms-for-affected-areas/story-opLLPWbDslGV6DCsgtTW7J.html
08-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: How Sars-CoV-2 is more insidious than Sars virus||People with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are the most infectious during the first week of symptoms, according to a recent study, which explains why this disease is spreading faster than other coronavirus diseases, like the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak caused by Sars-CoV-1.Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, replicates in the upper respiratory tract before moving down to infect the lungs, which leads to people shedding huge amounts of the virus through coughing in the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 × 108 RNA copies per throat swab), according to a study published in the journal Nature on April 1.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Researchers analysed data from nine patients in Munich with comparatively mild symptoms to understand how infectious they were and when, and how much virus they shed, or excrete.The active replication of Sars-CoV-2 begins in the upper respiratory tract of the patients, from the larynx up where it stays and infects people before infecting the lungs and causing severe respiratory symptoms, the study found. Sars-CoV-2 is genetically very similar to Sars-CoV-1, but subtle genetic differences lead to significant differences in how it spreads and causes severe illness. Both Sars-Cov-1 and Sars-CoV-2 infect the throat and lungs by using their external spike proteins (which give the virus family its name, Corona, Latin for crown) to enter the humans’ cells by attaching to a cell protein called ACE2, which is also present in the cells in the throat and lungs. Once inside, they hijack the human cell machinery to replicate and cause infection.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“Sars-CoV-2 takes up residence in the throat cells first, which doesn’t cause significant symptoms. The person can remain asymptomatic or might not think they have anything worse than a cold. And from that person’s throat… it can readily spread to others. Over the course of a week, in some patients, it will move into the lung neighbourhood and replicate just as Sars-1 would, causing severe symptoms, by which point the person is quarantined, but no matter since it had successfully spread,” said Peter Kolchinsky, virologist and author of The Great American Drug Deal, in a tweet.“These are two different viruses (Sars-CoV-2 and Sars -CoV) so their behaviour will be different. The host-virus interaction properties are different. In Sars, there was only lung infection and one could spread it when the infected person coughed, but in case of Sars-CoV-2, the infection begins in the upper respiratory tract so you can infect even if you talk. The virus is in the nasopharyngeal fluid which mixes with saliva so you can infect when you sing, speak or shout. Silent transmission is common in this disease. So screening at airports for temperature was appropriate in case of Sars but not for Sars-CoV-2,” said Dr Jacob John, veteran virologist and professor emeritus and former head of virology at Christian Medical College.On the other hand, Sars-Cov-1 directly enters the lungs and causes serious respiratory symptoms very rapidly, leading to the person being hospitalised and isolated very quickly after getting infected. This limits the chances of the virus replicating in the throat and spreading to others through coughing.Also read| Covid-19: Govt looks at ways to restart business ops post lockdown“So Sars-1 was a comparatively dumb virus. It went straight for the lungs, announced itself before it could spread to others, and so got social distanced into extinction. But Sars-CoV-2, the one plaguing us now, is stealthier, spreading first before revealing itself (and causing harm),” said Kolchinsky.“Basically, Sars-COv-2 is much more infectious (than other coronaviruses). Patients are seen to be shedding a very high amount of virus. Now there are studies showing that the infection can spread not only through droplets but also aerosols or microdroplets. Otherwise, it has the same pathology as Sars-like cytokine storm, the involvement of the lung and GI tract. The involvement of the upper respiratory tract in SARS-CoV-2 makes it more infectious,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of virology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.Sars-CoV-2 is also more severe than seasonal flu in part because it is more efficient at preventing cells under attack from mounting an immune system. For example, Sars-CoV-2 blocks the cells from making interferon, the alarm-signalling protein, by snipping off protein markers that serve as distress signals. This makes the transmission rate of Sars-CoV-2 higher than that of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which was also a less deadly disease.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The study also found the virus remained detectable in the sputum after symptoms stopped, with two of the patients with some early signs of pneumonia, continuing to shed high levels of the virus in the sputum until day 10 or 11“(The takeaway is) ...that beating this virus means social distancing and wearing masks even if we think we aren’t infected. Because we might be. The virus might be replicating in our throats without us knowing (that’s its evil plan!), so put up a roadblock,” tweeted Kolchinsky.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-sars-cov-2-is-more-insidious-than-sars-virus/story-igEXuMTEXhHtWCkRInu5CJ.html
08-04-2020||India||Govt forms clinical research team for better insight into Covid-19 pandemic||India is putting in place a hospital-based clinical research collaborative, the ‘India Covid-19 Clinical Research Collaborative Network’, to enhance the clinical understanding of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the country to develop India specific treatment protocols, and push research and development in the field of drug development for the viral infection.The country’s National Task Force on Covid-19, which is a group of technical experts reviewing important decisions regarding Covid-19, has recommended the establishment of the collaborative that would need to be coordinated by the country’s apex biomedical research organisation, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“The goal of this network is to develop specific clinical management protocols and further research and development for therapeutics. For this purpose, a central database of clinical and laboratory parameters of hospitalized Covid-19 cases is being created,” read a statement from the ICMR.All hospitals currently admitting in isolation wards, and treating, Covid-19 patients are being invited to become partners in the network. The research regulator has made public a link- https://forms.gle/LHByZkR41UPHqX9FA- taking them to a registration forms that must be filled byhospitals interested in becoming a part of the research network.“This is clinical research mostly using data at the hospital level, involving those who are directly dealing with patient management to know what kind of cases are coming to hospitals, with what symptoms. What is working in terms of treatment and what is not, among other things,” said a senior scientist at the ICMR.According to the data available so far, close to 80% Covid-19 positive cases will develop mild symptoms, about 15% will develop severe symptoms, such as breathing difficulty, requiring hospitalisation, and about 5% will be critical enough to develop serious pneumonia, and need oxygen support or ventilator support.“There is a lot we know so far and a lot more that needs to be known further. The research will keep on evolving, and we will get to know new things about the virus and disease pattern with every new research coming out on Covid-19. It will be an ongoing process,” the scientist said. However, registering for the collaborative does not mean a hospital or a laboratory is exempt from furnishing other patient details to the authorities.“It is over and above the usual testing and disease management protocol that need to be followed while dealing with Covid-19 suspected or positive cases,” said the ICMR scientist. Hospitals should continue to independently report relevant data to central and state health authorities as per current guidelines that includes local integrated disease surveillance programme units on a real time basis, says the circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-forms-clinical-research-team-for-better-insight-into-covid-19-pandemic/story-MHhVijokskiBr2UdEuZ6uJ.html

A domestic help, who worked at the house of an employee of Ceasefire along with her three family members tested positive for Covid-19.“We have put these persons under quarantine as a precautionary measure. We want to put them under observation as part of the containment exercise. Around 30 to 40 families had connections with the four persons who were found positive for Covid-19 in the JJ Colony of Noida in Sector 5. Nobody’s sample has been collected yet as that will be done only after observing them and if they develop any symptoms,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.“Families are being only quarantined and kept under observation, for their welfare and the welfare of the surrounding areas,” he said. Till now, the total number of cases in the district is 58, out of which 39 are linked with Ceasefire whose three employees had jumped their quarantine period which led to the spread of Covid-19 in various sectors of the district.Aurthorities had first planned to send the 200 slum dwellers to send to the Sharda hospital, but later they were shifted to the Galgotias University campus in Greater Noida.“The whole procedure is part of the containment work in the district to ensure that even asymptomatic patients don’t end up spreading the infection,” said a senior officer.The Expressway Police has lodged an FIR against Ceasefire under section 45 (Punishment of offences committed within India), 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR has been lodged on the orders of the CMO for hiding the foreign travel history by few employees of the firm.The managing director of ceasefire was also found positive for Covid--19 and had returned from the UK on March 1, another employee had returned on March 7. They also had a visiting auditor from London for three days in the third week of March. All the three persons jumped their quarantine period and were attending office which led to the spread among other employees and then to their family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-200-noida-slum-dwellers-shifted-to-government-quarantine/story-gJvmKjLnhe1Mo7pPMGVjFN.html
08-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Blood transfusion from those who have recovered may help||Virus fighting antibodies from people who have recovered from the coronavirus disease Covid-19 can help cure others, according to a research finding published on Tuesday that describes the technique – convalescent plasma therapy – as a promising option to save lives till a vaccine is found. The therapy, the most distinct among the handful of options doctors around the world have for Covid-19 at present, had consistent and safe effects on a small group of 10 patients in China who were critically ill but began to show significant improvements after a single dose, the American journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) reported on Tuesday. “All symptoms in the 10 patients, especially fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain, disappeared or largely improved within 1 day to 3 days upon CP transfusion,” said the report, which studied the effects of the therapy on severely ill patients with a median age of 52 years. The study was published without embargo by PNAS because of its potential to save lives. Till Tuesday, the Covid-19 pandemic has killed about 74,000 people across the world. While efforts to develop a vaccine are proceeding at a record place, doctors are repurposing drugs and therapies with proven safety to minimise fatalities. The basis for convalescent plasma therapy is simple: plasma – a component of the blood – from a recovered patient carries the specific antibodies that can neutralise the Sars-Cov-2 virus. This is transfused in a patient fighting the infection, acting as reinforcement for the immune system.For the 10 patients, the results were immediate. The transfusion raised lymphocyte counts, improved liver and lung function, and reduced inflammation, found the study. Lung lesions and other severe symptoms abated within the next week. The therapy led to no serious adverse reactions, but the researchers noted a need for larger randomized-controlled clinical trials to establish efficacy across populations.“It’s an excellent idea, plasma has been used to prevent and treat infections since the 1890s. We still give immunoglobulin IgE serum to prevent rabies in people with animal bites, and varicella-zoster immunoglobulin to pregnant women who have been exposed to chickenpox, which leads to pregnancy complications for the mother and her unborn child. It’s not used for pneumonias and chest infections anymore -- we use antibiotics -- but it was used with success to treat influenza during the Spanish Flu pandemic,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.The US Food and Drug Administration approved the therapy last month to treat Covid-19 patients in the United States, following which several hospitals have begun clinical trials to document its effectiveness.“The treatment’s success would depend on to whom and when it’s given. It should be given to people at risk, such as those who are old or have diabetes or hypertension, and must be given before complications begin. If it’s given late, it will have little effect,” said Dr John.Another expert said the therapy had shown promise in treating several diseases. “The immunisation mechanism has been used against other viral infections with varying success. It lowered viral load and deaths in people with severe acute respiratory infections during the H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic of 2009-10, and improved survival in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome not responding to treatment,” said Dr G Khilnani, chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical Care and former head of pulmonology at AIIMS, both in New Delhi. The World Health Organization recommended its use against Ebola, and issued protocols for its use to treat Middle East respiratory syndrome.“It’s being used in China and the US and involves a fairly easy procedure, collecting blood, titrating the plasma and injecting it into the patient. But for its use and rapid scale up in India, we need rules to regulate it. Blood banks are licenced and regulated by the Food and Cosmetics Act in India, and unless rules for plasma transfusion are formulated, it cannot be done here,” said Dr RN Makroo, senior consultant, transfusion medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, Delhi.India’s Empowered Committee for Covid-19 Response has fast-tracked approvals of re-purposed drugs to lower severe disease and death till a vaccine is available in 2021, and but it’s too early to say how well re-purposing will work as the outcomes of rigorous tests are yet to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-blood-transfusion-from-those-who-have-recovered-may-help/story-s4dTePsfsRgylpelyErIwM.html

India denied entry to nationals of Spain, France and Germany on March 10 on account of the global coronavirus pandemic. The government further imposed a blanket ban on all commercial international flights on March 22. Spain has witnessed one of the worst outbreaks of Covid-19 in Europe, with over 140, 511 positive cases (of which 43,208 have recovered) and 13,897 deaths till date.“We were asked by our employer to go back on March 20, and were given tickets for March 21. However, the flight got cancelled and later the Indian airspace was shut due to which we are stuck here in hope of being airlifted, but with no success,” said Robin Pereira, 38, who is from Mumbai.Sangita Bhagwan, whose brother, Sandeep Bhagwan, is among the 23 Indians, has been in touch with the Indian embassy in Spain, which sent her an email that said: “Prime Minister Modi has appealed that you give your next few weeks for the sake of the country. Conditions currently do not allow your government to consider evacuation from Spain. We are confident that we shall triumph over Covid-19. Till then, please be calm.”Bhagwan said, “The government has been very helpful till now. We understand the fight that our country is fighting currently and we are all in this fight together. However, these men are stranded in a Covid-19 hotspot.”Sanjay Verma, India’s ambassador to Spain told Hindustan Times on email, “We have tirelessly explained to the crew and their well wishers in India that our country remains in a lockdown. Also there are currently no proposals to evacuate Indians from Spain, or anywhere else given the lockdown, not to mention that our systems and personnel are engaged full time in ensuring that the lockdown is a success.” “Their company forced them to disembark at Barcelona and was reluctant to look after their employees interests. The Embassy was able to get in touch with the cruise line and ensured that the 23 Indians were provided with living arrangements in Barcelona. The Indian crew has since been provided for by their company,” Verma added.Prior to the national lockdown, which began on March 25, India has evacuated citizens from Italy and Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/23-indians-stranded-in-spain-kin-seek-govt-aid/story-q8pfTqthQIqVWFTsWvKq2J.html
08-04-2020||India||Sunderbans tigers under watch for Covid symptoms||Kolkata: Forest officials in the Sunderbans, along with the Border Security Force and police, are on the lookout for tigers which show signs of breathlessness and coughing while swimming across rivers. The animal could be a possible Covid-19 suspect.The Sunderbans is the world’s largest mangrove delta and the only mangrove forest inhabited by tigers. As the mangroves are largely impenetrable, tigers are usually spotted on the river banks and when they cross the rivers and creeks from one island to another. “Patrolling on boats has been increased to look out for tigers that show signs of Covid-19, such as breathlessness. The BSF and police have also been asked to keep a watch,” said Ravi Kant Sinha, chief wildlife warden of West Bengal. On Monday, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had directed all tiger range states to observe tigers with symptoms of Covid-19 such as dry cough or laboured breathing. The advisory came after a tiger at the Bronx zoo in New York was detected with coronavirus. It was the first instance of a tiger being infected with the deadly disease.As the Sunderbans delta is located along the Indo-Bangla border, the Border Security Force and police, who also patrol the delta in their own boats, have also been asked to look out for tigers which are found to be panting while crossing rivers from one island to another.“Our men are patrolling the area. We have been asked to alert the forest department if we spot any tiger with symptoms such as dry cough, breathlessness and running nose,” said SS Guleria, BSF deputy inspector-general (South Bengal Frontier). Out of the 2967 tigers in India, Sunderbans has around 90 tigers in its one national park and five wildlife sanctuaries. The Indian part of the Sunderbans forest spreads over 4200 sq km comprising 48 islands crisscrossed by rivers. Unlike other forests, boats are the only means of patrolling this delta. “We have around 1200 camera traps which have been kept on standby on boats and floating stations. Around 30 double cylinder boats are operating in the field. If we get any information about any suspect tiger, our teams will move in and camera traps will be set up in that area,” said a senior official of the Sunderban Biosphere Reserve. The state forest department has already stopped all kinds of tourism in the Sunderban, which is known for its Royal Bengal Tiger and estuarine crocodiles, among other animals.West Bengal is among the top three states in the list of casualties caused by human-tiger conflicts in India. At least 30 people have been killed by tigers between 2017 and 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunderbans-tigers-under-watch-for-covid-symptoms/story-mIiW24Z7YtPtD7Sk5f7BfK.html

The state will use the survey responses to then decide who all need to be tested for coronavirus. Bhilwara in Rajasthan was one of the first Covid-19 clusters to emerge last month in the country, and was put under complete lockdown by the state and district authorities to contain the spread of the virus. Apart from widespread surveillance and sealing borders, the state appointed anganwadi and Asha workers, auxiliary nurse and midwives (ANMs) as corona fighters to monitor those under quarantine in the city and rural areas of the district. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said that the state had procured 2000 new rapid testing kits (RTKs) or antibody tests to screen for potential disease hotspots, or clusters, in the state. Till now 323 persons have been tested, while 1320 persons are under quarantine in Goa, which has been under lockdown since March 22’s Janata Curfew. The state has seven positive Covid-19 patients.These moves come after Sawant came under some criticism for his handling of the lockdown in the state. Residents complained that they had run out of essential supplies, including milk and groceries, and the supply chain was hit after trucks from Karnataka stopped entering the state. The government attempted to start home delivery of essentials, but this could not take off due to the shortage of supplies. The Goa bench of the Bombay High Court intervened asking the state to resolve the situation after a resident moved court. Eventually Sawant had to reverse a number of decisions, allowing delivery persons to travel, restaurant kitchens to function, and grocery shops to remain open. The state also came up with a decentralised pass system to address residents’ woes. “The survey will be done in the whole state by going door to door. ANMs (Auxiliary nurse and midwife), anganwadi workers, teachers, booth level officers will form teams of two and visit each house. We have finalised a form to be filled which will include questions on whether a member has travelled abroad or has returned from abroad or from outside Goa in the recent past. Whether any family member is displaying influenza like symptoms, including fever, cough and difficulty breathing and if it has spread within the family,” Sawant said.In all, 7000 government workers are expected to fan out across the state to complete the survey within three days, following which the government is expected to crank up its testing capacity.The team will be headed by a supervisor who will divide the government workers into pairs and assign them localities to cover with a booth level officer. With the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s apex health body, allowing for rapid testing for antibodies, the Goa government has tied up with a locally-based private company, Molbio Diagnostics, to procure the testing kits that will provide the test result in one hour. Goa has two testing labs at present, including one in the Goa Medical College and Hospital at Bambolim near Panaji. It has also been sending samples to the National Institute of Virology in Pune using the Navy’s help. The state has around 2500 RT-PCR kits, or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests that require the nasal or throat swabs of suspected positive persons, and return results between 12 to 24 hours. A private laboratory at Porvorim has also been authorised to conduct the RT-PCR tests for Rs 4500. The Goa government has also announced an insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh and a 20% hike in the basic salary of all staff including sweepers, attendants and doctors as well as those working via an intermediary agency or on contract, associated with Covid-19 facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-looks-to-replicate-bhilwara-model-hold-door-to-door-surveys/story-wZASC8LWR0lu9t1CmqulAI.html
08-04-2020||India||10-month-old recovers, discharged from hospital along with mother||Chennai: A ten-month-old infant, the youngest in Tamil Nadu to test positive for Covid-19 was discharged from a Coimbatore hospital on Monday, after recovering from the disease. The child acquired the infection from his 29-year-old mother who works as a doctor for the Southern Railways.On March 29, the 29-year-old woman was admitted in ESI Hospital, Coimbatore along with the baby, her 58-year-old mother and the family’s domestic help. The doctor tested positive after treating a 63-year-old man in a railway hospital in Erode. He had travelled along with two Thai nationals who had tested positive for Covid-19 earlier in March.“First, the mother tested positive so we thought all other people in the family should also be tested so we admitted them and took a swab test,” the dean of the ESIC Hospital Dr. A. Nirmala told Hindustan Times. “At that time the child was found to be positive. He was allowed to be in the same room as his mother since both of them had tested positive. We closely observed both mother and child and provided counselling services to the mother as well.”In India, the number of Covid-19 cases has been lowest among the age group of 0 to 20 years, while the maximum number of cases has been reported among those between 21 and 40 years. The casualty rate has been highest in those above 60 years, due to existing co-morbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension and other issues, according to data released by the government last week.The team of doctors treating the 10-month-old infant knew that if the baby was immunologically competent, secondary problems would not arise. They continued to closely watch the child for other symptoms. “Meanwhile, we were treating the patient with required medicines and also giving nutritional food for baby and members of the family,” the dean said.“We kept a close watch on the baby and treated him with antibiotics for elevated temperature. We could not put the baby on hydroxychloroquine like we did for the adults. But since the baby was immunised for all other infections, it could have helped (him) get a good immunity.”All patients were fed a diet of porridge and fruit. “As a baby we took a lot more care of him, he didn’t develop any abnormal symptoms. Finally took the swab test for the family members. All except the doctor’s mother turned out to be negative. We discharged the doctor, the child and the maid, but the 58-year-old mother is still under treatment,” Nirmala said. Hydroxycholoroquine which is commonly used to treat malaria, arthritis and lupus, among other ailments, has been in the eye of a storm after United States president Donald Trump on Monday warned of retaliation if India did not supply the drug as asked. India, the largest manufacturer and exporter of the drug, initially banned exports on March 25 to ensure adequate domestic supplies. On Tuesday, the Centre decided to allow exports, depending on availability, after stockpiling enough for domestic use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-month-old-recovers-discharged-from-hospital-along-with-mother/story-CAnyUOKEHchwJ4indb7s8I.html
08-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update- More testing to welfare push: Tamil Nadu’s 5-point Covid-19 plan||The first week of April has been brutal for Tamil Nadu in its fight against the coronavirus disease. The number of Covid-19 cases in the state has multiplied by more than 10 times, from 67 at the end of March to 690 as of Tuesday, April 7. Of these, 637 are linked to those returning from the Tablighi Jamaat conference held in mid-March at the Islamic missionary group’s Markaz headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, which has emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hotspot in India.Here are five ways in which the Tamil Nadu government has acted to bring the situation under control.1) Surveillance, containment: Chennai is one of the 10 cities worst affected by Covid-19 in India, recording at least 149 cases. On April 5, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) launched a 90-day, door-to-door survey of every household in the city to check residents for Covid-19 symptoms. Nearly 16,000 healthcare workers clad in personal protective equipment and trained to ask the right set of questions will visit close to a million buildings in the city to record Covid19 symptoms and create a disease database, SP Velumani, the minister for municipal administration, rural development and special programme implementation, said.Those with symptoms would instantly be taken to the closest Covid-19 medical facility. Following what is now referred to as the Bhilwara model, based on the ruthless manner in which the Rajasthan town was locked down in March to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease, Chennai has sealed high-risk areas that reported multiple Covid-19 cases. Nine areas of the city that accounted for nearly 20 cases have been declared containment zones. Areas within a five-kilometre radius of such neighbourhoods are completely isolated, disinfected daily and citizens are simply not allowed to leave their homes. Health workers survey nearly 3,000 houses in each of the nine hotspots every day.2) Ramped-up testing: The government’s testing and isolation efforts, until the return of Tablighi Jamaat congregation attendees led to a spike in the number of coronavirus cases, were focused largely on air passengers and those with a history of overseas travel. Rather than stigmatise the attendees, the government started a helpline towards the end of March so that they could identify themselves and seek testing. This has worked in favour of the state: around 1,431 attendees have been traced so far. Because many are from rural areas, the state has directed its identification efforts there. After a go-ahead from the Indian Centre for Medical Research for using antibody tests which return quicker results, chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami announced on April 5 that the state had placed an order for 100,000 rapid test kits. State health ministry officials said that a bulk of the kits would be sent to smaller towns and rural areas.3) Essentials supplied: The effectiveness of the lockdown depends in large measure on the state’s ability to deliver essential goods and services to people in a manner that keeps them safe at home. The state’s well-oiled Public Distribution System (PDS), Amma Canteens and welfare schemes have helped no doubt, but the smooth supply of vegetables has been one of Tamil Nadu’s biggest successes in the crisis. The government has set aside Rs 3,280 crore for measures such as a Rs 1,000 cash support scheme and delivering free rice, lentils and cooking oil through PDS outlets. In many parts of the state, local authorities deliver a three-kilo weekly supply kit of vegetables for a nominal Rs 100. To ease the strain on the healthcare system, the CM has also announced a subsidy of 30% on capital investment with a cap of Rs 20 crore for new manufacturers of ventilators, masks, drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and vitamin C tablets. He also announced sops for farmers, including a waiver of cold storage user fee, loans up to Rs 10 lakh to farmer producer firms and has exempted traders from paying the 1% market fee for procuring farm produce. 4) Farmer cooperatives: Four months ago, Tamil Nadu handed over a large part of the management of the fruit and vegetable supply chain to farmer producer companies (FPC). FPCs are for-profit cooperatives that can be formed with 10 or more farmers as shareholders. Their activities can range from production and procurement to marketing and even exports. Such cooperatives now run nearly 10 primary processing centres (PPCs) in the big horticultural regions such as Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri. Since the FPC are farmer-owned companies, they find it easier to procure vegetables at a price that is fair to both farmers and consumers. There are cold storage facilities at all the PPCs. The farmer cooperatives are now playing a big role in door-delivering pre-packaged five-kilo vegetable boxes for Rs 250 in cities like Chennai and Coimbatore. The horticulture department has started its own e-commerce door delivery platform a few days ago that makes 1,000 deliveries a day in Chennai. 5) Social distancing measures: In order to ease overcrowding, Tamil Nadu converted bus stations in towns and cities into vegetable markets. The state has some 120 farmers’ markets where farmers can sell their produce directly to consumers. To manage social distancing and avoid chaos and crowding, nearly 60 farmers’ markets were relocated to bus stands that are now empty because of the lockdown. “The concrete flooring of the bus stands makes it easier to disinfect; bus stands are usually centrally located; and the large open architecture of bus stands make it easier to install disinfectant tunnels and prevent physical contact between people,” Bedi said....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-testing-to-welfare-push-tamil-nadu-s-5-point-covid-plan/story-SOVYb78EckiTTGYn8nXNOI.html
08-04-2020||India||Rajasthan: SHO to blacksmith, citizens help build sanitising tunnel||Jaipur: Brij Bhushan Agarwal, the station house officer (SHO) of Bagru police station near Jaipur, had just returned from a highway patrol on March 28 when he came across a video of a sanitising tunnel installed in Turkey for pedestrians to check the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.Agarwal shared the video with Madan Choudhary, a schoolteacher, and asked him whether they could do something similar. “Discuss it with Ehsaan Engineer,” he told Chaudhary, referring to Ehsaan Lohar, 34, who works at a workshop in Bagru. Lohar is better known as Engineer because of his metal fabrication skills. Choudhary called Agarwal later in the day saying they could create a similar tunnel. “Ehsaan Engineer has developed the design,” he told him.An eight-foot-long, 50-inch-wide and seven-foot-high sanitising tunnel was installed five days later on April 2. The tunnel is equipped with eight nozzles attached to its iron frame that spray sanitiser. It has been installed at Jaipur’s Laxmi Chowk, where additional police commissioner Ashok Gupta was the first to walk through it. “Officers in police stations normally don’t think out of the box like this SHO. I am happy a police officer could go beyond the call of his duty in the fight against this pandemic,” Gupta said.At least three other sanitising tunnels have come up around the country over the last week. In Tamil Nadu’s Tirupur, an entrepreneur set up a portable disinfectant tunnel at the vegetable and fish market on April 1. The Srinagar Municipal Corporation installed a similar tunnel at the entrance of a hospital, where Covid-19 patients are being treated. Another sanitising tunnel has come up in Ahmedabad for healthcare workers.Sanitising tunnels have been set up at many places across the world including in China, where the pandemic originated from, since businesses reopened there as curbs and other measures to contain the virus were eased with a drop in the number of infections.Agarwal said he called up Yogesh Singhal, an engineer and his schoolmate, when Lohar said he could put together a structure similar to what he had seen in the video. “When he [Singhal] approved our design, we knew we were on the right track,” he said.Lohar, Abdul Hameed, Suresh Kumawat, Kamaruddin Lohar and Zakir Hussain, who owns the workshop, began their work on the tunnel on March 29. Lohar, Hameed and Kamaruddin worked on the iron frame. Kumawat, a reverse osmosis mechanic, bought pipes and Choudhary arranged for sprayers commonly used by barbers.A 20-litre plastic tank fitted to the frame has been filled with the sanitisers. A pressure machine used by mechanics pumps the sanitisers into the sprayers using thin pipes used in water purifiers. The tunnel’s entry and exit points are covered with a thick plastic sheet. A shop nearby houses the motor that keeps the pressure pump on and bottles of sanitizer tinctures.While Lohar and his co-workers were busy making the tunnel, Agarwal was trying to figure out what sanitisers to use. “The disinfectant chemicals being used by municipal authorities may not be fit to be used on human bodies. So I turned to a homoeopathic doctor,” he said.Arvind Dadhich, 30, the homoeopath, suggested five tinctures of Azadirachta Indica, Ocimum Sanctum, Echinacea, Sambucus Nigra and Iodum mixed with spirit and water and said it can be used as a sanitiser. These are mother tinctures used in homeopathy.Dr Renu Bansal, director (homoeopathy), the government of Rajasthan, said the mixture used in the tunnel is safe to be used as a sanitiser. “The mother tinctures have around 65% alcohol, and when mixed with spirit, the overall alcohol percentage comes to around 70-75%, which is good for a sanitiser. The solution is also anti-bacterial,” she said. Virendra Singh, a former professor of medicine at Jaipur’s SMS Medical College, warned that people should continue wearing masks even while walking through the tunnel. “If an infected person sneezes in the tunnel, the virus is likely to hang in there for some time.”Singh said, “I haven’t seen it but theoretically seems to be an effective way.”Razia Bano, 38, an (accredited social health activist who has been going door to door for a Covid-19 survey, walks through the tunnel on her way to Bagru.A bus from a nearby nursing college stops near the tunnel and students, who have been put on screening duty, stand in a queue to pass through it. “We use sanitisers only for our hands. This will sanitise our full bodies,” said a student, who did not want to be named.Agarwal’s phone has not stopped ringing since the tunnel was installed. “My colleagues are calling me after watching the tunnel on local TV channels. They want to replicate it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-sho-to-blacksmith-citizens-help-build-sanitising-tunnel/story-wPSYGtluLSbDenyw0G5yvI.html
08-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Test, trace, treat in Delhi’s 5T plan||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday laid out a five-point blueprint to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), declaring that testing will be ramped up and the scope of treatment widened – an indication that the Capital was bracing for the possible ballooning of the pathogen that has ravaged several metropolises across the world.Fifty one new cases were reported in Delhi on Tuesday, taking the total in the Capital to 576, out of which 333 patients are linked to the mid-March congregation of a Muslim missionary group, Tablighi Jamaat, in Nizamuddin that has now become the country’s largest hot spot for Covid-19 infections. At a news briefing, the chief minister said that Delhi has formed a “5T plan” — testing, tracing, treatment, teamwork, and tracking — and that his government was prepared to scale up resources to treat up to 30,000 active Covid-19 patients at the same time, if needed.Also read: Alarm bells in east Delhi locality as experts suggest limited Covid-19 community spread“The first T is testing. If you don’t test, you won’t be able to find out which houses have been affected. It will go on spreading. South Korea identified every single individual through large scale testing. We are now going to do mass testing like South Korea,” Kejriwal said.He said the countries that did not conduct wide testing before infections climbed were unable to control the imminent spiraling of the disease. “We have ordered kits for the testing of 50,000 people. The kits have started arriving. We have also placed orders for the rapid test of 100,000 people. The deliveries of kits will begin by Friday. Random tests will be done at hot spots. Detailed tests will also be done.”On Monday, Kejriwal said rapid testing will be doubled from next week – from around 500 samples per day to 1,000 samples per day.Several experts have said that aggressive testing is the mainstay in the battle against the disease that has killed at least 77,000 people globally because the infection often spreads undetected.Also read: Covid-19 lockdown could be extended by 2 weeks, say officials after GoM meetSouth Korea and Germany have led the charge in mass testing, which has helped control the spread of new infections and kept the fatality rate low.“The second T is tracing,” Kejriwal said. “Tracing is being carried out at a very good level in Delhi and now we have started taking help from the police as well to check if the people who have been traced are staying under self-quarantine.”Kejriwal said that the government has so far given contact numbers of 27,702 people for tracing to the police. A person’s movement can be tracked through their phone. “Today, we are going to give 2,000 phone numbers of people who were brought out of Markaz to find out if they roamed in the area around Markaz. The areas they went out to, will be sealed and monitored.”The recent spike in infections has largely been propelled by the detection of hundreds of patients who attended gatherings of the Jamaat in Delhi’s Nizamuddin Basti last month in a violation of several restrictions. Cases linked to the meet have been reported across two dozen states and Union Territories so far. “Our third T is treatment,” Kejriwal said. “If someone gets infected with Covid-19, then we will have to provide that person with treatment. Delhi has 525 positive Covid-19 cases so far and we have made arrangements for 3,000 beds.”He said the Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (1,500 beds), GB Pant Hospital (500) and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (450) have been declared as dedicated facilities to treat the new disease. The government has also earmarked 400 beds at three private hospitals – Max Saket (318 beds), Apollo (50 beds) and Sir Ganga Ram Kolmet Hospital (42 beds). “At present, there are 2,950 beds reserved for Covid-19 cases. If the number of patients crosses 3,000, we will use 1,500 beds at GTB (Guru Tegh Bahadur) hospital, following which we will have arrangements for 4,500 cases,” Kejriwal said.“In this manner, we can go up to 30,000 beds if needed. We will have 8,000 beds at hospitals,12,000 hotel rooms will be taken over, and around 10,000 patients will be kept in banquet halls and dharamshalas. Most serious patients with heart, liver, cancer, diabetes and above 50 years of age will be kept in hospitals. Patients below 50 years and with minor symptoms will be kept in hotels and dharamshalas, but with all medical facilities,” he added.A spokesperson at Max Healthcare said: “We believe that to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, it is essential for us to have dedicated hospitals. We are working closely with the Govt of Delhi and have established a dedicated COVID 19 facility at Max Hospital Saket, East Block.”A review of Delhi’s preparedness by a five-member expert panel recently showed that the current facilities would be able to handle 100 cases every day. While detailing the findings of the review, Kejriwal had said the Capital needed to be ready for the worst scenario and that his government was in the process of ramping up the health care infrastructure.Experts maintain that it important for Delhi to upgrade its infrastructure to pre-empt a crisis similar to the one that has befallen New York. With cases skyrocketing, New York’s health care system is teetering on the brink of collapse. Late in March, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said that the strained health care system had the personnel and supplies to make it through only one more week.In Delhi, Kejriwal said that 400 ventilators and 1,200 oxygen beds will be needed if there are 30,000 active patients in Delhi and arrangements were being made.“Calculations have been done regarding PPE (personal protective equipment) kits. It has been an area of concern. We have received help from the Centre and we have placed an order for the kits which we’ll start to receive from next week. The Centre will be providing 27,000 PPE kits to us,” said Kejriwal.The CM said that the fourth T was teamwork, and stressed on cooperation between the Centre and state governments, and the public and health care professions.The fifth T, he said, is tracking and monitoring. “I have spoken so much, but these things need to be tracked and monitored as well and it’s my responsibility to track the moment-to-moment plan we have prepared. I am tracking it 24 hours,” he added.A senior official in the chief minister’s office said that Kejriwal’s first briefing every day is scheduled through a conference call with the health department at 10am. It is compulsory for the health minister, the chief secretary and the health secretary to be part of it. Usually, he prepares his briefs and joins the lieutenant governor’s meeting after that through video-conferencing. Later in the day, the CM then heads review meetings with representatives of the task force that he heads, the official said on condition of anonymity.Health experts and private hospitals welcomed the action plan presented on Tuesday.Vikas Maurya, head of the pulmonology at Delhi’s Fortis Hospital, said: “Rapid antibody tests result is a faster diagnosis. It is faster, cheaper and accurate – a smart way strategy in dealing with a large number of potential patients in cluster hotspots. There is one issue. This test is more accurate when dealing with a person who is infected for at least 8-9 days. Negative results may require repetition of tests after certain intervals.”Charu Hans, former head of the microbiology department at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, said: “We have limited resources, so we need a smart strategy. One has to have a clear protocol on what nature of individuals is to be tested under the said strategy. At this juncture, it is recommended to conduct tests only among symptomatic individuals in hot spots.”Jugal Kishore, head of the department, community medicine, at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “Simple random sampling is a scientific method and can provide a signal on possible community spread. But, when there is a resource constraint; the government should explore the possibility of conducting snowball sampling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-test-trace-treat-in-delhi-s-5t-plan/story-ab7xHFLtvRmWbIWB3gRQgI.html
08-04-2020||India||Maharashtra Covid cases tally crosses 1,000 mark||With 150 new cases, the Covid-19 tally in Maharashtra on Tuesday crossed the 1,000-mark to reach 1,018, the highest for any state. This was the steepest one-day rise in the number of cases in Maharashtra and came on a day when Maharashtra recorded 12 Covid-19 related deaths and took the state’s death toll from the pandemic to 64, state health department officials said. Of the 150, 116 new cases in Maharashtra were reported from Mumbai, which accounts now for 642, the highest among Indian cities. Also on Tuesday, Mumbai reported 100 new cases and five deaths, taking the total number of infections in the city to 590 and deaths to 40. Mumbai has over 60% of the total positive cases in Maharashtra. Two high risk areas in Mumbai have been identified as Dharavi, and the Worli Koliwada area.To break the chain of the coronavirus transmission, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday barred the sale of vegetables and fruits on footpaths and on open markets in the 241 containment zones of Mumbai. Out of the 100 patients who tested positive in Mumbai on Tuesday, 55 people were among the contacts in high risk containment areas. Pune recorded 18 cases on Tuesday, while Nagpur, Aurangabad, and Ahmednagar reported two each. Six of the 12 deaths on Tuesday were reported from Mumbai, followed by three in Pune and one each in Nagpur, Thane and Satara. According to the state health department, 34,695 people have been put under home while 4,008 under institutional quarantine. It added 20,877 tests (5,564 of them in private laboratories) have been carried out so far across the state, resulting in 1,018 positive cases. Seventy-nine Covid-19 patients have been discharged after their complete recovery, officials said.The rise in the cases necessitated a state cabinet meeting on Tuesday via video conferencing as some of the ministers were in their constituencies. Officials said the ministers pressed for additional testing facilities to understand the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19.“The government is likely to seek permission for more labs for testing,” an official said on condition of anonymity. A private laboratory can start testing only if it is certified by the Indian Council for Medical Research. In March, Maharashtra had applied for and received permission to set up at least seven new private laboratories in addition to the National Institute of Virology in Pune and Kasturba Hospital Lab in Mumbai. “We have increased the number to more than 1,500 tests per day,” said another official, who did not wish to be named.  He added the cabinet also discussed continuing the three-week lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 spread beyond April 15. “The decision on extending the lockdown is awaited,” a state minister said on condition of anonymity. “We have screened nearly 1.5 million people, conducted around 10,500 tests. This is why the numbers are high,” a BMC official said, requesting anonymity. “Out of the six deceased , four had pre-existing respiratory illnesses, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney diseases and other comorbidities,” a health officer said requesting anonymity. “ None of the deceased had a history of international travel.” According to the state Medical Education and Drugs Department data, Maharashtra’s mortality rate is 5.99%, which is higher than 3.4% globally. An official said the cabinet also discussed how Kerala managed to keep its mortality rate low -- around 0.7%. Kerala had 336 Covid-19 cases until Tuesday but has reported only two deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-covid-cases-tally-crosses-1-000-mark/story-OCqZFB7OyXT6Ub8C0HUkvL.html
08-04-2020||India||Kerala-Karnataka border row resolved, Centre tells top court||The Supreme Court on Tuesday disposed of a bunch of petitions against the closure of the Kerala-Karnataka border as part of measures to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic after the Centre informed it about a protocol put in place to facilitate a free movement of patients between the two states.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, told the court that the protocol was agreed to after a meeting of officials of Union home ministry and the two states. The protocol will facilitate a free movement of patients seeking treatment along the interstate border in Karnataka’s Mangalore.“In view of the above statement, the instant special leave petitions and the writ petitions are disposed of,” the court said in its order.The Supreme Court earlier on April 3 asked the two states and the Centre to arrive at an amicable solution to ensure movement of vehicles in case of medical emergencies.Karnataka blocked National Highway 66 connecting the state with Kerala’s northern districts last month.The Kerala high court on April 1 noted that the national highway network comes under the Centre while ordering the removal of the blockade on a petition of a group of lawyers. Karnataka moved the Supreme Court against the order on April 2.The Supreme Court separately on Tuesday issued a notice to the Centre and the Assam government on a plea that has sought the release of three people, who have spent over two years in foreigners’ detention centres. One Rajubala Das, the petitioner, highlighted the risk of the Covid-19 spread due to overcrowding in detention centres.The court gave liberty to the petitioner to share a copy of the petition with Mehta and posted the case for hearing next on April 13.The petitioner has cited the Supreme Court’s March 23 order directing states and Union territories to set up high powered committees to determine which class of prisoners can be released on parole or interim bail.“For instance, the State/Union Territory could consider the release of prisoners who have been convicted or are undertrial for offences for which prescribed punishment is up to 7 years or less,” the top court had suggested.There are six detention centres in Assam where 802 persons are lodged as on March 6 for illegally entering the country. They are confined in detention centres so that their physical presence can be ensured at all times for repatriation to their home country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-karnataka-border-row-resolved-centre-tells-top-court/story-meadzqEzEsqXyj4MkVYKEK.html
08-04-2020||India||10 Madhya Pradesh policemen contracted coronavirus from Jamaat men: IG||The 10 policemen in Madhya Pradesh who have tested positive for Covid-19 probably got the virus from Tablighi Jamaat members, who were hiding in different mosques in the state capital, Bhopal, a senior police official said. The policemen are the second group of government officials to be infected , Meanwhile, the number of health directorate staff who have tested positive for Covid-19 has increased to 38, according to government data. Senior health deparment officials, who, despite testing positive, insisted on being treated at home, were admitted to a hospital on Monday night. The total number of Covid-19 positive cases in Bhopal as on Tuesday evening was recorded at 83.The 10 infected policemen include a city superintendent of police (CSP), a sub-inspector and eight constables ; five of their family members have tested positive too. Other policemen who came in contact with the infected policemen are in self-quarantine, government officials said. Inspector general (IG) of police, Bhopal, Upendra Jain, said: “There is a 99.99% chance that our policemen contracted the virus while conducting a search to locate those who attended the Tablighi Jamaat meeting in Delhi, in various mosques (in the city).”He said, “Police personnel of mainly two police stations in Bhopal -- Jehangirabad and Aishbagh -- were involved in the search. Many of them stay in the residential colony on TT Nagar police station premises.”According to the officer, as many as 32 jamaats including 7 foreign jamaats were traced as staying at various places in Bhopal with each of jamaat comprising about 12 persons. As many as 12 of the jamaats took part in the event in Delhi. Of these Tablighi jamaat members, at least 20 have ested positive for Covid-19. According to Jain, “all the police stations in Bhopal are being sanitised”. He added that roughly 1000 policemen will stay in hotels. “They will follow all the norms of social distancing while performing their duties. I hope, these measures will be effective in controlling spread of the virus in the next few days.”Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan warned Tablighi Markaz people on Tuesday night that criminal cases will be lodged against them if they don’t disclose their whereabouts.Chouhan in his tweet posted on Tuesday night said, “All residents of Madhya Pradesh who went to Nizamuddin Markaz and those from foreign countries hiding in mosques have been identified and quarantined. But even after this if someone is hiding somewhere my request to him is to share information about him with the administration in 24 hours.”He warned, “If it is not done then administration will take necessary legal action by lodging criminal cases against them for jeopardising security of the state.”Meanwhile, five people who allegedly attacked a police team in Talaiya police station area of Bhopal on Monday night were arrested and booked under National Security Act (NSA) too on Tuesday, according to Talaiya police station.Those arrested are: Shahid alias Kabootar, Nafees Qureshi, Shahrukh Khan, Mohd Javed and Mohd Mohsin Khan.Earlier, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted on Tuesday,” Lesson needs to be taught to those who indulges in anarchism. These goondas will be booked under NSA.”In a late night action on Monday, the police shifted three senior state government officials including the principal secretary and the additional director of the health department to hospitals following an intervention by the CM, government officials said. These officers were insisting on being treated at home.The officials argued that since they didn’t have any symptoms of Covid-19 despite having tested positive, as per World Health Organisation (WHO)’s advisory they should be treated in their homes only while under quarantine. In a written statement on Tuesday night Commissioner, health services Faiz Ahmad Kidwai said, “An inquiry is being conducted to find out reasons behind a large number of Health directorate officials and employees having been infected with Covid-19. The district administration has been instructed to look into the contact history of affected persons and inquire into the order in which they have been affected. Tracing is necessary to know who met whom and from where it all started. After the inquiry responsibility will be fixed on persons concerned and necessary action will be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-mp-policemen-contracted-virus-from-jamaat-men-ig/story-em0Ld0NitKkw2JoyESVqAN.html
08-04-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee exempts bidi industry, betel leaves plantations from lockdown||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday exempted the state’s bidi industry, betel plantations and flower markets from the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus, saying the step was necessary to save millions in the rural areas.“The bidi industry is badly hit. Millions depend on it. However, only one person should carry the bidis from the factories to the markets. Betel leaf and flower growers are hit too. I would like to tell people that they should not crowd shops to buy paan. Social distancing must be maintained,” the chief minister said at a press conference at the state secretariat.Till Monday, Bengal claimed that only three people have died of Covid-19 so far and eight other reported deaths were caused by co-morbidity. On Tuesday, Banerjee said the toll in the state had reached five but did not clarify where these two people died. She said the infections were reported from seven zones in the state but did not identify these. “Of the 69 cases, 60 are related to nine families,” said Banerjee.Asked how many of those who attended the Taglighi Jamaat event in Delhi have been identified and quarantined, she said, “Don’t ask me communal question.”She said the government is prepared for a likely rush of people stranded in other states when the lockdown is lifted. “I don’t know if the lockdown will be lifted. But when it happens, people stranded in other states will rush to come home. We have to be cautious. We will ask these people to stay in isolation at safe houses set by the state. We call these “amar nijer bari” (my own home). Please consider these your own home,” said Banerjee.During the press conference, the chief minister also interacted in a video link with Nobel laureate economist Abhijit Binayak Banerjee.“I suggest that the government sets up teams in the districts to look for people with symptoms of Covid-19. Cough and cold is common in Bengal and people don’t pay attention. Testing samples may help identify patients. Reporting these suspects is important and women working for the Asha welfare scheme can help,” said the economist.The chief minister said more renowned people have been inducted in the global advisory board set up to help the state. They are Swarup Sarkar, a former regional director of World Health Organisation; Tom Frieden, former chief of Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, USA; Jishnu Das, economist, World Bank; JVR Prasad Rao, retired IAS officer and former Union health secretary; Siddhartha Dube, communication specialist, UNAIDS; Sukumar Mukherjee, a renowned doctor. Public health specialist Dr Abhijit Chowdhury is convenor of the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-exempts-bidi-industry-betel-leaves-plantations-from-lockdown/story-ILySV7Ez7zPVfneI3T5s0I.html
08-04-2020||India||Nizamuddin’s ‘sehat apas’ step up to serve their Basti||htreporters@hindustantimes.com​New Delhi: ​When 50-year-old Mussarat Begum was first asked to be at the forefront of a door-to-door Covid-19 survey in Nizamuddin Basti, she hesitated. ​ A resident of the Basti, she was keenly following the developments surrounding the outbreak and was particularly concerned about its impact on her neighbourhood after more than 2,300 people -- several of whom later tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2 infection -- were evacuated from the Markaz building, the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat.​But, on Sunday, Begum, along with more than 30 colleagues who are called “sehat apas” (health sisters) and “sehat sahelis” (health friends) stepped up at the call of the Delhi government and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to conduct the survey in her neighbourhood. ​“I had not stepped out since the ‘janta curfew’ was declared on March 22. Naturally, I was scared about the survey, but then I thought when else will I get an opportunity to serve the neighbourhood where I’ve grown up,” said Begum, one among the 50 women volunteers of the community health programme that has been functioning in the area since 2008. The Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), with the support of Tata Trusts, started it to serve as a link between the local community and public health services.​The two-day survey (April 5 and 6) was a collaboration between the Delhi government, 13 teams of ANMs (auxillary nurse midwife) from SDMC, Delhi Police, CRPF jawans and, the women volunteers from AKTC. The Basti was divided into eight clusters for it -- Nizam Nagar, Dildar Nagar, Khusrau Nagar, Gali Gadarian, Kali Masjid, Qureshi Masjid, Musafir Khana, and Zamin Nagar.​The volunteers, guided by Delhi government doctors, were armed with N-95 masks, surgical gloves, caps, and bottles of sanitizers.​“Local volunteers of Aga Khan Trust were involved so that people do not hesitate and participate positively in the exercise. All areas were covered and a day after the exercise, teams were sent again to verify if anyone is left in areas,” said an official from SDMC who asked not to be named. ​Deepak Padhi, a senior programme officer at AKTC, said that the community health team been working to save lives in the Basti for the last 10 years. “The years of training, experience and local knowledge was useful in carrying out the survey, which the group did with a deep sense of responsibility, and sometimes against the wishes of their families.” he said.​Having been involved in the health care programme in the area, these women volunteers have been closely connected with the people who live in area. But the survey turned out to be more challenging than they expected. ​“Initially, many of the respondents felt that we are carrying out the National Citizens Register (NCR) survey, so we had to halt mid way,” said Meher-ul-Nisa Khan (36), one of the volunteers. “Consequently we made a lot of effort and reached out to everyone in advance to explain that the only purpose of the survey was to protect us from coronavirus,” she added. ​The volunteers ascertained if anyone had developed flu-like symptoms, if they had been in contact with infected people from the Tablighi, or if they knew of other infected people in the neighbourhood. One family with six members was found to have symptoms of Covid-19, and they have been kept in home isolation with quarantine a sticker placed on the door.Apart from keeping track of the health of the members in each household, the surveyers handed out masks and sanitisers in each house. They were spoke to the people about the helpline numbers they could call of they experienced Covid-like symptoms.​Delhi government officials said that people from about 95% of the 2,000 houses in the area willing participated in survey, while the remaining either refused to take part, or the houses were found locked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nizamuddin-s-sehat-apas-step-up-to-serve-their-basti/story-kBI9ubFIXSlpWxod353cyO.html

Arjun Baraik’s body could not be brought to his remote Jharkhand village due to the ongoing lockdown to check the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.“I cannot express my pain. My son’s body could not be brought to our village due to the lockdown. His friends there in Goa showed us the funeral on phone,” said Baraik’s father, Ram Kumar, 42, a mason.Baraik had left the village around five months back in search of work. “Arjun first went to Gujarat. But he did not like the work there and then went to Goa some two months back and worked at a hotel,” said Baraik’s uncle, Suraj.Baraik’s family came to know that he was suffering from jaundice a week back and wanted to bring him back but could not due to the lockdown. “His friends there [in Goa] admitted him to a hospital for treatment... he died on Sunday night,” Suraj said.Baraik’s friend, Niku Gaud, who is from Odisha, said a week ago the former’s health started deteriorating. “...when he started facing breathing problem, we took him to a hospital. He died at 9pm on Sunday. Doctors said he was suffering from acute jaundice.” He said since there was no way to send his body to his village, they arranged for cremation in Goa on Monday. “His entire family gathered in his village in Jharkhand. We showed them the cremation live on phone through a video call from here in Goa.

Austerity measures which can be used to divert much-needed funds to the fight against Covid-19 are the need of the hour. In this spirit, I am writing to offer five concrete suggestions. I am certain you will find value in them,” she said.Gandhi demanded a complete ban on media advertisements --- television, print and online --- by the government and public sectors undertakings (PSUs) for a period of two years, with the exceptions being advisories for Covid-19 or issues relating to public health.“Given that the central government currently spends an average of Rs 1,250 crore per year on media advertisements (not including an equal or greater amount spent by PSUs and government companies), this will free up a substantial amount to alleviate the economic and social impacts of Covid-19,” she added.The Congress chief also sought immediate suspension of the Central Vista project. “At a time like this, such an outlay seems self-indulgent to say the least. I am certain that Parliament can function comfortably within the existing historical buildings. There is no urgent or pressing requirement that cannot be postponed until this crisis is contained. This sum could instead be allocated towards constructing new hospital infrastructure and diagnostics along with equipping our frontline workers with personal protection equipment (PPE) and better facilities.”In her third suggestion, Gandhi sought a proportionate reduction of 30% in the expenditure budget (other than salaries, pensions and central sector schemes) for the central government as well.“This 30% (Rs 2.5 lakh crore per year approximately) can then be allocated towards establishing an economic safety net for migrant workers, labourers, farmers, MSMEs and those in the unorganised sector,” she added. The Congress president also urged Modi to put on hold all foreign visits, including that of the President, the Prime Minister, Union ministers, chief ministers, state ministers and bureaucrats. “Exceptions can be made in case of special emergency or exigencies in national interest to be cleared by the PM. This amount (which is around Rs 393 crore for just the Prime Minister and Union cabinet’s trips in the last five years) can be utilised extensively in measures to combat Covid-19.”In her fifth suggestion, Gandhi demanded transfer of all money under PM-CARES fund to the PM-NRF. “This will ensure efficiency, transparency, accountability and audit in the manner in which these funds are allocated and spent. It seems like a waste of effort and resources to have and create two separate silos for the distribution of funds. I understand that Rs 3800 crore approximately are lying unutilised in the PM-NRF (at the end of FY2019). These funds, plus the amount in ‘PM-Cares’, can be utilised to ensure an immediate food security net for those at the very margins of society,” she said.Gandhi further wrote, “Every single Indian has made great personal sacrifices to fight this disease. They have complied with every suggestion, instruction and decision taken by your office and the Central Government. It is time that the Legislature and the Executive reciprocate this trust and good faith. Please be assured that you have our unwavering support in meeting the grave challenge of Covid-19 facing the country.”This is Gandhi’s fifth letter to the Prime Minister since March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-sonia-gandhi-s-5-tips-to-fight-covid-19-one-is-about-pm-cares-fund/story-upVVZG4zwVNpyTLFar7nML.html
08-04-2020||Today's||2 lockdown violations that reveal the weak spot of Indian State | Opinion||Article 14 of the Indian Constitution promises equality under the law and that everyone must be dealt with equally. Our Constitution provides protection to religions, classes and categories in education, reservation, the criminal law is agnostic in the matter of determining guilt. If you break the law, the penal code and other statutes treat all persons equally, though sentences awarded may vary. The recent controversy in Delhi regarding the Tablighi Jamaat continuing to house thousands of people in its premises or a few hundred found at Gurdwara Majnu ka Tila, despite the impending threat of Covid-19 and the closedown of religious institutions, are issues of public safety, health and consequential criminal sanctions. Even after the curfew (under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code) and directions under the Disaster Management Act were in place, the continued presence of large numbers at such religious places has posed a health hazard not only to those present, but to each individual who came in touch with these potential carriers of the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen. As per reports over 21,200 people have been placed under quarantine on this account alone, and the human cost that these follies will bring are yet to be discovered in the weeks and months ahead. What this tragedy exposes is the Indian state’s unstated inability to act with speed and effectively against religious communities and institutions, even where there is a blatant breach of law. A thought process, which instead of enforcing the law, effectively looks at the collateral issues and possible repercussions of action against those who profess or propagate religion is the weak spot of the Indian state in its application of law. Whether it is the Tablighi Jamaat gathering or the Majnu Ka Tilla Gurdwara crowd, (both in Delhi), such gathering of persons for religious functions was clearly in breach of the law and FIRs have been registered. But the investigation is only a reactive, and not preventive approach to the breach of the law which will take its course if a chargesheet is eventually filed with prosecution. What is a matter of further anguish is that while the provisions of the Disaster Management Act and of Section 144 Cr.PC were in force, its breach, punishable also under penal provisions for the spread of disease under Sections 269, 270 and 271 (Indian Penal Code) is being questioned in some quarters.Others err no less while portraying it as a communal issue, which it neither was nor is. Such angularities have to be discarded because our purpose must only be to ensure that every resource, legal or otherwise, be applied effectively to contain this dreaded disease. To term this health and public safety issue as a communal issue, or alternatively castigate a community, is a breach of the law and may invite criminal action.The pan-India effort to enforce our laws while dealing with Covid-19 is an issue of health, enforcement of criminal law, public safety and order. Whether preventive action is sought to be taken by state authorities or prosecution launched, we, as Indians and as members of the human race occupying this planet must realize, that it is time for us to act as one world and one people, and in India as one nation. It is time to step beyond our differences and focus on the larger good – that the protection of 130 crore people in India is ensured by effective and equal enforcement of the law.There are brave men and women in the field - doctors, paramedics, government employees, police officers all of whom are risking their lives, and those of their families, to ensure that we tide over this crisis with minimal loss of human lives. Doctors who treat their patients do not examine or consider the caste, creed or religion while saving lives. Nor do police and government officers enforcing the lockdown.And while the law must be equally applied irrespective of caste, creed and religion, those who question the application of the law or alternatively seek to focus on this exclusively health and safety issue on communal lines are, in fact, obstructing the national cause.(Sidharth Luthra is former Additional Solicitor General of India, and Ketaki Goswami is a lawyer)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/2-lockdown-violations-that-reveal-the-weak-spot-of-indian-state-opinion/story-KGWR65jbvgU8q7t8a6KKAI.html
08-04-2020||Today's||Political leadership is up and ready. Now it’s time for the bureaucracy | Opinion||We, as a human race, are at war with this deadly coronavirus, called Covid -19. Various countries, in their past, had to face similar kinds of catastrophic diseases and had to suffer the devastating consequences. Each time, the human survival spirit overwhelmed the catastrophe and recovered from the shocks and life moved on. With immense scientific advancement and extraordinary communication infrastructure availability, it seems the human race is better equipped to tackle the current pandemic. India also is currently under lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and reduce its impact on our people.It is heartening to note that despite various hardships faced by a large section of our vulnerable population, people have overwhelmingly cooperated with the lockdown, and by and large, adhered to the governmental guidelines.Our medical professionals, governmental machinery, policing system have shown exemplary professionalism in enforcing the rules set out by the government to contain the spread of this deadly virus. They deserve the nation’s gratitude, applause and fullest support. Certainly, the battle has just begun and we have a long way to go before we declare victory over it. Undoubtedly, we had never faced this kind of situation ever in the past so it is a big challenge for the administrative machinery. Though our system has shown its remarkable capacity to handle various kinds of emergencies such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and other such major upheavals, this situation is totally unprecedented and requires long-term sustained efforts on the part of our bureaucratic system to turn the tide.This, in turn, requires quick, decisive and reasoned decision making at all levels of the government. Fortunately, the political leadership of our country is ready and willing to take tough decisions as is clear from the decision taken to declare a countrywide lockdown for 21 days.My personal experience of working under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is that if you are taking decisions with honest motives and in the interest of the people at large, there is no need to fear anything. I enjoyed full freedom as per law to decide issues and act as per my best judgement. So it is now for the bureaucracy to take this situation as a challenge and steer the country out of the woods with their dedication and commitment to the onerous task at hand.Unlike other countries such as in Europe, our system is burdened with manifold responsibilities. On the one hand, it has to contain the spread of the virus by enforcing the guidelines regarding social distancing and lockdown, on the other it has to ensure that critically-ill patients are given all the necessary medical treatment and support. In addition, large quarantine facilities are to be created and run properly to ensure containment of the virus. Along with this, maintaining the uninterrupted and regular supply of essential goods is a huge responsibility that requires skilled coordination and administrative effort. Then there is the problem of the migrant labourers, daily wage workers and such others whose livelihood has been severely affected by the lockdown.The system has to ensure that these vulnerable sections of the population are taken care of by ensuring that money is transferred to their accounts without any delay. It is the job of the bureaucracy at the higher levels to not only ensure the transfer of money sanctioned to the needy but to also regularly assess the actual requirement based on concrete data depending on how long the lockdown continues. The system has to act in such a coordinated and thoughtful manner that the common people of our country should have the satisfaction that the government is standing with them in their hour of need to look after them.Also Read: Government looks at ways to restart business ops post lockdownI am sure that those at the helm of affairs must have taken all the available facts and data into consideration to suggest to the decision makers the future course of action to combat the coronavirus. This strategy has to look holistically into the experience of the past month, the spread of the virus, preparedness of our health system, supply of masks and other personal protection equipment, ventilators, economic condition of the most vulnerable section of the population, the essential item supply chain situation, rabi crop harvesting and grain market operations to name a few. Let us remember that this coronavirus will be controlled, sooner than later, but our country’s economy has to be brought back on rails at the earliest. For this to happen, our bureaucracy has to put their best foot forward and show to the country why they are called the steel frame. Time has come for that.(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer.

08-04-2020||Editorials||Covid-19: Take care of vulnerable citizens| HT Editorial||India’s 21-day national lockdown has been a trying time for all residents, in varying degrees. However, what has gone almost unnoticed is the plight of India’s persons with disabilities (PWDs). Reports about the difficulties that PWDs are facing during the lockdown forced the government to act to provide access to information and essential services, but these have not been operationalised effectively yet. The issue of inaccessibility, even in normal circumstances, is cause for worry, since 2.2% of India’s population, or 26.8 million people, suffer from some form of disability. A pandemic (Covid-19) only exacerbates this problem. According to the World Health Organization, PWDs are at high-risk of infection due to their physical, mental and cognitive impediments. Quarantining, social distancing and working from home are almost impossible due to their everyday dependence on caregivers. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, enjoins upon disaster management authorities to include PWDs in their crisis response. To be sure, the ministry of social justice and empowerment asked states and Union territories to make information about Covid-19 accessible — through audiotapes, braille, videographics with subtitles, and sign language interpretation. But a lot remains out of reach. Most markets, Covid-19 testing and quarantine centres are not disabled-friendly, despite PWDs being at high-risk.Yes, the country is overwhelmed and its systems overburdened with an unprecedented emergency, but it must demarcate a clear chain of command for its vulnerable in its fight. Ensure doorstep deliveries of essential supplies, make areas more accessible, give PWDs the support system they need. India owes it to PWDs to be more inclusive, especially now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid-19-take-care-of-vulnerable-citizens/story-CaZZfe3tIyZuxeiP4pifzI.html
08-04-2020||Editorials||India’s make or break moment| HT Editorial||India is at the crossroads in its battle against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). There are two scenarios. It will see a relatively manageable rise in the number of cases, but low fatality rates, a health system prepared to deal with new patients, and, sooner rather than later, the flattening of the curve. This is broadly South Korea’s trajectory. Or it will see a surge of cases; an unfortunate, dramatic rise in fatalities; overrun health facilities; and infected health workers — it will then remain at this peak for several weeks, before an eventual dip. This is broadly the trajectory of Italy and the United States.Why is this period critical? One, India has finally ramped up testing (though experts believe it is still not enough); this means there will be an increase in known cases. This, in itself, is nothing to be alarmed about, as long as it is accompanied by aggressive contact tracing, isolation, and treatment. Two, it is now a little over two weeks of the lockdown. This is also, broadly, the period when those infected begin to show symptoms. Those who may have got exposed to the virus before the lockdown will, at this stage, be getting tested positive. But over the next week, the effect of the lockdown will become visible. The indicator to watch out for here is whether the rate of growth of positive cases begins dipping. Three, migrant workers went back home soon after the lockdown was announced — if that did lead to the spread of the infection, including in rural areas, it will begin getting reflected in numbers around this time. Four, the government has now had 15 days to ramp up the health infrastructure, put in place quarantine facilities, expand beds, procure personal protective equipment (PPEs) and increase the supply of ventilators. Its record has been mixed, with specific concerns on PPEs for health workers, the absence of which can undermine the entire health system.The results will also determine the government’s decision on the lockdown. There appears to be unanimity among key decision-makers in the central and state governments about the need to continue with a set of restrictions, particularly for affected clusters. The difference is about whether a total lockdown should continue or it should be partial. The answer to that will be provided by the numbers over the next six days. India must hope for the best, but be prepared for all scenarios.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/india-s-make-or-break-moment/story-gvWsYhkXSE7lShdB1XaZ4N.html
08-04-2020||Editorials||How anti-Americanism blinds us||You have to be quite reckless to be seen like defending both United States (US) President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Even if on the tiny issue of a two-rupee, or three cents a pill of a drug so old it was in the market for a full two years before I was born, and went off-patent when I was 32. Namely, hydroxycholoroquine (HCQ). And you must be absolutely nuts if at the same time you also take on anti-Americanism, the most durable of our ideological hypocrisies. Cast in titanium.But after four decades in journalism and courting danger — and abuse — from all sides, let us do some plain-speaking.To begin with, as the currently fashionable expression goes: Aap chronology samajhiye (Understand the timeline). It was in his daily White House press conference on March 19 that Trump first mentioned hydroxychloroquine, or HCQ as it’s popularly known. He said there had been encouraging results among coronavirus patients administered HCQ and Z-Pak (American brand name for antibiotic Azithromycin).Trump can be accused of anything, but not understatement or discretion. So, he called this a game-changer. On March 21, he re-asserted this in a tweet. On March 22, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) issued a notification prescribing HCQ as a chemoprophylactic (preventive) for health personnel as well as family members looking after a Covid-19 patient. This set off a run on the drug.While Trump was roundly attacked and ridiculed as usual in the American media for “misusing“ his office to plug prescription medications, the US placed large orders with leading generic manufacturers in India. This fact was scooped by ThePrint’s fine health and pharma reporter Himani Chandna in a story published on March 22. Three days later, India notified a ban on export of HCQ.Alarmed at the prospect of hoarding and panicky self-medication, the Centre issued a notification on March 26 listing it in Schedule H1, thereby restricting its retail sale.Remember, the ban had come after the US, and likely also Brazil, had already placed orders and also paid some advances to private Indian firms for what was, after all, a routine, long off-patent, cheap drug. Or drugs, as Brazil wanted paracetamol too.After Democrats and the media had had fun with “Dr Trump”, on March 20, New York governor and current liberal darling, Andrew Cuomo, told anchor Sean Hannity that he’s getting 10,000 doses of HCQ and Azithromycin and releasing it for a trial on 1,100 patients in his state, now the global Covid-19 epicentre.On Saturday (April 4) morning, Trump called Modi. In the evening, at his press conference, he said that he had requested Modi to release the supplies of HCQ “we had ordered”. He said Modi said he will consider it. He, of course, went on to say that they (India) make a lot of it, which is true. He further added that India also needs a lot of it (true), because it has 1.5 billion people (not true).On Sunday (March 5) morning, Trump spoke with Modi again. In reply to a journalist’s question at his Monday evening (Washington time, remember, so around 4 am IST Tuesday) press briefing, he let it out that he had had another conversation with Modi on Sunday morning (Washington time) and that he was likely to release the HCQ, the US had ordered earlier. What if India says no, the reporter asked, will there be a retaliation? I don’t believe that is what they are planning to do at all, said Trump, India and the US are doing very well with each other. And then added, as an afterthought, if they say no, of course there may be retaliation, why wouldn’t that be?We woke up to outrage on Tuesday morning. Trump twisted Modi’s arm and he gave in. India is down on its knees in front of the Americans again. Modi has sold Indian sovereignty and Covid-19 patients’ lives to Trump.Now the little point I had deliberately excluded in my chronology, for suspense. Three respected media organisations, HT Group’s Mint, The Hindu, and (please allow me to add) ThePrint, had reported on Monday, April 6, 12 to 18 hours before Trump’s Monday evening presser, that India had already decided to lift the ban. In fact, The Hindu and Mint had recorded that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro had called as well, and the ban was lifted for him too.It was all done and dusted before Trump “threatened” this morning. Please do remember the time difference between Washington and New Delhi.But facts are boring, you see. Why let facts come in the way of your “tubelight” outrage?Paracetamol and HCQ are cheap, generic, mass-produced drugs long off-patent. India has the unique strength to make these for the world now. It should use it, not squat on it. The coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) has made these drugs, usually sold in bulk, like a commodity, valuable to the world. If Heads of State are calling in for these, it is an opportunity for India. And by the way, the raw material or Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) for paracetamol comes from China. From Wuhan, in fact.And surrender to America? What did we call it through the 1960s, when we lived a ship-to-mouth existence? It was also our most anti-American decade. Today, the Americans need an ordinary drug, and we must deny it to them? The reason we call unthinking anti-Americanism our most durable, cast-in-titanium hypocrisy.By special arrangement with ThePrintThe views expressed are personal .htandtheprintwrap {width:100%; font-family:"PT Serif"; color:#000; text-decoration:none; font-size:130%; font-style:italic; float:left}.htandtheprintimg {width:auto; float:left}.htandtheprinttext {width:auto; margin-right:10px; line-height:30px;float:left}||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/how-anti-americanism-blinds-us/story-S8F2XjI46Fuo7J3pgz5tEL.html
08-04-2020||Editorials||Cooperate on health supplies | HT Editorial||The Indian government’s decision to conditionally lift its export ban on 14 pharmaceutical products, including much-in-demand hydroxychloroquine, is correct. It has done an assessment that shows there is enough for internal requirements plus a buffer. A large number of strategically important countries, ranging from India’s South Asian neighbours to the United States (US), had asked to tap into India’s large pharmaceutical base. India also saw an opportunity to display leadership in rolling back the present “beggar thy neighbour” policies that are fragmenting global medical supply chains to the detriment of all coronavirus victims. Remember, India is as dependent on external medical supplies as anyone else. Even into the fourth month of the pandemic, India is importing tonnes of protective gear and testing kits from all over the world. Even before US President Donald Trump’s unacceptable reference to possible “retaliation”, India — based on an assessment of its domestic needs, the need to ensure it remains in a position to ask the US itself for critical supplies, and display statesmanship — had decided to go ahead. While the initial bans and restrictions on medical supplies and drugs were an inevitable panicked response, over time, it is becoming clear they make little sense. No government has the ability to manufacture every variety of medical equipment and manufacture all varieties of drugs within its borders. Many political leaders believe these are make-or-break times and this pressure manifests itself in unseemly ways. Hence Mr Trump’s personal obsession with chloroquine and his boorish language regarding India’s earlier ban on the medicine. India’s own behaviour has not been without fault. The continuing decision to ban the export of diagnostic kits, irrespective of disease, was harmful to many developing nations and deserves to be reviewed. Hopefully, India’s decision on the pharmaceutical front indicates a formula-based policy, which will add to a global momentum towards greater openness and cooperation in handling the pandemic. In a viral sea, no country is an island.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/cooperate-on-health-supplies/story-wCvojMTnESEdgeoUwTOt1O.html
08-04-2020||Editorials||Bhilwara’s ‘ruthless containment’ model | HT Editorial||Bhilwara emerged as one of India’s early coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hotspots. With the infection spreading from a hospital, 27 people tested positive. But, for the past week, the Rajasthan district has not reported a positive case. To be sure, cases could emerge again. But this turnaround is a remarkable story, and is now being considered as a possible model to be replicated elsewhere in the country. The Rajasthan government focused on a comprehensive approach. The first step was locking down the district on March 20, five days before the national lockdown was announced. This eventually extended into a strict curfew, where even essentials were delivered to homes. The next step was the identification of sensitive areas and aggressive screening of those with travel history, contact with those who had travelled, and vulnerable groups such as health workers. Those with symptoms were tested; and they – and their close contacts – were isolated and quarantined in both public and private facilities. There was then a focus on offering treatment to the positive cases. This has now been followed up with careful monitoring. There is an underlying logic to this entire process. Ensure no movement, which prevents others from coming in and spreading the infection further, and possible positive cases from moving out and infecting others. Once the disease is contained to a specific cluster, check who may have infection. Keep such cases away from others, to prevent them from spreading it. Eventually, the lack of mobility – and the lack of contact with positive cases – will diminish the rate of infections. There are three clear lessons from this model. Go local — and as deep as possible within specific geographies. Ensure deployment of adequate human resources to screen and test and ramp up of health infrastructure to isolate. And limit movement for as long as possible. Scaling this up nationally, especially if there is a surge, is difficult. But administrators across the country should adopt this model to their specific circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/bhilwara-s-ruthless-containment-model/story-qXVNH8SePB0KDNntlStiMJ.html
